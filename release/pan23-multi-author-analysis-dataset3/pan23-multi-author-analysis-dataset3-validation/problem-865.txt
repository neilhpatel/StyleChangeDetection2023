Also they have demonstrated that they aren't hitting civilian targets. The fear about giving UKR long range weapons was that they'd just start pounding Moscow.
The US has been trying to limit the range of Ukrainian weapons, looks like Ukrainians have got longer-range stuff. The straight-line distance from the centre of Moscow to the Russian-Ukrainian border is about 450 km which makes it in range now.
Security footage shows a blast at Engels air base near Saratov, Russia, hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border.
The Engels airfield, on the Volga River in southern Russia, is a base for some of Russia’s long-range, nuclear-capable bombers, including the Tupolev-160 and Tupolev-95. Ukrainian officials say it is also a staging ground for Russia’s unrelenting campaign of missile attacks on infrastructure, which have left millions of Ukrainians with intermittent light, heat or water — or none at all — at the onset of winter. Security footage from an apartment complex near the base showed a fireball lighting up the sky.
The strikes signaled a new willingness by Kyiv to take the fight to bases in the heart of Russia, raising the stakes in the war, and demonstrated an improved ability to attack at a distance. Shortly after the attacks on the bases, Russia sent a barrage of missiles streaking toward Ukrainian cities.
The Kremlin said that the weapons launched by Ukraine were Soviet-era jet drones and were aimed at bases in Ryazan and Engels, about 300 miles from the Ukrainian border. It said that its forces had intercepted the drones, and that “the fall and explosion of the wreckage” had “slightly damaged” two planes, killing three servicemen and wounding four others.
