Compare that to Snowden who took extra precautions to ensure intel involving individuals who could be put at risk was not revealed.
In Snowden's case, a big factor was the exercise of editorial control to scrub the information provided of anything that could put people in danger. Assange didn't do that. Wikileaks release people's social security, medical, banking, and credit information. Even if the more serious charges were dropped, the guy is still guilty of a boatload of federal crimes that have nothing to do with making the US government look bad and everything to do with nonexistent editorial standards.
If you look at the documentation over the past six years, it looks like the US Government wants to charge Assange with things like computer hacking and conspiracy. What's unclear is if they really have any good proof connecting Assange to such actions.
Assange didn't do that, but even if he did, hacking is justified to expose war crimes and corrupt politicians. How worried are you about Americans hacking into Iranian government servers? Should they be arrested? Yeah thought so.
I was there. The roes WERE used to more effectively attack us. All enemy fighters had to do was break line of sight and drop or hide their guns and we couldn't touch them.
