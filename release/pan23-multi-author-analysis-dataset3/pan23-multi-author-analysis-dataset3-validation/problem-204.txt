The point is what's the motive. Nobody thinks Iran wouldn't kill innocents out of morals. But what do they gain from attacking Qatar? As for killing their own citizens well the motive there is pretty clear, to maintain power and control over their citizens lives.
But this thread is about Iran planning an attack on Qatar, not about Iran planning an attack on themselves. And even if Iran were to attack another country why would they attack Qatar who they actually have decent relationships with and risk sabotaging that?
I doubt that if there was an Iranian terrorist attack that the response would be any different given that just like Israel, Qatar isnâ€™t a full member of Nato.
Doesn't anyone question the intelligence from Israel intelligence you know know that they want to attack Iran remember Iran was months away from creating a nuclear bomb what 10 12 years ago just saying.
We are making many assumptions here, first that Iran would attack, second that it would atttack a stadium third that Israel isnt lying and fourth that it would be an act of war against ALL nations involved. I think this is just a wet dream of some fan fic writers in Israel.
