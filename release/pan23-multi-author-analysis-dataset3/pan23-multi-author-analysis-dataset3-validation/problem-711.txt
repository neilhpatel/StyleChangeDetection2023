She apologized for her wrongdoing and said that she wasn’t aware of Jewish stereotypes about money, which is unfathomable. It’s pretty clear that she realizes she was wrong.
You were saying she did nothing wrong. She apologized for something that she acknowledged she did wrong.
No one is saying it’s only wrong if someone apologizes. You’re intentionally missing the point and using erroneous logic. You can say that you disagree with her and the Jewish people that were offended by her, but again, telling minorities when they should and should not be offended is incredibly messed up.
You don’t have to see it. She admitted wrongdoing and is being kicked off the committee due to that wrongdoing. The 12 Jewish congress members who condemned her were offended by her remarks, and it’s really not up to any of us to say that they’re wrong.
So again, when I hear that 12 Jewish members of congress were so offended and condemned her statement, I just hear that they were posturing to stay on their good side.
You wanna know who has said the exact same things about Israel? Bernie sanders, who is Jewish. No one has called on him to apologize about his statements on Israel. Wanna know who else had the same statements about Israel? Ron Paul. Why did no Jewish members of congress call on Bernie sanders or Ron Paul to apologize? You wanna talk about bigotry? There’s clearly islamaphobia in regards to ilhan Omar.
Although, Omar, does indeed, hate our country and everything it stands for, that much is for certain.
