When contacting them do not under any circumstances accept that the debt is yours. Ask them to provide some sort of documentation proving that you owe them a debt and that they are within their rights to collect it. If you are unable to clear this up on the phone, you will also need to send them a . Disputing the debt over the phone doesn't count, you need to do it in writing. It needs to be certified so that you can prove that you disputed it. Also keep a copy of the notice you received, you will need to send this dispute within 30 days. Either they'll respond with definitive proof that you owe the debt, and you simply forgot about it, or they will be unable to contact you any further about it.
The only thing they could possibly do to you is maybe deny you services until you pay the debt and I’m not even sure they can do that legally. You can look into that elsewhere.
They cannot put it on your credit report and as you know they cannot take you to court as the statute of limitations was over 6 years ago.
I believe there are laws that say they cannot legally harass you however I’m not sure if that has changed recently.
