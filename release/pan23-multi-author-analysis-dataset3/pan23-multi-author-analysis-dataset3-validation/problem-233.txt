Can you please please please help the national Dems learn how to message? Lincoln Project has done a great job setting examples over the last two cycles, but they're still Republicans and someday soon they won't be helping Dems anymore.
I do think we see what a productive GOP can look like on policy --- albeit these were Democrat initiatives. But there was Bipartisan support for an infrastructure bill. There was bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act, and generally speaking, China is an issue where there is a productive working relationship between Dems and the GOP.
I don't think there is a quick fix. I think that transparency in legislation makes it harder for legislation to pass. I think that decreasing transparency would be a bad thing because it would result in more throw-away lines in legislation that receive less public scrutiny.
Do you think decreasing the transparency of the law-writing process could help decrease the leverage of big money groups over congress? So they can just take the money and then do nothing for the rich assholes trying to skew policy, write more bipartisan legislation, and then only have the final votes for or against a given bill be public. This is how congress worked before the explosion in lobbying in the 70's.
