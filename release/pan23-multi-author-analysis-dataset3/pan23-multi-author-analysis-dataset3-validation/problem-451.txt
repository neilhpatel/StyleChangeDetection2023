A lot of these titles are kind of arbitrary but is usually linked to the title of the ruler (Grand Duchies are ruled by a Grand Duke), not very helpful, I know. In addition, it's not like there's some universal hierarchy decided by the various princes of Europe (another interesting note: while prince usually means son of a king in English, it can also be used to describe a sovereign ruler, that's why Machiavelli titled his book The Prince, it's not about a son of a king, but a sovereign). These translation difficulties can make sorting out a confusing, non consistent system even harder. Usually, duchies are inside kingdoms, a sort of administrative division ruled by a duke who is sworn to the king. Independent dukes did exist, and particularly large duchies might be called grand duchies. Diversion aside, it all really comes down to that title. A king rules a kingdom, a duke a duchy, an earl an earldom, etc. Becoming a king might require getting on the Pope's good side, in the case of Catholics (read: most of medieval Europe except the Balkans and Russia) and Lithuania's denial of a king title can be traced back to the whole Christianity thing. Lithuania was a kingdom once, it had a Christian ruler by the name of Mindaugas who became King of Lithuania after converting (military aid from the Livonian Order swayed his decision, most likely) but the country reverted to paganism after his death. The next Christian ruler was Jogailia (aka Jagiellon, a name that pops up in Polish-Lithuanian history pretty frequently) married King Jadwiga of Poland (she was styled King because Queens couldn't ruler in Poland, but nothing said a woman couldn't be a King. See why this gets confusing?) and Lithuania fell under personal union with Poland, where the Kings of Poland would also be the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. Lithuania would be an independent Grand Duchy sometimes, and fall under the Polish crown at other times. It would eventually become part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth. Rules around titles were complex, and this complexity is made worse by the English language, where titles that would imply a greater sense of power than duke like the Russian Knyaz is sometimes translated as duke while implying control over a state. For an example of the strange rules surrounding titles, there was only one King in the Holy Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire controlled a massive chunk of central Europe (modern Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Northern Italy, Western France, parts of the Netherlands, Czechia) and most of the rulers inside were called dukes or princes, or in the case of the seven rulers who would elect the Holy Roman Emperor, prince electors (these were: Mainz, Trier, Cologne, Bohemia, Brandenburg, Saxony, and the Palatinate, at least in 1444). The only ruler who could call himself king in that massive region was the King of Bohemia. Therefore, if a prince had acquired lands outside of the empire, in the case of the elector of Brandenburg, who had acquired holdings in Prussia, they couldn't be styled King of Brandenburg, oh no. They were styled Kings in Prussia, to make it clear that they were not Kings in the Holy Roman Empire. Fussing over titles like this was why some countries were called Duchies, Kingdoms, or whatever the ruler could be called without offending the sensibilities of the Pope and/or their lord.
Marcher Lords: Marches are basically border lands, but the lords at these borders usually rose larger armies, for reasons that seem pretty obvious (being right next to a foreign power). Marcher Lord in particular may also refer to lords set up between Wales and England in particular.
Can the same be said about the distinctions between baron, count, earl, marcher lord, duke, (unsovereign) prince? Or are there some actual privileges/rights, duties, other types of consequences (like the amount of castles or square km they can hold)?
