Edit: and why the F does autocorrect assume that the word "grants" is used less than "Grant's"? WTF!
WHOOAAA THERE! Why don't you loosen up your chaps a bit there, Bronco? With an ass that tight, it's no wonder you're so sore. Now take a deep breath, deep down to where your belly meets your britches, and go back and see if you can follow the thread.
Anyhoozie If you want to get bogged down in the minutiae of verbiage for everyone but yourself, you can do that. But if this conversation so far is any indication, you're going to look sillier than a mule in petticoats at the Prize Pony Parade. YEEHAAW.
Secretaries have lots of powerâ€“ that's the point of their position, don't you know. The president can't make decisions about every little thing, now can they? Sure, their power may not be dictatorial, but if you think that's what the first poster was calling for, then you seem to be the one wilfully misunderstanding. Besides, of what value was your response? None, I'd wager. All you had to contribute was basically, "Well shoot, if you don't like it, whydontchyoo leave it?".
And so on. No disaster ever has a single cause, the "root cause" is virtually always a culmination of a series of failures, correcting any one of which would have prevented the disaster or significantly limited its impact.
Of course we can. Not everything is about violence against the person. People's property rights infringe on each other's every single day. Speech rights, religious rights, privacy rights, due process rights, all of these can be opposed to each other in various degrees at various times.
But those rights get balanced against the rights and interests of everyone else. One person's spying is another person's lawful intelligence-gathering activity. One person's unlawful seizure is another person's civil asset forfeiture or eminent domain. And so on.
