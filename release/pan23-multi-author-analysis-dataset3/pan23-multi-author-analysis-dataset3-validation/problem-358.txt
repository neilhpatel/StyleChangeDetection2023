This really isn't a legal question, in the sense that there's no specific thing you can say to change the situation. Landlord is entitled to their rent, and entitled to their remedies if you can't produce the rent.
Or you can continue to stay there until your landlord files for and is granted an eviction for non-payment of rent. Depending on your city/state that might give you a bit of extra time with a roof over your head, so it is a viable option. But it does come with more long-term consequences (an eviction on your record).
If you are on a month to month lease, you can simply move out. Inform your landlord of your economic situation, and they may or may not choose to take you to small claims for owed rent.
If you're committed to an end to the tenancy (and that may indeed be a reasonable path), you might offer that to landlord. A deal where you vacate, clean up, and surrender the apartment so landlord can relet probably benefits both of you.
It sounds very much like you should be looking for someone to help you navigate the processes of disability income, of governmental food and housing assistance. And obviously you should be working with your physician on a treatment plan that puts you back on your feet.
With respect to the landlord specifically, you're generally better off in approaching them than in going dark. You may have to tell them you can't pay your rent and see where that gets you. Sometimes landlord are surprisingly helpful. Sometimes they're not. But to have any shot at some kind of understanding from landlord you probably need to be working toward a plan that gets them paid.
I'd recommend that you tell the landlord what is going on and ask to discuss options. In particular, you should probably discuss (1) how much you expect to be able to pay and when, (2) what if anything you can offer the landlord as an alternate payment, for instance doing some menial work, and (3) whether the landlord would like you out early.
