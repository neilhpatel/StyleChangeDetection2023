All of the checks are made payable to my wife, but there was an aspect of the will that because the kids all inherited different land estates from the grandparents they tried to use the liquid money to "even" the amount that everyone received, but it just seemed weird to us to get a bunch of checks payable to my wife, and then have to send them to someone else to then get the money back. Surely the checks should have just been sent to the estate account to begin with for distribution?
Title: Wife received checks from her inheritance, but her family is saying we have to send the checks to them to put into an estate account?
If your wife was named 100% beneficiary of an account, the institution would send a check to her for the whole balance of the account. If she was named a partial beneficiary of an account, they would send her a check for the percentage she was entitled to and the rest to any other beneficiaries on the account. Otherwise, they would not send her anything. Your wife can call someone at the financial institution(s) and verify that she is a named beneficiary for the amount of the check(s) received. If so, the money is solely hers and should not be returned to the estate for redistribution.
By redepositing the money back into the estate the executor or executrix would then get a cut of that money.
Depending on how the deceased set up everything, they could have done that to keep some of the money from being spent on the executor/executrix.
