When you say "the US", do you think the US government handles some kind of mobile application like China does TikTok? US agencies might ask for data on users (e.g. in 'exigent circumstances' under the Patriot Act) or buy it from third party data brokers (and US needs legislation to better protect privacy rights), but it doesn't control those websites like the Chinese government does TikTok through its parent ByteDance. Regardless, that's not a valid argument, it's just a tu quoque fallacy; even if the US government's relationship with e.g. Twitter was equivalent to China's with TikTok (though it's not), that still wouldn't mean people should use TikTok (they shouldn't, it's dumb to use it).
It's so weird that people keep saying TikTok is a Chinese spy app but seemingly no one is doing anything about it. From government, to corporations, to users; everyone is acting like the Chinese government spying on other countries is a non-issue.
It's just distractions and manufacturing consent to get you to look at a foreign power instead of the ones actually threatening your privacy.

I know I’m a random person on the internet so I’ll instead quote someone who has verifiable credentials. Here is a , a telecommunications expert with a focus in privacy/ security and the chair of that committee, about why unauthorized users getting access to people’s MAC addresses is concerning:
Back in 2015 the IEEE 802 Privacy Executive Committee (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; the 802 is just a computer geek thing) and one of those concerns was unauthorized users getting access to people’s MAC addresses, which is exactly what TikTok did. You can easily match a device to its user by using a MAC address.
