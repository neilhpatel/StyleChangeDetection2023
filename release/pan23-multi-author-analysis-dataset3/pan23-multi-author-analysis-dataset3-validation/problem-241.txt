Toilets & hot water are a habitability issues, so he should have a claim for loss-of-use (read: a reimbursed hotel stay) under renter's insurance.
He does have renters insurance, so that is an option for the toilet and hot water issue. He is speaking with the landlord first thing in the morning. His main concern though is that strangers from another apartment can just enter his apartment through the wall at any time.
I worry that because the landlord gave him a key to an empty apartment, there's nothing he can do. I'm afraid they will just fix the hot water issue in the other apartment and say that's all they can/will do for him. I wish every landlord would be as accommodating as yours.
Also concerning your needs neighbors just walking in. I would keep track of everything and if something was stolen you know who it is. Also the landlord should be doing something to try to keep things secure. Maybe lock down the bathroom door? So they can get into that bathroom but no where else.
So I had a situation where the bottom floor on my house flooded and me and my roommate had to live in the upstairs livening room for two weeks. They cut our rent in half cause of it. Also because you donâ€™t have a toilet or shower and your apartment is no longer secure. I would potentially ask for a hotel room while this is occurring.
