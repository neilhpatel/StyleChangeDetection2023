Your mother would likely have a hard time convincing the police or a court that the laptop was not a gift. With that being said, she could still sue you for it. Realistically, a 3 year old laptop is unlikely to be worth a great deal.
Also, your mother is obviously not obligated to offer you financial support. You can leave, but obviously you shouldn't expect anything more from your mother if you do so.
You can leave, but don't expect to be fed or housed later. The police may or may not interfere here, since I doubt they'll buy her "theft" angle if you've been using it for years. Still, if you wish to avoid any problems, and since are capable of supporting yourself as a developer, then purchase a new laptop, migrate your data, and leave her the brick.
Assuming the laptop is not anything special, you can replace it with a reasonable software development machine for well under 1000EUR.
You live in her home, is that correct? If you are of age, then she has no obligation to house you, or feed you. Pursuant to local Belgian laws (about tenant rights and notices), she may ask you to leave the home permanently, and eventually evict you if you refuse.
Are you still in high school? Are you studying towards a degree? How old are you? In Belgium, parents have to, in some cases, support their children past the age of majority if they are studying, but that seems to only cover high school education.
