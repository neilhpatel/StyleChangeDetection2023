The other thing I wished he'd done was explicitly namecheck the great work being done by teachers and historians on the issue. This isn't a new problem. Two of my favorites are around teaching hard history and the . The professor he interviewed is from TT and they were advisors on the segment but actually giving them a shout out would have been great.
At the same time, it's been a great way to help readers - including high schoolers - wrestle with the tension that is American history. A common pedagogical tool is to "pair" texts or to create text sets; giving a reader different texts that reflect contrasting (or similar, depending on pedagogical goals) perspectives on a topic or experience. There are multiple pieces in The 1619 Project that provide a powerful contrast to other texts, especially foundational ones. Eve Ewing's poem about Phillis Wheatley is a fantastic poem on its own but also when paired with foundational texts written by men who lived in Boston at the same time and wrote about freedom from tyranny... it can break a young person's brain open. In effect, it allows a way to make the familiar unfamiliar. That is, students have usually read or come across the Bill of Rights several times by time they get to high school. Reading the Bill of Rights alongside on prison in America allows students to see how a document written by White men centuries before has a profound impact on our lives today. (Feb. 12, 1793, A redacted poem by Reginald Dwayne Betts is a good example of how a single text can become a Paired Texts through the use of purposeful redaction.).
Thank you for your answer. I guess John did make a few oversights on his segment but that's to be expected when he covers such a wide variety of topics. This is precisely why I wanted input from people like yourself, for which I'm grateful. I'll check out the links so thanks for those as well!
