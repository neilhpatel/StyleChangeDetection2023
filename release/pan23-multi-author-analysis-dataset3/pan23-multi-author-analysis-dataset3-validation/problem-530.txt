Because they installed a 3.0kw inverter on a 3.8kw contract. Tesla only sells small, medium and large sizes so anybody that got a 'small' system like me must've gotten the 3.8kw contract - so do you really think Tesla bought a single system like that for me? They probably installed these 3.0 systems on 3.8 contracts at a whole bunch of places. It's not hard to find out. Asking the manufacturer how many they supplied to Tesla will reveal how many Tesla installed at client sites.
Have you explicitly told Tesla that you have a contract for a 3.8kW system but the system that is installed is a 3.0kW system? And I assume you have two separate contracts, one for each home, each explicitly saying that each home gets a separate 3.8kW system?
Right, but there's probably a ton of legal-ese to those contracts that specify these things and what you're entitled to.
And what you're entitled to get in terms of equipment should be outlined somewhere in whatever contracts you entered into, which is why the specific language of those contracts is important.
That specific language is going to be incredibly relevant here, and thus far, the portions of the contract you've posted do not include any of that relevant legal-ese.
