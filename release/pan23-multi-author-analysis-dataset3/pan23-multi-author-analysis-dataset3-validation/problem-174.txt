I'm guessing this is the cause of the new sign. It is possible this is not even a new ordinance - that the county put up the sign to alert thru traffic of an existing ordinance. There is almost certainly an exception for local deliveries (as evidenced by the trucks you have already seen).
While I can't speak for TX specifically, it is common that posted "No Truck" routes have an exception for local deliveries that cannot be accessed any other way. That's why you're still seeing Fed-Ex and moving trucks on that road. Your best bet is to check county ordinances to see if there are specific rules for their posted routes.
You can likely get a copy of the ordinance from city hall or your county seat, depending on who passed it. The town may have minutes of the council meeting or a copy of the motion on their website, as well. If they don't have it, they'll likely know who does.
If the city is within its authority to govern, then there isn't much to dispute. He can speak to the city councillors who voted for it and see if he can sway them, but it's mostly a political process, not a legal one, and there's no way to guarantee that they repeal it. Depending on how the city is organized, he _might_ be able to get a variance or permit allowing his business' trucks as an exception, but I wouldn't count on it if the motivation for this was to keep heavy vehicles away from the new schools.
