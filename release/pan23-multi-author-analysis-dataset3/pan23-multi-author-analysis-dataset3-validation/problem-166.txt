Title: Should I sue the Drunk Driver that hit my parked car, their insurance isn't paying what its worth.
As for suing you would sue the driver not their insurance company. The person driving is responsible not the insurance company.
I think you are confusing what the bank is saying, there's a common denominator in the two examples from the bank in 8k. To me this would appear that based on other factors the most they are willing to lend you is 8k. Most of the time people have loans on their vehicles that regularly exceed the value of the vehicle. There are fees and financing involved which boost the purchase price above the value of the vehicle. And really they are a bank, they deal in money, not in vehicles.
so the reason I included the bank is because the Bank or any car lender would go through the NADA to find the value of a vehicle. nada and KBB are valuing it higher than what the insurance is. to get a car loan im sure most banks are going to go through the NADA to get values on a car. which is part of the process of getting another vehicle.
and at the moment there is no true comparable. they first said that they would find cars similar to mine within 30 mile radius but there isnt any in my state.
