My understanding is both their names are on the title of the home. I'll ask about the tax returns, as I'm not sure.
It's unfortunate that a partition order would be a net loss for my friend (since he's been paying like 2/3 of the mortgage), but honestly I think/hope he'd take that deal to get out of this situation.
I'll check into if they're considered common law married; it sounds like that would be the ideal case. If not, a partition lawsuit sounds like the term I was looking for. I'll start reading up on that and get that info to my friend.
- if they're filing joint tax returns or can otherwise make the assertion that they're common law married, then the divorce procedure is probably available.
Family law, actually, both because of the possibility this can be handled as a common-law marriage, and because family law folks often end up dealing with other kinds of joint property issues.
Divorce is what's used in acrimonious divorces. A divorce is a legal proceeding that's as much about having a binding ruling on the division of marital assets as it is a formalization of the end of the marriage.
