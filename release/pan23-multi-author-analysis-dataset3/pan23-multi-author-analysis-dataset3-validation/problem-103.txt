These actions are ones of men who have no heart. I hope the russian forces get stomped into the fucking ground.
When reading this article that was the first thing that popped into my mind. I remember at the start of this war, last year, russian forces just destroying a car that was operated by an elderly couple.
You’re using two incidents which involved ONE soldier and making it scale to the concerted effort by the Russians to kill civilians.
Two of your links is about one solider and you’re comparing that to the concerted effort by COUNTLESS RUSSIANS who are actively killing civilians whether it be with tanks, guns, drones, etc??
I love this logic. You mind finding me reports on US committing genocide or causing this many intentional civilian deaths? I’m all for it if you have the numbers and reports.
The first is a general statistic. The second is an incident from 2012. The third is an incident from 2010 (from Afghanistan, but points stands).
"I'm sorry we lied and invaded a sovereign country for 8 years and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and untold suffering but it wasn't intentional".
