That's basically saying that you should only find out if a president is a tax cheat AFTER it's too late to do anything about it.
I don't understand how you could think that presidents should have to release their tax records but candidates should not.
Only if you try to make it “disqualifying.” You could pass a law requiring the IRS to furnish the tax returns filed by the President to the public.
Require the IRS to publicly disclose the candidates and the Presidents returns. Someone would have to sue to stop it or if the President tries to interfere with the IRS. But courts have long allowed disclosures to be required for purposes of transparency and freedom of information. Congress can draft the law to make compelling the case how the publics benefit outweighs the candidates privacy.
2) There is a significant difference between furnishing tax returns to Congress, vs making them public.
The Supreme Court would say that Congress (a separate branch of govt) cannot unilaterally impose restrictions that the Constitution doesn't on a separation of powers basis, and that it would require a constitutional amendment.
That’s not really within the scope of an “executive order” because it doesn’t really have anything to do with something that is under the control of the executive branch.
The Presidency is a separate branch of government and can't be bound in the same way by the legislative branch.
