I'm unsure if you delivered the work product or not? If you posted it, then deleted it, this is over and you have no rights to sue. If you find out later that they were able to grab it during the time you had it posted and they end up using it, then you have a case to sue them and/or file a takedown notice wherever it is posted.
In the future don't do freelance or contract work without a clear expectation of what will be delivered and how you expect to be paid. It's fine to demand to be paid up front if your agreement stated this. Contracts are great but even an email that says let me recap what my understanding is, can you confirm that, will go along way toward client management.
When the other designer wanted it, you should have referred them to the contact who hired you. IMO you screwed up here by deleting the file. Unless you had a contract that stated otherwise, it's likely your product was a 'work for hire' which means you have zero rights to it once delivered (and you are paid). If the client wants to pass it along another artist to tweak that is fully within their rights to do that. Deleting it puts you in a really bad position. I'd probably contact the company and say you're willing to repost the work as long as they can assure you that you'll be paid. If they don't pay you, your recourse is then small claims court and a takedown notice.
You may wish to send an invoice/demand letter before you turn to a lawsuit. A letter sent by certified mail, insisting he pay you a specified amount, by a specified date, may convince him to pay up, and if not, you will have evidence that you attempted to resolve the matter on your own before turning to the court. (In some locations, this is a necessary step before filing a small claims suit.) Depending on the amount at stake, it may be worth hiring a lawyer to write and send this letter to lend it an added air of seriousness.
(Though again, this only works if they actually owe you money. If you didn't deliver the final product, and the contract gives the client the right to cancel the project at any point without penalty, then you are probably out of luck.).
