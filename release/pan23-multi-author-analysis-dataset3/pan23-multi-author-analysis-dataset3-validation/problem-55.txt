You need to work on creating a coherent narrative of events, with proper terminology. What was the exact nature of the notice given by your landlord? If you were in the middle of the lease, your landlord couldnâ€™t terminate your tenancy without going to court. Were you served with papers by the court? Did you have a hearing?
Here is my guess as to what happened. You were served a 30-day notice of non-renewal from the landlord. This is NOT an eviction, which is a court process. You were mad that you got notice to move, so you stopped paying rent and turned in keys. You still owe rent through this notice period though , and your landlord can sue you for it.
I stopped paying rent because she posted an eviction notice on my door and told me to get out. Even after explaining what happened she refused to take me off of 'evicted status' so i left before my 30 days was up.
The incident where they tried to break in was written on the original notice, which is why I think it's pretty relevant. Because now it's listed as 'non-payment of rent' rather then whatever they decided to list the incident as on that original notice.
It sounds like the "eviction notice" you are describing was not actually a court ordered eviction notice, but instead your landlord demanding that you leave the property. Assuming you moved out and returned the keys, that would be a mutual agreement to terminate your lease early and you should not be liable for any rent after the date you turned in your keys.
