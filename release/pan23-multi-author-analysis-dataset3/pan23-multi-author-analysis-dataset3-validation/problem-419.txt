I really appreciate the extensive response. I wish I kept my mouth shut - it was my first encounter with police and I'm a pretty vanilla guy as I mentioned I don't partake in drinking or smoking so was totally caught off guard. He was shining his flashlight through the back window where you can clearly see the bottles that my friends left (I had no idea) and he mentioned he could take me to jail if he wanted so I thought it would be best to cooperate.
He had a body cam(Axon) and walked into the restaurant where I was sitting with my group of friends. He asked who was driving the car and even mentioned outside "I'm sure your not intoxicated but your friends surely are - are they of age" I said I don't know because they were "close friends". He didn't seem to press hard instead said I was responsible regardless.
Lastly, a good point brought up is I'm not on: "roadway or shoulder of any public highway." I was in front of the restaurant but I'm unsure if it was public or private land since they had meters causing me to assume it's public land.

This may have an impact on insurance rates too (not sure there). The best grounds for challenging the ticket that I see stems from:
