Absolutely they should and if not they certainly will know of a local shap that can. Mercedes still make new parts for their cars that are older then 1975.
Especially with older cars, repairs may take a while. Even worse if it's hard to locate a replacement part. However, I have found a lot of mechanics that work on older cars will keep all of your old parts around. You might ask this mechanic to show you the parts he's pulled out and explain why. They should also let you take the old parts with you. The insurance may have a facility to go to, or you can ask them about the dealer. Mercedes dealers and service centers are usually different than the normal Chevy and Ford dealers. You might call one or two and at least ask. Another mechanic will be able to look at the old parts and new parts, make sure they actually needed replaced or if they're not even for your car.
One thing to note, you may have to pay this mechanic for the work already done and parts replaced with your approval. If it comes to small claims court to resolve, the information from the new mechanic will explain whether or not you can also sue to get that money back.
Even if your insurance isn't helpful or doesn't cover this, I would recommend still calling the police and taking your car elsewhere. Including a box with all the parts for your car and the old parts he's replaced. You may end up in small claims, but if you have a detailed breakdown if the damages and cost to rebuild or replace the engine, it should make the process a lot smoother. I second the other comments talking about asking any related car clubs in the city or even the state. It may take time to find them and get some help with a mechanic. Don't leave your car with the current mechanic and longer than necessary.
Second I’d Tow the car from the shop with all the components so he doesn’t keep scrapping pieces. Not sure how capable you are but if you can begin to reassemble the engine it would be worth figuring out what is missing, or if you even still have the same original engine (they stole my clients and replaced it).
First step would be to call the police and file a police report. I’d have the police meet you at the location so they can “get his side of the story” which is probably going to sound like fraud to a cop.
