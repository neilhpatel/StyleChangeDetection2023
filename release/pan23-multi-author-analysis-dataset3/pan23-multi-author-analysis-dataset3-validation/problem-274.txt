Gaetz basically set this up as a warning. If he doesn't get everything he wants, he's going to tie up the house with endless challenges to leadership.
One of them is changing house rules so only one member submit a vote of no confidence and trigger a new leadership election.
A lot of their demands were related to house rules, which are voted on as soon as the speaker is selected. Those are many of the concessions that McCarthy had to give in to in order to sway the holdouts. If those concessions AREN’T in the rules package, the holdouts could vote down the rules package along with the democrats. Same scenario, nothing gets done in the house until the rules package is passed.
The concessions will appear in the rules of the House which need to be voted on. I don’t think this vote has happened yet, so theoretically the members of the house could once again debate the rules and we could see the same fight happening. If the Freedom caucus doesn’t get their wishes, they will threaten to get rid of McCarthy. If they do get the concessions, the house may not approve them and we are at an impasse.
C-SPAN is, however, they are only allowed to take the feed supplied by the House that is controlled by Government employees.
