We need politicians in power that actually fucking care. The problem with the democrats we currently have in power is that they are not proactive. They wait until the shit hits the fan to even attempt to do anything of value. Abortion and marriage equality should've been codified years ago instead of lazily relying on "settled law" and SCOTUS never repealing Roe. And remember, SCOTUS was very vocal about their intentions. No one paying attention was blindsided. .
As it should be. Abortion rights aren't even purely a women's issue. Since Roe V Wade rooted the right to privacy between a doctor and a client it has far-reaching implications that affect everyone. From men, racial minority groups, and the LGBTQ community.
Taking away abortion access is just the first step, and we already see them working on their second step of taking away trans medical care access.
A "miscarriage" is also an "abortion" as far as the law is concerned (How the fuck do you tell the difference), so getting healthcare during a miscarriage event is perilous for women now.
Republicans: passes restrictive abortion bans after doctors testify that such bans force women to carry dead fetuses until sepsis sets in.
