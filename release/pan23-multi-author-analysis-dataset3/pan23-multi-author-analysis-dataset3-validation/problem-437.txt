Used to be dogwhistles to provide plausible deniability to gullible moderates. Now they just shout it with a megaphone. And the base isn't going back to the dogwhistles now that they've had Trump.
Oh, 'gullible' was intended to refer to moderate/low-information/'ndependent' voters, not elected republicans. I probably could have phrased it better.
I mean I’m not advocating for not voting. I’m saying the past couple elections seem like a clear repudiation of what the Republican Party has come to stand for.
What is amazing is suddenly what.Teump does is not acceptable and unsettling to the Republican party. WOW, woke up a bit late on that issue by several years.
Thankfully I think it's too late for that. If Trump did one good thing he brought all that nastiness out into the open and exposed the republican party for what it truly is.
The Republican party lets these bigots in because of their policy that any enemy of a liberal is a friend of theirs.
Yup; republicans have been cozying up to these kind of extremist beliefs for decades and dogwhistling to them. Trump did it pretty openly, but it's been going on for a long time.
