I thought I paid for the item, because at the time of transaction, I was given a receipt and I walked out normally, there was no problem. It wasn't until today where she called me about the problem, I looked at my statement, and saw that it was refunded.
I am not entitled, I did pay the $21.64 and I left the store without problems, I wasnt notified of a problem until today. I have the receipt, and there is proof that I paid the 21, but there is also a refund receipt attached to it, which I didnt realize this until right now. According the store, it was the employee who mistakenly pressed the wrong button. I am compliant in paying the original $21 for my items, but am I wrong for believing they should take the loss on the refunded amount?
Did you pay for the item or were you given an erroneous refund? If you didn't pay, you owe for the item and any refunded you were given that you were not entitled to.
If she "refunded" you without ever charging you, then you'd owe both that amount and the price of the item.
