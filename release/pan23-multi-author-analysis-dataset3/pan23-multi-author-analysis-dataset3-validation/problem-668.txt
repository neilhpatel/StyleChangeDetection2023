Well China and Taiwan are still technically in a civil war. Just that Taiwan has practically given up after reality hit them that they will likely never retake the mainland.
The only thing that will provoke a war is when Taiwan declares it is an independent country. I doubt that will ever happen. Taiwan-China trade is over $160 billion per year and growing. Taiwan is also one of the biggest investors in China. This is a big worry to the US and that is why Biden and Co. keep stirring up BS. China will eventually get Taiwan, but only when it makes make sense for Taiwan.
There is no practical way in which China can conquer Taiwan. This could only happen if nobody fights back. Taiwan is not Ukraine, and China is not out of reach of Taiwanese weapons. Casualties in China would exceed the population of Taiwan many fold.
Taiwan is an essential part of the entire world's economy, including China. China would be one of the largest victims of an invasion of Taiwan, which is why it makes little sense for them to invade.
Regardless of the condition of the foundries, it is the deep institutional knowledge that gives Taiwan its edge and that is very difficult to replicate, much less do so in a speedy fashion. If it were, the US and South Korea would not consistently trail Taiwan in the realm of semiconductor fabrication.
