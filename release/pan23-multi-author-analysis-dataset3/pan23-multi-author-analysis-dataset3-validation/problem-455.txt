Aside from the many threads about the state of Japanese anti-air defenses at the late stage of the war (very poor, stretched, unable to engage effectively with lone B-29s), I just want to address a misconception evident in your question: the Japanese did not know that atomic bombs were being used against them, at least until after Hiroshima. The US did not threaten or warn them. They were surprise attacks.
One could ask, could they have tried _after_ Hiroshima, after they knew this kind of attack was possible? This ends up getting back to the "they didn't have the resources to counter lone B-29s" — every day there would be dozens of B-29s flying over Japanese cities taking photographs, making weather observations, and so on. Which one is the one that has an atomic bomb? There is no way for them to have known that. In any event, they were certainly not expecting a second attack three days after the first one — they had barely processed what had happened at Hiroshima when the news of Nagasaki was received.
The testimony of people from Hiroshima indicated that they did not find lone B-29s exceedingly suspicious; they understood that bombing raids came mainly from massed planes.
After Hiroshima, there is some indication that the Japanese people in some cities were more suspicious of lone B-29s.
Follow up question: Is there evidence that the Japanese citizens would “freak out” or react negatively to seeing the B-29 flying overhead? Would they try to identify it’s purpose (weather, napalm, atomic bomb)?
