IF this is the play by the Republicans to save McCarthy, get some Dem help. SURELY they could have used a better middle man. Or even approached a more conservative Dem.
2 - Let the democrats pick a republican house member of their choosing and vote this person in as speaker.
1 - Vote for the democratic candidate (yes, this is possible, the speaker only needs to receive a majority of the votes in the house, it doesn't matter which party those votes came from).
Either a handful of Republicans need to cross lines and vote for Jeffries or someone needs to lead the Republicans into a consensus on a new Speaker, possibly from outside the current House caucus. I’m somewhat surprised Trumps name hasn’t been floated yet but I think they all realize they need someone that actually knows the job and is a talented politician.
True it doesn’t need to be a current House member but what’s the upside for the Dems to nominate any Republican. It’s the Republicans that should be nominating someone else but they’d never go for Cheney because she spoke out against Dear Leader.
