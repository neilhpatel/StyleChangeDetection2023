I believe he is annoyed that we didn't counteroffer after he ignored "highest and best" instruction.
Or is he just annoyed that you didn't counteroffer because he didn't make his best offer and was willing to go higher?
And based on what the buyer says, then you tell the neighbor, "Since you didn't make your best offer at the tine, and I'm under contract now, and breaking the contract will cost me money, now if you want to buy the house, it's gonna cost you X. Do you want to pay X for the house or not? If so, I'll break the contract and pay off the buyer. If not, get lost.".
Either way, it's your prerogative to go with a written offer, or a lower offer, or a higher offer, the guy has no legal recourse. The only question, if you interested in pursuing it, is whether your realtor did in fact deceive you about his offer.
Even if your Realtor didn't tell you everything, that is between you and him and has nothing to do with this guy. Ignore him. People make choices about who buys their house for reasons other than money all the time.
