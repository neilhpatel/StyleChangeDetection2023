It seems that effects of Russia’s missile stocks are slowly degrading. The Tantrums are smaller and less frequent. Ukraine’s air defence is improving so less gets through.
This is why Ukraine will win. Europe can easily increase its production of modern weaponry because its economy is huge.
Hopefully under his guidance Germany can show some leadership in encouraging and coordinating EU military aid to Ukraine.
Feels like something has changed, US, UK, Germany France all sounding even more solid in their support of Ukraine and that they will need to win militarily and get the weapons and ammo to do this.
Isn't the threat of us letting them join DURING the war the last tiny little carrot and stick we have to convince Russia to back off and return to the original lines pre 2014?
The idea that the West doesn't have enough F-16s or that it's some kind of super advanced weapons systems that must not fall into Russia's hands are both bad excuses. We have plenty and Russia/China have already scrutinized the Venezuelan and Pakistani F-16s.
