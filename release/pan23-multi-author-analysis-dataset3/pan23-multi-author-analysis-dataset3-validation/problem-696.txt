(1) when originally asking you to resign your lease, did the landlord say it was for a month to month or year long lease? (How were your renewals previously done).
(2) after signing the year long renewal did you ever agree or sign anything else? Does the year long lease allow the landlord to terminate the lease with a 60 day notice?
It doesn’t say anything in the lease about allowing them to terminate with a 60day notice, only stuff about if we wanted out of the lease. And we haven’t broken any lease terms nor have we been late on payment .
(2) NOPE, I knew better than to sign anything else after that notice, but even before the notice, there were no more agreements sent/signed since the Year lease signed 03/2021.
So there was no prior discussion on your lease lenh and all other renewals had been for a year? If that's the case it sounds like the new landlord is regretting their decision. If you don't want to move out you certainly have the paperwork and history to support you. You could also negotiate a mutual break.
