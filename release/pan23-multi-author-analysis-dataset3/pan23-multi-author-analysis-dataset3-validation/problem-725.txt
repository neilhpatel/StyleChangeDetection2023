Countries all over the world has bought more weapons from them. America alone has earned back 10x times whatever they’ve given to Ukraine from these weapon sales. They’ve made security a tangible issue, and that’s what they do best.
The lesser seen political and diplomatic influence is far more valuable. America has united the EU, and earned a staunch ally where before Ukraine has seen the US as an unstable thorn on the side (remember when trump asked the Ukraine president to dig up some corruption stories).
So because of one group and a history of corruption (which is also true for every eastern european country), you would say that the US should rather let Russia just invade and annex Ukraine? Is that also true for other Eastern European countries then? Like, if Russia attacks Moldova, just let 'em?
Well i mean they make money on selling weapons. If this also results in Ukrainians getting weapons and defeating the invaders, then this is good, right?
"If this also results in Ukrainians getting weapons and defeating the invaders, then this is good, right".
Maybe I’m being cynical, but I assume the military industrial complex would lobby very hard to keep the weapons flowing to Ukraine. Any weapons sent to Ukraine are replenished with brand new weapons for the US. US defense companies are the beneficiaries of those replenishment orders.
