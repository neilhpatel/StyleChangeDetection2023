While your landlord has explained why they set the price how they set it, their explanation is a red herring. "Because" would be a complete and valid justification for charging you for early termination. If you don't like the rate, you can negotiate, but you can't use "your reason doesn't hold up" to avoid it entirely. Your alternative, should you be unable to compromise and unwilling to pay that rate, is to complete your lease and terminate at the end of the term.
One month for terminating a lease early and 1/2 month for assigning to a new lessor are about the most tenant-friendly lease terms I've come across in some 25 years of working with leases. There is nothing in that clause that is unconscionable, unlawful, unenforceable, etc.
1. No, not all contracts are enforceable; contracts which attempt to bind you into doing something illegal (e.g., murdering someone), or which are considered "unconscionable" (charging fees that are extremely inappropriate) are generally invalid (though how a court may go about invalidating the contract depends on a lot of factors -- they may throw out the whole contract, or reinterpret the contract so the offending portions are avoided, or force the parties to renegotiate, etc.).
2. Because even when you bring the tenant, landlord has work in the form of preparing the lease, receiving the keys from you, ensuring the property is suitable for a new tenant, and giving that new tenant keys.
For this case we have this agreement and because we have to do the work again of making a new add, finding a new roommate for the others, organizing viewings and making a new rental.
