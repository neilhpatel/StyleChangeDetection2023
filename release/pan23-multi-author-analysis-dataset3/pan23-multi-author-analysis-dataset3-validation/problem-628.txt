A pretty significant number of military analysts don't think China could win that war even if the US did nothing at all. Taiwan is a tough nut to crack. And amphibious invasions are a crapshoot.
True, an amphibious invasion would kill so many Chinese. It would be like D-Day, but not a suprise and against an enemy with modern weapons systems that can target Chinese ships during their slow journey across the Taiwanese Strait. Oh, and there are only a few beaches suited for an amphibious invasion, so wherever they land will be heavily defended.
That wouldn't suprise me at all. The Western world has the ability to obliterate China's economy with sanctions if they so desire. It would also hurt the West, but only temporarily, while China would just be fucked.
If there's one thing both sides of the aisle agree on is that China is bad. Hell, Trump even went out of his way to make it clear that Covid was Chinese by origin. Republicans hate China, to the point where its borderline racist, what makes you think they would give China any leverage on the world stage?
Asian countries like Vietnam, Philippines, Japan, South Korea as well as Australia have been keeping an eye on China and their bullshit for a long time now.
