If you own the house, your friend cannot keep you out. Even if this was a formal landlord/tenant situation, you have the right to enter the property you own. To help protect yourself, just do it at reasonable hours.
Can you change the locks?, yes. But you'll need to provide her with a key. You cannot remove her property before the eviction date, doing so would potentially be a crime.
Yes, going through the legal eviction process is the way to get the police to get her out. You might be better severed by “cash for keys”, which is you offer her x sum of money in cash for leaving. After she gives you the keys and moves out of the building you change the locks and give her the cash.
Once the police get you in, get a copy of her new key from her or call a locksmith to get a new lock. But you will need to give her a copy of the key.
It's very important that you mention that you moved in. Do not mention that you emergency extended the lease on the other apartment.
Call the police again and say that you own the house, have moved in, and the woman you let stay in one of the rooms that you are now evicting has locked you out.
