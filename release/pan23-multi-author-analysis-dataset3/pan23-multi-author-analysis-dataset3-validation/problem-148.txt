Already uncovered. The same LLC that Michael Cohen used to funnel the payoff to Stormy Daniels also took in $500,000 from a firm linked to Russian Oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. It took in $4.4 million just before Trump was elected.
"Financial records reviewed by The New York Times show that Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s personal lawyer and lonime fixer, used the shell company, Essential Consultants L.L.C., for an array of business activities that went far beyond what was publicly known. Transactions adding up to at least $4.4 million flowed through Essential Consultants starting shortly before Mr. Trump was elected president and continuing to this January, the records show.
And Cohen went to prison and seems contrite about his misgivings now. Meanwhile, Trumps ass is waddling around scot free while being in the middle of this crap.
Funny how articles like that always seem to come out when we’re about to find out some fresh new hell from the Trump admin.
I guess we know now why he has to promote the whole “Twitter was asked to take down Hunter Bidens dick pic therefore we should suspend the constitution” story so hard.
