Can you please clarify how that post (eloquent and informative though it is) addresses the question? What it seems the OP is getting at is the level of awareness, or lack thereof, the framers has toward specific guns that are (allegedly) somewhat related to the automatic weapons of today.
Sort of, but not in the sense of the question, as those were all rare, expensive weapons that wouldn't have been considered expected for standard military use. Future developments absolutely matter, which relates to what /u/_Booster_Gold_ asked and I totally spaced on getting around to, and places a large part in later developments in 2A jurisprudence. I skipped straight over United States v. Miller in the linked answer as it wasn't necessary for the focus there, but it is important here as it is one of the very few SCOTUS cases to ever handle the 2A. It provides good illustration, and also provides a very odd result.
(And I'll try to get to your restated question later today as it does raise one issue for follow up).
The question isn't whether they knew such guns existed, but whether they 'kept them in mind'. The answer is a clear and uncontroversial 'No', as to think they matter and had influence on the nature of the drafted Amendment is to misunderstand the fundemantal nature of the Second Amendment, as it takes as assumed the individual rights interpretation as constant and unchanged.

In a nutshell, Miller got in trouble for having a short-barrelled shotgun, which was regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934, the case ended up with the Supreme Court, and the results are interesting for two reasons. The first is that the holding of the case was that the 2nd Amendment protects firearms "reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia", and the second is that "[t]he Court cannot take judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches long has today [the previous]". Basically the court was saying that the 2nd Amendment was written in relation to the militia, so it protected weapons appropriate for use in a militia.
