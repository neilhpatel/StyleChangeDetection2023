Legally speaking, this is your error, not your landlord's. They weren't obligated to cash the cheque promptly: you were obligated to ensure the cheque could be covered so long as it's outstanding and not yet stale. Personal cheques generally aren't stale until at least six months after the date on the cheque, and depending on your agreement with your bank, may never be stale.
If they're willing to let this drop if you pay the bounced cheque fee and provide a good cheque, that's a good outcome. You can ask if they'll forgive the bounced cheque fee, and if you've got a good relationship with them they might agree, but your error did create costs for them, and if it comes down to a small claims dispute, they'd almost certainly win.
Deducting from your deposit to cover outstanding fees is not entirely abnormal. Not paying your fees could have worse and more consequences than that, though: it may be a breach of your lease, meaning that you'd be at risk of an eviction.
Your best bet is to ask for them to waive the fine and if they say no you pay it and find a better landlord when your lease is up.
None of your legal options are really worth the trouble. It would cost you more to file a small claims suit than it would to simply pay the fine.
