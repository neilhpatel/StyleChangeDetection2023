Yes. Though one could agrue that it might be useful for other Palestinian cases against Israel in the ICC.
have you read what al jazeera said about the Israeli investigation? They may not agree with the conclusions, but seem to acknowledge Israel did investigate.
So Israel did look into it, and they did accept a certain amount of responsibility. Not sure how this doesn't contradict your claim Israel never investigated, and denied everything. (your accusation of Israel lying may still be accurate, I have no way to determine that. and unless you are privy to all the information from the Israeli side, you probably cannot prove it either. Still I cannot disprove that claim - Although the US does back up the Israeli version).
Israel is not the first country to have potentially killed a journalist via sniper, but somehow, I don't recall too many people speaking up about any other sniper killed journalist.
One of the most respected journalists in the Levant was literally killed by sniper fire, and that is a known fact. The bullet was traced and everything. There is no "accidental" placement of marksmen, and definitely not any "accidental" shooting of someone visibly representing the press.
