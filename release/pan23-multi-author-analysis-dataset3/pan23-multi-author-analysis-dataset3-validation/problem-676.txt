These monuments started early. Already in Herodotos' day there was a stone lion on the hill where Leonidas fell, and several epigrams to honour the men who fought and died there. Herodotos would have lived long enough to see the tomb of Leonidas that the Spartans built back in Sparta, after they solemnly conveyed his bones home for reburial. Every year they organised a festival and held games in his honour; he was the only Spartan to receive heroic cult. Why all this effort to commemorate defeat?
Monuments to the bravery of the dead were a crucial part of this propaganda campaign. Simonides' epigrams were set up on the site of the battle so that everyone who passed through would read them. The stone lion for Leonidas made a similar point. Later on, , the remains of Leonidas were "found" and transported back to Sparta for further monumentalisation and celebration. By that time there was no longer much dissent against the official Spartan story of Thermopylai.
In fact, I sense a certain similarity in /u/Iphikrates ' argument for the celebration of the battle of Thermopylai by the Spartans. The Philippines in the 1950's needed to galvanize behind heroes, and with the recent liberation of Manila and the Philippine islands as a whole a costly liberation, too costly and still too recent in fact to be even considered for celebration, they chose a far less recent conflict (Philippine-American War) instead to celebrate and galvanize the country behind, along with other bungles of Aguinaldo and of course the pre-colonial victory of Lapu-Lapu.
Here in my home country of the Philippines, technically any war memorial before WWII are all war memorials for the losing side, since before that war our armed forces under a united Philippine identity hadn't won any war, only singular actions.
