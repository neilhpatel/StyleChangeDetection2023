Here's an idea: don't bail them out. Intervening in the marketplace ruins the concept of capitalism. Especially if the intervention is to keep a business afloat (airline industry) or to protect them from foreign competition (baby formula). Protect the organization of labor, yes, and protect worker rights, safety, etc., but leave it at that.
Back on the original subject, we shouldn't bail out any business. If a certain industry proves to not be profitable enough for the private sector to manage and it is deemed essential, then and only then should we attempt to nationalize it.
Nationalize this shit, take the profits and hand them over to the workers (and to expanding/improving infrastructure). Hell, with some investment, passenger rail might actually NOT suck in this country (though probably not, given the way things tend to work out).
I'm not really sure if that would be applicable in the railroad situation, since they aren't really competing in the same way, and they aren't struggling to make money.
