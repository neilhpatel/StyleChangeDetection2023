Give n McCarthy thinks that the American people should actually see all that happened instead of a report that's written on a political bias, my assumption is that all 14,000 hours would have to be shown unedited to provide the whole story.
Given that Fox News isn't likely to broadcast this footage for over 583 days with no commercial breaks, I expect it to be opinion programming that is written on a political bias.
To me, this definitely seems to be a Hail Mary by Fox News now that the Dominion case is demonstrating just how little they believed the lies they were telling in Pursuit of overturning the election for the benefit of Donald Trump and their shock jock reality TV opinion programming that the most credulous actually take to be news.
I definitely didn't say that they were news media. That said, fox is one of the most profitable and highest watched Networks for opinion programming on cable, thus making them at least close to mainstream depending on what your definition of mainstream is.
Reminder, for anyone who isn't paying attention: Fox News IS part of the main stream media. They openly tout themselves as the largest (and they are by far) cable news channel.
So I'm sure everyone who is really concerned about the MSM's influence and collusion with government is going to be really concerned about this one.
