Yes, served for 22 years as an military police officer. I'm telling you that because in ADDITION TO the normal panel of vaccines that Soldiers get, we got additional boosters because we were more likely to come into contact with blood borne illnesses. Every single year I got no less than three jabs for flu, hepatitis, and whatever else needed boosted.
Absolutely NOT. The logistics of the reassignments and skillsets, especially in low density military occupational specialties (MOS) would wreak havoc on readiness. You'd have a bunch of whiny, weasly fucks continuously bailing on the mission for vaccines, which they already try to do for a litany of other reasons already.
I think I see what your saying, why is this mandate a big deal when they already had to get like 30 vaccines for other things at bootcamp before the covid vaccine was mandated?
It is mind bogglingly stupid to worry about the covid vaccine more than every other vaccine they take. The covid one is more tested than at least some of those vaccines in only 1.5 years due to how broadly it has been used.
The covid vaccine has more testing across the world than pretty much every other vaccines they must take. It is mind boggling that republicans are going for this as everyone in the military knows how stupid singling out this one vaccine is.
REMINDER: The US military have been getting Vaccines since the Revolutionary War. Its about readiness and ensuring our troops are safe and prepared to deal with possible illness while on deployment.
Bottom line, preventative care for military members is CRITICAL to our national security and the safety of our troops.
