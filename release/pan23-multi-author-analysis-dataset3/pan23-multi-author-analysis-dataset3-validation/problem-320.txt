Tell her you aren't comfortable doing that. Who is listed on your lease? That's who you should be paying.
It's your landlord's responsibility to pay her own mortgage, regardless if it's too inconvenient for her.
Furthermore, assuming your lease says you will pay your landlord a certain amount each month, you will technically be in breach by not paying your landlord. If your landlord ever decided to pull a fast one, they can successfully initiate litigation because they can accurately show a court that they did not receive payments from you (because they didn'tâ€”an entity not a party to the lease agreement did instead). Sure, you'd have a valid defense and it could end up shaking out in your favor, but why even put yourself in a position to have to defend actions that you never actually agreed to in the lease? Litigation is taxing, financially and emotionally.
Your only legal obligation is to pay your landlord (or whatever entity is specified in the lease agreement, such as a property management company). A bank which may or may not be entitled to a payment from your landlord (how can you even be sure?) is not your landlord.
Mortgage interest is deductible if you're a landlord. The portion paid towards the principal isn't.
If the landlord is closer to the end of their mortgage, the majority of the payment could be principal and therefor not deductible.
