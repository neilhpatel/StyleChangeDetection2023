Yea, but what do we do about that power vacuum that'll open up after Putin? Do we really think the Russian state would replace Putin with someone who has Russia's best interests at heart?
Neither will make peace less likely as Putin doesn't give af about such things, especially evident by his actions over the last year.
Does she honestly think Putin is going to all of a sudden stop his war crimes and answer this call as if he was an honest man?
Please step back to reality and realize that just because you are a Nobel peace laureate does not mean Putin is going to just all of a sudden stop his war crimes.
Putin is responsible for widespread death and destruction, and you're concerned that calling for a tribunal will make peace less likely? Really? What exactly has been happening in Ukraine the last year?
History needs to remember how abhorrent Putin has been. Tribunal / Hague are seemingly rhetorical but important nonetheless.
A multi-pronged approach is needed to defeat fascism. Calling for a tribunal is a good thing. Wrecking the Russian army on the battlefield is a good thing.
