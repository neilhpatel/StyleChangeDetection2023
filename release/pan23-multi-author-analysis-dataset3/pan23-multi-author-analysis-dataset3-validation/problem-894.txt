What they showed us is that our current set of loosely held standards held up somewhat but is still in dire need of repair and regulations.
We are still staring at some wild new world ahead should our leaders continue to ignore the changes we need to prevent even worse to come.
What our leaders ignore is very difficult to fix at the grand level. At this time power is only in the hands of the party willing and capable of obstructing the agenda of the active administration. There has not been a workable democrat majority since Obama and that was for roughly 21 days at most due to illnesses and death. Otherwise you can expect the Republicans to do very little that will cede their power. And the one branch that receives nearly no oversight is entirely under their control. Republicans need to lose big and quickly because they are cementing their power for the long haul. And if it comes around to 2024 with a full red and Desantis at the helm, it will really be game over around here. Florida headlines still get worse by the day.
But that's not even the long game, if the democrats can't do anything then the apathy can win the long game anyway. Hitting back needs to be done while there is energy and shits to give in higher supply.
