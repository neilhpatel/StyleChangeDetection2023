That's why Erdogan loves Turkish people in Germany. Here they vote for whatever provides social security, at home it is erdogan.
You get 2 votes to influence geopolitics and can use it for conflict. On a national view point that all makes sense but we don't live in national bubble, we live in a global bubble and our understanding of democracy should retled that. So, yeah... I think people with multiple nationalities should be given the chance to choose, but they shouldn't be given extra votes.
So you're in favor that a citizen living away from the country of their citizenship shouldn't be allowed to vote in that country's national election?
If they're under a work visa for a couple of years they only should be able to vote in their home country since that's where they will be returning to, they shouldn't be able to vote in the country they work temporarily in.
Whilst being an immigrant for 2 decades I chose to never vote in any election in my own homeland even though I had that right because in my view people who don't live there and don't have to suffer the consequences of their choice shouldn't be making choices for those who DO live there.
I think somebody who is a decade or two out of from their country is out of touch with what's really going on there in the day to day and following politics (at best the art of persuasion, not of truthfullness) isn't going to give you that - you'll just be hearing more and more arguments about things for which you have no context.
From what I've seen both with myself (having now returned to my homeland) and other fellow immigrants, as an immigrant one always ends up loosing touch with the actual society of one's country and following politcs there isn't at all enough (IMHO) when one doesn't really have the pulse of how things are going there in general.
