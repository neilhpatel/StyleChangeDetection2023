Thing is, it's difficult to consider Celts as a really well-defined ensemble historically : while in the ancient sense, it mostly was about Gauls or part of Gauls; it took a wider meaning since the XVIIIth century to name peoples related by language then retroactively applied to peoples sharing similar material cultural features from the British Isles to Anatolia.
In a sense, your last question is unanswerable : the difference we set between "Celts" as an ensemble of related people and other peoples is mostly an historiographical term that would have been confusing for ancient authors for whom a "Celt" was first someone from Gaul, although neighbor peoples would have been diversely related to.
Rather than "Celts" ruling over most of Europe, however, most archeological or historical specialist favor the idea of various indigenous cultures more or less related by language (where it can be attested, which for Central or Eastern Europe is difficult) and material cultures associated with historical Celts (especially Halstattian or LaTenian archeological horizons during the Iron Age).
Depending on the historical and geographical context of these ancient peoples, of course, the situations were different : the idea is that a great deal of the make-up of Gallic, Germanic, Balkanic peoples associated with ancient Celts was made on an indigenous and mutual (if asymmetrical) acculturation.
For example, tough the distinction between Gaulish and Germanic people might came from pre-Roman geopolitical conceptions, the distinction between Gallic and Germanic was mostly about geographical and political realities; the Roman conquest later essentializing the differences between both (especially as Germanic-speaking groups came to dominate southern Germania as well in the Ist century BCE) as being wholly different.
Caesar's De Bello Gallico is a great template for this distinction, and reveals that from the Roman perspective, the dichotomy between Germans and Gauls is pretty much ideological/geopolitical and doesn't really reflect on the ground reality. For instance, Caesar explicitly states the the Rhine is the division between Gauls and Germans, but then flip flops several times throughout the text, mentioning that the Celtic speaking Boii lived far east of the Rhine in what's now Bohemia, that Germanic people had migrated west of the Rhine and conceived the Belgae etc. Even Caesar's first major nemesis, the supposedly Germanic leader of the Suebi; Ariovistus, has an entirely Gaulish name, meaning either something like "far-seer" or "noble/free seer), meaning that the Suebi were either some confederacy of Celtic and Germanic speaking peoples (there is precedent in the Cimbri and Teutones' earlier invasion of Italy, where many "Germanic" chiefs bear clearly Celtic names) or that Germanic nobles took on Gaulish names based on their perceived prestige.
