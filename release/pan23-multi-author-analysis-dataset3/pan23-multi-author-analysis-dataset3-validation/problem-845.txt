It's not the job or responsibility of the media to tell you how to think. You have the responsibility to think for yourself and be critical. Don't blame the media for your own shortcomings.
Nope, it's not, and that's why people here are saying it's odd the media is focusing on it. Asbestos is bad to work with because it's basically just lots of tiny glass shards, it gets stucks in your lungs and never leaves.
The danger of asbestos is mostly, that the broke off dust particles harm the human lungs, just like moondust(regolith), and inbedding itself in the tissue.
When asbestos is inhaled, it causes chronic and long term inflammation and scar tissue formulation within the delicate lung parenchyma.
Asbestos exposure to other body parts does minor effects. However most non-lung cancers are a result of metastatic spread, rather than from the asbestos on its own.
Asbestosis occurs as a result of scar tissue formation due to inflammation. However it is not metastatic and is a type of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
