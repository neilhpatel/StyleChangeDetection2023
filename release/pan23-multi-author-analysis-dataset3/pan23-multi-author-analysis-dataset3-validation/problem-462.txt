Unfortunately, we do sometimes have to deal with distressing images. It’s a difficult but necessary aspect of the job, particularly when investigating civilian deaths. Sky provides us with resilience training which is designed to help us deal with difficult content and we are fortunate to have managers that recognise when we need space from whatever it is we’re working on. It’s also really important to have systems in place to make sure that you control the circumstances in which you are consuming distressing content. We always warn each other when sharing distressing stuff, for example, and I personally try not to work from home when working on particularly difficult stories. These things might seem small, but they do help – Victoria.
The OSINT community on places like Reddit and Twitter have been growing, especially since the Ukraine invasion. Get involved in spaces like these and try to learn how they worked out where a video was filmed for instance. If you want to join Sky News, we have a work experience scheme that just opened!
Sky News UK is at least a news outlet. Sky News Australia might be worse than Fox News from a ”waste of time to watch” point of view, mostly because they are paroting the same sht but at least Fox News is actually in the same country physically (not mentally) as the one they talk about. No idea why the Sky News Australia folks are just paroting the Fox News agenda about the US.
Who are the individual owners of Sky News and what is their agenda? If you could state that publicly that would be great and would lend a lot of credibility to your reporting.
