As long as it's the woman who gets pregnant, relying on someone else to make sure she doesn't is a gamble.
Exactly. And I wasn't meaning to ignore the male worry part of the equation. It's just that as a woman, the first thing I thought of was an unintended pregnancy in a country where abortion is now practically illegal.
There are a couple of problems: no birth control method is 100% effective, and there's no way of knowing whether the man taking the pill has actually done so, unless the woman watches him do it, or whether the pill is the right one.
As you said, no method is 100% effective, so when you employ more than one method (safe sex/condoms in addition to birth control, which can now happen on both sides) then that is the best you can do all around.
The EU is more akin to the US Federal Government, and each state is more akin to a European country in that they are somewhat similar in size and have their own government but still has to abide by the guidelines of the higher authority (US Federal govt for the states, EU for Europe).
see, that's exactly the problem that this solves for guys. There's no way for a guy to know a woman took hers either. Now the guy gets his own control before the bedroom as well. Most guys have had to deal with this exact problem for their entire lives - "What if the condom breaks? I really hope she isn't lying about being on birth control", etc.
