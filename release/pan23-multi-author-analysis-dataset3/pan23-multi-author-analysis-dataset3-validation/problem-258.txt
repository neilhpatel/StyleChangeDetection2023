this is a situation where the libs actually need to be owned though and letting congresspeople to continue to use “democracy” as a casino to “own the republicans” is much worse, actually.
Besides, democrats are not as petty as the republicans and actually have some ideological scruples— so a bill introduced by republicans is much more likely to pass anyway.
The republicans can actually be trusted to support a bill sponsored by a republican, and the democrats will look at the bill on its merits. Several of them may be willing eschew party lines and vote with the republicans, so really it made sense to table it until this session. Let the republicans waste their legislative time bickering over the details of it— they ought to do some of the work for once.
Democrats tried to do this a few weeks ago and all the Republicans voted against it. This is for show, obviously due to the name of the bill. He didn't have the balls to do this when she was Speaker. There's a poison pill in it so the Democrats will vote against it and this shit stain will claim they don't want to do anything about it.
McCarthy can either say no to make sure GOP donors don’t care, or bring it to a vote and make Democrats vote against a popular policy because it’s named poorly and/or it contains a poison pill.
