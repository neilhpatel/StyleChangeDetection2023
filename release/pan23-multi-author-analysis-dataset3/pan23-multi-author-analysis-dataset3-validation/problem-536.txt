Ahhhhhh, THAT is why Putin says they only lost like 6000 men or so. "I don't understand it. The reports say they have killed hundreds of thousands with barely any losses, destroyed hundreds of HIMARS, but we are still somehow not advancing!".
P.S. Ideally, a neutral party, if not the Red Cross, would provide aid and logistics for medical and then completely remove them from the fighting, hopefully until it is over. The best thing is to keep them out of it on either side until things are done. Can't trust that they won't go back or leak info; if they were captured, I don't want to think about it.
I don't condone it, but in trench warfare, showing you are not going to waste resources on the wounded may hurt troop morale, but it messes with the normal strategic math.
Ignoring the MONSTROUSNESS of this which I shouldn’t be doing because it’s fucking _monstrous_, it feels like it’s also just bad military policy. Anybody care to explain how this wouldn’t degrade your force beyond the attrition from just sending these dudes home? Now you’re trying to fight when a sizable chunk the army is literally disabled.
Wait, we can get more use out of our meatshield soldiers if we force the enemy to recuperate them as POWs after they're gravely injured.
