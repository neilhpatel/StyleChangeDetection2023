As long as he's paid appropriately it's legal. Texas only requires a 24 hour rest period for retail. You didn't mention it, but if it applies, then there might be a religious exemption if he needs time/day off for worship.
However, while looking it up, there might be a religious exemption from working. - "Another exception pertains to employers with 15 or more employees: due to religious discrimination laws, in the case of employees who do not want to work at a particular time for reasons related to observance of their religion, failure to allow reasonable time off for religious observances may potentially be considered an act of religious discrimination, unless the company can show that it would be an undue hardship to accommodate an employee's need for time off for the religious observance.".
From what I've read, the employers don't have to give advanced notice for schedule changes, and they have basically complete control over employees work time.
Texas law explicitly says, "Work schedules are up to an employer to set and enforce, i.e., scheduling of employees is entirely within the employer's control, and it is up to the employees to comply with the schedule that is given to them.".
Texas would follow the federal rule. /u/Lucimon44, does your husband spend more than 50% of his time on his "primary duty" (management) if he is salaried exempt? (29 CFR 541.700(b)).
Hourly or salary will matter for the pay part, if hourly he needs to be paid for all hours worked and it sounds like a lot of overtime. Close to 100 hours a week so at $10/hr he'd be making $1,300 a week.
