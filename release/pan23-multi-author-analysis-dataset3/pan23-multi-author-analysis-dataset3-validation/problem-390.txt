Is he even allowed to be around kids? I suggest reaching out to one of the counselors or case workers about your concerns. You could also reach out to a child abuse hotline to ask questions. But people you work with are mandatory reporters and have training to know what to do next.
You should ask your supervisors what their plans are as you should be mandatory reporters, yes? That means even with HIPAA you have a duty to report the danger to authorities. However I don't know if this counts as immediate danger? But you shouldn't be able to get in trouble for erring on the side of caution with your report. I'm not sure if you need to inform the police or CPS or both, but there should be some mechanism for you with mandatory reporting.
Given the above plus mandatory reporter laws, at minimum you need to report to CPS. In your specific role, I would probably not take the step of speaking directly to the other client, but I would elevate your concern to those higher up in the decision chain.
HIPAA expressly defers to the professional judgment of health professionals in making determinations about the nature and severity of the threat to health or safety posed by a patient. OCR would not second guess a health professional’s good faith belief that a patient poses a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of the patient or others and that the situation requires the disclosure of patient information to prevent or lessen the threat. Health care providers may disclose the necessary protected health information to anyone who is in a position to prevent or lessen the threatened harm, including family, friends, caregivers, and law enforcement, without a patient’s permission.
PHI may be disclosed as necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health and safety of a person or the public based on the health care provider's professional judgment under 45 CFR 164.512(j). The disclosure may be to anyone in a position to prevent or lessen the serious and imminent threat, including family, friends, caregivers, and law enforcement.
From what I remember, you can't disclose that kind of information...unless you believe that the client or those around him are in potential danger (like if they're suicidal and you inform family to be alert, or if they express the intent to harm someone else so you tell the person or authorities). At least that's our protocol for therapy. Our duty to the patient/client's confidentiality ends where someone else's safety begins.
If you truly believe that those kids are in danger with someone like that in their environment, then you can report it. Preferably, if you're still unsure, you approach your superior with this issue, because they're likely to have more experience with this. And if, god forbid, the worst happens, be sure you have documentation that you did your duty to protect innocent parties by informing the appropriate persons.
