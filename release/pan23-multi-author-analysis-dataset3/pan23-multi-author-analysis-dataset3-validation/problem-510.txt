My main concern is that the pastor was clearly acting as a counselor in a professional capacity and venue. The conversation pertained to spiritual guidance which is within the scope of his training as a professional counselor. I expected that the issues would remain private, as I would if I had spoken with a therapist. My understanding is that, within reason, the expectations of confidentiality are similar.
Also, the damages werenâ€™t realized until quite some time since the original disclosure, as for the first year I was still expecting my family to reach out at some point. Could that impact the statute of limitations?
As others have mentioned you're facing a statute of limitations issue. Having said that, it doesn't mean there's not some sort of complaint you can file against the pastor. It won't lead to a suit but it might be something you can pursue.
But if there's not, you have to rely upon general causes of action like invasion of privacy or defamation. Here's it's not defamation because nothing he did was untruthful. Arguably there may not be a cause of action here for invasion of privacy because (1) it was discovered by an outside person prior to that disclosure and (2) you gave that person permission to speak to someone else. Now there may be an argument to be made that you had an expectation of privacy because they were a pastor. I don't know how strong of an argument that can be made.
Typically clergy privilege is the protection of the clergymen from being compelled to disclose what happens during confidential discussions of a spiritual nature with people. All states have some variety of this law. It doesn't mean they all have laws that state if a clergymen exposes something that is divulged in those discussions that there's a specific cause of action for that from which you can recover damages. I'm unfamiliar with Pennsylvania law to know the particulars in that regard.
Clergy is harder to map. Because that guy you call "brother", "father" or "pastor" in a backwoods church that runs it may not be affiliated with any specific denomination. He may have absolutely no credentials. Then you have strict faiths like Catholics that have a very rigid structure where you obviously archbishop who governs the archdiocese has to have certain perquisites and credentials to get where he is. The archbishop is likely bound to a lot more professional conduct rules than "brother". He may even have gone to ancillary schooling to become a licensed therapist, psychologist, which opens up the possibility of specific suits for malpractice.
