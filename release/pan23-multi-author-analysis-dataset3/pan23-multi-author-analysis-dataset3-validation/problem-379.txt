Hello. Using the maximum extent of currently available knowledge and fluency of ancient languages, when and where is the farthest back in time one could understand a language?
If we require both the ability to speak the language and the ability to understand it, we lose another thousand years. Old Aramaic \ has a piece on the work being done to document Aramaic speech before the language dies out completely.
We can read the oldest known written language: Sumerian Cuneiform. Sumerian Cuneiform dates back to around 3,000 BCE and was spoken in Sumer.

I believe that Hurrian is the oldest language we have a good idea how to pronounce \[1\]. Of course, there's always going to be things that surprise our time traveler due to the aforementioned lack of tape recorders, but we have a pretty solid graph of Hurrian phonology. Hurrian was spoken in modern day Kurdistan as far back as 2000 BCE. Unfortunately, we don't have nearly as good a grasp of the Hurrian language as we do Sumerian due to the fragmentary artifacts that survive. While you might know most Sumerian words, you will assuredly quickly find Hurrian words you do not understand.
