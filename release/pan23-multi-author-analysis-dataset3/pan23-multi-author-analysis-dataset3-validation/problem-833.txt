Adolf Hitler is dead. He died on April 30, 1945 by his own hand, as his Thousand Year Reich crumbled above his bunker. Witnessed by a number of people, knowledge of the Führer’s death spread fast in the rubble of Berlin. Hardly a day later when an Oberstleutnant Seifert was sent to the former Gestapo headquarters in Berlin to negotiate with the Red Army, he was greeted by Red Army soldiers shouting “Gitler kaput!”. The following morning a message from Wehrmacht General Hans Krebs to General Vasily Chuikov containing the news of Hitler’s suicide was met by the Soviet commander with the words “We know.”.
I don't think this means they knew Hitler was dead, as I understand, Russian soldiers shouted "Gitler kaput" at any German since the beginning of the war, it's broken German for "Down with Hitler".
My point is it can not be taken to invoke anything, "Hitler kaput" was a common Russian saying during the war and remains such even today, its meaning both then and now is basically "Down with the Nazis". If you can read German, here's more on the origin of the phrase, it has nothing to do with Hitler's death:
Adolf Hitler is dead. While this fact remains certain, people - from SMERSH to the NKVD, from Petrova and Watson to Charlier and Brisard - have poured an extraordinary amount of effort into establishing it over and over again while telling, at the same time, the sometimes strange story of Hitler’s last days and his mortal remains. This story, the effort invested in telling it, and the detractors it has gathered ranging from the History Channel and its supposed revelations about both Hitler’s alleged flight and the skull kept in Moscow to the more unsavory elements of a vast array of conspiracy theorists, mirror in a way the story of the dictator’s life. The historian Ian Kershaw described Hitler in his standard biography of the man as an “unperson”, someone, who “has as good as no personal life of history outside that of the political events in which he is involved.” – a circumstance Kershaw describes as deliberately cultivated by the man himself. From the often fabricated details he described of his own life in Mein Kampf to his method of privatizing the political in order to play his role as the “Führer” to perfection, Adolf Hitler was the first person who invested an inordinate amount of effort into writing his history and imbuing it with questionable details about his own life in order to exploit his readers’ fascination with his person. What worked in life hasn’t abated in death and where Hitler sought to sell his political brand, those who came after him have sought to glimpse some understanding of the genocidal dictator in his life or make a profit from selling alleged insight to a public sometimes seemingly obsessed with the dictator – often even both.
So, if in 1945 even a Red Army private knew of Hitler’s death, let alone us, in 2018, with a far more complete picture, it seems baffling that conspiracy theories about Hitler’s survival and escape still enjoy so much popularity and selling power that they are still running TV programs about “Hunting Hitler”. The background for these tales comes from the story of Hitler’s bodily remains – a tale of numerous investigations, Soviet inter-agency rivalry, a shoebox containing a still mysterious skull fragment - all culminating as of today in two recent examinations with different findings.
Dr. Bellantoni’s discovery is presented, on the show, as a journey, interspersed with pseudohistorical narration primarily from Dr. Hans Baumann, a mechanical engineer and Hitler survival conspiracist. The History Channel’s narrative culminates in the big reveal that , as Dr. Strausbaugh’s tests allegedly prove, Hitler might have survived. But sadly, as cut for the show, almost any usable information is gone, and the viewer is left with a distressingly incomplete picture. The dental remains, long acknowledged as the best verified evidence, garner only one passing mention at the start, and by the end, it must be assumed that the viewer has forgotten this as the now disproven skull is called the "only known" piece of Hitler's remains. Reached for comment, Dr. Stephen Remy, briefly utilized for a vague doubtful-seeming soundbite in the production, is much blunter than the small, deceptively cut fragments included by producers might suggest, stating “I would have a rather low opinion of the intelligence of anyone who considered a misidentified skull fragment to be ‘evidence’ that Hitler ‘escaped’ the bunker.”.
As already noted, doubts about the skull had existed from the start, from figures who nevertheless accepted the story of Hitler’s suicide, but History Channel did little to engage with that historical narrative. In no uncertain terms, “Hitler’s Escape” was less a piece of historical research than it was a disingenuous and sensationalist fiction. While real academics were involved in the scientific testing of the skull, and interviewed for some of the historical background, the end product was in no way representative of their actual views, let alone that of the broader historical community. All of this bears reevaluation in a fairer light.
