I'm confused about the property management company. Are they hired to manage this property? Or he just hired them to do a walk-through?
When I moved out of my last rental, the landlord charged us for a whole slew of stuff (not to this extent), but when we complained to the property managers they took the majority of things off, because they were normal wear and tear items that they couldn't legally charge us for.
My point being, usually the property managers have a much better understanding of the law than the landlord. So I am kind of skeptical that this "property management company" is even legit. It sounds like the landlord is trying to strong-arm you into paying for all this stuff and hoping that you don't have an understanding of the law.
There's good advice mixed in among the bad here, but it's maybe not clear enough that what the landlord is doing is super illegal and he doesn't have a leg to stand on. Highlights are the water heater, HVAC, and other areas that the landlord is 100% responsible for.
You could post the email for feedback. It should demand the security deposit back within 21 days except for lawful itemized deductions. The list you posted needs a $$ entry for each item for it to be the slightest bit valid. A judge would bend the landlord over.
