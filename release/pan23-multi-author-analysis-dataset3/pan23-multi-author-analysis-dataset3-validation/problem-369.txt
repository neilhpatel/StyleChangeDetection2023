You're owed the fair market value of what was stolen and KBB won't reflect those type of modifications. If you can prove the modifications raised the value you could argue that with the insurance company.
Okay, so the modifications are in fact something the insurance has to consider in replacement value. Modifications are part of the vehicle generally, rather than personal property, which isn't always covered in theft. USUALLY, which I write in big letters because it's important to know it's a bit fact specific as to what exact mods and the coverage, but it isn't a matter of the vehicle without modifications as what she's owed. It's the cost to replace what was lost.
Definitely and absolutely speak with the adjustor regarding the modifications, and you may wish to start doing some legwork on finding estimates of having the modifications done. If she has trouble with the garage, going through her own insurance will be the fastest and least stressful approach, most of the time.
If your mom's insurance has comprehensive coverage against loss by theft, it may be much more expedient to use them and let them pursue the garage if warranted.
Maryland has a law that does allow garage owners to limit their liability from damage or loss while they have care and control of a customer's vehicle -- but they have to specifically disclaim it prior to assuming control of it. They can't just say it's their policy after a loss; the customer has to be informed prior to leaving the vehicle.
And they shouldn't be responsible for their deductable which they would be if they use their own insurance. What a stupid law that state has, that dealership should have insurance coverage for this sort of thing. Another way the big guy finds a way to make the little guys pay. This makes absolutely no sense.
