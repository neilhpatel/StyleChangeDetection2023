If the roommate is your friend's landlord, then they need to follow landlord law for Ohio and give her proper 30-day notice to vacate.
The roommate owes your friend proper notice, and any attempts to force the friend out ahead of the 30 days would constitute an illegal eviction on the roommate's part.
Since the roommate is the only one on the lease with the owner of the property, it would make the roommate the landlord of your friend, yes.
We just found out today that the room mates previous room mate was never taken off the lease, and that’s why the leasing office never put my friend onto the lease. The office called her today and said that she is illegally subletting, and that she has to be out by the weekend or they will seize all her belongings and change the locks. Are they able to do this??
They’re claiming now that they never knew about her being there. We know that’s a lie because they even addressed her in a letter once, but she no longer has it to prove anything. Do you know if it changes anything if they “didn’t know” about her, or does the same thing apply?
