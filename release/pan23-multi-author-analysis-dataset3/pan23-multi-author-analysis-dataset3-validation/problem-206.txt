I remember watching a documentary many years ago on the re-emergence of vehicle manufacture in Russia, optimistically framing it as part of Russia integrating into Western liberal democracy and capitalism etc. It was full of optimism for the changing picture in Russia and the potential for a powerful new member at the table of civilised nations.
It seems something deeper must change in the Russian political mindset in order for it to integrate into the global system and really start improving life for its people.
Yeah, regime change from the top is the only possibility really, unless millions of Russians start starving or facing serious issues, which is unlikely.
Mishustin is a a characterless technocrat who would probably be quite suitable from the perspective of the siloviki as someone who continues to put a stamp on things while they rule from behind and look for a replacement.
Yeah, kinda surreal for me to see too. I mean, I still go to a restaurant sometimes with my wife, and meet my friends occasionally at the bar, but I've given up all the social nightlife cause it just feels weird to sing karaoke while people are getting blown up next door. Even when I meet my friend at the bar, basically the only thing we discuss is the war and exchanging new updates. We both follow different sources so it's a good chance to compare notes.
