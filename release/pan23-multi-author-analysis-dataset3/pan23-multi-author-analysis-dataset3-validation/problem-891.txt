The myth refers instead to what scholars call the "12th century renaissance" (for the obvious reason). Stretching a little longer than the actual 12C, scholars generally agree that this was an era of significant change in western Europe--religious, intellectual, social, what I will call "ongoingly economic" (although all of these are ongoing), and various levels of political. This period, especially its intellectual developments, is generally where Iberian Muslims are seen to play a major role in the changes within western Europe.
I think /u/Steelcan909 had dealt with much of this, so I will continue with the myth's biggest problem: ignoring other really impressive things medieval European Muslims did.
The idea that medieval European Muslims were valuable because they drove western Christianity's 12th century renaissance is fake history.
And it's not just fake history because European Christians were actually really good at what they did.
"The Renaissance is fake news" -most medievalists, privately to themselves, c. Literally all the time AD.
