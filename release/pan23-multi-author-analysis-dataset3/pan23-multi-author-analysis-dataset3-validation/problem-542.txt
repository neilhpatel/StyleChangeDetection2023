IMO COVID is far more concerning with regard to pandemic potential. Ebola would burn itself out. Also being a more graphic disease, people would be more fearful of Ebola and actually take measures to avoid it.
However, there are two much bigger factors with Ebola that make it easier to deal with if it does somehow become airborne. The first is that infected individuals can't transmit Ebola until they themselves are already showing symptoms. So unlike Covid-19, people can't go around spreading it while being none the wiser. The second factor?
This is true, although it should be noted that the vaccines we do have work for the Zaire strain of the virus. This happens to be the most common strain as well. There also happens to be three separate vaccine candidates undergoing human clinical trials before the end of the year for the Sudan strain of Ebola that is currently impacting Uganda.
This story is lacking information, but Iâ€™m guessing the strain in this case is the one going around Uganda right now - the Sudan ebola virus - which has a 39% fatality rate in this current outbreak.
PS: Just to be clear, I don't think that anybody (except the medical staff dealing with the few infected patients) located in this country was at risk of Ebola, but believe it is important not to underestimate how dangerous this disease is.
