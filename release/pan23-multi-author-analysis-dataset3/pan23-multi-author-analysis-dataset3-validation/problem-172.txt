IANAL. But I do work for a small hospital in the billing department, so I wanted to offer some info I think could be helpful.
I’m in California, so I can only speak to what we do here, but I have a hard time imagining it wouldn’t be similar elsewhere. I hope this helps, if even a little. Good luck!
The hospital that is billing you should, at the very least, be able to explain what services were rendered and why insurance didn’t cover it. If they didn’t bill insurance, they should be able to explain why not - and they should be able to do so. If they say they’re outside of timely filing limitations, they should be able to provide you with a claim form that you can submit to your insurance in the form of a grievance. If they did file an insurance claim, contact your insurance to dispute it. The hospital should be able to prove - maybe not to you, but to the insurance company if requested - that they confirmed the identity of the person they were treating (photo ID, signature on forms) because fraud does occur - people do fraudulently use other people’s insurance to obtain services.
Also, i would recommend stating to the hospital and insurance company that you have started the process of opening a Department of Insurance claim for Insurance Fraud and I'm willing to be people will be more accomidating.
If the hospital is in-network for your insurance then your insurance may be willing to step in and help you resolve this, since if it's a legitimate medical bill they'll be on the hook. Try calling your insurance customer service/support.
Call your insurance company, file a grievance against the hospital organization. Explain these details.
They will handle it from there. Filing a grievance is far easier than going through the claims department, and I would add how unhelpful that “lovely” woman was to you about this issue because they will look into that as well.
