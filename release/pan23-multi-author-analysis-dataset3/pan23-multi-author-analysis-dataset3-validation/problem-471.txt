The Atlantis story is a marvelously mutable myth, susceptible to being plucked out of context and pasted into any convenient theory about the unknown and unknowable.
2. That the description of this island given by Plato is not, as has been long supposed, fable, but veritable history.
But your claim that Platos contemporaries thought Atlantis having no basis in reality goes counter to that.
Classicists agree that Atlantis is a parable - a cautionary tale devised by Plato as an illustration of how not to govern. It was understood as such by his first generation of students, including Aristotle, who once observed that Atlantis was destroyed by the author who invented it (Strabo 13.598). The idea that Atlantis was real emerged a generation later, when Crantor - the first commentator on the works of Plato - claimed that Atlantis had been an actual place. There are only stray mentions of Atlantis, mostly casual, in later classical literature. But by the fifth century CE - when the ascendancy of Neoplatonism made Plato's late dialogues a topic of frequent discussion and debate - there were apparently several schools of thought about Atlantis among Platonist philosophers, with some believing that it had been real. All this, however, was purely academic. There is no ancient evidence for widespread popular belief in Atlantis.
So, as of just over five years ago, part of the Atlantis story has supporting archeological and geological evidence.
