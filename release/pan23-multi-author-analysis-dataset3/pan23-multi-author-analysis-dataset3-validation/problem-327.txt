They only have a limited amount of single rooms. They cannot make more. And your signed stating that you understood this. If you know you need accommodations you really need to check before you sign a contract regarding the process.
If the deadline for requesting accommodations was stated in the contract you signed (which it sounds like it was), then it is fully on you for not being aware of that date. Especially if you knew you would need some form of housing accommodation. This may be a rough lesson in learning that in the adult world, deadlines are often absolute and to pass them means to forfeit options.
Accommodations are governed by reasonability. It's not that they are denying you these accommodations outright, it's just that they have no ability to grant you what you are asking for due to a lack of available rooms that fit your needs. And the reason for that is a fault on your side. So in this case, they cannot reasonably accommodate you and cannot guarantee they will be able to do so for this year.
That's a really good call. Hope for the best but plan for the worst is often a great strategy for managing limbo situations like this one. I hope it works out for you!
Sounds like they are doing their best to help you. Youâ€™re only entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA. With their limited housing units and the number of students needing housing it may be unreasonable to expect them to meet your needs this close to the start of the school year. Especially with you being a late commit to the University. Secure housing outside the university that meets your requests or talk to your doctor about therapeutic remedies that may allow you to share a room.
