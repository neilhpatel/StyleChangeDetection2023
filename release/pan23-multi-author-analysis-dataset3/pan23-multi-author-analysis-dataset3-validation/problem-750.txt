The way a historian views history is a based on the bias and toolkit he uses. We all lean toward different methodologies when researching history. I for instance tend to focus on more recent cultural and social history especially what is considered "bottom up" meaning the history of how the every man shaped history on a trend upward to the top, further reaching those conclusions based on how social norms, structures and the culture In history shaped it. First the way you look at history of " the hero" is almost Jungian in nature. You look at history in terms of the "great man" theory or top down. Your method for looking at history is a time tested one specifically in Whig historian circles of the 19th century, and although not wrong it isn't used as much today with biographies being the exception1. Carr and Cannadine disagree as far as the utility of history with the former believing history was only useful in so far as it could mold or shape the future, the latter saw no issue with the history student or professor researching the "arbitrary". The issue with both is the historian decides within himself what history is important and what is not especially in the time he lives in. Bias can determine how we view history in good and bad ways. For instance it would seem that you may view history from the perspective of " the west winning", democracy to pave the way, etc perhaps because you live in a fairly industrialized western society? This informs your historiographical lens. That communicates your want to piece together the idea that history is a narrative of a singular character personified toward procession to a better more enlightened and benevolent society is Hegelian in nature. In Lectures of the philosophy of world history Hegel sets out to outline a teleological or historicist model of history, that is history with a goal or purpose2. A pervading theory for a time although there are plenty who disagree with it especially in light of two world wars, environmental global destruction, economic disparity, and race and class struggle. The strange thing about researching history is that although we may look at it as static and linear, when we research history with all our bias, personal nuances, and agendas history changes. There was an author whos name eludes me, that I read in my Undergraduate study that said history is an exotic island that we may visit but never live. In the end who you are and what you aim to study will shape the history you view. Being honest about your bias, and reflecting with your peers can help you adjust your focal point and create a framing point for what in history is meaningful or at least is meaningful to us now. For historiography questions I suggest reading Carr " What is history?" And David Cannadines "what is history now?". In conjunction they can help give a very broad idea about how historiography has developed and changed in the last 80 years or so. In all reality though keep at it! I read a lot of sci/fi fantasy as a teen such as dragonlance and Forgotten realm books and it fostered my love and eventual interest in history. In a way I am shaped much like you are. Hopefully any of this helps you.
Thank you for your answer. I get the sense that I'm going to have to interrogate Whig history as it feels like this is where some of my assumptions are building from.
Whig History is something that I'm never quite sure about. Like I'll think of some history particularly post-1945 Britain as a collection of social movements driving change but then I'll think of other parts of History in personalised and great man style terms. Especially thinking of the Thatcher period here in British politics, my thinking always coalesces more around her.
My historical thinking I feel is quite muddled. For example I'll think of the post-war British welfare state of being created by a collection of social movements and trade union influence but then I'll think of the end of that period specifically the neoliberal period as being highly personalised and associated with one figure namely Margaret Thatcher.
