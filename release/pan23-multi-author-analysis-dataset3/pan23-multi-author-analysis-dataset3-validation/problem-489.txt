Yeah, this is true... But there has also been a lot of pushback for that. Armed people showing up at drag shows etc. LGBTQ rights are still new. Don't ask don't tell ended in 2012. The Texas governor said if the supreme court repealed Texas vs Lawrence he would be willing and able to enforce sodomy laws again.
I'm focused on texas' governor because he's a pretty big political figure and he's not the only one. Yeah things were getting much much better for LGBTQ people between the 2000-2018ish but ever since people figured out they could mask their homophobia as "antiwokeness" that progress is being threatened.
LGBT folk were feeling like things were improving, they aren't the only minority group that will be impacted by the rise of christian fascists.
Of course things were worse in the past, but things were getting better even if some of you didn't realize it.
So yes, things are better than a decade ago. But just one meeting of old regressive people In power can revert all that progress. With or without the people's approval.
Yes better now. But that can backslide quickly. I mean just look at Roe v Wade. Something people were so certain was just inherently safe gone in a moment. Decades of progress rolled back.
Yea a lot of people get discouraged but thereâ€™s been a ton of progress made in the last ten years. A big part of it is people are more comfortable coming out so now everyone has a gay friend son niece nephew brother aunt uncle etc. Even conservatives poll slightly in favor of gay marriage now.
