On top of that, 80% of the Korean K2 Black Panther tanks will be built in Poland, and a ton of technical knowledge will be transferred to the Poles.
It’s the reason Poland has started buying South Korean tanks and howitzers. Production is more reliable than in Germany (and the ruling party doesn’t like Germany).
What’s more, Ukraine wouldn’t exist anymore would it not have been for US power, intelligence and supply.
This isn’t to say that I don’t think we should help Ukraine, but headlines like this really piss me off as an American.
I feel for Ukrainians, they didn’t want this and it’s being forced upon them. I really don’t have that much of a problem helping them. However, the fact that all these other European countries are hesitant to send the amount of aid that we have really infuriates me.
I'm just frustrated that they seem to treat NATO as a charity rather than an obligation that they agreed to.
I, as many others - citizens and fellow EU governments - are massively frustrated by this, but such is life.
