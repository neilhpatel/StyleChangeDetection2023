I have an additional recommendation for people wanting to think more about public memory and commemoration (especially with Black History). Jeanne Theoharis’ A More Beautiful and Terrible History is great for lay people and historians. Couldn’t recommend it enough. It follows in the tradition of Michel-Rolph Trouillot and should probably enter the canon for Civil Rights history and public history.
I also find that confusing. I don’t know why it’s not “day of independence” or an “emancipation day”.
Why are we calling it a national Independence Day? Don’t we already have a national Independence Day, this day didn’t see any nations becoming independent. Wouldn’t any of the other myriad of names the day has been called be more appropriate?
I do honestly want a reason why America the national choose that portion on the name. The only reason I can see is to be anti American. That makes sense from a slaves perspective (Independence Day means nothing to me), but not a countries perspective (I’m anti myself).
One of the reasons Black Americans elected to call it Independence Day was simply because they and their ancestors were still enslaved on July 4, 1776. Nothing changed for them on that day. This is basically the theme of Frederick Douglass's speech, "?".
