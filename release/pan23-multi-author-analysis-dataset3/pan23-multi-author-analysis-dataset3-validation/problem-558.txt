It might be worth checking some examples of the previous answers by me and others in these previous question threads:
One entry of Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, suggests it was indeed the cases in some cases, especially in early Viking Age:
Second, while we should be cautious about reading the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle too literally, its first report of viking violence at Portland in 787 hinges around the assumption that Scandinavians were already known as traders before the Viking Age. This fits the evidence of Portmahomack above, and it also fits what we know of Viking Age ship technology. In the later Viking Age it would be easy to tell the longship of a raiding party from a cargo-carrying knorr, but early Viking-Age ships like the Gokstad ship or Oseberg ship were both long enough to have a large crew and wide enough to carry a bit of cargo. That makes the story of the ill-fated reeve of Portland plausible. And it further suggests that there were ongoing interactions in the 700s where Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons needed to find ways to be mutually intelligible.
Has no one ever tried the experimental archaeology-type approach of getting people that know Old English and Old Norse and seeing whether they can communicate speaking only in those respective languages?
And finally, as someone who researches in both Old English and Old Norse, I suspect an 18-year-old taken from Scandinavia and dropped in an Anglo-Saxon monastery would have understood very little indeedâ€”at least at first. I studied Old Norse first and found the transition to Old English fairly easy, but I already had a broad background in medieval and modern languages. Certainly there were many people in the early Middle Ages who were even more comfortable with languages than I am. Frisian traders, for example, are known to have operated in both the North Sea and the Baltic, and the Norwegian chieftain Ohthere who visited King Alfred around 890 could probably communicate in Old Norse, Old English, and (I'd wager) Old Irish, if not Frisian as well.
