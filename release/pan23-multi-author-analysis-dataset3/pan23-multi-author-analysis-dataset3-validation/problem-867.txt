Hello there! Thank you once again for the splendid reply to yet another question on the British Empire, British Raj and governance in the Empire.
This bit onwards is adapted from an earlier response I made on the autonomy of British colonial governors, see if interested.
Well, quite a fair bit of autonomy was placed in the hands of the governors when it came to expanding empire. Two cases in point: India following the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, and the so-called "triumph" of indirect rule, which often became the formula for British governance over the Crown colonies.
Whilst three general "formulae" of imperial government did emerge in the early twentieth century (the Dominions, the Indian Empire, and the Crown colonies), they were still vastly different to each other in structure, laws, and government.
To conclude this side-investigation, whilst the autonomy of the Viceory in India and the Governor-Generals in Africa (and the rest of Empire) was ultimately tempered by the word of Whitehall and the Colonial Office, they had the free reigns to oversee the implementation of the imperial system in their respective territories. Although different in both cases, similar elements included the cooperation of local elites (to varying degrees) and the reinforcement of British overlordship with the threat (or use) of force. Though the British officials may have intended to act as whispers behind the thrones, they were not averse to threatening to destroy the throne entirely should its occupant refuse to comply with the will of the governors.
