I don’t accept the idea that there’s no way the U.S. military couldn’t intercept it and bring it down without it risking hitting people below. It’s a slow moving weather balloon. If we can pit people on the moon I’m sure there’s a way to engineer this problem.
It’s as I said — this isn’t shooting a rocket or plane out of the sky, it’s a slow moving object. If America had set the priority to destroy this thing as quickly as possible I don’t have doubts it would already be done.
It’s very likely not. Most likely this was just taunting America and the fact they let it hang around for a few days projects weakness that we know a nation like China would not reciprocate if the same thing happened on their soil.
If it's only purpose was to taunt the US, then not shooting it down but still acknowledging its existence is America saying "oh, that's cute China, be sure to try harder next time".
You'd think with all the republicans believing the China released covid on purpose, that they would be wary of an overly obvious balloon that's begging to be shot down. Great way to make your enemy release a bioweapon in their own country.
