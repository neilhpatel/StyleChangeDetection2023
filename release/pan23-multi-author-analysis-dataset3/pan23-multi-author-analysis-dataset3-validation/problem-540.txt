According to Russian media, no weapon the West supplies to Ukraine will ultimately make a difference and Russia is bound to win regardless.
I do not think that supplying more weapons will really pose a significant escalation threat to Russia unless Ukraine pushes beyond its boarders. Moreover historic precedent shows that nuclear escalation does not follow from simple conventional arms supplies.
Also according to Russian media, every new weapons system the West supplies is a dangerous escalation that might lead to nuclear conflict.
Even if you take a completely neutral look at this situation and applied logic while removing emotion (if that's even possible), every new weapon system that NATO supplies them increasing the likelihood of widening the conflict. World opinion seems to be in favour of Ukraine as they have the moral high ground on their side but there are holdouts.
China is currently not doing much in the way of aid for Russia but you know, I know and so does everybody else with a brain knows that China(PRC) really wants to make America bleed. It won't take much to tip China over fully to the dark side and the potential for catastrophy at the point is huge.
I wasn't specifically referring to nuclear escalation but it's safe to say that the data on this is kinda flawed since nuclear weapons have only been used once.
