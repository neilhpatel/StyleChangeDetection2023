A lender who is considering that asset is likely to want to use that asset as a security on the loan, like a mortgage lender would. That security interest would supercede any contract you sign. In theory, your grandfather could give you a secured contract that gives you a more senior interest (provided he does that before he gets a loan), but the lender would see that lien too and it'd make the house much less useful for getting a loan.
On your side, you almost certainly won't be able to use a mortgage to finance this transaction: a mortgage lender wants a secured interest in the property, and you won't be able to grant that interest if you aren't receiving ownership of the property.
I am thinking part of the reason he doesn't want to transfer the house is he is trying to buy part of a business and I'm assuming equity in a house is more appealing to a lender than us owing him the same amount over 30 years. But I'm not really sure.
I'm not sure if he will be using the house to that purpose as he has other assets. I'm just thinking that is part of his thinking. He will be giving us about $150,000 off the price of the house as well. I probably should have mentioned that since this is why we are entertaining the idea of this deal. He was talking about us being in second position, after the first mortgage, so I think when you talk about a secured contract that is what he was thinking. How secure is something like this?
