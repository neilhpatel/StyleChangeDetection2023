I'd love to see it. It'd be a huge smack in the face to Republicans as a governing force. And it would cut down drastically on the numbskullery we're likely to see for the next two years. It could even be the first rift on the right that splits magas from the rest of the party.
Once upon a time, it was conventional wisdom that Republicans would fall in line. Be interesting to see how true that still is.
Rumor has it he's been promising multiple people the chance to head the same committees. If it turns out he's been double crossing everyone, things are only going to get worse for him after the speaker vote.
I’m kinda hoping mccarthy will promise the maga faction and the desantis faction a bunch of shit to get speaker and then, when he is speaker, to backstab everyone leaving the party in shambles.
Last time the House couldn’t pick a leader they spent several months and several hundred ballots to eventually elect a third party speaker in February, so you might have a better chance than McCarty….
This isn’t just about hating McCarthy or getting elected, it’s about avoiding 2 years of investigations that whether we want to admit it or will benefit Republicans in 2024 elections. 2 years of dragging Biden admin through the mud in the House by McCarthy and MTG isn’t going to hurt anyone but Biden and Dems.
