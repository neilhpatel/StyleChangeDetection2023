I am leaving them for a new bank. They want a 1% assignment fee to do so. Otherwise I will have to get a new loan and pay a mortgage recording tax of 2.8%.
The older lender is charging me an assignment fee to transfer the loan. Or they wonâ€™t assign it and I will have to pay a new 2.8% mortgage tax for a new loan.
That first option counts as a new loan. The second option counts as a modification to the first loan.
Yes, this is standard (E: in some jurisdictions) You are leaving to get a new loan. Without their permission can pay off the loan with them, and get a new loan with a new lender (presumably at a better rate).
But with their cooperation (which they are not bound to give, and they can charge for) they can assign your existing loan to the new lender, who can then alter the terms.
Does your current agreement require them to assign the loan? There's a difference between refinancing (aka paying off that loan early) and assigning the loan.
Who is charging the assignment fee? The old lender? Why would they be assigning anything? The new lender will be paying off the loan. Or are you refinancing with the same bank?
