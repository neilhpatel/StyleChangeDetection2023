Aside from ensuring the towing costs are consistent with any applicable local ordinances, it just isn't clear you have any recourse. Obviously you might bring up your concern about the stolen tags with your landlord. If the tow operator is doing this, surely you're not the first. Or, conversely, landlord might tell you they've had trouble in the neighborhood with that unrelated to towing.
If the tags were scraped off before the tow, this undoubtedly isn't an illegal tow and your recourse is against some unnamed criminal.
It is very hard to imagine how you might establish that the tow operator unlawfully removed your tags just, presumably, to create cause to tow your car.
Are you saying of course any tow company can drive around and tow a vehicle that they deem not in compliance with laws or codes of local government or private businesses?
If I can ask an ignorant question - In Kansas City, can the private tow companies make law enforcement decisions without the direction of the police? Are they within their rights to tow any car that is in violation of civil statutes?
Yes it’s legal, did you miss where the OP says the car was towed from an apartment complex? As in private property. It’s quite common and 100% legal for an apartment complex to require all vehicles to be registered.
