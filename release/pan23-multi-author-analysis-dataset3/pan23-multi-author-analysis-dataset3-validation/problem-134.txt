A U.S.-issue morphine syrette, a toothpaste tube-like device with an attached hypodermic needle covered by a cap, contained about half a grain (30 mg) of morphine tartrate; the exact LD50 (amount of the substance required to be lethal to 50 percent of a test population) of morphine for a human is not clear, although extensive animal testing has been done on rats, mice, and dogs. A one-time dose of 200 milligrams of morphine is generally accepted to be universally fatal for a normal human, but this can be much higher in some cases, such as in addicts who have developed a tolerance to the drug, or much lower in others, especially in people who are particularly sensitive to opiate painkillers. One "poor quality" study of morphine overdoses among soldiers cited an average of 71 mg for a 98 kg (216-pound) man as a lethal dose.
Thank you for the reply and providing a lot of information about how many potential accidental overdoses occurred... as well as an instance of morphine being specifically administered to euthanize a soldier.
The standard U.S. Army (Medical Department Form 52b) contained an entry that the medical aidman was to fill out stating whether morphine was given, the dose, and at what time. In addition to the tag, the used syrette was often pinned to the man’s clothing. A second less than two hours after the first, and morphine was not to be given if a man had abdominal pain of an unknown cause (an interesting piece of medical “misinformation” accepted as fact in the first half of the twentieth century), was unconscious, had an obvious head injury, had depressed respiration (under 12 breaths per minute), or was due for immediate surgery.

Guidelines which could be best characterized as cautious, were soon standardized for the use of morphine. Morphine was only to be used for relief of severe pain, and codeine or aspirin for most other cases. It was also revealed that the standard half-grain dose was too large for many men.
