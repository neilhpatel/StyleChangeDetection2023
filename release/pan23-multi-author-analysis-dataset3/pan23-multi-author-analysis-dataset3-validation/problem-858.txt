Definitely call the police, and file a report. This is going to be critical for when you sue your neighbor for the vet bills in small claims court. Additionally, you should prepare for the likelihood that your neighbor's dog will be euthanized and this will negatively impact whatever relationship you have with said neighbors.
For example, if the neighbor's dog came onto your property and attacked your dog, the neighbor is very likely liable for any any damages. On the other hand, if your dog went onto their property, the neighbor's liability is much less, maybe none.
If you are going to describe that the neighbor's dog came under the fence onto your property and then dragged your dog back under the fence to their property ... realize this might be met with some skepticism. So the more evidence you can provide to those facts the better.
So when you say your dog "was pulled completely under the fence", how do you know your dog didn't go under the fence into the neighbor's yard?
So then your dad knows whether the neighbor's dog came into your property or not. If it didn't, that will have bearing on how likely you are to recover damages.
If the dogs are fighting along the fence line, it's time to go beyond temporary fixes and take steps to ensure your retriever doesn't come in contact with the other dogs.
