To start, it is worth putting one thing right: Argentina is much, much richer today as in 1890. Their RGDP/capita in 1890 is $4,245 (2011 $GK) and in 2016 it was $18,875. So, real income per person is about 4.5 times higher today than it was then. Of course, as jumped-up plains apes (as Brad DeLong says) we are obsessive about relative wealth, so we remember the 1890s as a time when Argentina was rich, and today we think of Argentines as poor (though they are still well, well above the global average GDP/cap!) But the actual living standards of modern Argentines, after 130 years of "failure" is vastly higher than it was back then.
With the "turning inward" of the global economy in the 1930s, Argentina was on its own to provide internal solutions to the problem of economic growth. Industrialisation, which was already on its way with the increasing size of Buenos Aires and its influx of immigrants, and with the development of "industrial" meat processing, was given a massive boost with the sudden change in the terms of trade. Now industrial products were extremely expensive, and primary products very cheap, pushing investment into manufacturing. Since foreign exchange was at an extreme premium, import substitution was necessity, and eventually policy.
One further observation is the critical problem of between "import substitution". Import substitution is a "solution" to a problem faced by developing countries as they approach diminishing returns from the resource exporting stage, which is that a nascent manufacturing sector is unable to compete with manufacturing from established industrial powers, and thus the country is locked out from much of the lucrative value added from processing raw materials to finished goods.
For a country like Argentina which has a relatively smaller population and a smaller selection of resources, import substitution is unlikely to work as a strategy for industrialization.
For Argentina, which has a relatively high GDP per capita, its unlikely that you can export "cheap labor" for instance by running textile factories producing low quality and low value goods which are labor intensive and very sensitive to labor cost.
Unfortunately, Argentina was not similarly advantaged as a manufacturer as it had been as an agro-exporter. It was very far from other developed markets, and intra-Latin American trade was anemic. Buenos Aires might have been a lot like Chicago, but then there was no nearby New York, Boston, Philadelphia, or Toronto, and even London seemed more distant with closed world markets. Its educational system and literacy rate were good by Latin American standards, but not so impressive compared with Europe or the other European settler colonies. Its domestic financial system was flimsy and shallow. The political system was... complicated, and the internal question of who should be taxed, and how, was never clearly solved. The advantage that made Argentina rich was in its links with the global economy, and now it had to go it alone.
First and foremost, Argentina was never the world's richest country. It was close, but it never quite made it there.
