This idea was first proposed in 2010 and more seriously considered in 2011/2012. The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve released a statement that stated, "Neither the Treasury Department nor the Federal Reserve believes that the law can or should be used to facilitate the production of platinum coins for the purpose of avoiding an increase in the debt limit.".
That's the context here. It's about preventing economic armageddon, at a time when that's the threat that some insane right-wingers are making.
And the GQP threatening to default on treasury debt is the opposite of predictability and stability. The debt ceiling serves no good purpose except to give the GQP something to grandstand about when Democrats are in power.
While it's going through the court system, we wouldn't be defaulting on the debt. And if you think there's a scenario in which some ruling causes the treasury to immediately default, you'll have to explain how you think that would work.
Tell me how you get paid, where you study, what your parents do for work, etc… and I’ll explain how an insanely disruptive treasury market will impact you.
