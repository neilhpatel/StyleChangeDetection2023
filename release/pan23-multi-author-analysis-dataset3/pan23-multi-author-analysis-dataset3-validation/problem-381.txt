That depends on the contract you signed, look for wording under the seller’s right to cancel section that mentions returning the vehicle.
I just read back through the contract, it states I am liable for the expenses for the seller repossessing the vehicle only if the seller sends a letter of rescission within 20 days of the contract. Considering it’s been 37 days and I have not received a letter of rescission, it’s out of their pocket to get the vehicle back, I’m guessing?
Yes the dealership is pretty legitimate, I made sure to read reviews and ratings and everything seemed okay. Yea being my first time getting a car, I didn’t know whether it was normal or not for them to actually give my the car before financing pulled through because they said it was guaranteed because of my credit and pay stubs.
After my phone call with the bank, they never got back to me but the dealership told me it didn’t pull through, therefore I my loan account never opened and I had yet to be billed for this months payment from the bank. But after giving the dealership the extra $1500 they said it was going to be fine. I still have dealership plates on and they said just a few days ago they were going to give me new ones.
When you say reputable dealership, do you mean it had a sign or was it attached to a new car dealership. To be honest if it's not a singed dealership (one with a ford, Chevrolet or similar factory sign on the building) it's a shady dealership. Look over your contract. If there's a lender named on it and an interest rate you need to call the lender. If you were sent away with a bva (borrowed vehicle agreement) you are out of luck. It sounds like you went to buy a specific car found by using Google or another like website and didn't do your due diligence when researching the dealership. Google reviews a re notorious for being wrong or faked. All that being said I would talk to a lawyer asap to see what your options are. Also what was the price of the car? You put 4600 dollars down in essence how much is left to be financed and do you have a bank you deal with that would finance the rest or your parents bank?
