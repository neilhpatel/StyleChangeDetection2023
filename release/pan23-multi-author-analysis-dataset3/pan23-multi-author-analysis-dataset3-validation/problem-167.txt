From now on, every time you stop by, record the property and its condition so you can verify that nobody was living there.
If they're already doing it, recording that walk-through isn't going to be any extra effort and just MAYBE gives them a slightly better chance. I'd do it for that extra bit of hope.
That way if a squatter does get in, they can't print out a fake lease and forge your name and backdate it. Because if they DO do this police may say that there is nothing they can do and make you take it to court.
From what I've seen, the police will do this anyway. They have no way to verify the lease is real, or that your little 'house is unoccupied diary' is real, either. So they'll allow the squatter to stay, and say 'talk to the judge'. And by the time you wend your way thru an eviction, the place will be trashed.
I've said it before- all leases should be written (ie: verbal agreements are not valid) and notarized. Then it's a simple call to the notary to confirm. Even a cop can handle that. ).
This is my response. Everyone is convinced it's squatters and I'm under the impression it's a great way for someone to have a throw away internet account to do whatever with.
