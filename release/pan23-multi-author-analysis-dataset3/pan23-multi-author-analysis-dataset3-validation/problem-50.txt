And when precisely did platform framing come about and start to supercede balloon framing? Given your mention of comparative costs, I have some speculation about what might have driven it, but don't want to go making assumptions!
Interesting. That is actually a bit earlier than I expected, which leads me to another question, although this might be outside your focus, so perhaps someone else would need to weigh in, but in any case, how did the post-war boom specifically impact the approach to home construction? I'm thinking about the massive expansion and growth of the suburbs, and stuff like Levittown and its progeny. Was this expansion building off already existing methods of cheap construction that was already developed, or were they pioneering new methods that further brought down costs (beyond, of course, the simple mass-construction angle)?
Two sort of related questions about this. Was there a specific factor that led to Chicago being the locale where balloon framing first was implemented, and how quickly did it spread to become the dominant building style?
The successor to timber framed construction, balloon framing using 2x4s, was invented/popularized in Chicago in the early 19th century. Walls several stories tall consisted of long 2x4s that were assembled on the ground and tilted up. Ledger boards would be attached to the balloon framing and floors would be built off of them. Buildings could be built much more quickly using this method because individual workers could handle the pieces of wood and connections could be made with nails. The issue with this method of construction is that it requires long mature trees. That and the attachment of the ledger board to the balloon framing left a gap in the stud cavity which fire could and often did spread to upper floors through. For this reason it's rarely used or allowed today.
