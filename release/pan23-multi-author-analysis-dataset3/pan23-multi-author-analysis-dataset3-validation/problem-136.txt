Get a bunch of guys in uniform with AKs to march into town, believing that the populace has not just a massive fear of you, but awe and respect to do exactly what you say and feel immediately guilty that Big, Cool, Scary guy Russia doesn't think you're cool any more and you'll do what they say because oh god, you really want Russia to think you're cool.
