Even if it is public land and a privately run apartment complex it is possible that the "health and safety" can override these things.
They can likely claim to do this per something in the student agreements you almost certainly agreed to.
So you are absolutely right about the student agreement. I looked through that and the exact language is, “a reasonable person would believe the actions committed have the potential to cause a danger to the community.”.
Do you mind explaining the how a bit more? I have a lease agreement with the apartment complex and no where on that lease agreement does it say I can be removed from my apartment unless there is emergency maintenance.
Also in the student agreements there is a list of approved punishments and removal from university housing is one of them but my apartment complex is not university housing.
Obviously I don’t want to get suspended either but if my options are a week suspension or carry all the stuff I need for a week, 1.5 miles while coughing up a storm I will probably choose the week suspension.
