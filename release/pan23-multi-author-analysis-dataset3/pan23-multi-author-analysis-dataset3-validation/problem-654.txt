When the senate isn't tied on a vote, the VP basically can't do a damn thing and serves a very good job of being the travelling face of the administration.
As AG for california, yes she was in charge. yes, California is most populous. can you provide any kind of evidence that it is per capita the most corrupt?
"Kamal Harris the the top law enforcement officer of the nation’s most populous state and also the most corrupt police force. Man foh.".
I get it. You know the truth and can’t share the truth because the truth will make you look ridiculous.
Stop lying about verifiable facts. Plenty of black people act like republicans, claiming kamala can't be bad for black rights is an obvious lie. She can and is. No one is going to claim clarence thomas is a supporter of black rights just because he is black. He happily threw out major voting regulations that preserved the rights of minorities.
Oh, now you want to use racism as a shield from your wrong ideas? The race of the person telling the truth does not matter. The truth matters. Trying to discount the fact with racism is extremely racist, so congrats on being racist.
