This is another of example of Republicans getting what they think they want, but learning it's bad for them until it's too late.
They may find it distasteful but it's just going to be worse if they let these compromised house members win.
The saddest thing is both sides of Republicans calling themselves RINOS, if they were a democrat infiltrator they would just side with dems and vote with them.
The moderates were all voted out, they opened the door wide open to the crazies like Boebert, Gaetz, and MTG, and now are experiencing a inter-party civil war where the term RINO is as hated as Democrat.
We wouldn't be in this position without that either. They were elated to have all the safe seats and guaranteed majorities, but in turn created a system where the only real electoral race is in the partisan party primary where only the most extreme candidates could win.
Side note: I think shutting down the function of government is their goal. The GOP has a stranglehold on a lot of statehouses. That's where their biggest advantage is, so they wish to neuter government on the Federal level.
