When you were hired was there an employee handbook or contract you signed that states something about if over payment is done it will be deducted from checks?
In Virginia an employer can deduct overpaid wages, BUT, the company must have your written authorization to do so. If the company has failed to pay less than $10k then the failure is a class 1 misdemeanor and more importantly for your purposes, they must pay you the amount in dispute and can be ordered to pay an additional amount equal to the disputed amount as liquidated damages. The Virginia code section that is relevant is below.
On the off chance they just agree to stop the deductions you would want to ask for an agreement in writing resolving the debt. Which you would want an attorney to look over before you sign. A consultation of an hour and a few hours of work would likely be enough, so you could probably get this done pretty cheaply.
The question you have now is what you want to do here. It might be first worth simply reaching out to human resources to say that you object to the ongoing deductions as you believe they are improper. They will make some sort of response, which likely will include a statement that you owe the money and so they want you to sign the proper authorization. At that point I would recommend going to file a complaint with the Virginia Department of Labor and Industries. You don’t want to go down the path of threatening to do that unless they fix it, while it is almost certainly not extortion to do so as you have a right to make the report and a right to try and resolve the claim, it’s going to set off bells with the company if you do, so I would recommend just reporting. Alternatively you could seek a consult with an employment law attorney before you talk to the company or after they make a request to sign the form.
If the company really doesn’t have an authorization from you for the deductions they have problems. But let’s back up and talk through the issues here.
