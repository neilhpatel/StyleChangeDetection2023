Russia: “NOOO YOU CAN’T DO THAT It’s not fair you’re escalating things Stop giving them cutting-edge weapons”.
If the Russians had valid combined arms, or where better at tactics, they could be in trouble. If the crews manning the Russian T-80s and T-90s are competent and trained in proper maneuver, they will give these trouble.
The downside is you'd need trained crews, trained commanders and a lot of teamwork to get the footwork down. The armor is light and those Russian tank guns will kill. On the bright side that 120mm gun has about twice the range as the Russian 125mm tank gun, but effective range is largely based on fire control system(targeting computer).
From what I can see a lot of the combat in Ukraine is with BMPs are BTRs which they will be good at taking out, while older T-72s can only reverse at 4-6kph the Leo 1A5 is a lot faster and is built to do shoot and scoot, using the surroundings as protection .
They were destroyed by russian command, modern AT weapons and modern tanks, need I remind you Ukraine has their own tanks, T64B modifications and T72s that were updated in 2000s and 2010s.
The whole philosophy around it is now faulty, western tanks are complex and require a good crew, well trained and prepared, that takes time, so the crew is considerably more valuable then the tank, while soviet tanks are simple and meant to be driven by conscripts with limited knowledge. USSR had a huge army and could not prepare its troops to the same level so it's kind of quality vs. quantity situation. The tanks themselves embody that, T72 is light, quick, has autoloader, shells in the turret, less crew 3 and less armor, while M1 and Leo 2 are heavy, have more crew 4, the ammo is sealed in a protected compartment that aims to save crew in case there is a cook off, armor is stronger and generally they have better components. Not to mention that the tactics are very different and those compliment that philosophy. So if I were to simplify it - western tanks supposed to be better to win. They aim to preserve life of the crew, that is why Ukraine wants it, Ukraine needs to have low losses, it can't win in any other way, if that doesn't happen Ukraine just loses because russia had more bodies. M1 Abrams and Leopard 2 do exactly that.
The Leopard 1A5s have the 120mm Rheinmetall gun from the 2 and the M1 Abrams retrofitted. They absolutely will kill any and all tanks in existence with it.
