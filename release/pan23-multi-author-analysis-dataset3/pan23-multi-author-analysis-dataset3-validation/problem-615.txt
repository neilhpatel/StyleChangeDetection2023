Have you arranged to fulfill your obligations (smog check, notarized signatures, etc) to sell the car ?
The first ten offers I got were variations on the "I am very interested and will send you the shipping information" by people who also showed no interest in the detailed condition of that car.
There's a very high probability that when the check arrives it will be written on someone else's account, be for the wrong amount (you will be asked to forward part of it, or pay their "shipping agent").
No, the bank a stolen or fake check is drawn on is not going to provide any protection at all to the person who receives it.
Have you confirmed with your own bank what they'll do if the cashier's check turns out to be fake, and how long they have to do it ? Funds availability rules are the axle on which these scams turn, and you can definitely have a check "clear" and make the funds available to your bank, and then be determined to be fake or fraudulent a couple of weeks later.
The problem is that in a lot of cases the check will clear, and only several weeks later will the bank realize it was fraudulent. At which point you will owe the money.
