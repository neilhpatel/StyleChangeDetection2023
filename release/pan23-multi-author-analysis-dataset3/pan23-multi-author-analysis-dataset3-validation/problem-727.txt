I have never read Eco's essay as an instrument to analyze the past; but rather as an invitation to challenge our assumptions on the present - and, thankfully, that's Eco's present, so we don't have to violate any rule of twenty years. The assumption - for instance - that, since fascism is - historically speaking - confined to "its epoch", regardless of our desire to stretch the boundaries of it, than we can do no wrong, nor borrow, or even reproduce without the need to borrow, the elements that defined (maybe) the formation of meaning in the public conscience in the outward sphere of "historical fascism".
And, unlike others, this is actually a theme that is shared by Italian Fascism and by "maximalist" socialism (I'll limit myself to the Italian scenario in this case) that goes even further in this direction with its absolute rejection of "class collaboration". Even then, in their context, the two approaches are so profoundly different that there is no way of mixing them up; it would be like saying that, since two pieces are both 3/4, then it has to be fundamentally the same music. And this difference of tone tends to persist even in the presence of those who claimed, or attempted to bridge the gap, because both those abstract rejections of the notion of "coming to terms with the enemy" were and operated in direct connection with their historical context.
In many ways we do have some sort of operative "definition", that comes from a process of natural selection - so to speak - of different interpretive attempts. The historiography of fascism is a field of its own, starting roughly in the early 1920s with the first works attempting to explain the affirmation of Italian Fascism. What one can witness through the decades is that - while certain traits remain consistent - our interpretations of fascism continue to evolve, driven for better or worse, by the dialogue between two poles: the present and the past.
So would you say its more of a semiotic reading of how discourse within fascism might look, as in how it brands itself and signals itself (since Eco was a semiologist), but its not a guarantee because the historical context and intents itself might be different?
