As I briefly discussed in an earlier thread (thanks to /u/WhoTookBibet for linking), there were no serious Soviet doubts to the veracity of the American moon landing--the USSR was aware months before that the Americans were on course to beat them in a manned lunar landing. Instead, Soviet authorities intentionally downplayed the scientific significance of a manned moon landing (note the "freer choice" in selecting surface material--indeed only the following year did the USSR recover any surface samples through an unmanned mission).
If you'd allow an engineer's perspective, I would contend that the Russian program to land a man to the moon _was_ an utter failure, and indeed, that barring a significant, politically untenable restructure of efforts and access to technology not available to them for decades, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to successfully match the feat of Apollo 11.
Was the reasoning strategically in line with other aspirations the Soviets may have had for an orbital station; or purely research oriented, seeing more scientific value in a station orbiting Earth vs anything they could glean through visiting the moon in person?
that orbital stations promised the right way forward"), thus solidifying a space station as the chief successor to the lunar missions; the USSR had alternatively pursued a manned Mars mission, but determined the timeline was unrealistic to compete with further American milestones--such as a space station.
Military interests did play a role in orbital missions, but I don't want to understate the scientific values of a manned space station; the Almaz reconnaissance missions of the mid-1970s were launched after Salyut 1, and by 1978 were abandoned for conventional, unmanned satellites, while Salyut 7 remained manned until 1986 and did not reenter until 1991.
However, even before 1969 there had been internal agitation for pursuing a space station concurrently with a manned lunar landing; Sergei Korolev had pursued an orbital space station as early as the 1960s (before his death in 1966), but Siddiqi contends that Korolev believed that such plans would not materialize until the 1970s, with greater effort and resources dedicated to Soyuz.
While the Soviet Union (not strictly Russian, and indeed the Baikonur Cosmodrone was in the Kazakh SSR, though populated chiefly by Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians) was far from a manned moon landing in 1969, it is a stretch to say the lunar program was a failure. Luna 2 succeeded in landing on the Moon in 1959 and Luna 9 successfully performed a soft landing in 1966, with the latter returning photographs of the surface, both before the United States.
Just to add that Luna 3 was also the first to take photos of the dark side of the moon, which at least to me seems to be the most scientifically informative of all the moon missions. We had never seen (technically almost) half of the moon until that point, and then we had.
