Yes, the individual contacted me personally. No letters, emails, or in-person dialogue with any lawyers, firms, or courts. I admit, I responded to this individual's very first email to inform them that the article in question did not reveal their name, business, or reasonable likeness and that my sentences within the article are truthful due to the messages received from this individual in the past that I have saved. Every subsequent message I have not replied to nor do I intend to.
I have receipts of my personal purchases for items that the individual erroneously claims I stole. The items in question are a specific item that are pertinent to the occupation mentioned, which I perform as a sole proprietor as well. The receipts are proof I purchased them. With this evidence in mind, and should the individual escalate this baseless claim, could the potential case be proven as extortion if they threaten to and/or file a police report?
In this case there's almost no way he'd ever see charges for criminal extortion or filing a false police report. They'd have to prove he knowingly lied to the police, or knew for a fact that his threats and accusations are not true.
Making an accusation that turns out to be incorrect is not the same thing as lying. If he escalates the claim and actually files a police report you should get a lawyer and together provide those receipts to the police.
If they do make a police report, the highest likelihood is that the police will tell this person it appears to be a civil matter, and move on. If they do, by any slight chance show up to talk to you, or ask you to come in for an interview, politely decline to speak to them and get a criminal defense lawyer. Do NOT talk to them and show them all your records trying to exonerate yourself. The rule of thumb is that you can never talk your way out of charges, you can only talk your way into them. Tell your story and provide your evidence to your lawyer.
If this person files a civil suit, respond. But until then don’t worry about it. Plenty of nuts threaten to sue, very few of them actually do it.
Most jurisdictions do not consider it extortion if the property is your own. So, “Return the $100 you stole from my wallet or I call the police” is not extortion. “Give me $100 or I will tell the police you raped me” would be.
This really isn't your problem, is it? Make copies of the receipts you have for business purchase, and store them safely. Tell this person to cease all contact with you for any purposes whatsoever. Block and move on.
And, as far as the potential extortion charge is concerned, in Florida you would have to prove that the demands for the return of property is malicious. So, the prosecutors would have to prove that this individual was making these threats knowing that the items weren’t actually theirs. That isn’t that easy. Your ex-boss could always claim that while you purchased the items and have receipts, they reimbursed you for them, and the items were therefore not your property, for example. I think its highly unlikely that the police would be at all interested in investigating potential extortion when there is a civil disagreement about property ownership. And, I don’t see how you would benefit from such an investigation. I suggest you focus on getting the crazy person out of your life rather than getting more enmeshed.
