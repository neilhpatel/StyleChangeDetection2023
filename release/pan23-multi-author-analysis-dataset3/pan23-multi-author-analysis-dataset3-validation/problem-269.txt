Title: Bought home from seller who was removing the inground pool from the property. To ensure they did the removal correctly, we requested they do the work with all necessary permits and added that into the contract. We just found out the permits were only issued, but were never completed.
Open permits can mean that final inspection was never requested. If the work has been completed, you can ask the city if it's possible to schedule an inspection & close out the permits.
If you already purchased the home, you just need to request a final inspection to close out the permits. Best to ask the vendor who did the work and requested the permits to do it as itâ€™s part of their job.
I had this issue with an old electrical permit. Found the vendor listed on it and had them close it out.
