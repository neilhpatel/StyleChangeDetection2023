I'm not clear on the situation here. Is this an apartment building? Where exactly are these cameras, and how are the other people getting access to them?
If they are in a common area, as opposed to your private area, you can't stop them from putting a towel over it. I'd do the same thing.
Yeah that was my thought. I once had a neighbor accuse me and my roommates of all kinds of horrible things, including dealing drugs. We were actually just 3 grad students with weird schedules and different friends and partners coming over to visit time to time. No parties, nothing loud or illegal, but our neighbor had quite the imagination and she loved to share those fantasies with our landlord at all hours of the night.
When you say “broke up a deal” did you actually see people exchanging drugs or did you assume what they were doing and then told your neighbor’s friends to leave? I mean, that obviously doesn’t justify the threat but I do wonder about the other side of the story. I can’t imagine too many people would be keen on a neighbor installing a security camera facing their door.
But it sounds like your neighbor didn't authorize or request his friend do this, as he is on board with the cameras, and it sounds like you don't have information on the friend.
With relatively high risk neighbors, you can certainly file a police report and see if they want to pursue it further, but that seems more likely to lead to a negative outcome if anything. It's very foreseeable that they ask your neighbor some questions, he "doesn't know" the friends details, and nothing changes except for your relationship with him.
The most pragmatic solution would be installing a cage around the camera that doesn't allow a rake handle through.
