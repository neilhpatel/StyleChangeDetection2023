One important thing to know is that the Holodomor wasn't so much an ideological issue, as it was an ethnic issue. This was just the last attempt by Russia to ethnically cleanse part of Ukraine to resettle it with Russians, and the way the USSR did it this time was by deliberately starving Ukraine.
Indeed and were so determined to do that so we had to starve other regions of povolzhye, kazakhstan and siberia where ethnic ukrainians were hiding. /s.
How come that ussr leader at that time was georgian dictator and union itself was composed of multiple republics of different ethnicities, but it's solely russia and russians who's responsible?
Those darn russians, not just they conquered those tiny little innocent states, but also forced their representatives to rule the union... /s.
I get it, you hate russia, russians and everything related, but you can't hold accountable just one nation and one republic for actions performed by union. All republics that were part of the USSR (that's at least Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia) at the moment are just as guilty as russia.
