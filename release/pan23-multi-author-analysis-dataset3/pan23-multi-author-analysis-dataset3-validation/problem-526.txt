In Golash v. Cherokee Cab Co., the Georgia Court of Appeals had to decide whether or not a cab driver was an employee and due workers’ compensation benefits. The court used the “right to control” test in which the court assessed whether or not the employer had the right to control and direct the cab driver’s work as per the employment contract.
Yes and it is a new business that grew fast and I’m thinking they don’t know the rules. My thing is that they can’t define in a contract what appears to be an employee. I’ll definitely make sure to negotiate what works for me though.
According to U.S. labor law, independent contractors are not employees—they are self-employed and do work for clients on a contract basis. If you do work as an independent contractor, you are technically working for yourself.
Whether you would constitute an employee or independent contractor will depend on many factors, not just one. If they need your services available at certain set times, that's not an unreasonable request for a contractor in and of itself.
