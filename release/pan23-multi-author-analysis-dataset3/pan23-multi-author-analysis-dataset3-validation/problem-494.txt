As for point four, yes the search was absolutely legal. You were arrested for a crime and booked into jail. This is part of booking procedure. I’m confused where you draw the line between you and “criminals” considering you were literally arrested for committing a crime.
She was banned from the property. The property owner called and stated that she was there and wasn’t supposed to be. The police had probable cause to arrest her for trespassing.
There was no restraining order, only a trespass notice. It was issued because of our fight last year. And yes, I was naïve to think that if he invited me it somehow 'cancels' it.
It was just shocking, I guess, to learn how degrading that 'procedure' was. And besides, the charges were dropped next morning, but no one said sorry for what I was subjected to. Criminal in my mind is someone who was found guilty of committing a crime...
I was exactly that - believing that our justice treats everyone fairly and is only harsh on someone who is proven guilty. I'm a kind of person who is always about following the rules, so it was especially embarrassing to find myself in this situation. And as I described in other responses, I would never have thought I could be routinely 'strip searched', thinking (again, naively), that it's reserved for the drug dealers and other criminals, and is done after there is a warrant of some sort... I'm definitely more aware now of the world I live in, that's for sure!
