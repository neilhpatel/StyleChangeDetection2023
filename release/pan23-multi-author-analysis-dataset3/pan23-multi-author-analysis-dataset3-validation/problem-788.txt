The Maurya Empire is further attested by archaeology. While not attributable to specific rulers, we can see the expansion of a uniform silver currency across their territory. We can also see the growth of a unique art styles, such as the “Mauryan polish” that makes the lion capitals so shiny. Many stupas and Buddhist sites do show notable expansion around the time of Ashoka, such as those excavated by John Marshall at Taxila.
The Ashoka inscriptions are actually multi-lingual, and were sort of like a Rosetta Some for scholars deciphering some no longer used Indian languages. In Prakrit, the main language of the Mauryan court, Ashoka refers to himself as Devanampiya Piyadasi Asokaraja, which is translated as “Humane King Ashoka, Beloved of the Gods.” They certainly paint him in an idealistic light and are subject to debate, but that’s true of any ancient document. Most modern scholars accept them as genuine, but there is certainly some debate. There’s really nothing else on the Kalinga War, but we do see the Mauryan currency and some architectural evidence of their rule or influence there.
Magadhan/Mauryan art is likely influenced by Achaemenid styles and technology, including the Mauryan Polish technique I mentioned. Stylistically, the lion capitals reflect this. The Aramaic alphabet was adapted to some Indian languages, such as Kharoshthi, and may have influenced the Brahmi alphabet (big debate on that). There is probably some cross-cultural religious influence, too, with some Zoroastrian dualism making its way into some Brahmanical and Buddhist schools, but that’s beyond my area of study.
Certainly, by a certain point we are talking about Buddhist societies (often with an acculturated substrate of what’s sometimes called “folk religion, famously Bon in Tibet), but we still find the mixing at official levels in many places. The relationship between Shinto and the Japanese Buddhist schools is complex, and sometimes they’re separate and sometimes they’re pretty explicitly mixed, but often they’re kept separate but for example before the Meiji Restoration, a Buddhist monastery might run a Shinto temple or vice versa. Like even when separation of worship, there’s not necessarily a separation of authority.
