Despite that fuzziness, some broad statements can be made. The synoptic gospels and the major Pauline epistles were universally accepted "except among the more extreme proponents of Jewish Christianity" (Ackroyd and Evans). These formed the "core" of the early Church's scripture, and even fringe groups such as the gnostics made use of them. The rest of the canonical NT was used some places, but was unknown or not recognized in others until a certain point.
What about the other epistles in the New Testament, which it appears some early Christian communities used and others did not? 1 Peter was widely received early on as being authentically Petrine. 2 Peter and Jude were widely accepted by the end of the 2nd century. Hebrews was attributed to Paul by some in the early Church, but nobody accepts that now; nevertheless, it holds an important place in the canon. The origin of James is highly controversial, with some scholars claiming it was not even authored by a Christian; it was one of the last books to receive recognition from the Church.
Let me take a moment now to address books that did not make it into the canon—the "New Testament apocrypha." But let's look at a few of the big ones. It's important to remember, as u/declawedboys pointed out, that the early Christian context was suffused with oral and written traditions, Christian and Jewish. Scriptural status in the strong sense of the canon—referring to a relatively small number of totally authoritative books—was not the foremost concern. One could also make the argument that the Old Testament canon is still an undecided question, given that Protestants, Catholics, and various Orthodox communions all use different lists!
I think another angle to consider is that, while canon is clearly important to all Christians denominations, it’s elevated in Protestantism. Texts and stories didn’t need to be canon for them to occupy an important place in spiritual life. In August 15 the high liturgical Churches will celebrate the Assumption of Mary — which is the belief that Mary ascended to heaven, body and soul, when she was on her deathbed. Why is this celebrated? It’s not in the New Testament! But it’s attested to in other early writings in the tradition which are not in the canon. In Protestantism it’s easy to forget that Christians were still valuing writings and still holding them in high regard, even if they weren’t canon.
“Canon” label aside, are you aware of any texts whose reputation has increased or decreased in the eyes of Catholics/other Christians in the light of modern academic findings?
