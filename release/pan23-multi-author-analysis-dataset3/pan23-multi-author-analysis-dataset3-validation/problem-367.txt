You need more info. How the electrical system is designed is not an answer. It is a relatively minor cost to design the electrical system in a home.
The capacity they are referring to then may be coming into the meter from the pole. That is a different issue, as it refers to the number of wires and capacity of the wires coming from the pole to the building. Still not an issue, just a matter of an additional line or larger capacity line, but sounds like they are looking for places to cut costs.
If the EV charger was an option that you paid extra for at the time you went under contract, you need to consult with an attorney to determine your options.
The problem is the have EV Charger as an options at the time we sign the agreement and we decided to go with this project over the other one because there is this option and we have already paid for this. They still haven’t communicated to us directly that they will have to remove the EV Charger — we heard it from another friend who bought before us and their building will be completed before us.
Thank you! I found out more: it’s indeed the capacity issue. They have to prioritize between elevators (private), heating and EV charger and they can only allow two out of three things and decided to forego EV charger.
It’s actually a national company — one of the biggest actually. We kinda like the location and we have already sold our current place so the timing wouldn’t work well trying to back out and finding a new home esp the prices have gone up quite a bit.
