It is a very shitty narrative. High school students and university students are our future. They do vote (or will shortly when they turn 18). Good for them standing up for what they believe in. The right to peacefully protest and make their voices heard, that is what freedom is all about.
True except conservatives believe blocking a road in protest forfeits your right to life. Considering their opinions on guns I doubt age would stop them.
In highschool I participated in a 15 min walk out/ moment of silence for a school shooting that happened near me not only did the principal tell us we were all suspended, many students, teachers and administrators told us we were wasting our time. One kid even said he would kill us all if his guns got taken away.
That’s why I hate the shitty narrative of “kids just want to miss school” because no, many of these students like learning, they just want to feel they can actually make a difference. It sucks that in a country that claims “Everyone has a voice”, you get ridiculed for using that voice.
If they were walking out because of a bill restricting gun rights or transgender bathrooms I’m sure desantis would be praising them for taking initiative.
Yep we all got suspended, most people’s parents didn’t care, and it was high school so the “permanent record” threat was laughable. The scariest part to me was how my peers reacted. It’s one thing to expect pushback from the older generations, but getting hated on and vilified by people your own age was something I was really expecting. I mean apathy is one thing but to make threats and be legitimately angry because some kids in your class walked outside for 15 minutes and sat silently seems insane!
