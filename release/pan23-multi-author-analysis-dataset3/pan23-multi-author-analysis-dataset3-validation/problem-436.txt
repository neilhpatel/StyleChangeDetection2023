Exactly they will continue to elect the most hardline conservatives they can while asking why the democrats can put up moderates despite the current president being the most vanilla moderate democrat available.
The kind of Republicans competing with the likes of Trump and DeSantis and the positions they would need to take on to emerge victorious in a nationwide primary would make them wholly unpalatable to any kind of center-left voter.
The first party to develop a not insane nominating system that relies on the narrow party fringes who dominate primaries to pick a candidate is going to have a chokehold on the presidency because they'll be able to deliver broadly appealing candidates.
Democrats are further along because they at least award delegates proportionally based on vote total, while the Republicans mostly have a plurality winner takes all system, which is just nuts.
The only way any Republican should win a majority is by stop pandering for the fascist and lunatic votes, and start being honest on issues to win more of the centrists.
