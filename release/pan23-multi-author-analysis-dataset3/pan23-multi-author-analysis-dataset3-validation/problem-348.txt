Yeah...she might be able to get away with that for about five minutes before the government reminds just how little power she has especially when it comes to creating an international incident.
The idea of punishing someone for something their government does which they personally have no ability to stop is complicated, and pretending that it's simple helps no one.
I also think a tennis open is different from the Olympics. A tennis open is a competition between athletes, and those athletes have a little flag displayed and sometimes their country is talked about. The Olympics is a competition between nations, where those nations bring athletes to compete (but it also has a tradition of being an act of peace even amidst interantional tension).
Personally, I do see the argument for athletes to compete under a IOC flag for countries that do commit atrocities or even invading their neighbors.
This would still allow athletes in the future in other countries that invade others to compete under the IOC flag as punishment too (as long as that punishment hasn't been already set for something else).
I don't understand why countries aren't collectively banning countries that commit atrocities from many things let alone something as simple as the Olympics. They don't seem to care about sanctions. Seems more like an inconvenience to them. The world needs to collectively do better. Otherwise we're going to continue to be in this mess.
