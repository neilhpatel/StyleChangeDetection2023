OP. this is the correct answer. Copyright is about control of the distribution and reproduction of the creative work in a fixed medium of expression. Personal singing of a song for yourself with yourself as the audience is perfectly normal and not copyright infringement.
recording your own performance of a copyrighted work is NOT a violation of copyright. Distributing that recording may be, if you do not have the appropriate license for the cover.
Youtube has a blanket synchronization license, which publishers can opt into. As far as I can tell, if the copyright owner/publisher of a song has opted into this system, you are free to upload covers of their songs to Youtube without needing any further license yourself.
In the US, you would be looking at a 'mechanical license' for the audio only or a 'synchronization license' for audio + video productions.
Depending on the details, this may also be covered under fair use, but there are too many mistakes about what is and isn't covered under fair use for me to make any definitive statements about it without a lot of research.
