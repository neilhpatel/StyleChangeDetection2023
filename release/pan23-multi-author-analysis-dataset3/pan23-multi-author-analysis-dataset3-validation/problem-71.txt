First, its important to recognize that the Catholic Church has generally, but especially since the whole Galileo fiasco, responded to new developments slowly. It usually prefers to allow issues to be debated for decades, sometimes centuries before the Pope chimes in. The Papacy waited a hundred years before saying something about evolution, by which time much more was known about the theory and its mechanisms.
This is not to say that there was not opposition at first to evolution by Catholics. Alongside the non-literal interpretive tradition in Catholicism, there have also always been Catholics who interpreted Genesis more literally. G.K. Chesterton, an early 20th century Catholic author and apologist whose writings are still very popular today, was known for frequently criticizing Darwinism generally, but especially Darwinism as a social phenomenon and as a way to understand human nature. And even Chesterton admitted that Evolution could potentially be true in a scientific sense. Chesterton's concern about Evolution as an explanation for the soul and for human nature and the structuring of human society has remained in the Church to this day. However, by the time Humani Generis came out, and stated there was nothing contrary to Church doctrine in believing in evolution, opposition within the Church to the theory of Evolution was probably a minority position. By the 1990s, the pro-evolution position had become strong enough that Pope John Paul II actually spoke of Evolution as being more than a theory. Opposition to evolution continues in the Catholic Church, but it is a fringe position rarely heard outside of very traditional Catholic communities. The Church does not forbid belief in evolution, but it does not require belief in evolution either.
You only mention Darwinism as being criticized by catholics. Evolution and Darwinism are not one and the same. It is not evolution that OP was asking about, but rather Darwinism.
I often hear that Darwin was at odds with Christianity. That is factually incorrect. He was at odds with some Christians, and that gave him great concern. But the mainstream church accepted him.
Of course, there are all kinds of Christians, and not all of them agreed on everything. Wilberforce chose to argue with the new discoveries, and in doing so made a fool of himself. Thomas Huxley was nick-named "Darwin's Bulldog" for a reason, and enjoyed the fight. Most of those watching (who statistically would have been mostly Christian), could see that Wilberforce was an idiot and the theologians were right.
