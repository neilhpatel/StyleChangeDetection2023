But to answer your question, no, there was not, because impressment was not practiced after 1814 and slavery was not outlawed in the British empire (except in Sri Lanka) until 1833.
It seems rather odd that you would compare the practice of chattel slavery, in which the enslaved person had absolutely no rights under law, to the practice of impressment, in which a man would be required to serve at sea under nautical discipline but in full possession of his rights as a person, and recourse to naval authorities for grievances.
Also just want to highlight the distinction that all this is occurring after the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, when it had become common and uncontroversial for English people to be proud of the fact that the trade was banned, or that slavery wasn't possible in English law, but slavery was going on as normal in the Caribbean and would until 1830. That bit of cognitive dissonance aside, it at least makes more sense where he's coming from: that he's framing both as a kind of kidnapping, and ignoring what happens afterwards.
I'll echo what u/jschooltiger said about it being a false equivalence, but you guessed right that the comparison was made at the time. Unfortunately I can't find the source I read the other week, which used all the same arguments (possibly by the same author?) but was shorter and clearer, however there's an example in this 'letter to William Wilberforce on the subject of Impressment' from 1816. The main points are an attempt to portray impressment as worse than African slavery by downplaying the evils of slavery and also by claiming that impressment was worse as the British sailor was used to freedom whereas the Negro was a natural slave or something. This set up, the author then criticises anti-slavery activists for hypocrisy for being so concerned about black people while ignoring British seamen.
Basically, while it is using the sympathy for abolitionism (of the slave trade at least), and the cultural prominence of abolitionist arguments, it's mostly downplaying slavery and engaging in the old and respected activity of criticising activist bleeding-heart types for trying to improve something while other bad things also exist, and using that to call into question the sincerity of their concern. While some basic anti-slavery arguments are accepted, it's really closer to being pro-slavery than anything.
edit: I just found I was originally thinking of, and it was by the same author, so I'll change my original statement from 'some people at the time' to 'one guy'. Anyway, the sentence I wanted was:
