And yes, unfortunately post op infections can happen even if the procedure was performed perfectly that’s why I can’t believe the 2nd doctor would say what he did.
This procedure was most likely done in a surgical center or outpatient hospital setting, I’ve done surgery in both and there is as close to zero chance as possible that those instruments weren’t sterilized, they have strips in the trays that change color so you know they were sterilized when you open them. It genuinely blows my mind a doctor would tell a patient after a post op infection “maybe the doctor operated on you with dirty instruments.”.
hey, revisiting this: i spoke with four outside ophthalmologists, and they all said to me that they think the infection was the fault of the doctor because the eye was infected immediately after the surgery. the strain of bacteria that was found is also an extremely abnormal and dangerous strain. based off these two facts, does it sound like we might have a basis for lawsuit?
Thank you for this info. The bacteria was actually quite rare/abnormal apparently. I'm actually also surprised the second doctor said that, but he is very reputable and considered one of the best.
This case may be winnable if the second doctor is right. This case may go nowhere if this was simply bad outcome despite the first surgeon having done things right. From where you are it seems like either is possible.
Perhaps this doctor knows something. If he does, that information would be the basis of her suit. Perhaps this doctor was spitballing or speaking metaphorically or without thinking. If that was the case there’s not much reason to think there’s a suit here.
