I have to disagree slightly. The upper nobility was certainly dispossessed, but some lower aristocrats probably managed to survive and intermarry with the new French-speaking aristocracy.
The great trouble with answering this question is that we almost completely lack literary evidence from the perspective of the ordinary Englishman of the 11th-12th centuries. A large portion of the population was illiterate and left no records. The literary output largely came from clerics, many of them Norman, and from writers sponsored by the Anglo-Norman kings, or from one and the same. Neither group was awfully interested in the ordinary peasantry. So while we can't really know their minds, I can say that the English rebellions ceased after 1071. The Harrying of the North was basically the end of organized Anglo-Saxon resistance. There would be subsequent rebellions, but they would involve almost exclusively Anglo-Norman lords and were of a political nature.
Follow up question: William the conqueror quickly distributed fiefs and lands to the Norman noblemen who followed him to England. For how long were these new landowners seen as intruding foreigners until they were accepted?
