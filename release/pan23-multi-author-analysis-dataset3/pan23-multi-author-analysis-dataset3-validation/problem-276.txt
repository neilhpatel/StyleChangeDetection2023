Bernie seems spot-on with this criticism. What on Earth is Biden thinking with asking Congress to force Rail Employees to work without sick pay days\, and with shift schedules that are clearly not healthy to maintain.
The only only acceptable reason would be that he knew that Congress could act to include sick leave - bypassing the objections of the rail barons and delivering for the rail workers. I highly doubt it, given that he's not talking about it in those terms. It seems more like yet another example of how moderate Democrats are incapable of saying a very simple phrase: "Pay your fucking workers.".
And here's the thing. If you don't wanna do this cause it's the right thing, then at least do it for selfish reasons and help keep your nice political job.
Democrats can help themselves now, and help secure some voters in otherwise red areas. Have they learned nothing from Fetterman and Pelotola?
This the exact kind of thing people remember and that gets them to vote for the people that gave it to them.
