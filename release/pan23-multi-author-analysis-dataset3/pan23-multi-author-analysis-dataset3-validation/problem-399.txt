The GOPers routinely used the evangelicals for votes while not delivering on hardy any of the promises (such as to overturn Roe v. Wade) because the GOPers are nothing if shrewd political operators. They understood that keeping issues like Roe a dog perpetually chasing a car drives out their base while not upsetting moderates who don't ACTUALLY believe that Republicans would do something like overturn Roe. This allowed them to sometimes play both sides of the fence while attempting to always make the Democrats look like extremists (as always). The GOPers used this, along with a number of other wedge issues to finally break through the permanent Democratic majorities in Congress. The strategy was working.
In the late 1970s/early 1980s, the GOPers, tired of permananet Democratic majorities in Congress, and reeling off of helping to perpetuate the greatest Presidential scandal in history, felt their power seriously starting to fade. They were concerned that they could be relegated to permanent minority party status, so they made a deal with the devil and brought the evangelical psychos into the fold. The GOPers promised to fight their culture war for them, despite largely having no interest in any of these issues themselves other than to make money off of them (i.e. the drug war). In exchange the evangelical leaders would create an army of Republican voters (the rubes) who would lower the taxes of the GOPers and help them to destroy safeguards for the working and middle classes while being largely working and middle class members themselves.
The rubes are the rank and file voters (non-business class who vote Republican almost purely because of "taxes"), who at this point are largely "culture warriors." These types are typically evangelical Christians.
This was around the time the "tea party" started happening (even if a lot of that was astroturfed by right wing Libertarian billionaires). This was the point that the rubes basically started seizing power from the GOPers and electing their own guys into office, who not only spouted the bullshit propaganda lies like the GOPers did, they actually believed this shit.
With the way the GOP media ecosystem operates and the fact their base seems drawn to unrepentant liars, assholes, and idiots, I'm half expecting this whole fiasco to turn into this guy becoming their next "shining star".
Do you really believe that they couldn't find a journalist who wanted to break the "congressional candidate is lying about their whole life, basically" story?
