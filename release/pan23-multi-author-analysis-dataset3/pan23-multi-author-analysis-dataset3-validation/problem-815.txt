Thanks for the reply, you raise some good thoughts. I will say the disability is mental rather than physical. That probably makes this case a bit trickier than most, but the bottom line is WFH is very accommodating. I feel like with my proposal, both sides compromise a little and they're still getting pretty much exactly what they want.
You mentioned challenging what they believe is reasonable, and that is what's happening here. Let's say the one part of my job that I must do in the office is count beans (obviously not what it actually is). Throughout my 10+ years of employment, I've never needed to count beans more than once, or on rare occasions twice a month, yet now all of a sudden they're trying to say I'll be needing to count beans twice a week going forward. That is pretty damn sketchy IMO, and I very much question whether this was truly in the cards all along as opposed to some form of retaliation towards my request. Even so, I feel the compromising solution should work for both sides: if I truly do need to start counting beans significantly more often, they have nothing to worry about. But if that's not the case- which is what I strongly suspect- then I'll have the WFH option for one of the two days.
Good point about driving in. I suppose I can instead just say coming in adversely affects my disability instead, though I also want to be fair to the employer and what they want to do, hence why I'm compromising from what my desired plan was moving forward. If they ask why, I can point back to the reasoning behind the accommodation in the first place: it would mean not working from home, which is how my doctor has indicated the disability can be managed.
It might be helpful to understand how the accommodation is intended to benefit you, as itâ€™s a bit confusing that you can work from the office when needed but still need an accommodation.
