Not in this case. Due to another Colorado law, the shooter's records were sealed and would not have raised any 'red flags' when he bought the gun. The point OP is making has nothing to do with the recent shooting.
Completely agree that he should have had his guns taken away, but I don't think that should be up to the sheriff to decide. In fact in this specific example the request to seize would have been denied by a court, due to the records of this guy being sealed when the case against him was dismissed. It's a tough balance. The law doesn't want to ruin someone's future over dismissed charges, but we still need to keep a record of past behavior.
A prosecutor noting the family doesn’t want to press charges still has time to trigger the red flag law if they deem it appropriate.
I believe that either a third party or the police could have potentially requested to trigger the red flag law which would have initiated the seizure of any firearms the suspect had access to and put him on the radar of local police. Those laws could have only prevented the suspect from having access to guns for a couple of weeks, but judges can extend those seizures in six month intervals.
So the shooter has prior crimes - including those which warranted gun restrictions - and it did not prevent him from possessing a gun. And the answer is more gun laws? I understand the kidnapping charges followed tweets by GOP Congress members criticizing kids….
