My husband anticipates my ex-husband will just cross his arms and refuse to budge, but we have medical evidence to back up our claim. My husband says we should skip mediation entirely.
At the time of our separation, I was making very little money and he held it up in court as much as he could to make me capitulate early on.
So just to be clear, it makes more sense for our child to transport expensive and potentially dangerous medicine a block down the road to the school and have them administer it to her as opposed to her walking 100 yards home where I can give it to her and have her dad pick her up at 3:05 PM?
It makes sense logically to me that you would transport the medication to your child's school on Fridays since it's an expensive/dangerous and temperature sensitive medicine. And, since you want to make sure the medication is administered to your child, the school nurse will be obligated to do so AND keep a record of it for you. That takes the issue altogether away from your ex, who can then pick up his daughter at 3pm sharp.
Besides talking to your lawyer about modification to your agreement to say 5pm, what does the school say about their ability to store your child's medicines?
Is it more paperwork for the school? Probably. Might it be worth it to avoid all the headache with your ex? I don't know, that's up to you.
Custody arguments bring a lot of hard feelings back up. The welfare of your child is the priority. I was suggesting an alternative option than having a potentially long and drawn out battle with a court because you don't trust your ex-husband to administer medication. I am only going by what is said here.
