Most Americans have never left the USA. They have little clue about foreign societies. They also think that America is superior to everywhere else. This is a big part of why American leads the world in gun violence.
Your countries leading cause of death for children is firearms. How absolutely delusional and heartless can you be to think that trying to reduce the amount of available firearms isnt even worth trying.
As a firearm enthusiast and father of young kids, I agree it is extremely irresponsible and you shouldn’t likely own guns if you don’t have a safe. I believe your child commits a crime with your gun, you should get charged with everything they do plus several charges for them being able to. I think that’s how all gun laws should be. Extremely harsh sentences for crimes committed with guns or for prohibited people possessing them.
I live in the south, and the pediatricians AND the public schools ask the same thing. It’s worded a little different but the point is to make sure they’re kept inaccessible from children.
I have a hard time with them asking if you do own a gun. I’d much rather them just say, reminder - it is a crime to have guns accessible to children. Regardless of opinions, it’s currently illegal and unconstitutional for the government to create a gun registry. The are doing so, in many different areas, and it’s blatant, common knowledge - not some conspiracy theory.
