During the War of Independence, Mustafa Kemal promised the Kurds an autonomous Kurdistan and 1921 Constitution is a clear indicator that the Kurdish autonomy was accepted by the parliament. However, there were some anti-Ankara Kurds rebelled in regions such as Sivas (Koçgiri Rebellion is the most known one). Things got changed after the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. The 1924 Constitution was a U-turn in the Turkish discourse and amendments related to autonomy was ommitted. The Kurds were in fear of facing the same fate of Armenians and rebelled against the Ankara goverment. There were already small rebellions in some Kurdish cities yet in 1925 the biggest one - Sheikh Said Rebellion - erupted mainly in surroundings of Diyarbakır.
Yet, the series of Kurdish rebellions continued and the second one erupted in 1927 - as it is known Ararat Rebellion. I'm not gonna make detailed explanations but Zilan Massacre in 1930 is the most notorious one during those days. The estimated number according to a German newspaper was 4.500 civilians.
They use more or less same discourse for almost every massacre. Their main idea is that Turkey was a newly founded republic and the Kurds were provoked by imperialists - mainly Brits, therefore the state officials ordered fierce attacks for the survival of the young republic.".
E.g. Kastamonu Deputy Yusuf Kemal said in the Turkish Grand National Assembly, "The health of the Turks must be protected". Upon this statement, Sivas Deputy Emir Pasha took the podium and reminded that "not only Turks live in this homeland". At this stage, Mustafa Kemal stepped in and emphasized that "The Assembly is not only made up of Turks, but also Circassians, Kurds, Laz, and their interests are common".
in the telegram he sent to Kazım Karabekir Pasha, he says "To unite the Kurds and even the whole nation as brothers and show this to the world.
