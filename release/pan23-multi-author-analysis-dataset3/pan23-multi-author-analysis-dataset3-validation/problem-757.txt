The far-right Freedom Caucus is holding out for some magic unicorn speaker candidate who would be acceptable to the entire House Republican Caucus but isn't McCarthy.
A few more moderate House Republicans start talking to the Dems about a bipartisan vote for a unity Speaker.
McCarthy and his allies let the Freedom Caucus propose their candidates for Speaker. None of them get more than 60 votes, and the far-right candidates get less support on every ballot, until it's just the 40-odd Freedom Caucus members voting for "anybody but McCarthy.".
If McCarthy caves to the demand to let any member make a "motion to vacate the chair" whenever they want, we will probably be right back here by March after McCarthy loses the speakership.
I think that it will actually go to a floor vote on Jan 3rd, but eventually McCarthy will get the speakership.
> There are a ton of ways this saga could conclude should McCarthy come up short on the first ballot, and Biggs' announcement Tuesday makes it very likely that happens.
IMO, there's a bigger chance it happens later, if McCarthy becomes speaker but is unable to advance key legislation like a budget CR or a debt ceiling fix.
