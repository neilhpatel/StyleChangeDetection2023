This is well beyond free Internet legal advice. Your cousin needs a divorce lawyer, and her husband needs an immigration lawyer.
For her marriage, she needs a competent family law attorney. Her husband cannot refuse her a divorce. Depending on her state, she will need to meet specific criteria, which usually involves living separately for a given period (1 year+). A capable attorney will represent her interests in court, and even if her husband isn't cooperative, obtain a divorce.
If she's being abused, your cousin should reach out to a local domestic violence shelter or hotline. You don't say where she is located, but a local shelter will be able to put her in touch with resources to assist her, including contacts in the legal profession, therapists, and more.
Also calling the state's bar association and asking for referrals to lawyers who specialize in stuff like this might help her.
In my state (and others) there are legal aid clinics through the county if your cousin cannot afford a lawyer. If she attends one she might be able to receive some advice.
