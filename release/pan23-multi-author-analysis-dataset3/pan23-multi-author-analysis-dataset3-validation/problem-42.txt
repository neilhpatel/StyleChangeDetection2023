Yes you can. Most national football associations are more corrupt, which is how they're all so easily bribed.
FIFA on the other hand, are corruption. They are made by it, they exude it, they smell of it, every room they walk into is tainted by their greasy fat fingers sneaking their way into pockets. They don't care. They're FIFA, essentially the 'owners' of the most popular game in the history of the planet. What are you gonna do, not watch football? Not play? Not buy jerseys, or tickets, or pints in a pub that has Sky Sports?\ Cause in some way, those aforementioned greasy fingers get a cut of all of that, because of how the sports world is set up.
The way I see it is the Olympics have a lot of corruption in the system, but in a lot of cases they are looking to stamp it out. It's not excusable but the organisation is inherently vulnerable to bribes and back slapping, and they've rightly taken the organisation of boxing away from amateur boxing's international body because they were just completely taking the piss with it.
You can't really buy an Olympics as far we I know. Obviously you need vast amounts of money to bother applying in the first place, but it's still down to the strenh of your application.
It's been known for more than a decade now the World Cup is just for open sale. They just can't say that, but they put so little effort into hiding it, it's insulting. Qatar is spending more money on this WC than the combined cost of every single other one since it was first held.
