Nevada Senate - CMM trails by almost exactly 9,000 votes, but the expected margin of the remaining ballots should put her comfortably ahead. She is relatively likely to gain the lead in the next batch of ballots from Clark County and if she does, she isn’t going to lose it again. 75-80% chance of beating Laxalt at this point.
Nevada Governor - Lombardo has a comfortable three point lead, and while the remaining votes absolutely can push Sisolak over the top, it’s a much harder climb than it is in the Senate race. 40-50% chance Dems pull this out.
For the Dems to gain a majority, they must flip 4 of them. CA-41, CA-22, CA-13 and AZ-6 (unlikely I am told) seem to be the safest bet.
In the House, Dems have a clear path to a majority via AZ-01, AZ-06, CA-13, CA-22, CA-41, WA-03, each of which they have at least even odds to win, w/ a backup in CA-27. It'll be close.
All these takes about Trump going away are extremely delusional. He will almost certainly be their nominee because he has a tight grip on his base. I think losing 2024 might finally break the camel’s back though.
