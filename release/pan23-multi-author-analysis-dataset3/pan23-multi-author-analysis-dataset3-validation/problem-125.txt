Why isn't the media calling out this garbage framing? Congress passes the budget. This idea that McCarthy could or should be negotiating "with Biden" is a gross misunderstanding of the legislative process.
Set aside how Biden/the Democrats shouldn't negotiate with the Republicans at all for a second. How do you negotiate with people who don't even know what they want? How does McCarthy expect Biden to "compromise" with "I don't know what we want"? It's impossible.
This is what gets me. McCarthy and the Republicans are demanding that Biden agree to their demands or they'll blow up the economy. Only they haven't decided what their demands are just yet and don't really feel like coming up with some. Instead, they want Biden and the Democrats to start cutting programs until the House Republicans declare it good enough.
Biden can agree to cuts-- specifically, offer to cancel all federal programs in districts represented by Republicans.
How about: Biden does not legislate at all, so House Republicans can make all the cuts they want to. Biden can only sign or veto, unless McCarthy gives him line item authority.
Isn't that sweet of him It's the usual Republican deal: they'll increase military spending off-budget, direct-to-deficit as a jobs program and no questions asked money dump into the moocher States, along with tax reductions for the rich. And in return Democrats can cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and end Obamacare. What a nice compromise.
