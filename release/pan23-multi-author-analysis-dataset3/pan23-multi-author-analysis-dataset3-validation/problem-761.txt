Can you elaborate on how the HOA could punish OP for an individual who is not a guest of their residence, or invited in any way? If the HOA had an issue would it not be between the police and the individual loitering?
If instead he is on the public street or sidewalk, then that would not be your responsibility, and if anyone can have him removed it would be the HOA.
If the situation is that he is actually on your property, then I believe it is your responsibility to be taking steps to remove him. I disagree with the others here saying he's not your guest. If he's on your property and you are not seeking to have him trespassed, then you are tacitly approving of his presence.
In that case, others are right, he's not your responsibility. They have as much power as you do to call the cops and see if this might arise to a public nuisance.
If that is the case, you should be contacting the police each time there is a trespass, and possibly seek a restraining order.
What exactly do you mean by outside of your house? Is he sitting on your front stoop? Camping on your front lawn? Parked in the driveway? Parked on the public street in front of your house?
Is that a public street? Or does the HOA own the streets in your development? If it's the latter, the HOA could theoretically have him trespassed from their property.
That being said, if heâ€™s a part owner then they can take action against you both collectively if he is breaking the HOA rules in some way. If he is not, then they have no action that can be taken unless you are providing him access by way of a gate or something.
