Take that line item on my check stub that says "UnitedHealthcare", change it to say "Medicare for All", and lob off 10-15%. I know we can't knock off all of the profits and costs currently going to the industry, but that chunk taken away will be nice. Boom, Medicare for everyone and it's sustainable.
Social Security is a payroll tax on wages. 6.2% from our employers, which is part of our compensation, and 6.2% from us, so we don't end up in the streets when we're 80 years old.
The GOP wants to give employers a 6.2% payroll tax break and hand over our 6.2% to Wall Street, ya know, like our volatile 401k's, which have been a blast to watch these last few years. The entire fucking point of Social Security is to keep it completely firewalled off from Wall Street.
And yup, changing that label from "UnitedHealthCare" to "Medicare for All" would change the line item from being the highest chunk taken out of our paychecks to the highest tax increase in history. Nothing but a fuggin' reclass. And it would be a great thing!
Oh great. I'm so happy to be alive during this time where I don't have massive amounts of fuck you money to combat all this bullshit. Instead, I go to work and come home all while watching my future decay before my eyes because these greedy fucks want more money.
The American govt is an absolute failure. Founders counted too much on people with honor and integrity being in govt, instead of a bunch of worthless, spineless, dickless, hopeless sacks of monkey shit. That goes for Dems too, gods damned cowards most of the time "can't upset the status quo" bullshit and just as beholden to their corporate "donors" (more like fucking sugar daddies).
