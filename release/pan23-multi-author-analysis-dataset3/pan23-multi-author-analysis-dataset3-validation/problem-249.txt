I can name multiple countries in different continents that are worse than Russia. If illegal war is what makes a country terrible, then the US sits atop that list. How many civilians died in Iraq as a result of the American occupation? Over a million.
The fact that this Ukraine war is a war between Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs for control of Ukraine is lost in the west. The poor men of Ukraine and Russia are dying all for the egotistical competition between these Russian and Ukrainian mafioso's. The best outcome is peace on whatever terms necessary. Unfortunately the hard reality is that Ukraine must lose for that to happen.
To describe the current war in Ukraine as a genocide is frankly moronic when you compare it to previous examples.
- large-scale genocide (in Africa you have to go back some time, same applies to Russia but shit still checks out).
Virtually every major country has committed a genocide in it's history. The British, the Japanese, Chinese, Americans, Germans, Dutch, etc.
