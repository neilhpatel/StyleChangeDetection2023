Literally millions of Chinese are employed at less than a dollar an hour to do nothing but comment, post, share, and influence online rhetoric around China](.
I'm not talking about the user, I'm talking about the literal China Daily staged footage that was Orchestrated by the Central Propaganda department.
It was literally staged footage, first posted by China Daily, while all media is state controlled, China Daily is literally run by the Central Propaganda department, state controlled and propaganda party controlled are very different, feel free to google it.
I'm not talking about the reddit account that posted it, I mean the actual footage is staged footage from China Daily, literally a news source that is owned and operated by the Central Propaganda department.
If they had a large presence on Reddit, we wouldn't see anti-Chinese posts hit the front page of key subreddits near-daily, nor the sheer number of anti-Chinese comments, misinformation and lies being spread about them all over Reddit.
Just like this article, this tabloid back then found some social media post from an internet user and then wrote an article as if it China's government did that.
Dude I know China Daily, I’ve lived in China, I read Chinese and trust me I know it is a huge propaganda outlet for the Chinese government.
But sure, I guess anything remotely positive about China or people in China must be fake and must be propaganda /s.
Being propaganda outlet doesn’t mean it’s fake. It means they have a strong bias and most likely only be showing you one side of the story.
But there are no problem when such fake footage portrays things according to their confirmation bias, such as this:
But my point is what they tend to do is selectively show you news, instead of downright faking news.
