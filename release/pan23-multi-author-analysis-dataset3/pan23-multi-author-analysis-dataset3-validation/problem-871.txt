The exceptions are 1) death caused by gross negligence or 2) where an injury was "substantially certain" to occur under the circumstances.
You should help to make sure she goes as soon as possible. This is a potentially serious medical issue, and if it's triggered by 80 degree temperatures, she could be in serious danger living in Houston in the summer.
There was no death here, so 1 isn't applicable. For 2, she'd have to show that 80 degree temperatures mean that injuries are substantially certain to occur. 80 degree temperatures may be uncomfortable, but I can't see any reasonable argument that such temperatures are certain to cause employee injuries.
Workers' compensation is the exclusive remedy for employment-related injuries in Texas, with very narrow exceptions. "Exclusive remedy" means that the only thing an employee can recover is through workers' compensation, and that a direct suit against an employer isn't allowed.
Unless you can show gross negligence or intentional harm, holds that a worker's compensation claim is the sole and exclusive remedy for injuries caused at work.
As a general rule workers compensation is the exclusive remedy for injuries suffered on the job. To have a viable lawsuit outside of the workers compensation laws you must show that the employer's actions which resulted in your injury were reckless or intentional. Given that the temperature was only in the 80s it is hard to see how you would make that case. Feel free to consult with a local employment law attorney, but at first blush this doesn't appear to be something that would give rise to a successful lawsuit.
