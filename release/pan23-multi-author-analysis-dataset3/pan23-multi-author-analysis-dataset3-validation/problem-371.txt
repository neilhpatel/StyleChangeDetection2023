Sweden's & Finland's problems are almost entirely due to Erdoğan's crusade against the Kurds (plus Orbán's almost-reflexive impulse to back a would-be strongman wherever he finds one, I guess), which I don't think is applicable to Ukraine.
I mean, that's a perfectly understandable reflex: I'm certainly not going to tell the Magyarok how to live their lives, but I tend to think everyone (including and especially everyone in Hungary) would be better off if they followed your example.
It makes sense, if you think about it: Article V means that any war engaged by a candidate nation would effectively become a world war once that candidate achieves membership, and kind of the whole point of NATO is the deterrence.
Furthermore, signing the alliance is tantamount to a declaration of war .. meaning article 5 would be void should Russia decide to take you up on that offer because you would be the aggressor.
They all do, but they also all realise that accepting a country that is being invaded would mean article 5 is triggered immediately, and then you’re suddenly at war with Russia. Whether Ukraine’s territory is disputed or not among NATO members then is hardly relevant.
Give me one example of a NATO member state, part of whose territory has been occupied.. Ukraine had pro western government since 2014 and still didn't become a member because Crimea had been occupied..
Easier said than done and the first prerequisite for NATO to even consider Ukraine membership is that Ukraine have full control of its territory including Crimea and that doesn't seem likely anytime soon.. right now some more of their territories are also under Russian control, so the war has to end.. Russia has to give up Crimea which it has held since 2014 but Russia knows doing so will enable Ukraine to get nato membership.
That requirement does exist alright, you can deny it all you want but there's absolutely no precedent for a Country being admitted in NATO whose territory has been occupied..
