As long as the modification/extension was countersigned by both parties [physically or electronically] (and keep multiple copies backed up in different places -- preferably online and offline), absent some unusual clause in the lease, you have a lease through 7/31/22.
They're welcome to try to buy you out of the lease, or sell the property with you as a tenant, but they can't unilaterally end the lease or pretend the renewal didn't happen.
You can also discuss options for the current landlord or new owner to buy out the remainder of your lease.
The landlord choosing to sell the property is of no concern to you, other than the occasional inconvenience of having to show the property. Once the property is sold you will pay rent to the new owner/landlord.
You almost certainly have a lease through next July. I'd suggest you reach out to the landlord, explain that you accepted the offered lease and will be staying through the full term.
As others have stated, it sounds like you have a valid lease extension. I would strongly suggest making copies of the renewal acceptance letter that is in the portal. If the LL\management company really want to get you out, they could pull that letter or lock you out the portal and then claim that there was never a lease renewal or that they never accepted your lease renewal (because the renewal was sent it error).
