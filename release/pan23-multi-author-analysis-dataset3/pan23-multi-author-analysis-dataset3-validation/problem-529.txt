Fist you have to ask will you ever come back to the US? If yes maintain your state residency just file a foreign address. They have the option for this on their licensing website. You have to be a resident before you go though and intend to come back to that specific state afterwards.
Otherwise if none of that works the best thing to do is contact your embassy/consulate once you arrive in your new country/is and they will work directly with you to help you get your tax status etc in order.
Second, if you don't intend to come back but don't want to give up your citizenship then let your state residency go and file on the state department page for what's called a "registration with a foreign address." You will keep your US citizenship and only owe federal taxes on money earned over a certain amount.
Additionally by registering a foreign address your passport etc will be shipped to that address although you might have to go to the embassy to get it renewed.
You can renew your passport at the us embassy in the country you are in and you can use your foreign address it doesnâ€™t need to be tied to a IS state. If you are giving up your overseas residency entirely you will likely not be able to maintain a US drivers license. You will need to continue filing federal tax for as long as you are a US citizen. You can file using an overseas address. You may need to continue filing state tax for the last state you were registered in depending on the state. You should be able to continue to vote in the last state you lived in via absentee voting.

If you're going to work abroad, you should check what their tax agreement is with the US. Sometimes you have to pay US tax, sometimes you pay the other country's tax. If you have to pay taxes in the US, renew passport, DL, or do anything official for that matter, you will need an address. If you believe you will not need any of those things, you don't need an address.
