They're quite ready to move on now that they got what they wanted. If Kosovo was still a part of Serbia, they wouldn't be sitting on their asses quietly.
Nope, Albanians are equaly nationalistic and clashes on Kosovo are going both ways. Not to mention the tensions that have nothing to do with Serbs, like Bosniaks-Croats tensions or anything regarding Macedonia.
It would be better just to a degree, you would still have Albanians, Croats, Bosniaks, Greeks, Turks, Macedonians... with their own nationalist ways of thinking and denial bs. But hopefully we would solve that problems in decades that are to come.
Yeah well from my experience, more Croats denounce Ustaše (even a lot of those Croats who are nationalists), but those who like Ustaše (and there is a hefty number of them) are one of the most batshit delusional people in the Balkans (and thats a hard thing to accomplish lol).
Croats had absolutely worst nationalist movement in history of west Balkans (maybe even Balkans in general), im refering to Ustaše ofc. However, i feel that precisely because of that fact (and the fact that they are in EU) that Croats became a bit less nationalistic and that most Croats condemn Ustaše and reject them because there is no possible way to defend them. Nationalism is still really strong among Croats (some are even proud of Ustaše) but it became a bit less prevalent than Albanian and Serb nationalism.
Idk how it is with Bellarusians but i as a Serb i can say Serbs and Albanians are most nationalistc people in Balkans, an extremely nationalistic region. Altho Serb nationalism is and was more dangerous than Albanian simply because Serbia is much stronger and more influential and that was especially true in last century, so Serbs usualy could use more force than Albanians through history.
Also, Serbia being a dick to its neighbors in no way comparable colonialism---the Serbs may well be obsessed with anything anyone ever did to them in the 14th century, but they were committing genocide as recently as, like, Season 5 of Friends. It's vapid and facile to sort the world into "oppressors" and "victims". And doubly so when dealing with a culture that defines itself by exaggerating its own victimhood.
