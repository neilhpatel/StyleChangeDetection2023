In the 1720 edition of "An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft: With Observations Upon Matters of Fact; Tending to Clear the Texts of the Sacred Scriptures and Confute the Vulgar Errors about that Point" one Dr. Hutchinson, an Anglican cleric in England, lists historical witch trials in Europe (and, in this "new" third edition includes the trials of Salem as, of course, news was slow to travel). He categorically refutes the validity of all of them by the logic of saying essentially that witchcraft obviously isn't real and so these trials are all shams. He claims many of the waves of trials were encouraged at first by Catholics as other churches splintered off and then by those new churches as further factioning occurred since it would be a sin to simply murder adherents to new religions since they were after all still christian, but claiming them witches created a loophole. Further trials were then just accepted as the norm and so individuals would use them for personal gain or spite against their neighbors. He then refutes each trial on a case by case basis according to what he thinks likely happened.
I don't have the in depth knowledge for a top level reply but I figure both /u/ and OP might appreciate a work not referenced here and not perfectly contemporaneous to the Salem trials but written not too long after.
Have you read anything on how those living in Connecticut reacted to the trials given that the Connecticut witch trials predated Salem by roughly 30 years?
Salem was a really late witch trial, and happened after most of the witch panic had already subsided... Learning about it, it seems that folks like Martha Corey, and Rebecca Nurse knew witchcraft itself was BS, beyond the false nature of the accusation against their person, thoughts?
Follow-up question if you don't mind - modern pop understanding paints the Salem Witch Trials as an exercise in misogyny, but you mentioned that men were also accused. Is it fair to say that the Salem Witch Trials were rooted in misogyny? How many women vs men were accused and killed?
