Title: Facebook won't delete multiple Grandma's accounts and scammer hacked one of those accounts and is impersonating her.
This is unclear, are they actually your grandma's accounts, or are they accounts a scammer created? If they're your grandma's accounts that a scammer "hacked," she should contact FB to establish her identity and have them closed. FB will often establish identity by requesting a photo of an individual's drivers license/state ID.
Might I ask for what purpose the scammer is doing this? What are they getting out of it? Does your grandmother have payment information stored on FB? If so, she should contact her bank/creditor and have new cards issued. If she doesn't do this, the scammer may be able to make purchases from her FB.
You should inform family and friends that someone is impersonating your grandma and that no account should be trusted except whatever account she actually uses and has control of. Any weird activity or requests should be discounted and your grandmother should be contacted directly if they are concerned. If the account uses photos, the individuals who took the photos hold the copyright and can issue DMCA takedown requests to have them removed. This may make it more difficult for them to impersonate her.
...The scammer probably gained access to her account through social engineering, so you might try helping your grandmother regain control of the email address used to create her account(s) and then take them back. If you do so, you'll want to scrub the email address for unauthorized backup email addresses or other suspicious activity and activate 2 factor authentication for FB going forward. Really I'd just change the email address associated with the FB account all together.
