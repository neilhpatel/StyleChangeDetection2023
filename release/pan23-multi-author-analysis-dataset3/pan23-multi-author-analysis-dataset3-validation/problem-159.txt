You're not adding any relevant information here. There is nothing for you to do until you talk to your disability and make an effort to agree on a reasonable accommodation with the school.
As others have recommended, you need to have a friendly conversation with disability services. Come prepared with your medical documentation that supports your requests and be able to explain what your accommodation needs are in order to appropriately access your course material/learning environment. Threatening them will get you nowhere. Keep an open mind to their suggestions and remember they are there to help you. The more pleasant and informative you are about your specific needs, the more they will be able to address them.
What is deemed "reasonable" is not determined by the student. It is based on the infrastructure of the system and the feasibility and/or financial impact of the accommodation. Accommodations also do not need to be what is preferred by the student. There are a few disabilities (e.g. hearing) where preference is in fact important, but in most cases it does not need to be what the student perceives as the "best" accommodation possible.
