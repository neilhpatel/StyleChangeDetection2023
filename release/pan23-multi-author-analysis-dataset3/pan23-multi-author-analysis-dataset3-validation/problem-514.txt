Define conservative, that’s a pretty fucking broad term. Could mean anything from right of centre to deregulated free market hellscape. Why am I “conservative”? Because they represent my values and opinions better than progressives, they also have a far better understanding of the economy.
Ignore the idiots saying it’s not. It 100% is a shit show in Brazil rn. There was a 0.9% difference in votes between them. Honestly I think it’s more divisive than the trump elections were.
Well I suppose we’ll have to agree to disagree on that. Lula is one of the most corrupt politicians to ever live and I will not be surprised at any assassination attempts or successful ones against him once he drives Brasil into the ground again.
Both can be terrible, and pretending that the guy who was in charge of Brazil’s two largest corruption scandals is anything good, just fuels the opposition.
He robbed Brazil during covid crisis in ways that we may never know, once he did everything to stop every investigations!
But you act like Bolsonaro didn't request $1 for every COVID-19 shot to Pfizer among other horrible corruption crimes. Bolsonaro is built differently.
