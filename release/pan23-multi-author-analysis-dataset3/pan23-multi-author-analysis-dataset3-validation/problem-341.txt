From all the historical bubbles you’ve studied, what were some qualitative and quantitive commonalities in most (if not all) of them? Do you see the same symptoms in today’s world?
Do I see the same symptoms in today's world? YES. Interest rates are low, economies are loaded up with debt, and the internet makes everything much easier to buy, sell, and speculate in.
2. Marketability - assets are easy to buy and sell. Most bubbles are preceded by sudden increases in marketability, such as the conversion of untradeable debt into tradeable equity in 1720, or the use of mortgage-backed securities in the 2000s.
Second question: In your research, did the asset bubbles typically require government action or intervention like the 2008 mortgage crisis?
I wanted to ask how different regulatory regimes responded to the various bubbles that burst over history and did any of them make quantifiable improvement in avoiding such scenarios from occurring again? Or is a financial bubble, by its very nature, unavoidable from a regulatory standpoint?
The government makes the rules for the financial sector, and any financial crisis could have been prevented by different/better rules. So in that sense it's true.
I've heard that they did. Quite possibly they got into airplanes because the bicycle boom crash - that's how Riley and Rover got into cars. I don't know, though. The American bicycle boom around the same time wasn't part of the project - that's another PhD for someone else to do!
