"The ACA is what Republicans came up with to save healthcare after the travesty that is Obamacare failed as soon as it was signed. Expanding ACA and repealing Obamacare is what needs to happen.".
Obama instituting Romneycare instead of the plan he campaigned on was Democrats acquiescing on negotiations that never really happened, and is really just a monument to their failure to adapt to the modern "scorched Earth" Republican party. Something they still struggle with.
Republicans just didn't want a Democrat President to have any success with legislation Republicans had a hand in.
Because they feel Democrats didn't deliver on promises they opt to vote for the party that actively opposed those promises instead.
Dems tried to negotiate with Republicans, and then when that failed, they shifted to a Democrat only bill.
Look, if you told these folks that these were all republican ideas and that democrats were opposed to them, they would vote for them. The whole us vs them mentality has become so entrenched, that most voters will reflexively vote for their "side" instead of looking closely at the actual platform. I think you'll find most people are largely supportive of what could be called "socialist" ideas, but if it isn't framed right and the right mouthpiece tells them it's a ploy to steal their freedom and identity, then they'll vote against their own interest. The 24/7 news cycle and social media amplify this message loudly enough, that the average uninformed working their ass off at 2 jobs barely scrapping by voter will believe that the opposition to these ideas is much bigger and has more support than it does. And the hardwired desire to be in the group will cause people to vote in opposition to the very things that would help them the most because they mistakenly believe that a loss will benefit their side in a sort of scoreboard mentality. Our side won, your side lost but the reality is both sides in terms of the voters lost and the oligarchs that run our country win every time.
