Which appears to be the case here, since entry was done when the landlord believed there was a fire in the dwelling and personally authorized the fire department's entry.
The only instance you know of the neighbor entering your apartment involved letting the fire department in. Since the fire department was responding to what was presumably an emergency situation, proper notice isn't required. Unless you can prove that your neighbor entered your apartment other times without notice, there's not much you are going to be able to do aside from moving out when your lease is up.
If your landlord was the one who gave permission for the neighbour to allow entry for the fire department into your apartment, then unfortunately there is no legal grounds to bring a case against anyone. The alternative would've been to let your house and your possessions burn down.
The landlord can exercise the right to have a someone hold a key on their behalf. In the extremely unlikely case of an emergency, the landlord may want someone who can access the property. However as per your lease agreement your neighbour cannot enter your property without giving prior written notice and without your express consent.
If the neighbour has harassed you in any way you could if there is sufficient evidence be able to get a court order to stop her from trespassing or approaching you but you'd need the evidence to support that as you can't get a restraining order without having to move.
