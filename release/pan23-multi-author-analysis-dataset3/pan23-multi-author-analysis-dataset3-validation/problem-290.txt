Also, start making a list of all the items you own. There's a great comment on Reddit somewhere from an insurance adjuster who recommends listing exact brands e.g. "LG microwave model xyz" instead of "microwave" because if you just list "microwave", insurance will pull up the cheapest option.
Yeah, this could definitely be an issue. I would just leave it up to the insurance company to investigate and decide if they want to go after the apartment owners.
Just relay the facts as they happened: You were steaming shirts with a handheld steamer 8 ft away from the sprinkler when they activated. You have photos of the sprinkler from before if insurance would like to look at them. You do not need to tell them that you think steaming set it off, that the room wasn't ventilated, that they probably went off because the plate was missing, etc.
If you were releasing a great deal of heat under one it may not have been a malfunction. In such a case you may have a much harder time proving that someone else was at fault.
