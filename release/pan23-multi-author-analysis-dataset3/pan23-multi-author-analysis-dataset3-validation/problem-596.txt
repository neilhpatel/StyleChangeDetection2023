Thanks, essentially I wrote a formal letter and in the language insinuated that my desire was to remain with the company if they were able to review my current salary and provide a salary increase. My Director called me and asked what my target salary was. He then said he'd call the CFO, later that evening he texted me and said he got me my target salary approved by the CFO but it would become effective 7/1/21.
Or perhaps he got it approved by the CFO but Director now regrets giving you the raise and wants to cut salary in his department, so he's revoking the raise and blaming the CFO.
Is it possible your Director isn't being truthful when he says the CFO approved this or that the CEO is now saying he/she doesn't have the authority?
His story of "(1) CFO approved your raise and (2) CFO now says he lacks authority to give you the raise" really makes the CFO look bad and perhaps the CFO would disagree that 1 or 2 or both ever happened and would not be pleased that the Director invokes the CFO's name when making promises and when reneging on promises.
So the rumor is the CFO will not be with the company much longer....our new President has supposedly stripped him of some decision making ability due to poor performance, which from my perspective makes sense as some major financial decisions made over the course of the past year have not panned out well for him including a disastrous attempt at offshore outsourcing our Admin staff work.
