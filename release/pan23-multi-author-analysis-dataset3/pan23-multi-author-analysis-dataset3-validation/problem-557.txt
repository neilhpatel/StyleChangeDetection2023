Thanks for your response! It was exactly what I was looking for. I got the impression for most of this from other answers I've read on this sub, mainly that the term "Celtic" is a contentious one nowadays.
So I hope that settles the question of why modern Irish people may choose to identify as Celts. It's more often members of the diaspora who lean into pan-Celticism rather than people living in Ireland, but it nevertheless remains a potent relic of imperial ideology and its counterpart, nationalism.
An ethnic identity based on pan-Celticism, which is rooted in romanticism; this identity has been projected backwards onto medieval "Celtic" peoples (i.e. people who spoke Celtic languages).
Do we know that there were people there that didn't speak Celtic languages (and how)? Do we know when the Celtic languages showed up (like, we aren't talking about Neanderthals or some other hominid when we're talking pre-Celtic)?
We don't know what language was spoken in Ireland before Primitive Irish (also known as Archaic Irish). Primitive Irish is the earliest known form of Goidelic languages. Fragments of this language are attested in ogham inscriptions. Presumably before Primitive Irish became its own branch of the Celtic language family, they spoke a less differentiated form of Celtic or proto-Celtic. But before the Celts came (see my above answer for our lack of understanding on what that even entailed), we have no idea what language was spoken in Ireland. It's some non-indo-European language which doesn't survive. There are probably a few place-names that carry over words from this pre-Celtic stratum; major rivers are the usual suspect. I don't know any examples off the top of my head but I know I've read stuff about Scottish placenames before where it was suspected the root name of the river was pre-Celtic.
I'm not sure where you got the idea "Ancient Irish people were never Celtic" and that modern Irish people "shouldn't" identify as Celts. The term Celtic is one that has been ascribed to many different meanings and ideas over the years. However, at its core it just refers to people who speak languages from the Celtic language family, a branch of Indo-European. At one time there were speakers of Celtic languages in much of western Europe. By the Middle Ages, though, these languages were limited to Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man, Wales, Brittany and Cornwall. Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh and Breton are still spoken by minority populations in these regions. Cornish went exctinct but has been revived with limited success in Cornwall.
