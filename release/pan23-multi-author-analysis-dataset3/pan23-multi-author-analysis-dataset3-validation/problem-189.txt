That's what he was trained to do as KGB. I'm a bit dumbfounded Bennett legitimately thought he got through to him. Though Russia could stop Israel in Syria, momentarily, he knows that his card and some concessions there buys the Israelis from overt assistance to Ukraine too. I'm sure after they tried and failed repeatedly at that point to kill Zelensky it was easy to pay lip service to that...
He would never kill Zelensky, those Russian born assassins sent to do so had nothing to do with him /s.
Yeah, they lie about the most meaningless bullshit, there's surely no way Putin would lie about definitely not wanting to kill Zelensky. That's why they went straight for the capital city and tried to rapidly capture forward positions like Hostomel airport with paratroopers which is just on the outskirts of Kyiv.
Only after they failed, they started to push these alternative reality narratives. Only truly naive people believe this.
Entire point was to decapitate the government, how that happened I think they didn't really care much about (whether they flee, get killed or get captured). Same government they branded as neo-nazis.
