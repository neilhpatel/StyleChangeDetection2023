Well, I still don’t have an answer. I have opted to ignore it until it until I receive notice via mail, phone, or see it on my credit report.
Same here, others too. I don’t consider email official, legal notice. Car2Go required a driver’s license to sign up so they have a proper mailing address. At this point, I’m writing it off as spam.
After months of email going to spam I finally received a notice from them via standard mail. Oddly still nothing showing on my credit report. I wish there was a way to contact somebody at Car2Go(ShareNow) to find out if this is truly legit. When I got to the ShareNow company the only options are for the countries they are in (no longer USA); so not sure how the heck to contact them. I was thinking of just replying in the envelope from Cedar Business Services that I've never used Car2Go and this is not my debt and I guess see where it goes.
Receiving the same e-mails from Cedars trying to collect on Car2Go balance. It's a really small amount and during my entire time with Car2Go I never had an outstanding balance. Truly odd and frustrating; I really hope they don't try to hit my credit report with this.
So according to customer support of the company that owns what's left of Car2Go, the balance is legit. However they can't tell me what the balance was for. I never received any notice from Car2Go that they were attempting to charge me.
I just got 2 HUGE notices from the same company about car2go. I’ve personally never used car2go, I’ve only rode in one once as a passenger 7 years ago. Seems like a scam because my 3 credit scores were just told to me 4 days ago when I bought a house and they were great.
