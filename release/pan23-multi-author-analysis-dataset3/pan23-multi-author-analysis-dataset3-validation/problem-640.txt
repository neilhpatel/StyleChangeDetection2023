I'm not going to bother with the legal analysis because it doesn't matter. What matters is that the infringers are in India. They won't care in the slightest that OP owns the copyright in what they plucked off the web. Enforcement is a practical impossibility by an individual in India. He would have to sue in one of the high courts, probably the Delhi high court. Indian lawyers are unbeliebably expensive - they use the solicitor/barrister approach perfected over hundreds of years by the Brits, and that approach (surprise surprise) maximizes legal fees. The average pendency of a civil lawsuit in the Delhi high court before the first decision on the merits is 14 years. It gets much longer with appeals. And money damages for past infringement are a pittance.
I don't know Finnish law or Indian law, but most copyright basics outside of the Communist countries are the same. I have managed patent litigation around the world and I'm pretty familiar with Indian law, and more importantly, Indian courts.
TLDR: OP needs to forget about the infringement, there's nothing he can do from a practical perspective.
My suggestion would be to simply do nothing since OP doesn't have any rights that are being infringed on and isn't losing any money on this.
OP still owns the actual work, even if he doesn't have a license for the IP, and can try to do a DMCA (or Indian equivalent) to get the work taken down.
