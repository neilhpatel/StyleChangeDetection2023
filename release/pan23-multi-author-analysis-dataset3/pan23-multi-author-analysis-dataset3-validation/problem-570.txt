as a German, i am in full support. i was raised to be on the lookout for Nazi resurgents, and its clear where it has happened. there is only one way to deal with Nazis, complete destruction.
the Belarussian army is like 1/3 loyal to luka... it has refused direct orders before during this conflict and the loyal part, potentially even smaller, is all thats keeping luka in power. if russia tries to take or hold Belarus, they got 1940s france x10 on their hands in terms of civilian pushback, not to mention the 2/3 of the army thatl prob insta cross the border into Ukraine, hop in their trenches n start an offensive right back from where they came.
I think Putins' initial plan was to have Belarus invade Ukraine and Russia would just help but for whatever reason Belarus has mostly stayed out of it, even with several threats and promises of assisting Russia in the invasion. Could be like you said and Belarus military wasn't having it. I truly don't understand how Putin thinks he's going to navigate this. He's lost far more than he's gained by this failed invasion. Belarus backed out, and now Putin loyalists are threatening Polish borders, whether it's all bark and no bite, it's still a threat to NATO territory.
but for a brief moment we saw how scared shitless Russia was making every attempt to try to bargain, disprove, and beg for NATO to not get involved.
At this point, I'm starting to wonder if Russia actually is trying to escalate to a nuclear war. Or Putin has gone absolutely batshit crazy, like for realz because this makes no sense. They can't even handle Ukraine, what makes Russia think pushing a NATO countries borders back would be chill or actually be feasible considering how they're handling Ukraine thus far.
I think that Medvedev is not only assuming that Russia wins in Ukraine, but that Russia will incorporate Belarus and launch their attacks on Poland from both places.
If they actually went after Poland, which would be a death sentence, they'd likely go through Belarus and use Belarus as a military boost, not like it would help any.
