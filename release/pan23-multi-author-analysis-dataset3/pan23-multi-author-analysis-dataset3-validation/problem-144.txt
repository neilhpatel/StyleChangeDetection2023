When the court was ruling on overturning Roe they imposed a very large exclusion zone in front of the court which limited the protest area to a small sidewalk over 200 feet from the very building. It limited the protest off the entire grounds to the small sidewalk opposite the Capital grounds.
I agree about disrupting proceedings, but I would argue that the citizens have delegated the right to restrict protests during proceedings for the purpose of good use of public time and funds. If abused by government the citizens should be able to restrict its government from preventing it from peacefully protesting anywhere.
That kind of overkill encourages even harsher laws for protests outside of courtrooms which are demonstrated in the comment.
And none of what you’re talking about here involves courtroom protests. Those have always been a no-go.
Public owned spaces has literally nothing to do with this, as you yourself points out - they can be limited (free speech absolutists might disagree, but that’s not the real world).
