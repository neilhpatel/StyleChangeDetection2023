Like I suggested, I don't think Putin actually cares about Donetsk and Luhansk (beyond them being a coal basin who used to trade with him). Nor do I think referendums done during a war for those areas can be legitimate.
So I think that there needs to be legitimate ways for regions of the world to contest their independence in the world. I say this because the alternative often seems to be invasion, rebellion, bloodshed and war.
That said, I'm really not well versed enough in the government style/structure of those areas to say what is legitimate for them. Returning them to Ukraine for a minimum of five years stability before performing a UN secured third referendum would probably be a reasonable thing to do - but even that assumes that the when they voted for independence was legitimate and not interfered with.
The only possible acceptable outcome would be if Ukraine is satisfied with the peace terms, not China, not NATO, and certainly not Russia, so China is working behind closed doors with the wrong people.
Many people hope China can broker a peace deal because they likely have some sway with the Kremlin and also China-Ukraine relations have historically been quite positive. However I'm just saying I can't personally see this being successful because Crimea is a redline for both countries and I don't see any agreement on this between Russia and Ukraine.
Also, whether the West is right or wrong to be involved with Ukraine is also irrelevant nor did I ever say we're wrong to support Ukraine in its efforts to align with the EU. Ukraine is a sovereign nation and has the right to do whatever it wants within its own borders. Russia's security concerns do not supersede the right of a sovereign nation to do whatever it wants within its own borders.
Russia's concerns over a nation on its border turning towards an allied bloc of nations traditionally opposed to it is also legitimate.
Just because Russia has legitimate concerns doesn't mean it's in our interests to give them everything they want.
Edit: I don't think Russia will consider accepting until at least their next major offensive fails. Here's hoping Ukraine can train on and deploy the Leopards in time.
