Dude flying is more fuel efficient than driving. Someone flying in an economy class seat is getting a fuel efficiency of around 100 mpg for their trip.
The 737 can seat at least 60 more (50% more), has 1/3 more thrust, and travel 5400km. That is hardly "roughly comparable". In car terms, it is like Elantra (Embraer) vs Camry (737). One is from a newer, less established company offering much less whereas the other is much more widely known and trusted which offers a lot more.
Even if Air India was buying anything like an Embraer jet, if simply makes better economical sense to bulk order (of all jet sizes) from one manufacturer for better prices, maintenance and support advantages.
Yes the Max's have crashed (the Airbus not so much) but with improved technology and the minimal increased costs to operate a larger aircraft, it makes sense for most folks to take on the extra seats due to the increased revenue.
During 2020 the Boeing 737MAX fleet was grounded because the planes had a fatal flaw, so the older planes were being flown not because the airlines were poor, but because Boeing sells unsafe aircraft with single redundancy flaws that kill passengers to save money in manufacturing costs.
Yeah, 120 passengers and 4,000 km is as I said earlier is roughly a 737-300 in size and abiity. That Embraer was approached by Boeing, who took anything they needed tech wise (basically stealing the plans for their competitor for no cost), then tossed the Brazilians on the street laughing at their naitivete still burns. That is what comes from dealing with the western powers.
