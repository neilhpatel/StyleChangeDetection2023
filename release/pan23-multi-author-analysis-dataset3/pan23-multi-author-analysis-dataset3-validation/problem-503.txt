Yup, damaged tanks were scuttled, not because they were beyond repair but because recovering them would have slowed down the operation, and we have no shortage of tanks, so it was easier to just destroy them.
Because the vehicles that everyone is talking about getting left behind, were not US property, they had been sold or given to the Afghan army.
Why didn't the US do that with it's various vehicles and what not when pulling out of Afghanistan? not trying to thumb my nose at the US by any means, just curious.
I wrote this with the Blackhawks in mind actually. I watched a news report recounting the various weapons and vehicles left behind, there was / is an airfield lined with Humvees and helicopters (US) being flown around by what the reporter said were Taliban "pilots.".
Yeah, that's the other thing. They have manpower on paper but I'd bet one normal American soldier is probably worth 3 or 4 North Korean soldiers, maybe more. It's just logistics and training.
China has little influence over North Korea (at least little that they are willing to flex anytime soon), but North Korea also has no power. Their military is woefully obsolete. They have manpower, but without weapons and armor they are basically just meat. Plus a lot of them might desert the instant the military is distracted by war.
And when I say China has no influence it's willing to muster, I mean that they have options to bring NK in line, but they're the sort of options that can't be undone. NK is heavily dependent on China for so much, they would collapse in a week of China cut them off, but NK is useful enough to China that China doesn't want to do that unless it absolutely has to. But not wanting to and not being able to are two different things.
