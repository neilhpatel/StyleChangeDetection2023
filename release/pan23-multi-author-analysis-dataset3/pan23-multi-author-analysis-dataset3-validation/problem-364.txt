I've been saying this for years. Furthermore, the more GOPers who jump in to oppose him, the more they actually help him since it dilutes the vote of the "not-Trump" faction.
DeSantis is not prepared to get down in the muck with Trump, and with the current voter base of the GOP, it's going to hurt him.
If DeSantis called Trump a fat, ugly, funny looking loser with horrible hair, they'd look at Trump and say, "yeah he's got a real point there.".
You can't beat Trump with traditional politics. Republican primaries are where his childish, bizarre tactics seem to work the best for him.
Until a candidate starts putting Trump in his place by using his childish bullshit against him, he will win.
But they are all so scared because he is a dangerous mob boss. Wimps. Cohen is on my list to watch to make sure nothing suspicious happens to and look at him go. He isn't afraid of him. With a straight face, when Cohen is on MSNBC or CNN he ALWAYS says "Maro Lardo" and nobody corrects him or acts like they heard him. This is the way.
A bully is a bully. They only respond to being degraded and having what they so desperately try and hide by throwing insults brought to the front.
