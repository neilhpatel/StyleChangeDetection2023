I think the greater point is this makes it twice now that an interception has led to parts falling in another country. Russia is not doing a good job of keeping it's own toys away from other countries. Ukraine is defending against more than a hundred missiles all over, aimed at trying to freeze the population, one missile overshooting a target is not their fault, its the one who made them fire. Things are spilling over into other countries, this will absolutely escalate the involvement of Western powers.
This is a missile, if it turns to intercept a russian missile that is flying directly at Poland then fails in flight, Poland cannot and will not blaim Ukraine, russia is at fault for negligence in both munition ingress and target proximity.
I really doubt Poland would have withdrew for an accidental missile missfire, its not even ukraine's armys fault much less Zelensky, Just dumb unluck or incompetence on the operators part.
Few missiles hitting Poland Is not a big deal, but we must wonder if he and the military knew It was their fault and still blamed Russia, or if he didnt and decided to use It for some anti Russia Press to gain some favour before doing due diligence.
Still not entirely convinced that this wasn’t Russia’s doing, but everyone involved came to an agreement to blame it on an errant Ukrainian missile to prevent the war from expanding further.
I didn’t say it would activate NATO but the underlying reason why a Ukrainian rocket was fired at all was to remove the Russians from their homeland.
Say it with me - Ukraine wouldnt have fired any missiles if their homeland wasn’t currently occupied by foreign forces.
"The longer Russia feels this immunity, the more threats there will be against anyone within reach of Russian missiles. Firing missiles at NATO territory is a Russian attack on collective security. This is a very significant escalation. We must act," Zelensky said.
