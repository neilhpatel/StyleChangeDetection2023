In annexing territories, Russia has invested even more in keeping them, because to relinquish them at this point would go from being merely unsuccessful in an invasion to accepting a loss of territory which they've proclaimed as theirs.
I'd like to believe that they're going to run out of steam and give up any time now. But I'm not holding my breath. I expect this to drag on, to get dirtier and sneakier and more brutal. I expect things to get harder for Ukraine as the political attention span of the world wanes, as the Russian war machine adjusts to a state of perpetual warfare, as Ukraine's infrastructure takes continual damage and its people suffer from want and violence.
Do you really think if Ukraine would surrender it wouldn't result in tens of thousands of Ukrainians dying under Russian occupation and billions, if not trillions in economic damages over the following years? Not mention that Russia would just do it all over again in a decade or two.
A lot. Would be nice if that wasn't necessary but unfortunately Putin isn't giving much of a choice.
Not even Putin is stupid enough tor this to be a legitimate fear of him. He and everyone else knows that Russia’s nuclear weapons makes it so they aren’t invadable. That’s just propaganda fed to justify aggression.
