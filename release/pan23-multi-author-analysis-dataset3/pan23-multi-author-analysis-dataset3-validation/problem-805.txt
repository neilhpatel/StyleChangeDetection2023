I’ll give Trump this though, I really do believe he meant it as “I have always been a great leader since the first grade, my calm mind hasn’t changed and I’ve always been a calm person.”.
But, Trump can’t think before he speaks. So instead he made himself out to be a child. Which isn’t that far off from the truth.
So true. It's weird reading in r/conservative how they can't believe how crazy trump is after his NFT's. I'm thinking "This is what turned you off him? Not the billion other crazy things he's done?".
Yep. Blame the electorate first and foremost. Republicans voters have, for decades now, asked for zero campaign finance accountability, garbage public education, tax cuts and loopholes galore for corporations and the super rich, blank checks to the military, free reign for industry to decimate the environment and plunder our natural resources with absolute impunity.....
Remember when Trump wanted to nuke the hurricane and inject bleach intravenously to treat COVID? The man is a fucking imbecile, like actually cognitively impaired but purely as a consequence of unabashed egomania and delusional grandiosity.
The list goes on and on. These people hate their "fellow Americans" and would rather burn it all to the ground than admit they were wrong about anything ever. After all, admitting you are wrong and don't have all the answers is a sign of weakness, and is the cardinal sin of the insecure.
