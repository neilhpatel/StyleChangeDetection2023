>As often as the parties have sexual intercourse with one another, they rise, each apart from the other, to burn perfumes. In the morning they wash, before touching any household vessel. For as ablution is customary after touching a dead body, so is it practised after sexual intercourse. There is a custom prescribed by an oracle for all the Babylonian women to have intercourse with strangers. The women repair to a temple of Venus, accompanied by numerous attendants and a crowd of people. Each woman has a cord round her head, The man approaches a woman, and places on her lap as much money as he thinks proper; he then leads her away to a distance from the sacred grove, and has intercourse with her. The money is considered as consecrated to Venus.

The post asserts that Herodotus used this subject intentionally as a literary device to demonstrate "otherness" of Mesopotamian culture. I've seen other historians claim that since Herodotus was writing pre-Alexander and pre-Hellenization of the middle East, his errors could have been caused by a lack of good translators - that he simply didn't understand the cultures he was visiting because no one could give detailed explanations in his language. Could something like this be going on as well?
