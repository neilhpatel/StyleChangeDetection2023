This really depends on the circumstances. I'm assuming that the parents are divorced or otherwise not married, and one parent is trying to obtain full custody?
Yes, the court can make it so only one parent has any ability to make decisions for/on behalf of the child.
Sorry, I assumed the parents were divorced in this scenario. If they are still married, then they need to work this out within the marriage because the court will not hear a custodial matter between married people who reside together and raise the child in a shared home. And if they do get divorced, you would have to be able to show that there are reasons why one parent should have their rights curtailed, such as they are unfit or actively dangerous. Not agreeing with the other parent or the child preferring one parent's style of parenting over the other would not be sufficient.
In this case the parent aren’t divorced, but generally they don’t agree and make different decisions and then they often argue about it. They’re still married though.
