This is really going to depend on their local codes, so they need to check in with the town office. A fence can be on the border in my current town, there was a 6 inch setback in the last place I lived and before that it was six feet (very rural).
My only concern with trying to build a fence right now would be that depending on the standoff distance set in the town codes the fence would probably have to be a few feet into their own yard, which given the survey is already in dispute. So depending on this neighbor's demeanor he might be malicious enough to build something right up to the fence even though the fence is deep in OP's parent's property. It's speculation, sure, but it's not out of the realm of possibilities.
So yes to the fence, but let this property-line dispute settle first at least, then build the biggest spite fence they can buy.
Let them build the fence - and let them bear the costs of tearing it down and restoring your parent's property.
While the advice to get a real estate attorney is spot on, I'd also consider sending them a registered letter with a copy of the survey noting they appear to be building on your property and if so action will be taken to require them to remove it.
