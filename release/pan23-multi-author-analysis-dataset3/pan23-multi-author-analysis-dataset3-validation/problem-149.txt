No one can answer that question definitively. Since you could not find verification that there was a will probated at the courthouse, that means possibly that the will was never probated. If the will had been probated the executor was required by law to mail a copy to your half brother, unless the executor deliberately left half brother's name off of the list of heirs to be notified.
Get an attorney (representing your half-brother) to write a letter to the trustee that requests a copy of the trust plus any accounting statements for each year the trust has been in existence. If half brother is named as a beneficiary in the trust, then the trustee is obligated to send the copy of the trust to the attorney or to your half brother.
If half brother is NOT named as a beneficiary in the trust, then the trustee doesn't have to send half brother anything.
"He also stated correctly: "If half brother is named as a beneficiary in the trust, then the trustee is obligated to send the copy of the trust to the attorney or to your half brother. If half brother is NOT named as a beneficiary in the trust, then the trustee doesn't have to send half brother anything.".
IF IF the half brother is a beneficiary of a % of the Trust assets AND if RENT has been collected for the "remaining properties", then the half brother has a right to HIS % of all the rent collected.
IF he is a beneficiary of a % of the Trust assets, then he has the right to demand the sale of the remaining properties, particularly if the Trust terms direct the Trustee to sell the Trust assets and distribute them to the beneficiaries.
IF, as you say, the Trust is still open, then he has the right to a copy of the Trust and an accounting of the Trust assets, particularly if the Trust gives him a % of the total trust assets.
If the assets were put into the trust, then there will be no public record of how it was administered since trusts are managed privately by the trustee.
He could/should contact the Trustee in writing and demand a copy of the Trust, particularly if he received cash as a beneficiary.
If you're not named in the trust, then the trustee is not going to give you a copy. He will just say something like "you have no business with this trust, go away." But you (or any random person) still has a right to see the Last Will, it's public record once filed for probate.
