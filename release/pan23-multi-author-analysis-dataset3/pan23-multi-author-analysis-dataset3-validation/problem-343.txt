Very interesting read. It makes sense that the Russians would be less inclined to support the revolution as a result of Brest Litovsk. It's just a conflict I have never put much thought into yet remained relatively curious about. I'm from Sweden and the war between Finland and the Soviet union is brought up in detail. But not the Finnish civil war.
So I wrote my barchelors theses on an aspect of Finnish Civil war. For anonymitys sake I will not disclose the exact subject, since I am only one who has written anything publically available on the subject. I will first tell how the war went, then why whites were better at warfare, and third, how reds could have increased their changes.
German intervention. 10 000 German veteran soldiers of Ostseedivision completely outclassed anything reds had. Apart from a hard fought battle at Syrj√§ntaka, German intervention was a complete curb stomp.
Leadership. Whites had an effective command structure on all levels. Red command did not work at any level. Highest prewar military rank among red leadership was 2nd leutenent, first commander in chief, Ali Aaltonen. He was cashiered due to drunkedness, and replaced with an amateur. Whites had General Mannerheim. Reds voted for company commanders, whites appointed trained Jaegers and imperial officers for those roles mostly. White troops fought loyaly, red troops mutinied, changed leaders and went on leave from frontline without permission.
