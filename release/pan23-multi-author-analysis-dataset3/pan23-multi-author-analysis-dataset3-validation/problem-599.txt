First, notice the revenge. They don’t just want to ask questions of those who don’t agree with them. They want to impeach them. When you move to impeach a person, “What did they do good?” is not the question that is asked. The question is what is that person doing wrong. In the GQP, they think Mayorkas is letting immigration go unchecked, which isn’t true. The GQP is using the issue to and that of building the wall to motivate their base. Here’s a link to the 2021 Homeland Security Southwest Border Enforcement. See page 2 for expulsions: So, to answer your question, he’s doing his job. That’s good. That’s what won’t be shown in an impeachment.
There's going to be a few hundred impeachments this term. Republicans are going to grind the government to a halt. If the white house janitor was an impeachable position, I'd be worried. They're going to impeach anyone they can, maybe even Biden's dogs.
Is there anyone they did not threaten to impeach? If (big if) they succeed, all of these impeachments will be going to the Senate. So that may be all the Senate can do is engage on trail after trial, instead of confirming judicial appointments and actually doing work. Last time, Roberts refused to preside, so the President pro-temp Leahy presided. Patty Murray is expected to be the next president pro temp, so her life may be presiding over trial after trial. I wish there was a way to force Roberts to preside on trial after trial if it happens.
