Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) got emotional on Thursday as the House of Representatives moved to pass a historic bill codifying protections for same-sex and interracial marriages.
The Respect for Marriage Act passed in a 258-169 vote, with 39 Republicans in support. The measure passed the Senate last month by a similar bipartisan margin of 61-36. Republicans who backed the bill said they were assured by additional protections for religious liberty that were added to the Senate version. The bill now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk.
The Missouri congresswoman, who is a social conservative and lonime opponent of same-sex marriage, urged her colleagues to reject the bill on the grounds that it would undermine “traditional” marriages.
I’d prefer her to at least be authentically opposed to same sex marriages for some reason than the other GOP sleaze bags and closet cases voting against the bill even though they’re personally indifferent or even supportive.
If you’re going to vote against something like this, you better cry, you better bring up your deeply held beliefs, you better say that you fear that the world will collapse and everyone will die. Voting against it because “idk, sounds gay” is much more offensive to me.
