While there are always new questions or suggestions which can be made, there are many which have been previously addressed - including variations of an 'answered/unanswered/responded' flair. As a rule, to stand even if they are repeats, but we would nevertheless encourage you to check out the as it is possible that your query is addressed there. Frequent META questions include:
We're not prepared to introduce a because it simply comes with all the issues of workload, unreliability, flair discouragement, and inviting answers because "there's nothing here yet,' but even worse because it's pointless in a community dedicated to high-quality responses to hand out a thread flair for low quality responses.
I understand that it's sometimes disheartening to see posts where you think there might be answers only to find out that there haven't been, but as previously discussed (and as discussed in this thread) there are several pitfalls to introducing an 'answered' or 'X responses' flair, including the enormous amount of time-consuming work that would fall on the already overstretched mods.
While it is nearly impossible to implement an "answered"-type flair and still uphold the way the sub functions as well as our quality standards, the mods and flairs have tried to cultivate a community that is conducive to finding answered questions if you just take a minute to seek them out.
Can we overthrow the mods and make this a free community in which there can be unsatisfactory answers, but at least there are attempts at answers, which is better than nothing?
To save the mods a little bother (it's a big thread) - this suggestion stems from a misconception that every answer is individually reviewed and allowed by the mod team. Given the scale of the sub, this doesn't (and can't) happen - all answers stand by default. Generally, the mod team relies on the 'report' function for potentially problematic answers to be flagged to them for review. This, as I understand it, is one of the major problems with implementing any kind of manual 'answered' flair - it represents a much bigger workload for the mods than it appears, as it would mean that each answer would actually need to be evaluated by the mod team, instead of relying on crowdsourced referrals as they do for substandard posts.
