They don't protect people like me. I would be lucky if my statement was recorded accurately after I was victimized.
Extra dollars don't automatically mean better response times. An audit of what happens with funding is important.
And a shit ton of it goes to low hanging fruit instead of more serious crimes that are expensive hard work to pursue.
Arresting criminals is great, the cops just suck at doing their job because they can rarely ever do it properly.
If you canâ€™t see why people arresting other people committing crimes is good than you are really out of step with the average American.
Arresting people who commit crimes is good, if they arrest the right person and innocent lives aren't sitting in jail from days to years. And if it's where they enforce arresting people evenly and arrest as many white people, as they do black people, instead of letting them go for the exact same charges. But to arrest a criminal they need to not murder their suspect, who may or may not be guilty of what the cops suspect they are guilty of.
