She has basically guaranteed a Republican senator from arizona in 2024. Arizona has no runoffs so she is a spoiler candidate that will take away from democrats.
My bet is she will flip to R when she is up for reelection since although much of Arizona hates her, Rs vote party over.
I think the lesson from the 2022 Arizona election is that there are still a lot of red votes in Arizona, but not enough to vote for crazies like Masters and Lake. So this is a huge opportunity for the AZ GOP, who are too dumb and crazy to take the simple route and nominate an antiTrump Republican.
Sinema will run in 2024 as an independent against Gallego + whatever horrorshow the AZ GOP decides to prop up. She and Gallego will split the votes from people who wonâ€™t vote for crazy, which will be enough wiggle room for the GOP candidate to squeak by.
Either the AZ Democratic Party backs her over Gallego in a general, or the dems face a really tough election. Either she regains her seat (unlikely) or she spoils things for the dems, making it easier to get that Fox News spot or donor/lobby money or all of the above.
