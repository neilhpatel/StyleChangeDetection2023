Though if the Russians can keep a higher readiness, some of their ship based weapon systems (specifically their 30mm CIWS) are pretty ideal for taking out such drones.
The Russian navy has many issues, indeed, but they still do have a good deal of anti-missile tech. Shooting missiles at these things will not guarantee a kill unless one use a hell of s lot of them.
What missiles are you talking about? I only read that they were going to receive patriots, which are defensive surface to air missiles. I mean logically, the states giving offensive first strike weapons to Ukraine would be the fastest way to WW3, but Iâ€™m not even American and you would know best.
Unfortunately, the current US admin is still reluctant to supply anything that can strike "Russian territory", even though the Ukrainians have been very clear they would not use American weapons to do this.
Technically no: Ukraine has short range missiles (a few dozen miles) capable of damaging or destroying ships, but no long range (100+ miles) weapons so all these ships are parked outside the safety of Crimea.
whatever ones are necessary, to sink any ship that launches missles into Ukrainian civilian centers, in an act of terrorism and genocide.
Have missles capable of reaching and sinking those ships, if they attack Ukrainian civilian areas, reached Ukrainian forces yet? And if not, why the not??? - Me, a tax paying American who paid for these weapons, and stands with Ukraine against Russia's genocidal campaign.
I've paid for decades to stand against the atrocities russias is committing.. well...seems it is the time to stand against it. Lets get to it.
