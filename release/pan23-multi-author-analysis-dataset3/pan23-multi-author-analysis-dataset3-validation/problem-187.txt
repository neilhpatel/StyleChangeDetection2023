"Don't blame Republicans" - if Republicans hadn't vetoed the earlier bill, Biden wouldn't be faced with his current choices of either hurting railroad workers or hurting millions of people.
So after Republicans voted against or filibustered the bill, the "casual observer" should blame... Joe Biden (because of course).
What this picture critically omits, however, is that it was Biden’s White House that originally set last week’s events in motion.”.
“The White House thus initially opposed any attempt to include paid sick days in the contract it was hell-bent on imposing. Facing a backlash, Nancy Pelosi soon after announced the dual votes that ultimately took place: one, on imposition of the tentative agreement, and another on the insertion of seven days of paid sick time. Pelosi did so knowing full well that the latter would never get the necessary support to pass in the Senate. Had she and Biden actually been serious about trying to win railworkers their sick days, she could have refused to decouple the two issues and tried to rustle up the votes to avoid a strike and score a victory for workers at the same time.”.
Yep, it was good ol' Joe Biden who forced the rail workers to settle for only 7 days of paid sick leave, and not the Republicans. Republicans didn't want to give them any sick leave.
