"To be fair" the PM told him to fuck off after a series of tweets where Musk called Ukrainian Crimea "Khrushchevâ€™s mistake" and argued that Ukraine should give Russia their land and call it a day. He said this while acting like he was simply being logical and advocating for peace. Meanwhile the terminals were sent over at the beginning of the war as a show of support (and a huge marketing opportunity). Elon and SpaceX chose this.
SpaceX may be run as though it's Elon's corner store, but they have other investors and should answer to them. Not spending money or leaving money on the table because people think they should sell at cost. A company that's never been profitable.
Imagine someone invents data teleportation. 100 Gbps with 0 ping and under 5 watts of consumption. You think they'll charge more or less?
There's a difference between cost and price. I got an iPhone for free with my carrier. It doesn't mean phones are free. Same with my router and the fiber. One provider ran it to me for free. Another one collected $100k. Apple makes phones for less than $400 marginally. When they give Ukrainians $400 unlocked phones then I'll justify charging some marginal cost. Same with my $2700 Comcast Fiber that they sell to home users at $300.
