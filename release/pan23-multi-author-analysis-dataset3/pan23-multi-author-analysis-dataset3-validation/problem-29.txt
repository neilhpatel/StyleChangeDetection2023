The way worker's compensation works is that employers pay into a system run by the department of labor to ensure that all workers injured on the job get payment for their injuries. Employees don't have to prove that their employer was "at fault" for the injuries, as long as the injuries arose out of their job. In exchange, the employers typically can't be sued by their employees for compensation, barring something like malicious behavior. So, in a way, her employer is the one paying for her treatment by paying into the state system for all the employees. And their rates for what they have to pay likely went up as a result of the injury to your sister.
Ah, thanks. I am in Washinon and wasn't sure exactly how it was in most other states. It seems like the various departments of labor still ensure that workers get benefits, they just aren't paying into a state-run pool.
Most Workers Compensation is not via a state run program. It's provided by private insurers. The exceptions are Ohio, Wyoming, Washinon, and North Dakota where your only option is through the state. There are other exceptions where the state wants to provide some underserved risks with options but they're in the minority.
Granted, the line of business, it's rates, and rules around compensation are heavily regulated by the states.
Every state likes to give the departments slightly different names, but yes, there generally is some government entity that is making sure it's all running properly and offers some kind of guidance to workers.
