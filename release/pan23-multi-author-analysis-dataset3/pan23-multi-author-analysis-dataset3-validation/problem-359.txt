"Mr. President, the real one, not that lying cheater in office right now... If you don't run as a 3rd party candidate, is it because you know that you can't win? Or is it because you feel Mr. Desanctimonious is better for America than you are?".
As others are saying. DeSantis is popular with maga. If trump splits the party maga will go for him not rick. The 3rd party will be the ones who DONT want trump I think itll be more like liz cheney or adam kinzinger.
Oh I didnt say good choice. Just that a schism in the republican party might create the far right maga party and a milk toast gop that would be a coin toss with dems so voters would reject.
I doubt there would be a serious third party formed. I am only saying trump would pull votes for one election. Republicans would have to choose between running a trump party and a party that would now look to dem for gardcore voters on the right.
Some of them saw the opportunity, but in the end, Trump defined what it meant to be a Republican for voters. Nearly all who crossed Trump lost their elections.
