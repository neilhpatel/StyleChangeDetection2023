Are you concerned that she is paying for someone to mow part of your lawn? The mower would probably appreciate to know where the end of the yard is, could save themselves some time.
You could approach your neighbor the next time you see her out and jokingly mention having to straighten her mowing guys out. That way you can bring it up but also avoid the conversation being confrontational.
Throw some little flags down along the property line to show the mowing company the next time they arrive and ask them to avoid your side of the property line.
2. if you aren't home when they cut the grass talk to the neighbor, ask her if you can have the contact details of the company cause they are mowing your property. Call the company and explain the situation.
1. If you see them mowing the yard, go out and talk to them. I assure you they have no interest in the world in mowing on your property, explain where your property line is and ask them to not mow your property and they will be ok with this.
Next time the mowing company is out there, tell them where the property line is. They will likely just stop mowing that far - or if there is an actual disagreement on where the property line is, and it is not just the company getting it wrong, it will bring it to light when they tell your neighbor you disagree. Better to get in front of those things early.
