I am an intellectual property attorney, but not your attorney. Logos are not patentable. Patents are for inventions. If you want to use a logo to identify you or your company as the source of your book and other goods or services, then the proper form of protection is a trademark. It sounds as if you have something potentially valuable and worth doing right. Consult a competent IP lawyer who has experience registering trademarks - and also registering copyrights to help you protect your book as well.
This seems like sound advice I will definitely track down an IP lawyer in my area and see about getting an international trademark for my work. From my research online apparently all countries included in the Madrid agreement are eligible to apply for a global trademark, I was a bit worried as I am currently based out of East Africa, but Kenya appears on the list of the Madrid agreement so hopefully I can track down a competent lawyer to help me with the paper work Thank you again for the help!
The Madrid Protocol provides a streamlined process to register trademarks in the countries that have signed onto the agreement, but you still have to pursue your rights in each individual country. A competent trademark attorney can provide you with more details on this and help you decide where you should apply.
