"bans teaching anything that assumes “fault, blame, or bias should be assigned to race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, or to members of a race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin because of their race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin.”.
Especially when the law "bans teaching anything that assumes “fault, blame, or bias should be assigned to race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, or to members of a race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin because of their race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin.”.
And it was white people in general benefitting from it. Even poor white southerners who were "competing" with black slaves to some extent were still benefitting in many ways, like having exclusive access a wide variety of jobs and cheaper access to every resource that was produce by a slave. And from a sociological stage it gave them someone to feel superior to even when they were doing poorly, which is a depressingly powerful thing.
That is why they conveniently define racism, and define it in such a way that it is basically "anything that would make a white supremacist uncomfortable.".
Not with South Carolina judges. And not when the law literally bans any acknowledgement of systemic racism. It basically makes it so they can enforce it in a systemically racist way and they can never be called on it, because doing so is itself illegal.
