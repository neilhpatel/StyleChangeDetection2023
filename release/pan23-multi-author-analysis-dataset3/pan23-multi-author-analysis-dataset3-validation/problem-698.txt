“I’ll tell you my priority,” Hartzler said. “Protect religious liberty, protect people of faith, and protect Americans who believe in the true meaning of marriage!”.
This bill doesn't require churches or people of faith to participate in any way, shape, or form of a same sex marriage. A same sex couple getting married has ZERO effect on these people's lives. This all about forcing their religion on the rest of the populace. Therefore why are people of faith in need of protection? Absolutely illogical and insane.
Ehh I call those crocodile tears. Even if she isn't faking it, they aren't coming from an honest and heartfelt place. She is crying because she can't deny the right for two consenting adults to get married. It's pretty vile.
I am so freaking sick of this shit. I didn’t choose to be gay. People like her choose to believe in God. They choose to go to church and live their life by some stupid storybook. Gay people are fact. Religion is fiction. One is based on reality. The other is based on faith. My right to exist and have the same rights of everyone else in this country has absolutely nothing to do with your right to believe in a fairytale. Do you see us marching in our parades with signs that say “we hate Christians” No We don’t give a crap We just want to be treated like human beings The worst part about all of it is that this Jesus dude they are so obsessed with would hang out and care for prostitutes and disease ridden vagabonds. He loved everyone and preached about acceptance. And last time I checked, it was the Republicans and every other religious nut out there who are being arrested for molestation and child porn and lying and cheating and raping. It’s 2022. This needs to end.
