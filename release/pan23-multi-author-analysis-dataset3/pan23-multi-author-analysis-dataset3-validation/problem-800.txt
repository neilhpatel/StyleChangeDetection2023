Excellent answer, I vaguely remembered that the whole lost in thought thing he used to. It in interesting as while Socrates was not mystic, the poster is not entirely off point as at my understanding the neo Platonists would take on a lot of mystical type practices in spite of the lack of mysticism in platonic/socratic works.
Later Platonists read this sort of thing back into Plato, who, undoubtedly, does occasionally describe philosophers as engaging in semi-mystical practices. (The only really solid, uncontroversial instance of this is the description of the philosopher coming to know the Forms in the Symposium, which is likened to an experience in a mystery cult. But this has to be balanced against other non-mystical descriptions of the same experience, such as this cognitive condition being produced by a long training in mathematics in the Republic. However, we must not deny that the Symposium's description exists. Even still, there is no meditation, etc.) But what Plato says is often distorted by late-ancient doctrines. For instance, people like Plotinus, Porphyry, etc., believed that it was impossible to describe in language the One. This is part of why they think that experiences of this are mystical -- and they attribute the same belief to Plato. Except that the attribution is false. Plato often spoke about the One and (in)famously delivered lectures on it. What he refuses to do is write about it. The lack of writing on the One gives us the false picture that the late-ancient mystical approach to the One could plausibly be found in Plato, too. But when we read more about Plato's attitude towards the One, we realize that what we're doing is just projecting backwards later categories.
If all you want is something to read on the episodes of Socrates' "trances," check out Alex Long's Conversation and Self-Sufficiency in Plato.
These "trances" are nothing more than Socrates engaging in this practice at awkward and inopportune times.
Socrates is up to something very weird when he just stands there and thinks. I do suggest that you read Long's book, which I mentioned at the start of my original answer. Nobody tackles these questions related to Socrates' weird instances of standing and thinking better than him. If you're interested in mysticism in the Platonic tradition, I strongly suggest Dillon and Gerson's anthology Neoplatonism: Introductory Readings, paying special attention to the readings from Iamblichus.
