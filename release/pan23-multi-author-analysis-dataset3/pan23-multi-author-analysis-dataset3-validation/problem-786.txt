Seems like a waste of time to me. Too many real problems in this country and too many useful bills get log jammed in the system to waste time with frivolous “might happens”.
Yes Marjorie Taylor Greene puts out stupid bills that everyone else ignores and probably will never gain traction on.
Its the government forcing them. Period. Even when Trump told his some of his most followers that he thinks they should get the vaccine because he did he got booed at his rallies. Its probably the one thing they consider their god mistaken on. The posts on /r/hermancainaward are filled with posts of people going on and on about vaccine and microchip conspiracies.
Republicans that screamed about microchips in vaccines will reflexively start loving chips at the first sign of Democrats trying to legislate against them.
Republicans before Democrats try to ban microchipping people: Bill Gates is going to give you the Mark of the Beast via microchips hidden in Covid Vaccines.
Republicans after Democrats try to ban microchipping people: It's American's God-given right to get the Mark of the Beast.
