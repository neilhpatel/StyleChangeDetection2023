Seriously, I saw a chart on how much Qatar spent and how much they're projecting to earn in their economy due to hosting it.....$211 billion spent, $4 billion projected revenue.....WTF.
Well FIFA made their money, Qatar are the ones losing money on this, but see it as a net gain since they are buying publicity and trying to sportwash their reputation.
The funny thing is for FIFA this tournament isn't even a big money maker, in fact it's been a financial disaster all things considered. (For one thing they had to give the US media rights for the upcoming US World Cup to American broadcasters at bargain prices when they could have made massively more for them.) They now have to tow this line not for their own greed but because of the greed of Sepp Blatter and quite a few other corrupt members of the organization 12 years ago who were the ones who REALLY got rich off this farce.
Yep! It's a money loser for FIFA and an absolute financial disaster for Qatar (good thing for them natural gas prices are so high right now I guess.) It's only the people who got bribed who made any money off this ridiculous November World Cup in basically one city.
