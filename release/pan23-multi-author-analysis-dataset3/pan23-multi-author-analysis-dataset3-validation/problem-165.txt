Russia fucks up time and again and they whine at others for not letting them win.. this is more pathetic than a school bully running to their parents in tears cause their last victim decided to fight back.
Yeah seriously! How pathetic and stupid does someone have to be to start a war and then throw a temper tantrum and complain that their enemy is fighting back??
So invading a neighboring country and starting a war of aggression isn't a global catastrophe, but arming someone to help them defend themselves against said invasion is?? Gotta love Russia's stupid logic.
There are plenty of stupids that simp for Russia and cling to any argument they shell out. That's why they continue to say this ridiculous shit. Had someone sincerely tell me Russia is the most powerful country on the planet and Western media is lying to us about the war.
Yes, that's one thing people didn't really pay attention to when Russia was running their mouth about using nukes against US, UK, France etc. The moment US assumes nuclear attack threat is real and imminent they won't sit around and wait for Russia.
If someone from USA really suggested something like this to Russia this maybe finally made them understand that nuclear war is not something you should use as a threat.
Aside from this being a thinly veiled threat to use nukes, which I think everyone can see for the bluff that it is, if Russia has the ability to ramp up the conflict in any non-nuclear way, what are they waiting for? Itâ€™s amazing to me they think this sort of statement they make very regularly is believable, even for domestic Russian consumption.
