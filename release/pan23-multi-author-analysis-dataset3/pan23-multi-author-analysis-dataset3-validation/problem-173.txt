Mere injury ON A PROPERTY does not give rise to liability; the injury has to be BECAUSE OF THE PROPERTY and negligence of the owner (i.e., where there was a duty to maintain and failure to perform). It does not sound like there is any issue about the property/area not being kept in a safe condition, and in any event, there was no injury at all until the woman became lightheaded and fell off the chair (as you note). Moreover, it sounds like the grandma was the (unintended) cause of her own injury. She had a prior severe illness, probably was on medication, and as a mentally competent adult (or being accompanied by people charged with making decisions for her) could have opted out of climbing three flights of stairs. Just do some searching for New York personal injury (aka tort) laws to give your friend some peace of mind and basics of what types of things give rise to legal claims. And in the meantime, take photos of the area in question and ask people at the party if they have photos or videos of the event in question.
Friend should not admit any fault, not offer payment or compensation or to share medical bills, and refuse to engage in any discussion of the injury. He or she should wait to see what happens, and if lawsuit is ultimately filed, then friend needs to notify her insurance (rental or homeowner, depending), notify the building if she rents or has a condo, and CONSULT A LAWYER.
To add to this, some homeowners insurance will require that the person represented by the insurance company be named in a lawsuit, so your friend or her boyfriend may be required to be the defendant in a lawsuit.
It's absolutely possible that her health insurance will deny payment or require the claim be filed with the homeowner's or renters insurance for reimbursement purposes as well. Just throwing this out there to clarify that it may not be just about trying to sue.
