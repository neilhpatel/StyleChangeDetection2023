It's my understanding that she can get a birth certificate with or without you, and she could probably legally take the child to Brazil under their laws and stay there and there's nothing you can do about it. Sorry to tell you this. I'm not 100% sure.
Hello, I am half brazilian on my mother's side. Similar situation, I was born here. I have dual citizenship and a Brazilian birth certificate.
Why is this downvoted, Brazil allows dual citizenship. So mother can get both the birth certificate and passport even without op agreeing to it. The advice on this thread of him getting a divorce attorney is more an issue than this post. Op might break his marriage over an issue that she can do even after divorce. And divorcing just would make more motivated to leave the country.
So how does someone leave the country? With a passport. If the child does not already have a US passport consent of both parents is needed. If she is going to be able to get someone to make a fake ID or whatever the you need to enroll in so that you can be alerted if a passport is issued (that you didnâ€™t know about). I do not know the process to get someone a Brazilian passport. Additionally the US has no exit controls so it is very easy for someone to leave.
