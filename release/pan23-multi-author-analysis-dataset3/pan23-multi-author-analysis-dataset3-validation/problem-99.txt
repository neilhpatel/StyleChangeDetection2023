... which is not acceptable, but I did not know that his accuser was a lonime friend of Hannity and lied about Franken writing the kissing scene just for her. I understand everybody's assessment is personal to them but I don't see why she felt the need to embellish the impact of the kiss by framing it as a creepy trap.

I know. I don't even click the stories anymore. They’ve devolved into click bait. Nothing substantive is going to happen. They’re never going to charge much less convict a former POTUS. He really could shoot someone dead on 5th avenue, (if blubberbutt could hold a firearm longenough), and there would be oceans of ink, and hours upon months of nightly tv drama, but nothing would actually come of it.
