This is bad, but totally, totally management. Take some deep breaths. No need for rash action. Can you answer the questions above?
5. You are being sued (or have received a demand letter probably) from an insurance company claiming $130,000 on behalf of their clients, correct?
7. Even if a $130,000 judgment is entered into against you, there's no way you can pay it. Worst case scenario you'd file for bankruptcy and it would go away: poof. Around 1,500,000 Americans file for bankruptcy each year. Bankruptcy is not a dirty word. It allows people to start fresh. That's the worst thing that could happen, based on what you wrote, and that's very unlikely unless you ignore your mail.
6. The bottom line is that you have absolutely no money. Once the insurance company realizes that you have absolutely no money, they will probably stop coming after you. (They may go after your boss, since he owned the van. Do they know who owns the van?).
