In the 1930s, under the state owned company Aeroflot, soviet air transportation started “taking off” (sorry). But at this point it was largely freight based, not passenger based. While there were passenger planes they weren’t used often by the average citizen, with the average ticket costing 350 roubles, around half a month’s average worker’s salary. However it’s worth mentioning that in 1939 the USSR volume of cargo transported by air exceeded that in the US.
The Soviet Union decided quite early in its existence (1920s) that it would be a good idea for them to develop their air transport infrastructure. They looked at their more remote territories - particularly Siberia - and concluded air transport might be the better and more economical solution than building a huge road or rail network to all these areas.
These cheap flights had two purposes in the minds of Soviet leaders : connect the different republics to Moscow, and provide the people with possibilities of leisure within the USSR.
I read an interesting article in French newspaper Le Monde a few months ago about the particular case of low cost flights in the 1980s between Tblisi (Georgia) and Moscow.
