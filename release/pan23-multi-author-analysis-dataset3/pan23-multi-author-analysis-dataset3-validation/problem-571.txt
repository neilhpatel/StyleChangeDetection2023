No. It sounds like this is second hand information coming from Desiree. You have no idea what was or wasn’t found or how much danger she was in. The stepmother didn’t break any laws because she cannot commit someone.
The stepmother can’t force anyone to do anything, only the courts can. The inpatient has to assess the intake and determine next steps. It sounds like the stepmother was concerned, talked to Melanie, they went to the inpatient when she was in a bad place, and checked in.
She also allegedly either found a note or something made her believe a plan existed. That’s called being a protective parent, no matter how old you are. Unless she put her hand over Melanie’s and signed Melanie’s name with her, she didn’t force Melanie to sign.
I was told everything by Melanie's wife who was there as it all happened. The stepmother was screaming and stomping around. Melanie only signed herself in because of her stepmother forcing her to.
Melanie was afraid of her stepmother. I didn't go into detail in the post because i didn't think it was relevant, but the stepmother was screaming and stomping and drove Melanie there herself. She wouldn't have signed otherwise.
