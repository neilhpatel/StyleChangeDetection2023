The more fair comparison is not OIF and OEF, but the first gulf war. OIF and OEF were mostly fought against insurgent type forces and not organized militaries. Ukraine isn't a hodgepodge of insurgents, they are a standing military nation backed by a government. Desert Storm was the US lead coalition versus the standing Iraqi army. At the time, Iraq was supposed to have the 4th largest army in the world behind the big 3 super powers of the US, Russia, and China, and they were battle hardened after wars with Iran and an invasion of Kuwait. The coalition absolutely mopped the floor with the Iraqi army. There was never a question of who had air superiority and the US defeated the elite Republican Guard in less than a day during the Battle of 73 Easting. The whole ground war was pretty much over in less than 100 hours. You can read the official details of each movement . That's the war Russia expected to conduct, but they found out very quickly that they were not the US and their allies.
You're not wrong, but the human element in us must recognize that there are at least a few people taking up arms for the Russians who are either doing it against their will or under false pretenses who would otherwise not participate. Not everyone has the coin to just up an leave their country, not everyone has the knowledge to know that their country is in the wrong, and some still were taken from prisons and mental institutions and armed. Sure, there are plenty that are not good people and are getting exactly what they deserve. There is statically no way though that 100% of the people being pushed to the front agree with what is happening. That's not to say that we shouldn't celebrate Ukraine's victories here. Ukraine has every right to be slaughtering them wholesale so long as Russia sends them into the meat grinder. That does not, however, mean that we cannot also think multidimensionally in this conflict and have empathy for those that are dying. As someone who has fought a war, the Ukrainians at the front will likely have no such empathy. There is no room for that on a battlefield. Empathize with the enemy and you may hesitate. We, however, are at home typing on keyboards. There is room for empathy here. There is room for us to say that if it wasn't for Putin and his ego, that thousands upon thousands of men on both sides of this war would not be decaying in shallow graves right now.
Russia is also fighting a pointless war, with increasingly poor equipment, and poorly trained troops, so their casualties are rising quickly...
Iâ€™m just curious if this is indicative of Russia getting crushed or 4 days of extremely violent battle with high casualties on both sides.
The Ukrainian estimates from the defense ministry the last 4 days are 2,990 KIA(or they mean casualties; see below) total.
The Newsweek article is written like shit on multiple fronts, such as saying killed and casualties interchangeably along with a possible math error. The Ukrainian report for Sunday says 600 "liquidated" which I was saying on another post may be a translation issue, but sure sounds to me like "killed" is the intention. 3,000 seems crazy to me for KIA or casualties, and I don't speak Ukrainian so I can't read the image they have with each casualty report.
Maybe someone who can speak/read Ukrainian could translate the +600 row from the below image to at least establish if Ukraine is claiming KIA or total casualties? Because those are pretty extreme kill counts.
