I'm confused; is the Dropbox username they reference the same one as your old Dropbox account? Or is the CP Dropbox under a username you've used elsewhere, but not on Dropbox?
I used to have a Dropbox, but I have never owned cp. But I can't say I wasn't in contact with someone who has/does. The most I used it for was Gore videos and they used to be in mass video/picture files. I never watched all the videos or anything like that so that's why I don't know if they contained worse than just that or what. Who would I contact, my father received the letter and I'm in a different town a few hours away from him. But still in the same state, Utah.
I don't know, everything about it seems legit. The whole letter is from the attorney office from my state and has official number along with head members. My father sent me a text asking what that was so it wasn't even sent to my current address.
Okay thank you, if that happens and I don't have anything they claim. I even tried to login into any of my email accounts with a generic password I use for sites idc about for Dropbox and I don't have any accounts registered with Dropbox, even when searching my emails for account confirmations I didn't find any.
The mailing address is from the real attorney general office. My father sent me images of the letter and what envelope it came in. Everything about it is screaming legit. He said he'll call and ask if it's real.
