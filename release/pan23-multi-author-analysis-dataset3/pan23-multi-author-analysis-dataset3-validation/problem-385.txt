There's nothing to worry about. Biden has historic job growth, record judicial appointments, and other legislative victories stacked up to point to.
Biden does not have historic job growth. Biden inherited an economy that had unprecedented losses due to the artificial closing of the economy. In fact fewer people are working today than before the pandemic and there are 2 million fewer jobs than in January 2020. His economic record is worsening by the day. Weâ€™re into stagflation and the recession is deepening.
