A technical debate may decide whether more than 40 million Americans receive up to $20,000 in student-loan debt relief.
I generally agree, but student loan debt is so present in most American’s lives that it would be hard to forget you owe $10,000 in predatory loans than you could have.
I expect a decision striking down student loans based on republican arguments such as "you took a loan, you pay it back" and "I paid my loans you should too!".
At that point two things happen. First, payments are halted for an even longer time. They aren’t collecting interest AND inflation is high. This is basically a back door to forgiveness. Second, the GOP realizes that if Democrats won’t unfreeze loans then they have to do it. This will be incredibly unpopular without accompanying relief.
It gets even worse if Biden has the stones to extend the pause. People forget that the forgiveness is a compromise in order to reinstate payments. They literally announced both plans together. That means Biden is well within his rights to say ‘Look, the deal was we forgive some debt, and then start payments again. I ran on that. I won’t do one without the other.’.
So basically, if the Supreme Court strikes down loan forgiveness, the GOP takes full responsibility for the crisis AND Dems get what they want anyway.
