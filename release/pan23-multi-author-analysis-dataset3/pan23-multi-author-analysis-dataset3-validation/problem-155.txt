Itâ€™s honestly not. There are regions that are a lot worse, but there are lots of parts of Russia (the more populated side) that have pretty decent weather. Some cities have 300 days of sunshine, like Sochi. Moscow gets pretty cold in the winter tho.
Ya that seems a bit off, seeing as Russia and Canada have virtually the same climate. Unless they are using climate as like "the political climate" or something. BTW if you don't like the political climate, GTFO of Ukraine. Canada has the highest population of Ukranians outside of Ukraine itself, it's fair to say you managed to piss us off with this whole invasion.
Canada has the 3rd highest population of Ukrainians, after Russia and Ukraine. Why Russia would think we're just following the US' lead is beyond me, we have more demographic connection to Ukraine than the US does.
"Russian" being a race isn't that far off from the Russian zeitgeist. They have this whole idea of the "Russian soul" which is ostensibly more artistic/true/valuable than say, Ukrainians.
Russians consider themselves a race so they can be racist af. And it's ironic, being the largest country on the planet, with one of the widest cultural ranges.
