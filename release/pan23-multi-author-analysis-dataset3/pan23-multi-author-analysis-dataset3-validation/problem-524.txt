Three - we decided early on that pain would be necessary, so we made very painful changes to our economy, society etc. The 90s were hard here too - economy had to be completely rerouted, we still had Russian forces in our countries (94 for Estonia, 98 I think for Latvia due to their radar station, not sure about Lithuania), capitalism, alcoholism and drugs ran rampart.

- The will of the Ukrainian state and people is an aberration, and Moldova/Georgia will fold far more easily than Ukraine.

On top of that most experts have concluded that Russia will definitely move to annex both Moldova and Georgia whether they win or lose in Ukraine.
We know for a fact that Moldova was intended to be invaded concurrently pending they'd reached/landed at Odessa.
It was quite obvious that Russia would continue to Moldova after Ukraine. Emboldened by this, they would likely move on to the Caucasus states, absorb Belarus, and then possibly Finland, Mongolia, or Kazakhstan. Depending on how deranged Putin became, they might even go after Japan.
