EU already has something like this, but only for domestic production. This extends it to imports, reducing the incentive to move those industries out of Europe and thus strenhening European production.
That's what many countries want anyway (see the US tariffs on steel import for example) and is usually not seen as a negative because it creates jobs locally instead of just enabling cheap imports from low-cost countries.
If you want an environment in which such tariffs can be charged, you're going to have to get countries to agree to a new trade treaty that allows for such tariffs; the outlook for other countries signing on to a treaty like that is exceptionally poor. There's probably not any way to square the circle between "China and India want to increase emissions because they have a ton of desperately poor people they'd like to industrialize" and "the US won't agree to emissions cuts if China and India can continue to increase their emissions". There's REALLY no chance that you're going to get China and India to agree to let the EU levy a climate tariff on their goods.
No. If anything, other countries would specifically avoid making the retaliatory tariffs ones that would affect carbon-heavy industries. For one thing, the EU doesn't have a lot of those to begin with; kind of the point, right? But more importantly, the whole idea of the retaliatory tariff is that the other countries would be signaling that EU's carbon tariffs aren't legitimate to levy under WTO rules. To then target carbon-heavy exports with the retaliation would be a bad case of mixed messaging.
The major problem with this kind of approach is pretty simple: the WTO doesn't recognize "climate-related tariffs" as some kind of special category. Once the EU actually starts levying the tariff, other countries are going to go to the WTO with complaints, and those countries are going to win those complaints. The end result is going to be retaliatory tariffs against EU exports.
If you want to sell anything to the EU, these tariffs will produce huge pressure to decarbonise the entire industrial chain.
We can only ensure that our industrial chains decarbonise as much as possible, and anyone who wants to sell into the EU will need to adopt that too.
The EU plan is to apply this to all sources of steel, etc. including domestic ones, to force them into using low carbon manufacturing methods.
