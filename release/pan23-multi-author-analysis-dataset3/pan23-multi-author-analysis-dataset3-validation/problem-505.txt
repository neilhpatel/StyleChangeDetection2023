The claim, that the CIA funded the Taliban in the 1980s to fight the USSR, is false. This is for the primary reason that the Taliban did not exist.
Once communism was overthrown in Afghanistan, however, the arms and money did not vanish into thin air. The Taliban movement was formed, and it won to its cause numerous mujahadeen figures who had been trained, armed and funded by the American state. It also got arms and funding from Pakistan (again, which would have been a beneficiary of American aid) - essentially, while the US never directly backed the Taliban, it did back many of the tributaries that fed into its formation and composition. One need only take a look at its founders, Mohammed Omar and Abdul Ghani Baradar, both veteran mujahadeen fighters who served with Hezb-i Islami Khalis, which was one of the favoured groupings of the ISI (who distributed US weapons and funds). The Taliban would go on to receive direct support from Pakistan, so even if it was not US intention, they were indirectly supporting them.
How do you reconcile this connection with your assertion that the US did not fund the Taliban, it seemingly being a prominent splinter group of the at-the-time prominent rebels groups?
At the same time, the Taliban fought against groups who were more explicitly US-backed, such as the mujahadeen organised around Ahmad Shah Massoud who would go on to form the Northern Alliance, whom the US placed in power in 2001. So rather than American-backing of the Taliban, it was the fact that the United States flooded a country loaded with political instability and civil war with weapons and other means to wage war. And some of that inevitably made its way into Taliban hands as a legacy of US involvement, and the strategies of American allies.
A major country that was a US ally and that had a major influence in Afghanistan and Pakistan was Saudi Arabia. The form of very austere Islam that the Kingdom enforces internally (known widely as Wahhabism after Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, although its followers don't actually like the term) it also promoted abroad. Osama bin Laden, during the Soviet Afghan War, was not yet an outsider pledged to overthrow the Saudi monarchy, and had close ties to the royal family, and was able to raise funds there and in the Gulf.
