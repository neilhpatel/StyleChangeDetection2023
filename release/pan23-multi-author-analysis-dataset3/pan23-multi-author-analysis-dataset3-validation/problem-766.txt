Title: My grandfather passed after a stent was put in improperly. Do we have grounds for medical malpractice?
That said, poor outcomes and complications are not medical malpractice. It was a failure in communication to not explain to your family that all surgical procedures have both positive and negative outcomes, including death. Even if something was done incorrectly, one would have to prove that was the cause of his death. If he was having a stent placed, he may have already had a significant blockage (which the stent would hopefully fix). In addition, stents are not remotely as helpful as doctors and patients alike have long believed. They do not improve chest pain above placebo. They do not as significantly reduce mortality as was once thought (depending on the reason for placement, they may not reduce it at all).
I'm so sorry that your family is going through this. For your peace of mind, speak to a few medical malpractice lawyers.
I am glad that a doctor contacted you about this and provided documentation - given that, absolutely pursue it without delay. Initial consultations with attorneys are low cost. I would set up appointments speak to a few and find one your grandmother (and you if you will be helping her with this) feel comfortable working with (as this has the potential to be a long and emotionally exhausting process).
