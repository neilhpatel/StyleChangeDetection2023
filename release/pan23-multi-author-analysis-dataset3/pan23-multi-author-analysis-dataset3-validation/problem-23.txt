Scam! Someone posted here this scenario few weeks ago, after he was hired he was asked to work 60-70 hrs, he refused, so they fired him and asked him to pay the training money.
They want 6 weeks GROSS from you, so if you made 1k a week paid 250 in taxes and worked 6 weeks and they fired you you would have to pay them to have worked there. Over 6 weeks you earned 6k but paid 1500 in taxes so your take home was 4500, but they fired you so now they want 6k back, you paid them 1500 to work there.
What are they offering for this? I have seen things like this when there is a sign on bonus, the bonus is pro rated over X amount of years and you have to pay the bonus back pro rated if you quit/fired/whatever. I would tell them to go have intercourse with themselves if they are thinking you would sign this without some type of payout upfront from them. Telling you it's to pay them back for training/interviewing etc etc is bullshit. Those are employee churn costs and it is a hidden expense business' pay when their company sucks or pays a low wage and people keep bailing on them left and right.
Major red flag on this. This sounds to me that working for them sucks and they know it and want you to eat the churn costs.
