Weapon deliveries always take YEARS. The weapons that the United States sold to Taiwan under George W. Bush took 4 years to deliver. And that’s not taking into account the pandemic or the war in Ukraine.
President Biden has now come out and said the U.S. would defend Taiwan four times now. The last time during a tour across Asia, where he was likely briefed in advance of what was admissible. This serves as a clear message to China. That is, they would have to take on the U.S. if they dare move on Taiwan.
Comically is to assume that mainland china would start a full out war with Taiwan + the US over territory. Playing Anno is not a source my dude and economic dominance is the number one reason modern wars are fought. You seriously believe the US would protect Taiwan because of its territorial importance and sovereignty? Nothing about having complete control over the most valuable economic ressource (which Semis are) is simple. You should try to understand the impact it would have on everyone if TSMC would be Chinese, instead of thinking that some historical one china policy garbage that has been argued about for decades now, will be randomly enforced and possibly spiraling into a global war. Thats a joke!
lol, what a statement considering that all sanctions are aimed to hit china in that specific area. Why that? You probably think that China also wanted control over Hong-Kong for territorial reasons….
China claims Taiwan as a part of its territory and has long sought to bring it under its control. The Chinese government believes that Taiwan is a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland, by force if necessary. This belief is based on the idea that Taiwan has been a part of China for centuries, and that it is an integral part of China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The Chinese government has also argued that Taiwan's separation from the mainland is a legacy of China's history of foreign invasion and colonization, and that reunification is necessary to restore China's national dignity and unity. In addition, China's leaders see Taiwan as a strategic and economic asset, and believe that reunifying with Taiwan would give China greater influence in the region and the world.
There are also cultural and emotional factors at play in China's desire for reunification with Taiwan. Many people in China see Taiwan as a part of their shared cultural and historical heritage, and feel a strong emotional attachment to the island and its people.
As Taiwan is seen as a part of China historically and from a cultural point of view they have to get it back somehow or they will look weak to the belt of lesser loyal people and this could lead to a chain reaction of uprisings in those parts.
It makes the whole Taiwanese situation awkward, as here the interests of Taiwan and Western countries supply chain security concerns are at odd: the more the West becomes independent from Taiwan semiconductors, the less incentive there is to defend Taiwan in case of of a hot war.
But the West is indeed extremely warry of letting China having a hand on Taiwanese production - because if they do, China would have zero incentive to play nice with them, and especially with the US.
