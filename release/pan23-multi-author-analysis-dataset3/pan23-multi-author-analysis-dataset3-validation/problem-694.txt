so am copying an older answer in with some slight modifications (although phrasing reflects the original):
One infamous example I would use is that of Robert E. Lee. Although the popular image of him is that of the conflicted, but honorable, Southern gentleman who held a personal dislike for slavery, this is a fairly erroneous picture in a number of ways, but he is generally held up as a "nice" slave owner, which again, is an oxymoron. What I would focus on here specifically is his use of punishment though, specifically when to of the people that his family owned tried to escape and gain their freedom but were captured and brought back. He certainly didn't hold back on a whipping for either of them, and he supposedly ordered that the wounds be doused in salt-water afterwards as well for an additional burst of pain. Even if we talk only in comparative terms, and state that as far as slave owners go Lee was hardly the worst of them, that is small consolation to the two men who wanted only freedom, and were cruelly punished in their attempt to gain it. A slaveowner being "nice" only went so far as the enslaved persons accepted their place as a slave. A master may not have had to use the whip much, but that didn't change the fact that the enslaved persons were still enslaved, and that their status was held up by the inherent violence of the system.
That said, there are examples of slaveowners who came about in their thinking, and became abolitionists, and I would highlight as they in particular give force to the first statement.
I notice that throughout many of your responses, you use the word "enslavers" rather than "slaveowners", "slaveholders", "slavers", etc. that I've more commonly seen. Is there a particular reason for the use of "enslavers" rather than another term?
Now, to be clear, some enslavers were, by objective measures, less cruel than others. There is no disputing that, although it is hardly a mark in the institutions favor. Those forced to slog through Uncle Tom's Cabin in high school may recall how the uncertainty of ones' position, Tom for a time having a comparatively nice existence which then was pulled out from under him due to forces outside his control being one of the many evils described by the abolitionist tract. In point of fact that, to focus on that misses the point entirely of what slavery is, which is what the historian Orlando Patterson terms "social death". It is not just the loss of power, but the loss of self. Slave systems throughout history have varied greatly, but the status of the slave as a socially dead person is the most consistent part, as well as that makes any claim of "nice" or "family" ring hollow.
Southern plantations are a pretty complicated beast when it comes to how they engage with slavery in their history. I've toured several in my time, and some do a very good job about it I'd make a particular shout-out to Montpelier, which I have not had the opportunity to visit, but from what I understand is a masterclass in how to approach the matter. Others... not so much. I'm not familiar with Whitney Plantation and whether it reflects just the one tour guide doing a poor job, or the broader way that they (poorly) contextualize slavery as part of the standard presentation (given , I would assume the former?), but would point to if you are interested in my further musings on the southern plantation tour industry.
Also - I'm surprised that the Whitney Plantation has a tour guide selling the notion of nice slavery. I wonder if that guide is following the script. I would suggest the OP and discuss their experience.
