West Bank isnt in israel. Occupation soldiers arent cops any more than Russian occupation soldiers in Ukraine are cops.
And yes, nobody denies the legal right of Russian soldiers to kill Ukrainians, if they're actually defending themselves. Including the people who agree that the Russian invasion is completely illegal, but understand international law. In fact, including the Ukrainians themselves. They aren't arguing that every single Russian soldier that defended himself from a Ukrainian attack is a war criminal.
The issue is with Russian soldiers claiming to be only defending themselves, when they clearly weren't. That simply isn't the case here.
If Netanyahu boasted about ending the laws against cannabis use, and people were still arrested, indicted and jailed for smoking weed, it would mean those laws are still in place, and Netanyahu simply lied. I'd really like to see a defense lawyer telling the judge, "but your honor, Netanyahu boasted about it!".
Then we are talking about the same thing. Said innocent people die because Hamas uses their homes, schools, hospitals, roads, basements, offices etc. as military installations. Israel attacks them within its rights (though many many times it doesn't do so if there will be too many casualties). Also, Israel only attacks after Hamas does so, so it's a legal state of war brought on by Hamas against Israel's will, so that damage is self-inflicted.
