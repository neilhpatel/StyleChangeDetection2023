While I agree with your comment in general, I think your representation of Taiwan's political situation is wrong. In particular, it's not that "they never established sovereignty on a global-scale", it's that they lost such recognition. Taiwan (or rather, Republic of China) was the only China there was for decades, and even after the civil war and establishment of the PRC on the mainland, ROC was a permanent member of the UN SC until 1971. Your post seems to suggest that Taiwan is a separatist state trying to break away from "their former imperialist regime". No. Taiwan is the former imperialist regime.
Additionally, US de facto recognizes Taiwan as a state for decades. They have unofficial embassies in each others' countries, and US has treated Taiwan (or ROC rather) as its own country, even after US switched recognition in the 70s under Carter / Nixon.
The only reason the US or UN don’t officially recognize Taiwan is because China said they wouldn’t agree to any trade or be a part of the UN, otherwise.

It's also Taiwan why they don't recognize any Russia annexations. This whole debacle can only be resolved for them if they drop support for Russia, which in turn causes even bigger dilemmas for them.
