that’s so reductive it’s asinine. Bernie is older than Biden but in much better shape. the relevant data is Biden had his first brain aneurysm in the 80s IIRC. mental health is very important but age is just a number.
Of course, but health issues become much more common in as you age. Additionally, being President is physically taxing. All the things people typically do to extend their lives become more difficult to accomplish.
The problem is in 18 months his health could decline. I’d hate to be in a situation where he’s suddenly Fetterman on the campaign trail, and the conversation turns into “will be make it through a full second term?”.
Serious question, has an incumbent president ever won re-election when the vast majority of their own party doesn't want them to run again? If not, then I'd be skeptical he actually is the best chance.
Probably best if Biden doesn't run again as Carter is a great example of what happens when an incumbent president with high inflation runs again.
You can argue it will be different this time as long as nobody primaries Biden, but it seems more likely it was the inflation not the primary that did Carter in.
I suppose you could quibble on whether that is vast or not but when only one in 3 want him to run again that seems incredibly low and makes it hard to compare him to other incumbents.
