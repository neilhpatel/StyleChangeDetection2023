Bajan here...Barbados is still homophobic as fuck. Read the comments about this from Barbados Today or The Nation Barbados and you'll see just how much people hate anything LGBT there...
I hope no one would read this and take it as Barbados being LGBT friendly. This is like the lowest bar possible for LGBT rights (not to detract from it being great progress). A country decriminalizing gay sex means just yesterday they threw you in jail for it, and culture doesn't change overnight like laws do.
Yeah this was a judicial decision rather than a legislative one, so there's still a lot of societal changes to happen before the LGBT community can feel safe in the country.
You could ask any LGBT person, from any Latin American country, where homosexual marriage is entirely legal, how accepted they feel by their society.
Furthermore, pools conducted in the most progressive cities of said countries show that, even if the majority of people are OK with same-sex marriage, they're still against same-sex couples adopting or even raising children.
That shows you that, even if most, but not all, people, tolerate our existence, they still won't grant us basic rights, because we aren't normal people in their eyes, and we should be grateful that we are allowed to marry.
