You would be liable for 1 months rent and should have given 30 days notice. We tried to back out of a month to month rental agreement before moving in, and this is what was required since my partner had already signed the lease agreement.
I’m sure lots of people sign a lease though and then change their mind prior to moving in right?Are those people also obligated to pay first month rent and security deposit? My old apartment I signed the lease August 29th and moved in November 1st. If I had changed my mind after signing the lease and prior to moving in would they have been able to charge it to me anyways like she’s trying?
As for the lease it simply said we were allowed to paint. Nothing to specific on it. It wasn’t through a normal landlord it was something she had written up to fit out situation.
Thanks for your reply! I actually ended up talking to a lawyer and because I have written communication between her and I saying that the rental agreement was contingent on my buying the house and she agreed to it, he said I shouldn’t be responsible for not moving forward with the lease. Especially because there was no payment made to her.
