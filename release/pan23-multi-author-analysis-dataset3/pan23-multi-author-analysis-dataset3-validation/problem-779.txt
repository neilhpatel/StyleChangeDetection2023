1) I would notify your Dad in writing that if he doesn't return the funds in the next few days (specify specific date in message) that you'll be taking legal action. I expect this won't yield anything, but it'll help with the following and create a paper trail. Save a copy of this, also it's better if you send it via the mail, but email is legal too.
2) You need to contact the bank and let them know that the custodian on your account has committed fraud. Explain that you're an independent student and no longer live with them and that all funds deducted were not used for your benefit and is now causing financial hardship. Ask to have records of the withdrawals showing his information. Then ask he be removed from the account and get it confirmed in writing. Feel free to note the above action you took in Step 1 and lack of response.
I'm citing this because the account was created when they were a minor which means the account should've been converted by the bank to a non-minor account when they turned 18.
I'm sorry that this happened to you but it is unlikely the bank will be much help aside from getting you a new account set up in just your name.
Edit: Also, if all your money is gone don't link your current account to the new one. That would keep him from transferring money out from your new account to your old one.
The only real advice is to get a new bank account and one that one or take your name off it. I would also cut ties as it toxic. He wants you to come running back- they thrive on your dependency on him. Don't give in.
