Recommendations for educated layperson level reading about the intrigues and dramas of this era? It seems genuinely fascinating, but also often sensationalized. Thank you!
Thanks Appreciate it. The background of the plotters is pretty convincing as we've seen that pattern in other historical events. Also "Never attribute to malice, that which could be attributed to incompetence" so you've certainly talked me round.
Thanks for including a new idea; mentioning the complicated nature of the double agents, who, for all we know, double crossed themselves to get more double agent work.
The answer I have included ‘God’s Secret Agents’ which I would say is a fascinating insight into the era and the complicated nature of the politics of the groups.
The real stigmatisation came after the Great Fire of London some decades later. The fire was falsely blamed upon Catholic’s, and this led to Guy Fawkes really becoming the face to all faceless plots that existed in the minds of a fearful and somewhat bigoted public.
Fawkes became a figure that became identified as ‘the enemy’; any and all sense of reality of the man was lost; and he became iconic. But not in the modern sense. The ‘Guy’ became any straw filled figure, the symbolic target of the bonfires that erupted around the season.
