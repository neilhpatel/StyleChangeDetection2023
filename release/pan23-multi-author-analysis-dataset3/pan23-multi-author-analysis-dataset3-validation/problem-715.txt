no. but for something someone wants to label "the greatest film of all time." i'd have expected to have atleast heard about it before now. i've studied film, and cinematography. i come from an acting and film background. i work professionally in lighting for film/events. i enjoy cinema. so i dunno, i figured if its such hot shit id have heard of it.
no, but i have watched a lot of movies. ive taken classes on classic film and cinemetography. i enjoy foreign films as well even if im a little less familiar. so i'm suprised ive never heard of it before.
and the quick interviews ive seen of people discussing the film... well they all come across as overly full of themselves.
im actually taking a break from watching it right now to reply to you. its.... interesting and artistic. but i don't think i quite agree with it being the greatest film EVARRRR.
You cannot ask them to discard movies that they consider great but that don't have a mainstream appeal.
Wtf lol. The number of voters is around double than it was. Please explain how it can be "almost all of the same people" if most of them are new.
