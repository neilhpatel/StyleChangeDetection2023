There's an outside chance just enough Republican representatives won't vote for him as Speaker. The ENTIRE House votes for Speaker, and all Democrats will vote against McCarthy. If 5 Republicans refuse to vote for him, he doesn't become Speaker. As it is, whoever becomes Speaker in the 118th Congress will have a harder time than Boehner did in 2015.
Some Republicans may not vote for McCarthy, but there isn't a chance in Hell any of them would vote for a Democrat as Speaker. It'd be send a gilt-edged invitation to be primaried in 2024, a primary they'd almost certainly lose. IOW, only Republicans who'd decided to retire in 2024 would even consider doing so.
We'll probably end up with a few House Republicans that will find themselves in positions of influence like Synema and Manchin were in the Senate the last two years.
The only realistic chance of blocking McCarthy is for the Dems to nominate a moderate, vote in lockstep, and peel off 5 Republicans.
There is a slim to none chance that the more centrist assholes would try to convince 5 Rs and all the Dems to vote for one of them to avoid a MAGA leader.
It won't happen because Rs have no spine and will fall in line and for a lot of the Dems, they view a MAGA asshole leader fucking things up in the house is good for the 2024 election.
Not if the Republican majority in the House of Representatives does nothing more than fling poo for the next 2 years. There's the small hope that McCarthy and the GQP Qaucus make Republicans more generally objects of derision.
