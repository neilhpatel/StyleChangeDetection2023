You need to talk to HR/management. It's illegal for them to edit your timecard to not pay you for time worked, however it's perfectly legal for them to have a policy of not allowing overtime/skipping lunch without pre-approval and can fire you for ignoring policy (but would still owe you for all hours worked).
Sorry, my bad lol. No a policy doesnt have to be written. An employer would have troubles in court if they tried to hide their policy or constantly change it to confuse employees, but otherwise policy is whatever a company says it is when they say it.
Hence the point that you need to talk to HR/management to understand the policy. It is rare that employees get to choose to work overtime or skip lunches when they want. You never said you had approval so I assume you just did this on your own.
If you want something written for your own legal defense then write up your understanding of the policy and email it to HR asking for their confirmation.
would this apply if there is no actual written policy on the matter? what if the manager just decided one day to no longer allow over time, and that skipping lunches without approval would result in termination, but that's not in the company policy or handbook?
