I’m just saying that financially it would make sense for OP to consider all the financial outcomes of each option as well as consider the time commitment before rushing into a lawsuit. To clarify, I am in no way denying that what the landlord did was illegal. This is definitely something that could be brought forth in a lawsuit if OP desires to go that route. I am just pointing out that sometimes in both a legal and financial aspect, other avenues/compromises may be worth considering.
Truthfully, it may be easier for you and the landlord to agree that it was an early termination fee and get the deposit back, just from a money and time standpoint with the whole legal process. Figure out what option works out best for you mathematically and if working it out privately is better, try that first before you go full send on a lawsuit.
So, she illegally evicted you the moment the locks were changed. You can sue for any rent that you paid from the point where you couldn’t access the apartment, and for your deposit back since she now cannot prove what damage if any was caused by you.
It was illegal for the landlord to remove their ability to access for a reno in the first place regardless of any agreement, and therefore rent for that period should be returned. Any agreement to lose access would have been void under the tenancy laws and constituted an early end to tenancy by the landlord when they started renovating.
