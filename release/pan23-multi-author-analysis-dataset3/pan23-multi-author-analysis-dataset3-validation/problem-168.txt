But if it can't simply be denied in California, they must have a reason; a restaurant that is busiest in November and December may disallow use of vacation time during those months, or a business can prevent more than X% of the workforce from vacationing at the same time. These are reasonable for businesses, as they do need to be able to operate. But saying only one person in ten can be gone at a time AND only during two specific months would not be permitted, as there's no way for all employees to actually receive it.
This is especially true if vacation time is capped, because California considers it as part of employees' legal wages, not just a benefit.
I'm not sure CA employers are required to approve vacation or be reasonable about it, or to give a reason at all.
It also allows them to place a reasonable\ cap on accrued vacation usage, with any earned once the cap is reached being forfeited. They are allowed even more freedom if, rather than forfeiting the time, it is paid out as wages at the active rate of pay.
\ "If implementation of a "cap" is a subterfuge to deny employees vacation or vacation benefits, the policy will not be recognized by the Labor Commissioner." - the California Labor Board. I suspect denying all claims for an extended time with forfeiture at cap would be a problem; denying them with payout at cap likely would be fine.
