Although satellites catch new very small ones, a new volcanic island in the North Atlantic or somewhere, the short answer for bigger land masses would be, no. That had been sorted out quite a long time beforehand. For the first several hundred years of European exploration there had been , to the contrary, quite a number of anomalous sightings of islands- a lookout on the dawn watch sees what he thinks is a shoreline at the foggy horizon, and a note is made in the log but the ship doesn't get any closer, or (because accurate means of measuring longitude happened only in the mid 18th c.), an island is seen in two locations on two different voyages by two different captains, and given two different names. This resulted in the listing of quite a number of islands that were not there. But as recordkeeping and navigation improved, ships that were blown off course could definitively say that they were at a location, and there was really no island there. And of course, if there was an island placed on a chart, and they thought they were being blown into it, they would naturally make a note on the chart that it didn't exist. Those imaginary islands slowly got crossed off the charts.
Do you know what happens with newly discovered islands like this? Like, does a country claim it? Can a person claim it? Is it like Antarctica and no one can claim it?
No acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica or create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica. No new claim, or enlargement of an existing claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force.
Some Treaty Parties do not recognise territorial claims and others maintain that they reserve the right to make a claim. All positions are explicitly protected in Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty, which preserves the status quo:
