One, Emancipation led to German Jews assimilating. For example, after Emancipation, they were required to take last names: one of the most common name choices were Germanic sounding names, like "Berg". Also, because of Emancipation, many Jews from more restrictive places - especially Poland and the Russian Empire - fled to Germany in search of a better life. This is one of the reasons: classic Xenophobia, i.e. "strange" or "foreign" people moving in in large numbers. In this case, it was Eastern European Jews moving westwards in search of a better life.
In other words, the reason for Pre War German Antisemitism can be compared to violence against Black People in the Post Civil War era. After the end of Slavery, American Black People tried and in many cases, succeeded to better themselves and climb up the Social ladder. Hence, we had things like the Black Wall Street in Tulsa, one of the most prosperous Black Neighborhoods/Communities in the Country. White Americans felt threatened by Black Prosperity and wanted a return to the days of Slavery, when Black People "knew their place", hence the Tulsa race riot and American laws designed to cheat Black People.
Antisemitism isn't really that different from other forms of Racism. Antisemites simply don't like Jews, and their "dislike" was highly influenced by the perceived "threat" Jews posed to them economically. Which was why many of the early Nazi Era Anti Jewish Laws were economic in nature, designed to reverse what the Nazis believed were "Ill gotten gains".
This delusion of an internationalist conspiracy would finally result in the Nazis’ Holocaust killing vast numbers of Jews and those made Jews by the Nazi’s racial laws. While this form of antisemitism lost some of its mass appeal in the years after 1945, forms of it still live on, mostly in the charge of conspiracy so central to the modern form of antisemitism: from instances such as the Moscow doctors’ trial, to prevalent discourses about Jews belonging to no nation, to discourses related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to the recent surges of antisemitic violence in various states – antisemitism didn’t disappear after the end of the Holocaust. Even the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the conspiratorial pamphlet debunked soon after it was written at the beginning of the 20th century, has been consistently in print throughout the world ever since.
The essential point that needs to be emphasized: the reason for anti-Jewish hatred and persecution has absolutely nothing to do with things Jewish men and women did, said or thought. Religious and racial persecution is not the fault of the victim but of the persecutor and antisemitism, like all prejudices, is inherently irrational. Framing history in a manner that places the reason for racial hatred with its victims is a technique frequently employed by racists to justify their hateful ideology.
Racist thinkers of the 19th century augmented these new barriers and prejudices with conspiratorial thinking. The best example for this antisemitic delusion are the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fake political treatise produced by the Tsarist Secret Police at some point in 1904/05 which pretends to be the minutes of a meeting of the leaders of a Jewish world conspiracy discussing plans to get rid of all the world's nations and take over the world. While the Protocols were quickly debunked as a forgery, they had a huge impact on many antisemitic and völkisch thinkers in Europe, including some whose writings were most likely read by the young Hitler.

It seems you are asking about the background and reasons of anti-Jewish and/or antisemitic sentiment throughout history. Posts of this type are common on the subreddit, so we have this reply which is intended as a general response that provides an overview of the history of antisemitic thought and action.
No, this is actually a macro we post to such questions about the origins of antisemitism. I believe it was mainly or entirely written by /u/hannahstohelit.
