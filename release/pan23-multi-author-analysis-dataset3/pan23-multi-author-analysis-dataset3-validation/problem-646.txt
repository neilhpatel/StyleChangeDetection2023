Well, unless the friend was in the interview room with the cops, he can't be sure what he told the cops, like did he try to implicate the friend to get a better deal. The friend should consult a criminal defense lawyer and shouldn't speak to the police unless his attorney advises it.
Obviously OP's friend is advised to ask that very question of a qualified Texas lawyer, which I am not. A google search though shows that Texas allows at fault divorces for a number of reasons with the two most likely to be relevant being "abandonment" and "felony conviction.".
Yeah. I've now talked to him about doing so now that I've received that advice. I guess he didn't even consider that it might have been just another manipulation.
That's what I've told him. That outlet is being exhausted. He's already talking to two family attorneys on the matter out of the nearest larger city. This post is mostly to figure out what to expect.
Already inbound but truthfully, in west Texas, even those who have passed the bar have the equivalent of a high school diploma in the rest of the civilized world so I thought I might see what people thought might occur in such a situation.
