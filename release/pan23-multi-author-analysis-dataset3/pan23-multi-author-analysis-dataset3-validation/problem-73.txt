(Based on your inclusion of "duke" I am assuming you are focusing your question in Western history).
So the issue there is that while Victor (to stick with our example) was a prince of another territory, but that does not make Savoy a principality. Similarly, when Sardinia was obtained by Victor, Savoy did not become a kingdom. It was ruled by a man who was a king, but that king was the Duke of Savoy, and thus was sovereign of the duchy. Victor could style himself as Prince of Piedmont, but his main source of power was as Duke of Savoy.
Ok then, let's take the case of the Duchy of Savoy. They have been elevated from County by the HR Emperor, and have been awarded a few more territories on both sides of the western Alps. Throughout its history, the Duchy has been orbiting between the Spanish and French court, depending on political gains (or inability to prevent other people political interventions on their own affairs). But they had to wait until the 19th century to proclaim themselves Kingdom until they acquired Sardinia, at what point they proclaimed themselves Kingdom of Sardinia even though they would never set foot on the island until Napoleon invaded.
But could he have been able to do so if a Kingdom of Sardinia weren't established yet (or if there have been no other handy de iure Kingdoms available in the area)? The Dukes of Savoy have also been Princes of Acaja since the 12th-13th century but never styled themselves as princes. Was there a need to be granted a de iure title in order for Victor Amadeus II to be crowned king?
