That's what it feels like to me too. The employer is framing it more as "this isn't working out, but I can offer you this lesser pay to tide you over until you figure out where you're going next". Which just doesn't make a ton of sense because if it's not working out, why keep him on staff at all?
Thank you for your thoughts. If he doesn't end up continuing as a contractor I'll make sure he knows to put up a fight to get his unemployment.
Thank you for your thoughts. As I understand it, the termination of the salaried position was definitive, and the offer of the contract role was made at the same time. But he was not given an ultimatum like you were describing. It was more "your salaried position is over, but we want to help you out, so we can offer you this lesser pay until you find something new". Which is kind of nice of them in theory, but it's putting him in the position of working for way less than he's worth instead of collecting unemployment and having more time to job search.
It also puts him in the position of saying he's currently employed while job searching though which looks more attractive to potential employers. That could be how they feel they are helping him out. Walking into an interview saying you are choosing to leave for xyz reason is much easier than saying you were fired because the last job just didn't work out.
