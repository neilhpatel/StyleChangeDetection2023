I was daydreaming about this today. Please, Donald, use that ridiculously inflated ego of yours to run as an Independent who siphons off the DeSantis vote.
You and I had the exact same thought The idea of trump running as a 3rd party candidate to pull votes away from Desantis just gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.
My big question is if DeSantis runs in the presidential race, will he garner more support than Trump? Or is he so similar that he won't have national appeal? He's currently feuding with Trump last I heard, but he also aligns with Trumpism in a lot of ways. I wonder if national voters would reject DeSantis as vehemently as they are rejecting Trumpism in the midterms.
I think many voters reject Trump specifically because he’s insane in the membrane. Even apolitical people got tired of him constantly wanting attention. DeSantis is less off the rails than Trump, and he’s got good PR/advertising people working for him, so I think he could get independent votes.
I know that, and it highlights how fucked up our election system is. We vote for the candidates handpicked by rich people. In a fair system, there would be no donor money coming in, every candidate gets the same amount of air time and what not.
The sad thing is, a lot of people want the insanity, so technically we still have a 2 party system… I’m just depressed that here in Florida, the insanity won. Totally expected it, but still bummed.
Not surprising DeSantis won by a huge margin since we’ve been getting inundated by DeSantis ads since July or August, with barely nothing from the Crist campaign. Seems like the DNC gave up in Florida.
