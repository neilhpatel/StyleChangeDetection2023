Keep in mind Russia is essentially a mafia state. The more violent, vicious and terrifying someone is the more likely they'll get power. Then they stay in power by having everyone else either so terrified of them they won't cross them or the problem individuals get brutally murdered.
If someone were crazy enough in Russia and felt that was a better alternative for themselves and didn't care about anyone else, who knows.
Imagine if the US did, in fact, say they will carry out this attack if Russia doesn't remove Putin from office in the interest of global stability. Russia would be like, "Damn, maybe we should have him removed.".
Yep. The Ukraine defense extortion and Hunter Biden stuff kinda came out of nowhere in the Trump drama, and it's only in retrospect that it was in some sense telegraphing Russia's intent. It was a lingering question that has an answer now - Russia was counting on Trump to hamstring Ukraine's defenses for the upcoming invasion.
It’s not the US or NATO that Putin has to worry about; it’s the angry Russians who’ve been impoverished in the past year by Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine.
