It's unlikely they will need to turn of power to the entire unit. Probably only a few circuits. The landlord cannot cut off power to your unit.
Your lease should detail what parts of the property you are entitled to use. If putting up this door would hinder access to parts of your unit, that would be a violation. If the renovations are occurring in a common area, the landlord is within their rights.
I'd send the landlord a letter stating that they would be in violation of the lease if they proceeded with the renovation. If they're still insistent that this begins before your lease term is up, you may need to speak with an attorney who handles landlord/tenant disputes.
In our lease it states they may not enter without our consent unless it is for emergency repairs/maintenance, to show the house to prospective renters, buyers, etc, and requests made by the tenant (us).
We tried to negotiate termination of the lease before construction began, they declined and stated we could move our things out prior to construction. Essentially they are stating we can live without a bed, couches, etc for an undetermined amount of time.
