I wonder how the sixth amendment would play into a situation like this. You have a right to a SPEEDY trial. Four factors involved are lenh of delay (3yrs seems unreasonable), reason for the delay (it appears no reason has been given to op), time and manner in which the defendant has asserted their right (I’m assuming op hasn’t already waived this right), and Degree of prejudice to the defendant which the delay has caused (Id assume the repeated travel invokes some degree of prejudice).
Even a short delay might be unconstitutional if the trial was delayed on purpose and, as a result, a defendant’s opportunity to defend himself or herself has been harmed (for example, if an important witness dies during the delay). A longer delay might not be a violation because it was by accident or due to uncontrollable events (like COVID) and because no witnesses or evidence have been lost during the delay.
Others have mentioned a possible 6th Amendment defense for right to a speedy trial. I don't think that would work. The SCOTUS has previously held that there is no set amount of time for a trial to qualify as “speedy.” Instead, the court ruled that a number of factors must be used to decide whether the Sixth Amendment right was violated: (1) lenh of the delay, (2) reason for the delay, (3) the defendant’s request for the right (i.e. did he or she protest during the delay), and (4) whether the delay hurt the defendant’s ability to receive a fair trial.
You're close: the Sixth Amendment doesn't provide a right to a speedy trial because it only applies in criminal cases (including misdemeanors). People v. Madeyski (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 659, 664; also see . Traffic tickets are civil infractions, so no constitutional right to a speedy trial.
Doesn't the right to a speedy trial only apply to felony cases under the federal Constitution? Also, even if it applies to misdemeanors, a traffic violation might not even qualify. Depending on the state it's a civil infraction.
