Disclaimer: I have not done much research on 18th century French history. However, I will address your question regarding population and revolutionary violence through the lens of the relationship between population and wages. I am an Economics student at the University of Michigan finishing the last 4 credits of my undergraduate.
Bonus application: in events where you have a single exogenous shift in economic production, you will eventually end up with more people, but the same pre-innovation wages. If you subscribe to Malthusian philosophy, you understand that wages and standard of living were relatively constant for thousands of years until the Industrial Revolution, where compounding and constant technological innovation allows us to live lives with much higher standard of living than 100 years ago.
TL;DR - Suppose you have an economic boom for France around 1750-1770. Their birth rate rises and death rate falls, and thus population rises relatively dramatically during that period. However, that heightened population starts putting downward pressure on wages toward the 1780s and 1790s, and you potentially get heightened civil unrest (as product of falling wages) that culminates in the French Revolution.
I’d be fascinated to know if there’s any scholarship on whether this population boom impacted the subsequent revolutionary violence in France, especially in light of the preceding crop failures that I’ve heard contributed to the population’s dissatisfaction with their rulers. I regret that I know next to nothing about the history of France, so I apologize if this is a rudimentary question.
You can look at the , which was starting to become obsolete around the time of the French Revolution but still provides some useful insight.
