Document everything, what lights were deactivated and what they meant. It could be nothing but it could be the dealership trying to hide a lemon.
Personally I would take it to a reputable shop that isn't the one you got the Toyota from. Explain to them you are worried that the dash lights may have been tampered with and you want to check and make sure. Deactivating lights like that could be a sign something fishy is going on like an engine problem or electrical issues.
Tampering with a the check engine light that reports to the driver engine problem conditions would be a big deal. I’m not sure there’s a law governing oil change reminder lights. What year and model car?
I think your post title and OP may have spun this up bigger than it is. Especially on the gap between a service engine light and an oil change indicator.
This sounds to me more like someone set the oil change reminder to never. In that case you’d ask a Kia dealer to change it to your preferred interval.
Disreputable dealers have been know to disable a service engine light. That’s a big deal and would call for you to do aggressive things.
