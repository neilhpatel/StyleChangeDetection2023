For real though can anyone tell me how the 2003 invasion of iraq was just? Is it just as illegal as the 2022 invasion of ukraine or only slightly less illegal?
They aren't righteous. They know it's wrong, but when the people telling you to not buy oil due to an illegal invasion also did an illegal invasion and cared not for what the rest of the world thinks.
It's wrong to buy Russian oil, it's a fucking war and the world is leaning on Russia, India is literally just being trash In this choice, be with the world or be greedy, India chose greed nothing else.
India would make a huge strategic mistake boycotting Russian ressources but y'all are too focus insulting everyone that doesn't align 100% with your side to see the whole picture.
It’s odd seeing people defend India for acting in their best interest (buying from Russia) and then condemning the USA for acting in its best interest (pressuring countries to stop buying from Russia). Same goes for the opposite argument. Either argue countries should act selfishly or don’t. Just don’t be the guy saying “it’s okay for me and not for you”, cause y’all just look foolish.
