You know what an offer is. "Acceptance" means you must agree to be bound by the contract, you must have the mental and legal capacity to enter into the contracts, and you entered into the contract knowingly by your own free will. So if someone tricks you into signing a contract after drugging you, that's not enforceable. If someone forces you to sign at gunpoint, that's also not enforceable. If you are declared insane ("incompetent") by a court, then contracts you sign are also probably not enforceable.
Okay, so he quite possibly has a legally binding oral contract without need for the written contract at all. The state is relevant, as a few states do require a written contract for tenancies over a year. If he’s not in one of those states, and his ex can prove that an oral agreement existed, his ex can possibly successfully sue him to recover the unpaid rent. Whether he was a valid sub tenant might matter.
1) Why do they feel he should be responsible for half the lease? Is he on the lease or otherwise obligated to it? 2) contracts need consideration to be valid. Consideration is basically the thing that both parties get out of an agreement. If your friend is getting nothing out of the agreement, it probably doesn’t constitute a valid contract.
