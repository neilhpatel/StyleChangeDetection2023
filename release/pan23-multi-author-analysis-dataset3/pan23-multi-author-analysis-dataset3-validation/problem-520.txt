I wonder how that was the flagship. From what I read, the Moskva (sp?) was only partially operational. The equipment was antiquated. The hull leaky and never fully patched up.
That is quite likely considering the kind of "training" we've seen or heard of from this army. Russian soldiers either lack the teaching or discipline to sabotage their weapons before abandoning them in enemy territory. I don't mean their rifles but like tanks and similar vehicles of war. Hundreds of their own abandoned tanks are now being used by Ukraine against them.
This why the Ukrainians should destroy as many retreating troops as possible. Russia did not call for green zone. And the Russian occupiers are committing hostile acts on their way out.
Ha ha, remember when Russia could invade a country like Ukraine across 1000 km of front and attack on multiple axes?
Russia has never significantly outnumbered the Ukrainians on the ground, which is not a position you want to be in as an invader when time is against you. Once they failed to force a quick capitulation by storming Kyiv they were pretty fucked.
They are trying to retroactively address their manpower issues but it's inherently easier for Ukraine to mobilize large numbers because of less logistical challenges due to defending their own territory, western training support, and the obviously fact that they are fighting a war for their very existence while the Russians are fighting a fairly pointless war of aggression and naked expansionism.
