Thanks for the advice fam. Will definitely give them a call. I had the same thought to record or voice record our next convo. Would have this morning but didn’t anticipate this happening. I’ve heard neighbors say he’s a sick but I was in disbelief when he started going nuts.
So to clarify, if a street is public, anyone has the right to block it and anyone who hopes to have it unblocked is out of line for trying to tow these vehicles.
If he is blocking the driveway such that you can’t get a car through, ie overlapping your driveway, thats likely not legal and you can call for a tow.
if they are blocking a driveway, maybe. but it sounds like the problem was big equipment, not him blocking your driveway.
Is it blocked, like cars cannot drive through, or is there just not enough room for the large construction equipment you want? Because your contractor should be well aware that almost all towns have a simple permitting process that will prevent parking during construction to allow larger equipment to go through.
