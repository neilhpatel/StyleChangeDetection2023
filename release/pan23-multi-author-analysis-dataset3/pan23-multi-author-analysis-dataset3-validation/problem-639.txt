Debt to rebuild and discount for American and European companies? Sure but the arms they give to Ukraine now are mostly gifts with no debt and not lend leases (although even those aren't that bad, Britain paid their last payment only a couple years ago without it affecting much of their rebuilding) .
To be fair, the funding sources aren't very clear, but the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, that has been set up to send Aid to Ukraine on wikipedia points to it's source of funding to be the Lend lease. This way all funding, can be referred to as Aid, even if it's a loan.
In this article it states that the Aid has totalled 850million, the other 21 billion is from the Presidents drawdown, in other words the lend lease.
So if you're a solider in Ukraine now, you have the option to keep fighting, and if you live then after that you get to work for the US on the gas fields to pay back the debt.
It's of course also not mentioned in the propaganda how Ukraine will pay it's debt, but the deals are already done, they will pay from Gas royalties. Which is what this war is actually about, resources.
