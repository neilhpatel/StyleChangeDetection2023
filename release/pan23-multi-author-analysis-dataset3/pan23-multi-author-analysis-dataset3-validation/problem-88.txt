NAL, but the only money your mother couldn't touch was the trust. As you said, most of that is put away (she can't legally touch the trust unless it says she could) life insurance is different. As a minor I believe your mom can use the money for your care (in addition to funeral costs, settling grandma's estate, etc) but that would depend on the actual document (the terms and conditions) of the life insurance. It could be your mother was also a beneficiary (if grandma was her mom).
If the money wasn't tied up in a trust, it's legal for your mom to spend it on your upkeep. And it's really hard to pin down what is spent on you vs what is spent on her. You have to have a place to live, and you live together, so bang, rent is a cost of your upkeep. She has to get you to school and such, so the car is a cost of your upkeep. Even if you managed to get this in front of a judge, a judge might look at $125K/year as reasonable living expenses from the perspective of a person with an advanced degree and a good income.
Because since you are under 18, your consent isn't legally required. And unless she has no money at all of her own, it's really hard to say she spent your money on the photos vs. hers. And if she uses the laptop to monitor your school performance, then ta da, she can say it's for your upkeep.
