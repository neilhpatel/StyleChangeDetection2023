The rep from my district has been the same republican douche for like 20 years. My parents still live there so I checked how the states elections went and holy shit their rep got unseated by a democrat!
I will say, at least we flipped 2 seats to the Democrats in Ohio. Kaptur was supposed to be a vulnerable incumbent, and she won by 13 points. She won counties Tim Ryan didn’t win. (Erie and Wood) Still we’re horribly gerrymandered, because 10 Republican seats and 5 Democratic seats is not an accurate reflection of how Ohio votes.
Any clear-headed Republican who isn't in a ruby red district just got a wake-up call about their next election. They've gotta stop emulating Marjorie Taylor Greene if they want to have a long prosperous career.
But, even if the GOP narrowly takes the House, I think it'll be hard for McCarthy to hold his caucus together after his party was so clearly rebuked in these midterms.
I'd love to see Congress work well for a couple years & if the GOP has slightly more than half a brain they'll need to come back closer to centrists to win voters back.
One possible thing about just the house going slim GOP is that there's a couple congressmen that'll vote w/Dem for reasonable bills introduced by Dems... But anything that's introduced by the GOP will not pull anyone from Dem over, it'll all be too far right.
Or they could keep dry fucking us with attempts at fascism... Something tells me this'll be the case.
And with the Senate being a possible 51-49 Dem majority any far right bill is dead in the water anyway.
