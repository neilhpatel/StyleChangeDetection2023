Leo Tolstoy wrote the book , which was published in 1894 in Germany after Russia banned it. It’s a book about the idea of universal love. Christian anarchists believe the state is founded on violence, in opposition to the Sermon on the Mount by Jesus, and Jesus saying to love thy enemies. Matthew 5:9 says “Blessed are the peacemakers…” The title of the book is based on Luke 17:21. Luke 17:20-21 says “And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here or, lo there for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” (In the Gospel of Thomas in the Nag Hammadi Library discovered in 1945, Jesus says “The Kingdom is inside You and outside You.” allegedly said “What you are looking for is what is looking.” Thich Nhat Hanh said “What you are looking for is already in you.”) Tolstoy believed that when Jesus said to turn the other cheek and love thy enemies, it means giving up violence, even in defense, and giving up revenge, and he believed Jesus practiced non-violent resistance, and that any country or government that wages war is against Christian ethics. At the time, the Russian Orthodox Church was merged with the Russian state and totally subservient to the state, but Tolstoy believed the Church was not teaching the true teachings of Jesus. Gandhi listed the book as one of the 3 most important modern influences in his life. Gandhi wrote letters to Tolstoy. Wikipedia says:
But modern evangelical Christians in America — who fetishize guns, who blindly fall in line and tend to be authoritarian, who hold contempt for the poor, who pray in public to be seen by others, who think abortion is a sin (even though Jesus never said abortion is a sin), who seek to punish women (rather than following Jesus who said let he who is without sin cast the first stone), who want revenge (even though Jesus condemned “eye for an eye”), who worship false idols — are the hypocrites Jesus condemned. Jesus condemned hypocrites who appear on the outside like whitewashed tombs but on the inside contain the bones of the dead and everything unclean. Jesus condemned those who focus on the mote in someone else’s eye while ignoring the beam in their own eye. Jesus said “love thy neighbor as thyself.” Matthew 6:15 says “But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.”.
Sadly, there are true Christians in our country, who deeply believe in Christ’s many commandments to love their neighbor, the poor, the enemies, etc.
The Christian left believes religion is a prescription to center your life on loving your neighbor and helping the opressed.
