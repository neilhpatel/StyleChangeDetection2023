It's not even about what the crazies believe. Many of Fox's viewers don't want to hear or see the truth if it conflicts with their worldview.
I will say, though, that I doubt this will make any Fox viewer change the channel. For one, they have created a situation in which any outlet that covers this story can be dismissed as fake news -- even the AP. And secondly, people tune in to Fox for the sugar rush of finding enemies and feigning white persecution -- not really for sound journalism.
I am glad that a wide range of outlets have decided to pick up this story about how Fox News knowingly lied to its viewers and how it only exists as a propaganda outlet for the Republican Party.
Of course, this while situation doesn’t stop the new situation that Fox has created themselves - ultra right wing news that peddle lies even more than Fox. There though, hopefully the case against Fox creates various precedent, opening these shit holes to legal attack as well.
Not American, but this shit and Fox seem indicative of the entire problem you guys have. Hopefully any punitive measures on Fox gets them to change their tone permanently (it can’t simply be a case that “other companies tell the truth but that market is fully saturated there; so we must tell lies so we get other - and more potentially - viewers), or if not, at least scare them enough to be good for a few years till everyone forgets.
