Wait huh? I deposited the first one last week and used the money. The second one came today and that’s the one I accidentally deposited cUse I didn’t realize it was a duplicate of the first check I had already cashed and spent.
Well let me rephrase….whatever check has the earlier date will end up bouncing since the IRS would have cancelled that check and sent you a second check. I’m not sure which one you actually received first but the earlier date one will be cancelled as they would have issued a stop payment on the check number.
No. The first check will bounce back as it was cancelled. The second one will go through. That’ll be the end of it. Your bank will likely charge you a returned check fee.
When you deposit a check, the bank provides you that money until the check clears. If the check doesn't clear, the bank removes that money from your account.
If you've spent that money and the check doesn't clear, the bank still takes the money out of your account. If you don't have enough in your account, your account goes into the negative. This is how a lot of scams operate -- they send you a fake check, ask you to send them back a part of the check, and then you end up losing that money.
