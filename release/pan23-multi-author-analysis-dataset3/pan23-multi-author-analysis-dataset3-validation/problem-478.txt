As it should. Giving (limited) money to poor people is like hitting the refresh button on supply and demand.
I'm proposing we do what we already do in the way of food stamps but with actual cash, you do know that stores get money for food stamps and it helps their profits right? It helps supply reach demand.
"if you give your employees less than the amount they need to pay their rent, you will be richer than if you did pay them enough to pay their rent.".
Yep. Except union memberships have been plummeting around the world for years. Governments and their super rich benefactors have done a bang-up job scaring people of unions. The media portrays them as this greedy nuisance only concerned with disrupting daily life for the rest of us hard-working folk by going on strikes all the time. Most kids coming out of school today are anti-union because they genuinely believe they can negotiate better salaries and benefits for themselves than they could collectively. And the boomers believe that being a member of a union is akin to being a member of the communist party.
Edit: This is honestly like saying the US is in a union and therefore socialist. It's nonsensical. The EU is the largest free-trade bloc in the world, with freely moving capital, labour, services, and goods; anathema to most state-based economic controls. Its members are more likely to use insurance models rather than single-payer healthcare like the UK, and a couple actually have a lower tax:GDP ratio than the US.
