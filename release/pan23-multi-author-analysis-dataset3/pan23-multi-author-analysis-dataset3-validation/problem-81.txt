This question better suits /r/askscience, since the answer you're looking for is based on the molecular structure of soap. However, let me give you an answer regarding the way soap works and why "we got really lucky". (I hope this doesn't break the rules of the sub, since it's not really focused on history. If it does break the rules, please delete.).
Soap can be produced through different processes and with different ingredients, but virtually all soap has one thing in common: the individual soap molecules have a hydrophilic (water-loving) & lipophobic (oil-fearing) head and a lipophilic (oil-loving) & hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail. This molecule structure enables soap and water to remove oily substances from surfaces, which water alone can not clean.
Detergent means a synthesized product that helps clean (especially oily dirt, with the aid of water). “Soap” encapsulates a much narrower set of materials that fit the same description.
To further clarify, the antimicrobial properties of soap are largely trivial to the actual usefulness of soap. If it had zero antimicrobial properties it would be just as useful. Soap gets things clean because it breaks up oil and allows water to wash it away. Killing microbes has nothing to do with the benefits of soap.
I feel like this question assumes that the important part of soap is it's ability to kill microbes, which is a widespread incorrect assumption. Soaps primary role in cleaning you is as a surfactant. This is the same process that cleans your pan, and it's what leaves our hands largely germ free.
