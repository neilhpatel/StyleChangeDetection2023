Wife and I went through a similar scenario. Incomplete miscarriage at 10 weeks. She was prescribed abortifacients to help complete the process, and fortunately everything resolved and we eventually had a daughter 2.5 years later. I'm very glad this all happened 8 years ago...abortion is health care and is as essential for people who want to have children as it is for those who do not.
Had abortion been legal, they would have gotten the abortion, recovered, and could have gotten pregnant with a viable pregnancy. Instead, the abortion bans ensure that potential babies will never be born while actual living women suffer and possibly die.
Not to mention the women that had to get close to death before they were allowed an abortion who suffered needless complications, including infertility. Women who would have wanted to have had another baby, but whose pregnancy wasn't viable this time.
What they didn't think about, or care about is this, women afraid of getting pregnant. I know if I was young enough to still want babies, I wouldn't be trying for one, I'd be too scared of something going wrong and killing me. All because the nonviable fetus has more value to the GQP than I do.
