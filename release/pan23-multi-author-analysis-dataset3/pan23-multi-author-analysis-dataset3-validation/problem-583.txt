As I said in my post, there is a difference between Periods and Dynasties in the chronology of Egypt. The Ptolemaic dynasty coincides with the Ptolemaic period, but when considering dynastic durations, the proper comparison is not to between the Ptolemaic dynasty-period and other periods (Early Dynastic, OK, IM1, MK, IM2, NK and so forth), but with other dynasties (of which, despite what the linear numbering suggests, there could be several at a given time). That said, socioculturally, the distinction between periods certainly makes sense before Persian rule (i.e. the distinction between periods tracks sociocultural shifts), but whether the distinction between, say, the Ptolemaic and Roman is really a sociocultural shift, rather than merely a baton pass between different political powers (thus somehow abducting the "periodic table" to track a different kind of change), I have my doubts. To be sure, there were significant sociocultural shifts between Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt - but whether those were as (relatively) abrupt as they were between, say, OK and IM1, thus being amenable to be expressed as a sudden period break, and moreover coincided with the shift in political power, as opposed to a very gradual sociocultural change - again, I have my doubts.
edit: ("I have my doubts" ought to be a meek way of saying that, well, it's not consensual in academia.).
I see what you mean. I'm afraid I inadvertently steered the conversation away from that core question. It's a good one. I can only speculate on the answer. Perhaps someone has written something that addresses it directly, but if they have, I haven't read it. Most of the written materials about the Ptolemies focus on their infighting and ruthlessness, the manipulation of Mediterranean politics, their attempts to win the support of the native populace, etc. Nothing I've read gives me a reliable explanation for why their dynasty was stable.
On the whole, periods of centralization generally lasted for several centuries, while periods of disunity were relatively short-lived. The Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms lasted between 400 and 500 years each. The First and Second Intermediate Periods lasted about one century, while the Third Intermediate Period was longer, but it was not truly a period of complete disunity. For much of that time, rule of the country was amicably divided between the High Priest of Amun in Thebes and a nominal pharaoh in the Delta, with the god Amun "ruling" the country and maintaining peace between earthly powers.^2.
(I get 302 years for the Ptolemaic Period, but it just depends on when you start counting. Not a major difference.).
2. From my study of Roman Emperors, there seems to be a clear pattern that when kids are raised in privilege and prestige and told they will be all powerful, they generally turn out pretty rotten (Commodus, Nero, etc).
