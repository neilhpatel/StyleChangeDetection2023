Iirc, Mastodon is based on decentralized self-hosted servers for communities. Think of like subreddits, but each had their own host, rules, and user bases. The basement dwelling folks could literally be hosted on a basement dwelling server!
That model works for a niche, but I don't see it scaling, it'd become too finicky and not very user friendly. It's more inline with the tech minded folk who would find that easier to navigate. The model is not advertising friendly, because each host sets their own rules .. so you would have ad-friendly communities and nazi-friendly communities. They could change if the host changes. Advertisers don't like that amount of instability where they put their branding.
For an alternative to Twitter to exist, it needs to be as basic bitch as it can get so everyone sees it as an easy alternative to jump ship.
There is no viable alternative to Twitter at the moment. The whole core value of that a site is it’s the best “breaking news” platform where you can jump into conversations on the latest in hard news or pop culture. You can have a loose community that you follow but at the same time stay connected to trends in the wider world. NOTHING else does this as efficiently. And that’s what is saving Twitter right now, because I think a lot of folks would be out if something else was around.
My only thing pulling me back to twitter are the local twitter minicelebs which were fun to follow. The 10k or 5k follower accounts which just had local updates and memes. Cant get that elsewere for now.
What is hard to replace are the local celebrities and even local twitter minicelebs which were fun to follow and keep up with.
