The end all and be all of it is that you're not obligated to raise someone else's child. If you don't want to do it, don't do it. Raising a baby is stressful. Raising a baby you don't want can be even more stressful.
If you don't want the child permanently, say no. They will find an appropriate home. The state is usually required to find a relative for placement. Are there any other relatives in your family that will step up, even distance relatives? Reach out to them to ask and send the social workers to them.
The state is most likely asking them for all possible placement alternatives for the child. I'm in Florida (not an atty) and here a child would be placed permanently thru adoption in this circumstance. No chance for temp placement. A child should not be in a temporary place for 7 years. The state would be looking for a relative first, then if no one, they'd look for a non relative.
I'd ask about their plan for permanency and their time frame. Are they thinking adoption or guardianship.
She'll be placed in foster care. Depending on the circumstances and on her parents' wishes and willingness to participate, she may be placed with a foster family on a track for adoption.
Hopefully someone in the family will be able to take the child but if not, there are many loving families wiling to adopt.
