It was not in any way written to limit government power. That was mostly amendments and the majority of the document is actually the opposite. Guarantees of government power.
Most of the constitution is enumerated rights of the federal government. Control of federal elections for example.
The bill of rights and semi-related amendments guaranteeing individual rights are just a small part of it. Most of the constitution is guaranteeing rights that the federal government has over states.
The 2nd amendment does not grant rights to individuals, it grants rights to the states. The right of each state to keep a Militia armed.
And unless an individual is commissioned in a well regulated state Militia, they do not have the right to keep or bear arms. At least not according to the 2nd amendment they don’t.
Auto Insurance companies do it. They force parents to list all teen drivers living with them on their insurance. Guess teens with cars are more dangerous than teens with guns.
The word Militia is the important part here. It is capitalized to show that it is an official body of a state; a well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State. And because of this necessity, the right of the “people” (people in this instance meaning the collective states of the union) shall not be infringed.
