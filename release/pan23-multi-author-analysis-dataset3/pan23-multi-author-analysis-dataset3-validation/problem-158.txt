Right now, they are trying to get Ukraine to agree to allow Russia to just keep the territory they're currently occupying. But any reasonable person knows that if Ukraine agreed to that, Russia would just invade again once they've rebuilt their forces. Additionally, Ukraine is kicking Russia's ass. Ukraine has taken back significant parts of territory occupied in early 2022, and is threatening to retake territory occupied in 2014. These two factors make any cease-fire with Russia a poor strategic decision.
I don't think you appreciate how fragile Russia's position is though. Russia is increasingly relying on poorly equipped conscripts to make up the bulk of their forces because they simply have burnt through most of their military stockpiles and trained troops. Those soldiers don't have proper winter gear and will either run or freeze to death after the first cold snap. Russia wasted 16K missiles so that less than a quarter of them could get through to damage civilian infrastructure, and now they don't have the missiles left to continue their barrages. The sanctions are taking their toll making it very difficult if not impossible to manufacture what they need to continue, while the price of oil dropping means that they won't have the funds to continue fighting indefinitely. Meanwhile all those other satellite countries kept under the thumb of Moscow are starting to notice that Russia is getting pretty weak and won't act if conflicts start in areas outside of Ukraine.
It sounds like west sending message: When you concede and pull out from Ukraine, we will have talks to see if Ukraine will not continue into Russia.
Here is a question: If russia pulling from Ukraine is a condition for peace talks. What will the talks be about? Russia already left Ukraine, which means that it conceded and war is over?
If they were out of Crimea and other occupied territory, the war would in fact already be over. They're still on Ukrainian territory they decided was Russia, unless there's some news I missed completely.
