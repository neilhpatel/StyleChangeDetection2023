This is a complex issue that historians have debated for decades now, and it’s contentious for precisely the reasons you described: there seem to be deep roots of nationalism in ingroup/outgroup thinking that has existed since a lot longer ago than the French Revolution. But there was a change in the way people thought of ethnicity/nationhood/ingroup-ness around the time of the French Revolution. Historians disagree on whether this change constitutes the invention of nationalism or merely a change in nationalism’s appearance.
At the heart of your question is the definition of a nation, and it’s probably unsurprising that historians can’t agree on what a nation is. Like you asked, was Classical Athens a nation? Were the Picts a nation? How long ago did Poles become a nation? It’s fuzzy, and depending on which side of the debate I’ll describe below a historian lands on will depend on and determine how that historian thinks of nationhood. Nationalism is, to my mind, a bit more straightforward. In modern European history, we usually think of nationalism as the principle that the boundaries of a political formation should have a 1:1 relationship with the ethnic group it governs (Gellner, 1). So there should be one Welsh state that governs all the Welsh and only the Welsh; there should be a Basque state that governs all the Basques and only the Basques; etc. While many historians see nations as a premodern phenomenon that simply changes form around the time of the French Revolution, most historians agree that this definition of nationalism comes from about that time.
There are three schools of thought about nations and nationalism that we need to understand to get how historians think about this: the primordialists, the state-first group, and the nation-first group. In your question you actually anticipate the existence of these three groups (nice noticing!): the primordialists are the “simplistic pop history” strain; the state-first advocates that “national pride is a relatively new thing”; and the nation-first group tries to account for the existence and persistence of ethnic and political differentiation prior to the French Revolution.
I think I follow your point about people in post-revolution France becoming an increasingly cohesive "ethnic" group considering the linguistic and cultural connections. At that point it becomes more meaningful to talk about French "nationalism.".
