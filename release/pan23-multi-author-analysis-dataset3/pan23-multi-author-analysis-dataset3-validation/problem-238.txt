Ah, that's what I was afraid of... But thank you so much for giving me peace of mind that I'm not leaving anything out I'm attempting to write a historical fiction novel, and on top of that I'm trying to keep as accurate as possible for everything I can. I guess this means that I have a little bit of leeway when it comes to creative license, haha. Thanks again for your time If you have more, I've come up with something else to ask you now: in the years just before the Peloponnesian War, were various armies known to contract out or outsource either mercenaries/soldiers/individuals possessing the required skills for what one might consider special operations? Like perhaps how a spy might sometimes work? Or was it strictly their own men for the more more delicate matters? Also, is it true that city-states would pay pirates and bandits to harass their enemies? (Again, I believe that I recall a previous professor talking about this, but it's been so long that I can't be sure!).
1. As far as we can tell from Athenian sources, there was no very precise distinction between the types of infraction you're describing. The Athenians distinguished 3 military crimes: astrateia (draft evasion), lipotaxia (desertion/leaving the formation) and deilia (cowardice). In practice, though, people were rarely brought to trial for these things, and when they were, the accuser was likely to argue that the accused was guilty of all three. You can picture how a single act (such as running away from battle) could easily be described by any of these terms or all of them in combination. We have no comparable evidence for Sparta but it seems likely that their conception was similarly fuzzy - there was really just the one category of military crime, namely not doing what was expected of a citizen in war. In any case, while we have plenty of information about what would happen to Spartans accused of being "tremblers", we only have evidence of a single case of someone being actually made to suffer these punishments. The Spartans, like the Athenians, usually didn't bother to press charges for military crimes, and probably thought the punishment was unreasonably harsh.
4. Most reconstructions of the Spartan hairstyle are based on showing carefully arranged braids or plaits of hair. The idea of a rat tail most likely comes from Frank Miller's graphic novel 300, which was first published in 1998, when these things were in vogue. Miller clearly depicts Leonidas with a rat tail (though the other Spartans have more authentic-looking airstyles).
