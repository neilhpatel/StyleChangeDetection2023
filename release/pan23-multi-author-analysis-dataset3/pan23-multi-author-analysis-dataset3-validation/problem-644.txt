Demonstrate or use the atomic bomb first in a way that would not kill as many civilians, but would make clear how powerful it was.
There's plenty more on the atomic bombings in . One thing that it's important to note is that there's a fair amount of reasonable disagreement about what exactly led to the Japanese surrender -- a lot of things were happening around the same time. It's also worth pointing out that the conventional narrative, the idea that Truman had a choice of either dropping the bombs or invading, is incorrect for a couple of reasons. The first is that Truman never made a positive decision to use the bombs -- he just went along with the generals, and it's not clear he even realized Hiroshima was a city. He made a positive decision to stop the bombings after Nagasaki, which he also did not explicitly authorize -- he was clearly uneasy about civilian casualties. The second is that there was never an either/or, it was a both/and -- keep bombing along with an invasion, use bombs on the invasion beaches if necessary, etc.
So the framing of "either bombs or invasion" is a narrative that was invented after the war, to retroactively justify the bombings. In August of 1945, the allies were blockading Japanese ports, conducting conventional fire-bombing raids of Japanese cities, and preparing for a land invasion, while the Soviet Union was also planning to invade Japanese-held territory in Manchuria. I've about American efforts in the Pacific.
