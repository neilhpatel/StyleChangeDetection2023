First off, the Southern and Northern split to which you're referring applied to Israel a few centuries before Roman occupation. The kingdom split, according to the Bible, after the reign Solomon. The southern kingdom was called Judah while the northern retained the name Israel. Then the Assyrians attacked the northern kingdom and scattered the inhabitants. The Babylonians did the same to the southern kingdom. The Samaritans did descend from the northern tribes, but that has nothing to do with their eventual location on the Roman territory map.
By the time Jesus was grown, the differences between Galileans and Judeans were stark, but they had nothing to do with the Jewish identity. Instead, there Galileans were viewed as backwards hillbillies, basically, and Judeans made fun of their accents all the time. This is why the statement is made about Jesus, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?".
Yes. In a lot of the literature we have, there is suggestions too that the Judeans looked down on the Galieans.
That background can help explain why Galileans were seen as Zealots, and why the Zealot movement formed there. But we need to circle back to the second leader of the Zealot movement, Zadok the Pharisee. Zealots and Pharisees seemed to be connected. And it brings up a very interesting possibility, that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. This may seem like a weird proposal, because the Gospels are pretty down on the Pharisees, but as John Dominic Crossan explains in Who Killed Jesus, that is more likely due to polemic against Rabbinical Judaism, which derives from the Pharisees. After the Temple destruction in 70 CE, and after the first Jewish War ended, the only Jewish sects left were the Pharisees, which became Rabbinical Judaism, and Jewish Christians, which would become Christianity. And the two had quite a bit of polemic against each other, and it was in that environment that the Gospels were written. Before that, Pharisees weren't seen in a negative light. After all, Paul was a Pharisee.
The idea that Jesus was a Pharisee has taken off a bit more in recent times, but it is still debated.
The background of Jesus, and even of Galilee, can be a bit contentious. One of the most famous Galileans, besides Jesus, was this figure named Judas of Galilee, that we learn of from Josephus. Judas's story has an interesting connection to Jesus. In Luke, the author talks about a census. Simply, Luke gets the census wrong. He places it at a wrong time (and adds aspects that never happened). But that census occurred around 6 C.E., and it spurred a rebellion, which Judas of Galilee was one of the leaders.
