The first diagram of the effect of islands on waves is from which also has further information on Polynesian navigation and island-finding.
As for the details of long range ocean travel, it's important here to not be fooled into thinking that the only vessels available to the Polynesians were small "canoes". Some of the ocean going vessels of the Polynesians were enormous vessels with the ability to carry many dozens of crew and enclosed structures (houses) built on the deck. These were perfectly suitable for long ocean crossings. Today a reproduction vessel, the Hokule'a, sails all across the Pacific, and it is small compared to some of the largest known Polynesian vessels. Additionally, here again it's important to recontextualize the problem space. It is not necessary to have the capability to travel from anywhere in Polynesia to anywhere else at any time desired, instead the "minimum viable solution" is simply being able to make a voyage with a reasonable probability of success when the time and conditions (ocean currents, prevailing winds, etc.) are ripe for it. And that turns out to bring a lot of the ocean crossings between South Pacific islands into the realm of possibility.
This is how you min/max traveling between Polynesian island chains in the Pacific. The goal is not to sail from point to point so that you come right into a target harbor on your target island perfectly, that's not necessary. All you need to do is be able to get close enough to any island within a target island chain that you can find your way to that island. Individual islands can be small, and low islands without huge mountains might be visible only from a handful of miles away (due to the curvature of the Earth), but islands cast big "shadows" on their environment. Islands harbor cloud systems at high altitudes which are visible much farther off. Islands act to refract sea swells and ocean currents in ways that are noticeable if you know what to look for. These effects make it possible to detect islands from up to about 30 miles away. That dramatically changes the navigational problem from one of traveling the whole open ocean to find, say, a single tiny, flat 5 mile long atoll (which you'd need to be nearly on top of to see) to instead pointing in a specific direction and expecting to run across a line of current disruptions and cloud formations which form a "wall" hundreds of miles across and 30 miles thick. When you detect that you are within an island block then you can look at the water, look at the clouds, look at birds, etc. to find directions toward land. And once you have made landfall at any island it's comparatively easier to navigate between islands. Even if you "get lost" you can just go back to where you were, the whole island "block" is a huge area and easy to stay within, so you can iteratively problem solve your way toward finding specific islands.
