It doesn’t matter if it’s legal. The Canadian constitution has what’s called the ‘notwithstanding clause’ which basically lets provinces temporarily ignore parts of the constitution. For example, Quebec has already used it to ban government officials from wearing turbans, hijabs, or other religious wear.
Telling individuals that they can't wear religious symbols is NOT religious freedom. You just swapped out Christianity for Atheism.
I agree with you to some extent when it comes to the burka - rather than a religious symbol it could be understood as a symbol of oppression of women.
I definitely agree with you about the burka, but the wearer will turn around and say she is a feminist and wears it by choice because she feels liberated (face-palm, head-shake).
I'm sorry you see things that way. Corruption and the mafia exist everywhere in the world. Don't believe some of the preposterous Québec bashing articles in Mcleans, the Globe and Mail, and other media. These fall into the usual stereotypes and tropes of Québec-bashing. We have made genuine efforts to confront and combat this problem. Québec is a great place to start and grow a business. Despite how others try to paint us, we will continue working to build a just, prosperous and inclusive society.
