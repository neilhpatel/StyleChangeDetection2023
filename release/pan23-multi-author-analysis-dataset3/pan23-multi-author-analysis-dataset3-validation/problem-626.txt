The only thing I'd add to this is that any authentication information they request for use by a replacement would be information you'd likely be required to provide, as they could be argued that they belong to the hospital.
But seeking the advice of an employment attorney would be a good idea, and any further threats should be met with a "You'll have to discuss this with my lawyer, <info>, we won't be discussing this now.".
Unless the cops actually show up (which is probably unlikely), the only lawyer worth talking to is an employment contracts lawyer, to review any employment contract paperwork you may have signed just to make sure you don't have some kind of liability exposure for not giving notice, and to act as a go-between for handing over requested information. (And that'd be a contract dispute, not a criminal issue.).
Yes. They probably won't have a successful lawsuit, but they can go through the process of suing you.
I would expect nothing. They seem disorganized and now don't have an IT department. If you do get sued then you need a lawyer and you have to show up to court.
Talk to a lawyer. You can probably threaten to counter sue them for ignoring patient safety by ignoring the IT staff requests to upgrade old equipment before it dies completely.
