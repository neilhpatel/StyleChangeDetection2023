If you balanced your checkbook (and forgive me, I’m curious as to how old you are because balancing checkbooks isn’t done so much these days so you may have no idea what I’m talking about), then it wouldn’t matter if he never cashed the checks because you could look at your checkbook and know you had paid $X to your landlord so whatever was left after that is what you had available to you.
You seem to not be taking responsibility for the fact that you didn’t actually know how much money was in your account. Regardless of the situation with your landlord — how do you not notice that you still have two months with of rent in your bank account? Wouldn’t that strike you as odd?
But it is ON YOU to verify that the checks were cashed, either by checking your statements/online account, or by balancing your checkbook and accounting for the money there.
After writing him that checks you would have it written down in your checkbook "I have X amount of money's - this amount of rent = this amount of money's" if you did your job of balancing your checkbook. Then you would know how much money you really have because he can cash them whenever he wants. It's also your fault for not noticing that you had extra money in your account that happened to be the same amount as your rent and not drawing any conclusion from it besides spend it. He can wait and cash them every six months if he wants. Even if he said he cashed them and didn't, if you would have balanced your checkbook it wouldn't have mattered because you still would be deducting that amount of money from your savings.
