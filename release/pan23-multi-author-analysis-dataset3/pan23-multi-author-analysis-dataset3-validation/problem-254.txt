So what did Jesus claim during his own lifetime? Based on the traditions about him preserved in the gospel accounts (that pass the scholarly criterion for historicity), Jesus identified himself as the Jewish Messiah, the one whom God had chosen to rule over the new Kingdom of God that he would very soon establish upon the earth. This is especially evident in the fact that all the gospels agree that Jesus was put to death by the Romans for claiming to be “the King of the Jews.” Jesus was not the only person to have made this claim; Simon bar Kokhba, who led the eponymous revolt against the Romans several decades after Jesus’ death, at the very least embraced speculation by his followers that he was the Messiah. However, Jesus’ legacy survived long after any other claimant for a very specific reason.
With regards to the first part of your question, we need to first draw a distinction between the claims Jesus made about himself during his own lifetime and the claims that his followers made in the decades after his death. Scholars are largely in consensus that Jesus never claimed to be divine, much less God himself, during his own ministry; this idea, which out of the four canonical gospels is only found in the latest, John, emerged in some Christian circles towards the end of the 1st century.
“scholars are largely in consensus that Jesus never claimed to be divine, much less God himself during his own ministry”.
I don’t doubt that that’s the academic consensus, or your expertise thereabouts, but you can probably imagine that practicing Christians would push back hard on this claim!
