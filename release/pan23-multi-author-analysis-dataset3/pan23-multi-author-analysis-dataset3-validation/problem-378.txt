Traitors and bigots don’t deserve commemoration. Their only memory should be in history books about the hell and depravity they caused so that subsequent generations can learn from their hideousness.
The fact that RepubliKKKans have been trying to save these statues is an insult to those who suffered and died while enslaved and to all those since who shed blood, sweat, and tears to promote equality and equal protection under the law.
And yet there are undoubtedly a ton of people upset by this and who think they are personally being attacked because they're not allowed to worship a public statue of a literal traitor and slave owner.
Lee fought a war against his own country over the right to own slaves, and I didn't want anyone to claim he was just fighting because he was protecting Virginia or other nonsense that has been trotted out about him since he was _also_ a slave owner.
Maybe we should remove the 1st and third president from the dollar bill they both were slave owners and are probably the most popular ones not defending them but saying they were slave owners aren’t a valid excuse seceding and betraying your country yeah for sure.
And being homophobic and a misogynist which you probably don’t even know the meaning of doesn’t make you a terrible person he had tons of qualities that are inspiring and everyone should have the fact he didn’t resort to violence and name calling or insults should clue you into the fact he wasn’t a evil piece of shit.
How is he homophobic the article literally says he isn’t and most people back then probably had even harsher views than this it’s not even that harsh either considering a lot of people say this in 2022.
