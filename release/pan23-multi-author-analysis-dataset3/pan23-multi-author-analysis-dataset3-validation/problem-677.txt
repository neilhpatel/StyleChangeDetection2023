Beautiful. I think I've prepared my response something akin to "due to childcare reasons I am unable to change my long standing schedule, what accommodations can be made?" I suppose being fired is the best course. I do have a meeting with a lawyer Thursday anyway for an unrelated thing, maybe I'll ask for a freebie. Thanks again.
Thanks for the reply. Should these things be discussed with a general private practice lawyer preemptively or would my state determine my eligibility no matter what? Real glad I pushed through this covid season so they could sell the business with highest revenues to date. Capitalism go brrrrr.
From my research having special needs kids pretty much makes you untouchable, and having normal kids as a female has some protection. But a man has no case unless you know they already granted a woman the same request you have made. I feel more confident in giving my truthful reason on why I can't change rather than "just cause". Hopefully I can ask unemployment office before this goes down.
I'd try the unemployment office first, honestly. They can likely tell you what qualifies/disqualifies you.
A general attorney could probably help. But if it's not a free consultation I'd think it was a waste of money. Start with the unemployment office first.
