I'm omitting the US Navy casualties from the loss of the USS Liscome Bay. We can also presume that among the 4,690 Japanese dead were a number of laborers; I omitted the surrendered laborers included in the article as I would not consider laborers, often forced from countries and areas other than Japan, to be military combatants. However, a number of Korean laborers were killed, and it isn't possible to separate them out from the other KIAs, so that figure includes them.
There is at least one common thread through many of these battles: The Japanese had no avenue to withdraw or retreat from the island, and surrendered only rarely (and then in small numbers). That meant there were many battles in which almost every Japanese casualty was KIA. If you combine the total American casualties (WIA and KIA) and compare to the Japanese casualties, the numbers are still lopsided but make much more sense.
Do we have any indication that American troops in the Pacific were less inclined to take in any surrenders that might have occurred compared to their counterparts in Europe, and that this might also account for some small portion of the high death/casualty ratio among the Japanese? Especially in the context of the dehumanizing war propaganda and general attitudes at the time, most exemplified in the .
