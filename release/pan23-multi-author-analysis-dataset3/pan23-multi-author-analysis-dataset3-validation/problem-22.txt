Let's assume for the moment that you're simply naive rather than disingenuous, and actually believe what you are implying. Clearly with the current rumblings of the Chinese sending some lethal aid to the Russians, and at a time that the tensions between the Americans and the Chinese have reached a high point, Ukraine can ill afford to take any type of action that would further push the Chinese towards the Russian camp.
No, it doesn't. That's your interpretation and is exactly why in international relations statements are kept vague and ambiguous. Everybody agrees that sovereignty must be respected, but precisely the question of sovereignty is what Ukraine and Russia are fighting over. Ukraine claims they are a sovereign nation independent from Russia, Russia claims that (part of) Ukraine falls within the sovereignty of Russia. Hence, it is not at all clear that Russia needs to get out of Ukraine as part of this statement. Russia has performed mock-referenda in the occupied parts of Ukraine precisely to give legitimacy to their claim of sovereignty.
I take it you're making a snide remark about how the prevailing opinion on Reddit has been that the Chinese peace plan was not to be taken serious, and that this news seems to disprove that.
I almost thought you were talking sense until you revealed that youre talking out of your arse by saying Chinas peace plan favours Russia.
China is two faced, they've been keeping Russia afloat and then the recent news of giving support and aid to Russia with the war, now wanting peace? This is a huge maybe but they might actually see how this War is spiraling down a dangerous path with Russia/Putin, you know Putin will not accept failure or losing the conflict and will go to any lenhs to be the winner. If this "peace deal" doesn't work out I think we really have the potential to see things go from bad to worse real quick.
