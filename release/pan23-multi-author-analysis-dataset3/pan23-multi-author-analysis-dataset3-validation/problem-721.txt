Their coup failed. The "red wave" swept them out of control in swing states they needed to try another one. They're looking at a shellacking in 2024 when Gen Z comes at them with vengeance.
I'm more hopeful. This kind of midterm should have never happened given economic conditions. To me, its a sign that the "demographic doom" for the Republican party predicted decades ago is coming to pass.
Republicans had huge losses at state level this year - many in districts that were supposedly safe gerrymanders. Young people are going to break the party.
Under 40's vote D almost 2-1. And Republican's strongest supporters are 75+. How is that sustainable for even a few cycles? By 2024 election Millennials and Gen Z are predicted to be over half of the voters. How are you possibly going to win when over half the voters lean D 2-1?
It’ll look like a split until they just vote together. The more I hear retrospectives about Reagan the more I realize Trump isn’t an aberration but just the next great Republican leader after they waited through the bushes.
