As a researcher on desertion and defection during another American conflict, the Vietnam War, I’m very interested to hear about the process of defection during the American Civil War. Defection ostensibly involves surrender followed by integration - how did this process look during the Civil War?
My question is, was surrender in the Civil War notably different than previous wars? As in, did surrender in the War of 1812 differ in specific ways from surrender in the Civil War?
The first chapter of the book examines the role of surrender in the Revolution, in 1812, in the Mexican War, and in Indian Wars. What happened in the Civil War built on what happened in these earlier wars (and indeed many of the people who surrendered in the Civil War had prior experiences that shaped their conduct). What made the Civil War different was how often they surrendered.
As you point out, however, for black soldiers, surrender worked very differently. The whole dynamic of surrender changed in late 1863 and 1864 when we start to see large number of black soldiers and the collapse of prisoner exchange.
The prisons were really bad in 1864 after the prisoner exchange system fell apart. But before that, conditions in prison were actually pretty good (for POW camps) and most soldiers who surrendered didn't stay in prison for very long before they were paroled and exchanged.
I’m curious if the nature and frequency of surrender changed throughout the war as word got out about conditions inside prison camps. For example, would soldiers in 1864 have been more reluctant to surrender than in 1862 knowing some of the details of what was in store for them inside some of the more notorious camps?
