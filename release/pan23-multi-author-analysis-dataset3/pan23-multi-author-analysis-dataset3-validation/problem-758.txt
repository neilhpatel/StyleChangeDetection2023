If KCMO has an Office of the Inspector General (a quick Google doesn't turn one up) or Ethics Hotline this is exactly the type of thing that those are there to investigate.
Anyone can request anything... whether the city responds to those requests is typically a matter of local policy (it's been a while since I've read the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices [MUTCD] but I don't remember anything pertaining to parking specifically, aside from the forma of the signs) I'd start by calling the city department of Public Works ( who typically oversee these types of things and they can confirm if its a legitimate sign and if so any local processes to challenge the placement if legitimate. They're also most likely the ones to most expeditiously correct the situation if they were placed without authorization.
Everywhere I've lived "real" signs either have a legend on the front (e.g. in California, most CalTrans signs typically have "PROPERTY STATE OF CALIFORNIA" in a box near the bottom center of the sign) or a sticker on the back that typically extremely difficult to remove and also frequently has the date it was installed indicated. Those would be the first two signs I'd look for but of course aren't conclusive.).
As for the sign. She may have just found some extras at the city or had them made. There's really no such thing as a real parking sign other than in the context that the city ordered and installed the sign themselves. I make signs for the city and other companies and really as long as it complies with whatever regulation it's being used for then it's real. The question is if the sign is being used properly and enforceable. If she just stuck them there herself they could be real signs that are not enforceable.
If you are legal to park on your street those signs are most likely not enforceable. I would hesitant to get into a pissing match with your neighbor, especially if she works for the city in one of the code enforcement departments. You could always take pictures of where the sign is at in your yard, then take it down and return it to the city.
Take pictures and leave the signs in place. Make a polite and professional complaint to the responsible inspector general or ethics office, cc'ing the city council and mayor noting your concern a city employee has posted questionable signs trying to specifically restrict parking in front of her home on a public street. No need to go into discussion of her being Mrs. Kravitz or why she may have been peeved enough to create a no parking area in front of her home as it doesn't matter.
