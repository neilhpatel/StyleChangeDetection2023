"Italians/Irish/Poles weren't considered white" is a popular way of describing the complicated situation in the 19th and early 20th centuries. There's even a book titled How the Irish Became White! However, this framing is presentist: today, most Americans (not so much Europeans) tend to see ethnicity and "race" as equivalent, with the options being "white", "Black/African-American", "Native American/Indian", "Asian", etc. In order to get the modern American to see that Catholic Italian immigrants were not seen as being on the same order as Protestants with English ancestry, then, it's easy to say that Italians "weren't considered white". But this upholds our modern, American ethnic/racial distinctions as objectively real.
I'm not attacking the author. I'm just saying that the framing of the Irish as previously "not white" reflects that modern "'hard' understanding of race" rather than the reality of how the Irish were seen in the nineteenth century, which is all that "presentist" means.
Anyway it is true that the question of whether the Irish qualified as white is part of the discourse around how concepts and definitions of race in the United States have changed over time, but it's not necessarily the be-all-end-all "gotcha" to prove that race is socially constructed (which, by the way, it is).
Still, I feel like the idea that race is entirely socially constructed at least comes from the same academic milieu as CRT, and saying that the Irish, who are basically the lightest skin group of people in the world, are not white, would very much support that. If it's genuinely true that people didn't consider the Irish white, that's absolute proof that the concept is totally arbitrary.
I remember an older answer which I can't seem to find that also pointed out that if Irish were indeed not considered white legally, then they wouldn't be able to immigrate to the US since the country had a white only immigration policy. The answer also mentioned that there were no known miscegenation laws that prevented Anglo-Saxons from marrying Irish people. Are these valid arguments?
