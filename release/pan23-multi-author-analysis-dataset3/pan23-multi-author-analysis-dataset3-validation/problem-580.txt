No a health risk is not an adequate ground to violate a court order. Nothing is grounds to violate a court order. Follow the court order. Hire an attorney and take the issue to the court. Let the chips fall where they may. But I doubt the court will allow you to keep this child from their father because of the vaccine.
It will not end well for you when this gets to court if you withhold the child from her father over a vaccine. Get the right judge YOU could be the one that loses time. Family court has already made it clear covid is not an excuse not to follow court ordered custody agreements, they will not take kindly to you thinking you know better than them! Part of health and safety for children is their mental health, and it is mentally damaging for children not to be able to see both their parents.
Not legal advice, but just pointing out this question has been asked by others answered over the past year.
In this situation you get no vote, your a legal stranger. Back off and let mom and dad coparent as needed.
