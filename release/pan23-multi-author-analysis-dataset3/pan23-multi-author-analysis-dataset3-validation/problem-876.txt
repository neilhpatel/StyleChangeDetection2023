I think plenty of people are now making payments, since they are now aware of how much of their loans will be forgiven. Personally, I did not pay on my loans until I knew the amount to be forgiven, that way I would not have to go through the process of asking for a refund.
I do not see the legality of either, particularly not the loan forgiveness. If the pandemic is over, then payments on loans should resume. If the pandemic isn’t over, why, and when will it be? And it certainly isn’t clear that the intent of a post-9/11 law passed by Congress was to give the executive branch unabridged authority to cancel billions in debt, which is the Biden administration’s argument for forgiveness.
It does not, unless you subscribe to the idea that the intent of the law was to grant unlimited authority to the executive over debt forgiveness without further congressional action.
Masking is pretty rare in most areas. Kids are back in schools. The vast majority of businesses are operating in person. 69% of our population is completely vaccinated. Our daily case rate has returned to levels roughly equal to the beginning of the pandemic. Daily deaths are at all-time lows.
