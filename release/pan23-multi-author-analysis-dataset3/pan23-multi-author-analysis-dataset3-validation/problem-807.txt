"Investors" is the key word here. I am in agreement with limiting foreign investment firms (actually, all investment firms) from buying residential property.
"The bill would prohibit certain foreign individuals or entities from purchasing or otherwise acquiring title to real property in Texas. They include a governmental entity of China, Iran, North Korea or Russia; a company or other entity that is headquartered in these countries or is directly or indirectly held or controlled by the governments of these countries; owned by or the majority of stock or other ownership interest of which is held or controlled by individuals who are citizens of these countries; or a citizen of these countries, among other stipulations, according to the bill language.".
I'm having trouble parsing the last part of this restriction list. Are citizens banned from buying land or are companies owned by citizens banned from buying land? Could a US permanent resident with Chinese citizenship still buy land in Texas? I think US permanent residents from any country of origin should be able to purchase a primary residence.
It seems like the bill would also ban citizens of those countries from buying land. That would prevent permanent residents from buying houses in Texas. That seems incredibly discriminatory to me.
