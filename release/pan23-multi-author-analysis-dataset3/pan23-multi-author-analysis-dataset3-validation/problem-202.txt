Austrasia (the "Old" Kingdom) consists of territory in what is now modern day Western Germany (west of the Rhine), Alsace-Lorraine, and parts of Belgium. This is the heart of the "original" Frankish territories settled in the last days of the Roman Empire when the franks were a "federate" ally and, incidentally, its where the Carolingians come from (more on this later).
There was little reason for the Franks to branch back towards ‘Germania’ other than purely for conquest (which they occasionally did) because Roman Gaul was a wealthy place, and barbarian land beyond the Rhine was... well, less wealthy. This means that from the 5th century onwards, the Franks would have associated themselves with Gaul, and Gallo-Romans would have associated themselves with Francia. Though Frankish origins in the Rhine valley might suggest they were associated with ‘Germania’ as well as Gaul, at that time they were not nearly as big and powerful as they quickly became at the fall of the Roman Empire, and so were probably not as nostalgic about their roots as we might imagine.
TL;DR: Franks expanded from the Rhine valley into wealthy Roman Gaul as the Roman Empire collapsed and felt no inclination to go gallivanting into land which falls within Germany’s modern borders, they used Roman systems of administration including the Christian Church and rules over people who had been Roman for over 500 years.
As the Empire began to collapse in the 5th century, the Franks were able to expand into Gaul, and suddenly encountered a crippling problem of administration. How does a large tribe establish their rule over a vast area of land which had been Roman for over 500 years? The Franks used systems that were still partly in place from Roman rule, which was probably a major factor in their early success, but we won’t get into that. Frankish kings used their adult children and their trusted advisors to act as quasi-governors who controlled large areas of land, these are those whom Gregory of Tours described as Dukes and Counts of Francia. As well as this, (from Clovis’ adoption of Christianity) the Church was extremely important in the role of the political elite, and were hugely influential in Frankish politics. These were Roman systems and the inhabitants of (formerly Roman) Gaul would have (probably) felt comfortable being underneath them. With that in mind, you can see how the Franks were able to establish themselves as the ruling class of Gaul, and of the area that is now France, evidently out of necessity than an actual preference for Gaul over ‘Germania’.
To answer that and the question of why is France and not Germany the "inheritor" of Frankish identity we need to keep exploring the geographic evolution of Francia.
This is admittedly not an area in super strong on but essentially we need to think of the Frankish empire as one with many languages and where certain peoples could probably speak multiple languages at a time.
The confusion might arise from the fact that Old Franconian was the language of the Franks and was Germanic but this was gradually displaced in France by the Romance language spoken by the vast majority of the population.
But there is clearly a growing linguistic and cultural divide over time and a clearer and clearer sense that being West Frankish is different from being East Frankish or Lotharingian etc. And part of that is definitely about the vernacular languages they are using.
I've always found it interesting that there were 3 romantic languages defined by how they said Yes.
