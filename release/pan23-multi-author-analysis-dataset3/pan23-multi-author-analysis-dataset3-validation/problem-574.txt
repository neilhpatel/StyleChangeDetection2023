Israel created a charity that emphasized Islamic identity to oppose the PLO who were non-religious palestinian nationalists.
This is like blaming Britain for US war crimes because they created the 13 colonies. Hamas was not hamas when Israel was involved.
I’m talking about Hamas and Jihad of course, they are the ones in charge in Gaza. They don’t give a shit about their kids. Heck, they would prefer kids to get injured and die for their shallow, stupid and cheap propaganda.
LOL it’s so funny to see all the surprised people here. “Why would the Palestinians put their children at risk?” “That should be condemned”.
So your point is the people setting up rocket launchers around schools and hospitals are not Palestinians?
You are blaming Israel for Hamas putting rocket launchers next to schools? In what way has Israel forced Hamas to do this?
Who do you think is sneaking around Arab Palestinian Gaza launching rockets into Israel? If you say Iranians I’d probably believe you. Iran runs everything else there, using Hamas as their paid proxies.
