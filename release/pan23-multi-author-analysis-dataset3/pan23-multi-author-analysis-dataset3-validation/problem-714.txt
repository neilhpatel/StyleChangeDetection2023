Even aside from all that—and you’re right on all counts—going after Disney (and now Blackrock) for being “woke” is a dumb, stupid, incredibly dumb thing to do.
And while I’m tempted to say that in the short term, for -one- guy who wants to rile up the Republican base so he can run for president, it’s a great plan—that’s not true either! The overriding message is “You cannot trust me to go to after your business unless you keep up with the culture war desires of my absolutely-insane base,” and what corporation on earth wants to hear that? You can win over the voters, but you need donations from large corporations to win the minds of voters. I’m sure he’ll get plenty from coronations just so that they can hedge their bets, but do they WANT a guy like this in the White House? No way.
Businesses are in-and-of-themselves “woke.” They are wildly diverse entities that employ people from all walks of life. MOST corporations, like it or not, have diversity programs, because diverse companies attract and keep the best talent. DeSantis / the state of Florida going after corporations for being woke is a serious signal that tells businesses to stay the heck away from Florida. In the long-term, it is mind-bogglingly stupid.
DeSantis is not stupid. He is an absolute scumbag who doesn't care about any kind of collateral damage as long as it makes him look good to his base (also he's a wannabe fascist willing to punish anyone for speaking out against him), but he's not stupid.
It’s a wildly dumb prank he’s pulled, and I hope it destroys him and scares all the wanna-be fascist GOP pols like him.
I’m not going to say you’re wrong because obviously you’d know better than me, but I do find it hard to believe that you know a bunch of Republicans that hate him. That very much surprises me.
I am so shocked. I'll give Ronnie credit, he's been really savvy at getting in the news for conservative catnip reasons every few weeks or so.
