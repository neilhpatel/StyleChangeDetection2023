Yeah maybe they should tell everyone at the beginning of every single flight what the safety protocols are with seat belts and emergency exits instead of being so unclear.
Oh airlines should be clearer than having a literal sign above each seat in each row that tells you when you should fasten your seatbelt?
I feel like the airlines need to be clearer about this. If you leave the seatbelt sign on all the time, people think it's not necessary to be buckled or remain seated.
I agree with you, but it's not a matter of personal responsibility. I believe that the routine safety instructions, the "Captain voice," and the general sense of "yadda yadda safety" on airlines contributes to the careless attitude of passengers. That's a problem for everyone.
I want airlines to be more emphatic about enforcement, because that turd standing in the aisle with a blas√© attitude is a danger to all of us.
Remember, those unsecured passengers aren't just a danger to themselves. I'm sitting next to them, securely buckled, and just as likely to get injured when they land on me or crack open the overhead compartment with their skull.
