That sounds like exactly what they're doing. You might get better results here if you mention your location.
IANAL, but you can "Disclaim a benefit", meaning, essentially, that you are refusing to accept something that is willed to you. That property then becomes part of the estate.
This is called a "life estate," and it's legal to make such a bequest. However, your parents can't obligate you to accept it. You should talk to a lawyer before you accept the title to understand the situation - the remainder beneficiary of a life estate is, in most senses, a landlord, with all that entails.
As others have explained, life estates are common, but in a life estate, the resident is responsible for the maintenance and property taxes. I’d guess the lawyer will steer your parents in that direction. You have nothing to lose there, as you can always disclaim the house even after your sister passes and won’t bear any responsibility for it beforehand.
However, it sounds like your parents haven’t seen a lawyer about their will yet. When they do, the lawyer will clarify what they can and cannot do in your jurisdiction. My suggestion is to offer to go with them so you can advocate for yourself as they rework their plan or save them the trouble by explaining to the lawyer that you intend to disclaim the house if they do that. That way, you can get the full story before you commit to anything or get into any family drama.
Edit: on rereading the post, it seems her parents haven’t consulted a lawyer yet. It’s possible the lawyer will steer them in a different direction.
Your comment made me look at the post a third time. You make an excellent point. The post makes it very hard to tell what OP assumed and what their parents actually said. I interpreted it as the parents saying all that except for what OP admits to assuming (like sister not paying rent) while you interpreted it as OP assuming most of it. Now that you’ve pointed it out, I have no idea which is the case.
You’re describing a life estate which is absolutely common for the exact reason you described but this is a little different. In a life estate, the resident is responsible for property taxes and maintenance of the home. OP describes a situation where they are liable for the maintenance and taxes. It’s possible OP misunderstood their parents or that the parents misunderstood their lawyer and this really is meant to be a life estate but, if not, this is something a lot less common.
