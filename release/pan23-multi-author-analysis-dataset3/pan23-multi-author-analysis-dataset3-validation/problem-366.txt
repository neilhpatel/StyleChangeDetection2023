Poland won't transfer the tanks without German approval. It would not be wise to get on the bad side of Germany and their defense industry. I predict Germany will approve the transfer since they don't have to give up any tanks.
And yes, I agree Germany will probably approve. Lot of pressure to approve by NATO, German tank industry has the new KF51 with its 130mm cannon to sell to backfill allied tank stockpiles, and designs akin to the leopard have proven devastatingly effective against soviet Era steel-ERA hulled tanks like the ones Russia is fielding. There isn't many reasons left not to release the tanks.
But there are so many spare parts for older models and Poland has been moving away from German tanks to American and south Korean models that they might not care if they lose support for their older models and are willing to risk it to get the ball moving twords europe supplying more heavy armor for their neighbor.
Kinda. Nothing prevents you from physically moving em, but you do lose upkeep support from the manufacture.
I know, it's odd, but it makes sense in a way. Bullpups are situationally useful, but have drawbacks that make em kinda a poor choice for a standard issue rifle for all around general purpose. But by just making an interchangeable upper receiver, can just feild both a standard and bullpup for only a modest increase in cost.
