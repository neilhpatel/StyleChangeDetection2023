It didn't go quite that well. Sweden announced they'd send like $700K in aid (which isn't a lot of money for the size of this damage) and now they're asking for Turikye to open up their border with Syria to allow for refugees to receive aid in Turikye.
Not really the same thing. Turikye has been at war with Syria for a few years now actively carrying out missions in Syria to stop anti-Turikye insurgent groups that are attempting to take over regional power. They've closed their borders and made it insanely difficult for Syrians to immigrate or claim refugee status over security concerns.
Turkiye doesn't have great relations with Armenia... in fact... they still don't officially recognize their government. Turkiye has erected walls around the Armenia-Turkiye border. The main issue is that two countries formed from one (Ajerbaijan and Armenia). Both of these countries aligned with Russia (and still do). An Armenian region in Ajerbaijan (The Republic of Artsakh) was claimed by Armenia and Turkiye worried about this conflict potentially spilling into Turkiye.
I just read an article that said that Russia’s providing economic help to Turkey in exchange for Turkey helping Russia with problems caused by sanctions.
When Russia makes Ukrainian buildings crumble, turkey responds by blocking NATO memberships and increasing trade with Russia. They should feel real lucky the rest of the world doesn’t treat them the way they do Ukraine.
We are helping Ukraine don't worry. Even Ukraine sends us help this goes to show you who needs immediate help at the moment. We supplied them so many drones throughout the war, I don't think we will stop doing this because of Sweden. We also sent our soldiers to Korea in the 60s. We proved our worth to NATO time and time again. If there was an earthquake today in Sweden, I would have supported any decision that would make the situation easier for Sweden. No buts, ifs, conditions. "Differences" would be the last thing that would came to my mind. Sending aids to "force someone's hand" is such a sick thought.
