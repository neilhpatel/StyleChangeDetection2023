Culture war cannon fodder, they have no idea how bad it makes them look. It’s like hiring a CEO, only to watch them only change the wall colors in the office.
It being brought to vote in the first place, for one. That the argument that rules were actually broken, secondly. That the amendment maker believes that historical rules and culture changes have no relationship, third. You’re leaning into the specific arguments you watched from the floor.
