It won’t change until someone like her dies as a a direct result of doctors playing pass the parcel.
Well, it turned out that that was the case but at the time it was hard to say how close it would be in a referendum. Many people felt that it was very likely to pass but by what margin was the question. Nobody felt 100% certain though because most people could remember the first pro choice protests in Dublin and that was back in the late 80’s. It was hard to be certain when we’d been arguing over the same crap for most of our lives. Divorce and abortion were the two highly controversial topics in Irish politics over the last 35 years.
In Ireland it was Savita Halapanaver’s death that made the public finally say ‘fuck this’ and voted a couple years later to legalise abortion.
Nowadays I believe it’s becoming part of your hiring contract when you work in a hospital. Eventually the list of things your conscience can absolve you from will not include abortions. So no punishment for abstaining medical staff yet but that won’t be the case forever.
I'm not saying that medical staff shouldn't have choice. I'm saying that their choice shouldn't override patient's choice. If doctor is not comfortable doing certain procedure then it should be his duty to find/refer someone else who is able to do it. That would respect patient's wishes, that would make me trust him as I would know that he has best interest in my wellbeing. But Conscience clauses are commonly used as "I don't want to do it, so you shouldn't either'.
That's true, but how do conscience clauses apply? If anything religious doctors would be more in favor of circumcision. Isn't a conscience clause basically "my religion says I cannot do this" for doctors? The parents already have a choice in that matter.
