People will justify just about everything, and anything against Israel will always cause some dumbfuck to say "well if he wasn't so opressed maybe he wouldn't have killed a 6 years old, so really it's the 6 years olds' fault for opressing him".
You can advocate for Palestinians who are wronged by Israel, but please don’t be such a moronic douchebag making excuses for terrorism. You can be a better person than that.
This is going to be a never ending cycle, women don’t sleep with incels and then are suddenly surprised when they are attacked from withholding their vagina from them.
See how stupid victim blaming sounds? Stop making excuses for terrorism, there is absolutely zero reason to run over children with a vehicle. There is absolutely zero reason to celebrate the murder of innocents, which we see in Palestine _every single time_ Israelis are murdered. Then they see foreign, uneducated, sympathizing assholes like you come to their defense for murdering civilians so they think they are even _more_ in the right for doing so.
