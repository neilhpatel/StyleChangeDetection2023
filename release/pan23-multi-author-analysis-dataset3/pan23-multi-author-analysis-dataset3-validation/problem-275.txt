"The IRS Whistleblower Program guarantees to the whistleblower at least 15%, and up to 30%, of government tax collections that result from the whistleblowerâ€™s reporting to the IRS, to the extent those recoveries exceed $2 million.
No reward is paid to the whistleblower until the IRS actually collects the taxes, penalties and interest owed, and all the statutory periods for a taxpayer to file a claim for a refund has expired.".
This is true. The next step is to report unreported wages to the state labor agency. If federal taxes weren't paid either, need to report it to the IRS.
Untrue. Payroll taxes or lack thereof doesn't preclude employment. In other words, while paid payroll taxes are a good proof of employment, lack of paid taxes mean there's no employment. Work was performed, and worker was paid, so it is employment. You just find alternative ways to prove it. These gift cards are a proof. Any written communication with employer is a proof. Any pictures taken at work are a proof. A list of names of coworkers is a proof. Everything helps.
Once employment is proved through alternative means (see above), you can sue their ass and you will win.
