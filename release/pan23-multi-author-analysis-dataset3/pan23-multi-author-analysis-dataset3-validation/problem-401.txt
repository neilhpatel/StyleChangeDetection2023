Even within the Turkic council, where Turkey is the most democratic member, Turkmenistan stands out as the odd sibling. Such a weird country. But they have oil and people live fairly well off, so relatively stable.
In Korea too but that's why I said aircraft. In both Korea and Vietnam, Soviet pilots did not fly officially. They were either "volunteers" or just didn't officially exist. Su-24 that was shot down was an actual Russian aircraft with Russian markings. Guy had a state funeral and all. Making Turkey the only NATO country that officially shot down a Russian aircraft.
I don't disagree here, if you do not read any Turkish action for the last 5 years with actually hurting the alliance. Even with towing the middle line, Turkey was the country that hurt Russia more than any other, geopolitics wise in N Africa and in ME, while other NATO allies were allying with it.
But I wouldn't judge Turkiye for acting in their own self interests considering the instability in their country. As long as they don't push their relationship too far with Putin. I think everyone in NATO wonders how deep the alliance is considering how many sides the nation has shown.
Without Turkiyes full commitment to NATO in the event of escalation, their inaction could be tantamount to siding with Russia.
