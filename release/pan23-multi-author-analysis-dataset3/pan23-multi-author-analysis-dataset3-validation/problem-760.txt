It's all a lot more complex than face value. I think it's a shame that the only thing most of the public seems to be processing about this event is that it's some kind of Biden versus Trump narrative.
Possible. The Guardian article at the top of the subreddit right now says the pentagon was aware of 3 during the Trump administration, and a 4th one early in the Biden administration. This is at least the 5th detected balloon.
A balloon isn't that easy to detect. The radar return won't be all that strong and a slow target might be missed if Moving Target Indication (MTI) processing is used to avoid detecting birds or ground clutter. There is also the problem of distinguishing a threat from legitimate weather balloons.
The balloon drifts with the wind. Not too accurate for bombing. Biological agents would likely be neutralized by the strong UV radiation and low temperatures at high altitudes. The carrying capacity is limited - someone considering an act of war and all the things that it implies would not find balloon-born weapons to be of much value.
Bullets don't reliably take down large high altitude balloons - they punch tiny holes that leak so slowly it can take days or weeks to descend, and by that point it'd be out over the deep Atlantic or maybe even in another country's airspace. A missile was the best way to reliably take it down just offshore in the shallow water where it'll be easy to recover all the pieces.
