They can change the rules at any time subject to the bylaws, and with the vote of enough members they can change the bylaws (exact rules depend on state, of course).
I really think a community covered by an HOA was a mistake for you if this is how you feel about it. HOAs have broad power to restrict all kinds of things about your private property.
I have a hard time believing something like this could be included in bylaws as it prevents use of my own property. Itâ€™s one thing to require a fee to use a pool or something silly like that, but entirely different to restrict use of private property.
Assuming fees like this are included in the bylaws, what is stopping board members or simple majorities from raising something like an impact fee to an exorbitant amount to discourage new construction? A fee like this is absolutely a restriction on the use of my private property that is not recorded in the CC&R documents.
Just got an update to this. So they never drew up resolutions. When I inquired about seeing the amendments they just said we will send you a copy of the meeting minutes where they were passed. The President of the HOA has no documentation on any resolutions passed nor are they recorded at the Register of Deeds as required by the original CC&R and NC Law to be binding.
