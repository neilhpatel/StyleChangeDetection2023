Part of the context was that the Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz had long considered Iraq under Saddam Hussein a major threat to the Middle East and to American interests, going back to the Carter administration in which Wolfowitz had served (yes, Wolfowitz was a Democrat prior to the election of Ronald Reagan, in whose administration he also served, along with that of George H.W. Bush). Wolfowitz was convinced that Saddam's Iraq, with its military power and its support of Palestinian terrorist group was a major threat to the Middle East's stability, especially after Iraq invaded Iran in 1980---unlike many American policymakers at the time, Wolfowitz thought that the US supporting Saddam's war against the new Islamic Republic of Iran (if mostly covertly and by proxy via the Gulf monarchies) would be a dangerous mistake, and that the end result would be Saddam strenhening his regional hand in the Gulf, thereby turning his aggressive ambitions elsewhere - which is exactly what happened in 1990.
Both the Carter Doctrine and the Reagan Corollary are important context here; by the 1980s the US was signaling that it was committed to defending the oil resources of the Persian Gulf from any outside aggression (which would be the USSR) or, the case of the new Iranian regime, any regional aggression against US allies (though this was unfortunately not clearly enunciated to Saddam until he invaded Kuwait in 1990). Wolfowitz was one of the voices singling out Iraq as an additional and, in his judgment, more threatening regional Middle East aggressor than Iran.
Wolfowitz shared these views with other officials in both the Reagan and first Bush administrations, including I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, who worked with Wolfowitz in senior roles in the Pentagon during the first Bush administration under then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who he later hired Libby as both his chief of staff and national security advisor when Cheney assumed the Vice Presidency; Richard Perle; who served as an Assistant Secretary of Defense under Reagan while Wolfowitz was an Assistant Secretary of State, and who later chaired the Defense Policy Board, a senior advisory body to the Pentagon, during the second Bush administration; and Douglas Feith, who likewise served in mid-level to senior national security roles in the Reagan and Bush 41 administrations before he was made Undersecretary of Defense for Policy under Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz in the Bush 43 administration.
Attendees included: his immediate superior at the National Security Council, Condoleezza Rice; Paul Wolfowitz, United States Deputy Secretary of Defence 2001-2005; Richard Perle; who would go on to become the Chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee 2001-2003; Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State George Shultz. Hadley announced that the ‘number-one foreign policy agenda of the Bush administration would be Iraq and the unfinished business of removing Saddam Hussein from power.’.
You mention that the Bush administration saw the overthrow of Saddam as 'unfinished business'. Why was that? I imagine this idea didn't come out of thin air, so why was it regarded as such an important goal even before the September 11 attacks?
