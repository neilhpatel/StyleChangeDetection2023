SCOTUS has purposefully adopted a “freedom for religion” position instead of the “freedom from religion” position that has traditionally been held by government.
You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about here. Courts have long upheld separation of church and state with the Lemon Test. Since the recent Conservative majority, there’s been a marked shift away from historical precedent in regards to the establishment clause.
I believe the crux of the issue is prohibiting discrimination on basis of religion itself could be discrimination on the basis of religion.
Religion is a protected category, so you can’t discriminate based on someone’s religion. Sexual orientation or marital status isn’t protected so you can say it’s against your religion to serve heterosexual and/or married people and refuse them service.
Right, but if the argument is that one can choose not to serve women marrying women but will serve women marrying men, you can see how it actually comes down to discrimination on the basis of sex.
So the argument there isn't "we are discriminating based on gender" it is "we are refusing medical treatment based on religion". Now that court case is also in line for a precedent - what if my religion is Moon Crystals and thus I won't sell you your insulin or your anti-cancer drugs?
