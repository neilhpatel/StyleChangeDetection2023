I know it wasn’t permanent, but we did give the opportunity for female children and women to attend school while we were there, and I’d fight for that any day.
People who make comments like the one you responded to refuse to try and even understand the positive impacts that were made. They see the end result and disregard all the wells, schools, roads, etc. that were made safer and allowed children to go to school safely.
If you’re trying to be coy and referring to some political game that was played by the administration - the average American private, or sergeant or even officer in the Army or any uniformed service, was not a player in that game. They had missions and whatever the overarching conspiracy was is not their concern. But if they liberate a village from Taliban, and make the roads accessible, and protect them, so kids can go to school, that’s worth fighting for.
Ok well if it's not a country and it's not worth fighting for then I guess fuck it the Taliban can have it. It's all theirs and all those little tribes can continue to grow poppies living under the Taliban. I do not give a flying fuck.
You never really did give a fuck. No one does. But that wasn’t my point. My point was that we are part of the problem.
