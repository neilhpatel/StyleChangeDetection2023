The Democratic Party has gotten more progressive since the days of Bill Clinton. That’s a good thing. Meanwhile, the Republican Party has become more extremist and downright stupid. Republican policies and rhetoric are centered around hurting people while only helping the rich and corporations.
Bernie, Warren, AOC, etc. Yes. The party has moved to a more Progressive stance with the help and influence of those folks.
Are there parties that are more progressive on some issues? I'll bet they are. But in this instance voting third party only takes votes away from the only party who would be able to make any appreciable change.
And sadly, a few rogue votes for third parties everytime isn't how you enact change and get the third party to win.
Unless there's a unified push for a third party candidate where everyone is on board, voting for them is wasting your vote.
But if you want your vote to actually "matter" and decide who actually sits in the chair, you sadly "have" to vote either democrat or republican.
So unless you WANT to live in that republican world he promised, you "have" to vote democrat to stop the republican one from happening.
Being "forced" to vote for a democrat you dislike and keeps everything the sams is better than allowing a republican win who removes all your rights.
But when the republicans win and strip away our rights, it's because all the liberals either threw their votes on random third parties or just outright didn't vote at all.
You're voting for someone who has no chance of winning AND making it easier for the Republican candidate to win because their voters will NEVER vote third party.
And if you'd vote third party just to spite some random guy on reddit, that's just further cementing that you're not understanding how crucial it is to vote democrat right now in this election, to keep republicans from winning.
if you honestly believe that voters can’t make the wrong choice in an election, to the disastrous consequences for the rest of the nation, then you are naive or stupid or both.
So yeah, if you actually care about America and don’t want to see it fall into fascism (as Republican policies are clearly trying to do,) then voting Democratic is indeed the only choice. That doesn’t make Democrats perfect, but JHFC at least they’re not insane and are actually doing some good for this country instead of constantly trying to tear it apart.
