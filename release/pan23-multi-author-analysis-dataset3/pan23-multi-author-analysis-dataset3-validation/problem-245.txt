A lawyer is a good idea, and you can expect that spiking your ex's vacation plans like this will set the stage for conflict down the line. If you would trust your ex to return to the state, and would be comfortable taking the risk that she doesn't, it _might_ be a sound strategy to offer to let her take the kids on her vacation in return for taking them for Christmas this year. Let your lawyer figure this out if you can, though.
As everyone has stated, your only route is getting a lawyer. Without a custody agreement , you cannot prevent her from taking her kids wherever she wants and she cannot do the same to you.
As a general rule, either parent is free to travel with their child anywhere they want to go absent a court order to the contrary. If she won't make an agreement with you, your remedy is to hire a lawyer and file for custody or visitation rights.
You can get a lawyer and go to court to try and get a custody agreement. You could also get an ex parte order prohibiting her from taking them to Hawaii until custody is sorted out.
