It happens when the fascists close all but one polling station in liberal/progressive districts so the lines are 20 hours long. It happens when armed fascist thugs patrol the one polling station and threaten voters. It happens when they make weird-ass ballots and fascist vote-counters throw out the votes they donâ€™t like.
How dare they register and then actually vote after we ruined their lives! Republicans like to complain that Democrats are ruining everyone's lives, but it's a big deal (TM) when the Republicans actually do it, like they did, at the state level, during the 2021 to 2022 term.
That said, threatening to raise the voting age is a huge blunder and if the Democratic Party wants to win the 2024 election, they would do wise to campaign against a party that would send folks off to war who can't even exercise their civic power.
for pointing out that one of the reasons that the youth vote appears lower as a share of the early vote thus far, relative to '20, is that younger Republicans aren't voting. The PA data certainly backs up that notion.
I saw this being talked about when people were looking at early PA voting. Articles were being written about how the youth turnout here was low and why that was a bad sign for Dems.
My guess is that young Republican turnout was low. This lowered overall youth turnout but is what is giving us the larger shift towards Dem in the youth vote.
Increase the voting age? Freaking people over on the conservative sub are talking about how the Founding fathers had it right when you had to be a landowner in order to vote.
