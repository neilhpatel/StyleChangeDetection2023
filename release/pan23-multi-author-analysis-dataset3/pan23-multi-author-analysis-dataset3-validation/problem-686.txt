Assuming causalities are even significant on either side. A failed invasion could just be China being turned around, after seeing how serious the US is about Taiwan.
I think a more interesting question is how the US would respond if China put a naval blockade on Taiwan. I think China would likely be destroyed if they go for a naval invasion, but if they can force the US to take the offensive, that would substantially improve their odds and it wouldn't hurt their global reputation as much.
I don't think the scenario is highly likely, but I could see it at least being heavily considered if China decides to go all in with the invasion.
There isn't gonna be an actual Chinese invasion Taiwan for the same reason there isn't gonna be an actual attack from North Korea. Because all the aggression and shows of force aren't actually for the west. It's to rally support from their own people.
If China fails to take Taiwan then Xi and the ccp will lose face and empower an uprising because they've shown weakness. which will only be amplified by the Cia and other western subterfuge agencies. that's the opposite of what fascist regimes are trying to accomplish. They wanna retain power and support and not have to devote resources to putting down insurrections. So it's all posturing about how they can crush the west anytime they want if they actually felt like it but they're so malevolent.
