Just to add some information, the news article supports your point. There was apparently a study conducted in Yukon to gauge the impact of putting cancer warning labels on alcohol.
I understand there are concerns about information overload elsewhere in the thread, but it seems to me that some warning labels can still be helpful, even if some places in the world (CA?) may have gone overboard with labeling.
Put on all the labels. It won't help. People don't read shit. I work in safety for a living. Putting up signs is a part of the job. Most people don't read them. Behavior won't change until consequences hurt, unfortunately.
It seems as if almost everything causes cancer anyway. Breathing the air in most large metroplis' will give you cancer. Eating burnt food can give you cancer. People who drink enough alcohol to get cancer will not care.
Heavy drinking increases general risk of cancer by a factor of 3 to 4 folds. those who do not drink have an average risk of developing a cancer of 0.035%, those who spend a lifetime drinking have a risk of 0.13% over roughly 50 years of heavy drinking of developing an alcohol related cancer... Leaving you with a 99.83% chance of not getting cancer because of drinking.
As a carcinogen, alcohol is a very weak carcinogen, your odds of dying in a car crash because of alcohol, of an accident or a fall because of alcohol are thousands of times greater.
The vast majority of the harm done by alcohol has nothing to do with its role as a carcinogen, and everything to do with its ability to induce intoxication and cause liver/brain damage.
Ever hear of a DDOS? Excessive information is a weapon in and of itself, just look at what the California warning labels have done. Have those labels educated people about the risks of various substances in their daily life, or did it teach them to ignore those labels? Maybe it even taught them to ignore that entire class of warning?
> Results revealed that the presence of graphic health warning labels did not influence participantsâ€™ purchase of cigarettes as a main effect.
Do the graphic warnings on packs of cigarettes work, or does it desensitize addicts to the content of those warnings?
It seems like it should be to me as a non-smoker, it only makes sense that a graphic warning would be highly effective.
