I honestly don't care if it's an anti russia paper, russia can go fuck themselves after all they did in the past 30 years, they deserved every articles on the shit they are doing. Yes the core issue is maybe different but I'm sorry I don't give a fuck about nuancing anything about russia.
I think they’re just pointing out that this isn’t really a unique criticism of Russia if that’s the case. It’s important to remember that we are in the midst of massive amounts of anti-Russian propaganda even if it is largely ‘justified’. How many nations probably ARE responsible for an ongoing ‘ecocide’? Yet, this kind of posturing is reserved for the big bad Russia almost exclusively. Ukraine doesn’t actually expect this accusation to be taken on as an ICC case or formal matter of any consequence (or what little consequence International law can allow) and I suspect the same would be true even if Russia did respect their jurisdiction at all. It’s also important to see that Ukrainian sources are providing almost all of the information contained in the article, which somewhat impedes their ability to be unbiased about their own culpability (if they may have any). Animals’ deaths in war are generally an afterthought, which is tragic, but not new.
TL;DR There is no doubt in my mind that the war instigated by Russia is killing loads of animals, but are we surprised? What does this change? Is it any different than if any other nation had gone to war anywhere else?
We SHOULD make change in order to stop violence and war, call me controversial. What I’m saying is that this is not so much Russia committing an unprecedented act of ecocide, and more an (unsurprising) byproduct of warfare between two nations. But that’s not how it comes across right?
No no you’re right. The eu and individual European nations certainly aren’t pledging support for ukraine and in some cases backing that up with a fuck load of military equipment, that certainly hasn’t been a thing. States aren’t joining nato to ensure russia can’t invade them like they have ukraine.
Russia killed civilians on uk soil, interfered in domestic affairs of other nations and used bully tactics for years, this was the bridge too far.
