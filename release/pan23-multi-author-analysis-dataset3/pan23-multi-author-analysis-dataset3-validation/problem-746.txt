So much pain, misery, and death are looming on the horizon and no one who has power gives a single flying fuck.
Lethality really means jack and shit until the RO is high enough for it actually be a pandemic. This flu has been around since 1996 and still no significant outbreaks or signs of high RO in humans.
So yeah it would depend on the RO a lot, but this Flu strain has been around for 24 years now and not caused a human pandemic. If anything it's very bad at infecting humans and really hasn't show any sign of rapidly changing course.
I think the big thing about flu is that antibody resistance tends to be for life, not just a few months, but real the initial wave lethality would be bad. On the other hand it be a lot easier to vaccinate against and would not stick around for many years or decades like COVID could.
It would take years to work through the population and we would have a vaccine rolling out in a few months, so NO.. half of people won't die.
It won't be a long struggle getting a vaccine like with COVID, but we won't get it right away either, and in the mean time it won't be pretty if the mortality rate among mammals stays consistent when it moves human to human.
COVID is still around, will likely be a seasonal thing we worry about but I don't envision the response to the next immediate pandemic being anything like COVID unless it's killing folks in droves.
