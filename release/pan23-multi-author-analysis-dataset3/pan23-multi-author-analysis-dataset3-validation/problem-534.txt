Legally you are due the actual cash value of the car one second before it became totaled. Unfortunately, what your car is worth is almost always less than the cost of a replacement.
If you want to buy a new car with the money, then that's your decision. But, the entire idea of getting the fair market value is that you ought to be able to go out, find a similar USED car and use the insurance payoff to buy it. If you buy a new car, then that's effectively an upgrade.
If they think it's totaled, then make sure that you get a fair estimate for the value of the car -- used car prices are sky high right now, and THAT's the price that the insurance company should be paying, not what the car would have been worth had this happened last year. You're entitled to the fair market value of the car at the time of loss.
They will pay you the current value (pre-accident of course) of the vehicle. If the value is $10K, theyâ€™d pay out $10K, the first amount going to pay off the loan (say $2500), and the remaining $7500 as a check to you.
