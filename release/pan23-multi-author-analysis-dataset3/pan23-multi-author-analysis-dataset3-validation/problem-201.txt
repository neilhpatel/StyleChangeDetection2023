Lacking that, don't pursue child support. The state usually won't force it if you don't ask for it. This would Not pursuing child support would be especially foolish. Child support is for the benefit of the child and there is a reason it cannot be waived by contract. Not collecting child support is a great way to make sure your child's life is not as good as it could be.
Since you said you're on public benefits the point is moot. The state will make the father pay child support if the baby is born whether you want it or not..
So long as you are fully supporting yourself AND the child, you can choose whether or not to collect that support from the father. However, if at any point in the child's life you receive taxpayer assistance, the state will have the right to pursue child support on your/the child's behalf. You will agree to cooperate with this process when you sign up for benefits and failure to do so could cause you to lose access to taxpayer support services. I see that right now you are receiving support, so it is very likely that the child's father will be forced to pay some amount if you choose to have this child.
The only way to ensure the father does not ever have any responsibility towards this situation would be to end the pregnancy so that no child results from it.
If you choose to have the child, which is completely your choice, the father will have an obligation to financially support the child until they are 18. This cannot be waived by anyone.
