It’s actually about oil … China is just a player … the real movers are not the governments either it is the oil companies involved here … Venezuela oil politics are way way above anything we can comprehend.
Well, the economic boom in Venezuela happened when It was an ally from the west, most oil companies/equipment Is from America and It helped build the country, all i see Russia/irán/china is helping to keep the dictator in power while savotaging our resources.
You know shit, Chavez expropriated over 90% of industry, only a couple business survived, then after they completely destroyed those business the how we call it Bolivarian Oligarchy, composed of members of the military and PSUV politicians got their hands on those properties, so no shit is private owned in Venezuela, and I did read Marx, Engels and Lenin fyi.
Death squads? Hahahaha what are you smoking dude? Did you know oil extraction was nationalized since the 70s in Venezuela and no concessions can be made to foreign companies or countries? And that the US was our biggest oil buyer? That Venezuela use to own 7 refineries and shit tons of gas stations in the US? You’re like the average conspiracy ignorant American, talking shit because it’s free to do so, but never grabbed a book to fact check.
Tf you know about Venezuela, Chavez and Maduro, go read about socialism of 21 century from them and Dietrich, they are of course full communists trying to disguise in some other shit. It is sickening reading EU/US people claiming there’s no communism in Venezuela.
Let’s not repeat the tired far left propaganda that that things in Venezuela were going just fine before sanctions. They weren’t.
