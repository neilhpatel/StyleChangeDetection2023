I don't care that Bernie aimed for the sky and had to lower his goals. That's what everyone should do. You aim high for the best you want to achieve. You work as hard as you can for that goal. You put that goal in the heads of others to keep fighting for it and along the way, make compromises along the way as needed until, you hit that goal.
Now though, affordable health care for all and the absolute scrutiny of private health insurance is an active policy of democrats, or at least a growing faction of vocal progressives.
Look at student debt. The ONLY reason (outside of winning political points) that Biden wants to erase it is BECAUSE Bernie actively campaigned on it which has now become a vocal point of the growing progressives in DC.
Don't think Bernie really did much, Biden was probably just using him for his ideas but not actually doing anything about it. He's been in politics too long to suddenly change his tune on policies. That said, I still think the agenda proposed by Bernie and his people is ambitious and could be positive for the country if it's implemented properly.
