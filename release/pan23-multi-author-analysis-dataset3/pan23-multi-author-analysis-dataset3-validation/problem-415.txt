Whatever the armor's performance, the more definitive answer is about how economical it was: budgets in Europe quickly shifted to handing out a musket to as many cheap infantry as possible, to the detriment of, first, armor and then later pike. In comparison to this fundamental allocation trend, the armor's effectiveness question was optimization at the margin.
The reason why those Japanese and Chinese musketeers wore armor may just be that, at those specific times and places, melee weapons were still an important part of the fight.
Crucial battles like were not won by Later Jin forces bristling with advanced gunpowder weapons, , and . The Ming forces (along with their Joseon allies), which were ultimately defeated in detail, . Kenneth Swope's, "The Military Collapse of China's Ming Dynasty, 1618-44" has a very detailed breakdown of the Ming defeat at Sarhu.
Sarhū, then, was significant not so much because it set the pattern for the battles of the Ming-Qing conflict, but because it was one of the last times that the Jurchens got away with not using gunpowder. The conquest of southern Manchuria, let alone the Ming empire proper, was achieved off the back of a considerable expansion in the use of gunpowder-based weapons and tactics in response to the demonstrated inadequacy of traditional tactical approaches.
It's certainly true that the Manchu aggressively and eagerly sought more advanced gunpowder weapons to deal with Ming fortifications and defences (like you state!) but I think the fact that they initially acquired these weapons from defected/surrendered/captured Ming troops/gunsmiths (and the occasional Jesuit they recruited into casting cannon for them?) shows that neither the Ming nor the Jurchens were unwilling to adopt improvements or adapt to more powerful technology.
I'd agree that the Qing failed to pick up on several 18th century innovations and so lagged behind European armies technologically in that sense. However, as I note in the post that /u/Otisheet linked, the Qing were actually still iterating on a number of weapon designs, particularly artillery, until at least the Second Jinchuan War in the 1770s. So it's not that there was any active stifling of military development. Rather, the Qing simply didn't adopt a number of new European technologies – for various reasons which I suggest in the above-linked post – which is a separate issue from whether they still worked on active innovation directly.
