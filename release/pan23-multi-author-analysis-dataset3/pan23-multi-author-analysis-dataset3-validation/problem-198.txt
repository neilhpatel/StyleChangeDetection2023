Yea, Aunt already did this. Insurance confirmed that they were billed at every service. Just the 'Patient Portion' was never paid, because dentist did not want to charge family. I don't think it's 'double charging' as the patient portion was, indeed, never paid - because the Dentist internally would not take payment.
If the dentist got their money from insurance then this would be a double charge, which is illegal. Get the aunt to call her insurance and ask if the dentist collected insurance payment. If they did, and send to collections anyway, the dentist is trying to scam the aunt. She should have no issues taking the dentist to court.
If she wants payment, why did dentist allow aunt to leave without paying. It's something that's passed, so dentist needs to move on, imo.
Keep in mind that IANAL, and it's only my opinion, if the dentist tries anything funny, tell the aunt this.
If however dentist decides to play stupid games and send aut to collections, aunt can always ask for the debt to be itemized and invoices provided.
