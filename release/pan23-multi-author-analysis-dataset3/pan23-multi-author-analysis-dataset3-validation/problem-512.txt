Which is still a weird thing for Republicans to attack him about. There are only 4 years between Trump and Biden. Next election, Trump will be as old as Biden was at the last one.
If he makes it a full term, great, the new VP can then be the nominee for 2028. But he can't just ignore people's concerns about it.
Honestly, the problem isn't him, it's Harris. She's not pulling any weight as VP and has proven to be a mistake. Biden needs to replace her as VP in 2024 with a strong candidate that can potentially act as his successor if and when the time comes.
The better than expected results from this midterm isn't because of Biden and people being in love with his leadership and Democrats and Biden would be wise to recognize that.
A lot to read but my takeaway is that the Republican poor showing wasn't because of Biden's leadership driving things since we have the exit polling stating most wouldn't care for Biden to run in 2024 and even the majority of Democrats only staying the somewhat approve of his leadership, rather it's threats to abortion from the regressive party was the driving force.
You can feel free to disagree of course but I read it as Biden's leadership was not the driving force in this election.
I hope we can at least agree that it’s good Biden was elected as opposed to the only other possible outcome.
I understand your frustrated, but context and circumstances are extremely important. By any objective measure Biden has been extremely successful legislatively considering the makeup of Congress and the general political climate in the country the last two years.
Compare Biden’s legislative accomplishments in his first term to nearly any other modern president. He’s been very successful in relative terms, especially in this highly polarized political climate.
