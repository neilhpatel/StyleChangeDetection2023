Wow, that was an interesting read I remember going to an exhibit about Houdini in Appleton but I don't recall there being much, if anything, there about his Judaism, so it was really interesting to learn about that side of his life.
Yeah, it's hard to tell how much Judaism was actually part of his life from what I've been reading (though I really haven't studied Houdini much). Apparently, people who were upset when he debunked spiritualist claims would sometimes make antisemitic remarks, and really interestingly to me, he left one of his brothers money in his will on the condition that he confirmed his sons in the Jewish faith (Reform or Orthodox) within three months- I have no idea what the backstory was there.
Drachman, who wrote a deeply interesting autobiography for those who may be interested in the development of American Jewish life at the turn of the 20th century, devotes a few pages to discussing Houdini and his parents. (While I was a bit of a magic hobbyist as a kid, I got started learning about Houdini by reading Drachman, which I acknowledge as being a bit backward...) The autobiography was written after Houdini's early death at age 52 of a ruptured appendix, and therefore serves as more of a retrospective on Drachman's relationship with such a great celebrity. He starts by mentioning that he remembered Houdini and his siblings in Hebrew school, and then describes a relationship with Houdini, who he says had "a profound reverence for the Jewish faith and and deep-seated filial affection for his parents and reverence for their memory," in which Houdini would write to Drachman from around the world and, according, to Drachman, "looked upon me as his teacher and respected me as such." He then tells a touching story about how many years earlier Drachman had bought a set of Maimonides's Mishneh Torah from Houdini's impoverished father as a way of giving him financial assistance with dignity, and that later, when Drachman asked Houdini for a contribution to help pay the synagogue's mortgage, Houdini gave $500 on the condition that Drachman return the books to Houdini, so that he could have them as a memory of his father, despite the fact that Houdini could barely read them. He also describes his time speaking at the unveiling of the massive monuments which Houdini put up at his parents' graves (which Drachman is careful to note were not a mausoleum, in accordance with Jewish tradition), and that Houdini referred himself as "your \[Drachman's\] old scholar" in the letter he sent requesting that he speak at the unveiling. He also mentions Houdini's wife, Bess, who was not Jewish but who he recorded saying once at a dinner at Drachman's home that she considered herself to have become Jewish when she married Houdini, which Drachman says he did not comment on at the time, but that there is Talmudic support for that idea (though normative Judaism requires conversion).
Whatever their true relationship was, it is clear that Drachman held Houdini in high esteem, no matter how much of his motivation for stating it (or perhaps his overstatement) may be chalked up to Houdini's celebrity. At the end of his section on Houdini, Drachman says:
What kind of a relationship Drachman actually had with Houdini is debatable. While the above stories can be confirmed by other sources, when told through Houdini's eyes the story with the purchase of the Mishneh Torah reads somewhat differently- in one interview with a writer from The American Hebrew, Houdini tells the same story, but temporarily forgets Drachman's name, and doesn't mention that he gave a donation to the synagogue in order to reacquire the books, only mentioning that Drachman was the one who bought them. He describes Drachman as the rabbi who confirmed him at his bar mitzvah, and in contrast with Drachman's description of Houdini as being barely literate in Hebrew, Houdini portrays himself as having been an assistant Hebrew teacher to his father in Wisconsin. As that would have obviously occurred when Houdini was a small child, I'm inclined to believe Drachman's actual assessment of Houdini's skills. Houdini also told the story of how he visited Drachman once he was famous as Harry Houdini and revealed his true identity as a former student, and that Drachman was completely shocked, implying that any connection later in Houdini's life came after a long break in Houdini's youth. Perhaps, though, this article came before a reconnection between Houdini and Drachman, so that many of Drachman's recollections come from a time after this date when they were closer. (On a completely different note, in the same article Houdini humorously claims that his legendary lock-picking skills came from his learning how to break the locks on his mother's cabinets where she hid the pies that she'd baked.).
