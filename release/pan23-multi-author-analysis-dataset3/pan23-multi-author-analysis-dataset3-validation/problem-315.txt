The republicans should have never nominated a person like Trump, the republican senators should have ejected trump in impeachment number 1, the DOJ should have indicted trump based on the obstruction Mueller proved in his report, the current president shouldn’t be so worried about looking political, it is by definition, the American people should not be so poorly represented at such a high cost. Our federal government regardless of party has been corrupted by big $ and the American people continue to pay the bill while working two jobs and unable to afford health care.
Absolutely correct, but once big $ takes hold it’s like a cancer, hard to remove, but if enough of us can see it we can reject it in every way possible, starting by voting against self republican elitist! Vote America.
Mueller wasn’t in a court of law to prove anything, but his report clearly stated in 10 different instances where trump obstructed justice or did you miss that part?
Mueller never proved obstruction, he said he could make an argument for charging, as a reminder in this country we have trials to PROVE guilt. We don’t rely on animals like Andrew Weismann! to persecute their political enemies. It’s been conclusively shown that Clinton and Elias were the originators of the dossier.
