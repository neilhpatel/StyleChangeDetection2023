Erdogoon is going to see this as weakness and push them even harder in the pre election months. His psychotic religious base are already saying stuff like "this is gods punishment for not going harder on sweden for burning the quran" and similar things.

In many Muslim nations and especially Turkey recent days there have been burning of Swedish flags and crowds yelling anti Swedish slurs because 1 man burned a Quran a few weeks before... Yet after the Earthquake Sweden cared more about helping Muslim victims in Turkey and Syria than most Muslim nations ever would.
Lol and Turks were burning Swedish flags and yelling anti Swedish slurs because 1 man burned a Quran a few weeks before... Funny how they suddenly gladly accept the help from a country they hate and blame for one man's actions... hypocrisy.
I find this a bit cowardly and hypocritical. Especially because Muslims have always made it clear not to be judged by one extremist's action themselves.
