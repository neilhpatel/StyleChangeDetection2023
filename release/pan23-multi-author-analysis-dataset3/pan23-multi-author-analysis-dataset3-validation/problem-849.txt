I'd like to call him Captain Obvious.... but he's right. This needs to be stated, over and over again. Russia will not win this war or any part of Ukraine.
It's not just about taking Ukrainian territory. It was betting that Ukraine would be a fait accompli that would discredit the whole system of international politics. Proof that Russia was still an empire and great power that deserved a sphere of influence where it controlled puppet states in which no foreign power could legitimately meddle, like during the cold war or the age of empires of the nineteenth century.
Remember the context here. NATO had been weakening for decades and Trump's isolationist turn began to undercut the trust that people had in NATO, because really the point of Article 5 is calling the US Army to defend Europe. Macron was also quite vocal about the need for an EU army to eliminate the dependence Europe has on the US. Germany was so sure that they had a special understanding with Russia that would allow them to negotiate. NATO was on the shakiest footing it'd been possibly ever.
That's why the US and EU can't afford to betray Ukraine by just letting it go or pressuring Ukraine into a deal that only sets them up for another war in eight years. That's why the US and EU must supply weapons and ammunition. That's why the US and EU must keep up diplomatic pressure on Russia, even if it's obvious that such pressure will not achieve a peaceful resolution until Russia's hope of unseating the global order created by the collapse of the Soviet Union is buried in a shallow grave in the Donbas.
>“Russia chose to destabilize that and put all that into question, and it’s not just a question of Russia’s behaviour towards Ukraine or any countries around Russia, it’s a question of other countries around the world wondering that, ‘Oh, perhaps might makes right, now. Perhaps because we have a larger army than our neighbour, we can invade, we can attack.’.
