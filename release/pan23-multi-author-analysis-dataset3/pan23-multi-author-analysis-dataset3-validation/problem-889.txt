Based on the words "in connection with the Service and Youtube's (...) business...", would they be able to just license videos to outside entities that aren't doing it to support Youtube's core business? Like, I could see saying "Well, we used your video in an ad for YouTube, that's covered." But for Netflix, it might be more up in the air.
I thought you needed to register to be able to bring a suit for statutory damages, but you could still bring a suit for actual damages if the work was unregistered.
I am NOT an IP attorney, but some quick research seems to indicate that registration is needed if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work. And I am assuming this is a U.S. work, so the answer may be different in other countries.
Thereâ€™s an American copyright attorney named Leonard French with a YouTube channel called Lawful Masses that might be worth following. He cover a lot of IP issues like registration and fair use. You might want to check it out.
Is addition to the complex factual issues and possible defenses identified by others, you asked would it be worth pursuing. One of the first questions an IP attorney will ask is whether you registered the work.
You may be right. I am not a copyright attorney and was trying to point out an issue addressed in an FAQ on the website for the U.S. Copyright Office:
It's a copyright issue -- and copyright issues are complicated and fact-specific. It could be an infringing use that would expose Netflix to having to pay you damages, or it could be a fair use for which they would not owe you anything other than attribution. There isn't enough information even to guess, but even if you did provide more information here, all anyone could do is guess.
