Did she forge your signature on loan documents to apply for these loans, and then out her address down as yours and receive the checks and cash them?
You would’ve had to sign documents agreeing to pay the student loan’s off in your name which I saw a different comment saying that they did not forge your signature. If your parents won’t work with you directly to get a paid off then your choices seem to be to get a lawyer involved to sue them if the lawyer thinks the divorce decree is enough to win the case or to bite the bullet and just pay off your own college loans. There are always payment plans based on income you could look into for student loans.
This is literally how student loans work. You are an adult who entered into a contract by signing the paperwork. You would have also been required to go through the counseling for your promissory notes every year reminding you of your responsibility. Then, before you graduate, you are required as part of graduation in the three schools I attended to go through exit counseling that says when payment starts and about how much your payment will be. If you have financed anything since you started college then you should have seen those loans on your credit. The notifications for the loans aren’t usually only from the processor alone. This comes to you from the school too. I did this for the last 15 years as I got my doctorate and my freshman in college just started the process this spring.
How old were you when you started college? Did you sign the loan agreement before you began college, or was it signed later?
