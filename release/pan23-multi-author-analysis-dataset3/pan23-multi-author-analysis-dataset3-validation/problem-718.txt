It’s not criminal, you’ll just have to work out a payment plan you can afford. Also, 100’s of cars were parked on the beach? So did 100’s of cars also go into the ocean with yours?! Or were you the only car out of 100’s to leave your car for 10 hours next to the ocean?
Hey, the damage liability is only where you damage it in a way that is not excluded. Driving it into the sea is not included on the policy. Therefore you pay the full price of the vehicle (current market value I would push for).
Sorry mate, your going to owe the replacement cost of the car @ it's current value. You also have 2 seperate cases here, regardless of the tour operators instructions you have a contract with the rental car company, and one with the tour operators as you purchased a tour. After you lose the $$ to the rental car company, you can lawyer up and see if you can recoup the losses from the tour operators. Not to be rude, I doubt an operator in the area that's local and works everyday, explicitly told you to park there. If you parked with everyone else, seems unlikely you would be the only loser. Regardless, no comment! Prepare for a big bill and hopefully you can launch a counter against the tour operators.
