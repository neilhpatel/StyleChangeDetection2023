I thought I'd just build on the first half of your question /u/fullyoperational with a hypothetical situationin which the whole Norse funeral ship thing actually happened, and give some info on how materials are preserved at sea.
The process of cremation usually leaves quite small pieces of bone matter, so realistically we're only going to find those in an excavation, which would only happen in shallow water, which has lower chances of survival, and that's if our hypothetical ship even manages to sink.

Just to add-on briefly about the archaeological record of ship burials. There are Scandinavian land ship burials found in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, as well as on the British Isles. The Vendel and Valsgarde graves, in Sweden and from the 6th-9th centuries, contain people buried in boats around 30 feet long, often with many grave goods. Unlike the funeral Ibn Fadlan describes, these bodies were not cremated, but simply placed on the ship and then buried in the ground, with the ship serving as a sort of coffin. (You can see some of the burial goods as well as a drawing of what the ship would have looked like at one of the graves in Valsgarde .).
