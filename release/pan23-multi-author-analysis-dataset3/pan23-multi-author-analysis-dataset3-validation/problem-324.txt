I'm not trying to say you should be thankful that they're willing to look at documents while still keeping you in consideration, but they don't have to, generally. They could just say "Hmm DUI? Tell them 'we've taken the project in a different direction' and wish them luck.".
Unless there is a specific state statute forbidding it (and this may be coming down the pipe in some states in the near future), they can refuse to hire you because of the DUI, whether you give them paperwork or not. You have a right not to refuse to give them the documentation they're asking for.
You don't have to give them the underlying documents about your DUI. You can refuse. They can choose not to hire you because you refuse to give them this info.
Are you a person of color and do you have some reason to believe that if you were white they wouldn't be asking for this information?
You are free to complain that this is racist and that white people with recent DUIs and criminal convictions are hired there without having to provide court documents.
