I'm a Florida Employment Attorney, but my practice is solely representing employers. I'm not your attorney.
Florida does have a Private Sector Whistleblower Act. It protects private sector employees when they object to or refuse to participate in a violation by the employer of a law, rule, or regulation that is applicable to their employer and pertaining to the business (and in a few other instances that dont apply here). However, I dont think it helps you. "Theft" is a generally applicable law, and is not somehow more applicable to your employer than the public at large. Also, the theft by an employee from the company probably isn't an act of the company (there's an argument under a case called Pinder that the employer endorsed or ratified the theft so it becomes the act of the employer, but the employer can't really steal from itself, so at that point it's not even theft).
One interesting point to try to save a case for yourself if you do talk to a plaintiff's attorney is you said you work in HVAC? I believe that's a licensed profession in Florida. I dont know the regulations, but if there's a rule or regulation from the DBPR or the applicable Board that would prohibit the theft (maybe even a rule about good morale character?), you could at least use that as a law, rule, or regulation that was violated. But I still don't see how you could get past the argument that it was an employee that violated it and not the employer.
It's also not illegal to tell your co-workers, any clients you worked with, and any competitors about the facts of what happened.
Make sure other people at the company know but i don't think you have much legal ground. You can collect unemployment and your old company doesn't have much of a leg to stand on legally for contesting unless they lie.
If you don't have proof that you were illegitimately fired, then you won't be able to effectively sue.
This experience might encourage you to take an opposing stance against at-will employment laws though.
