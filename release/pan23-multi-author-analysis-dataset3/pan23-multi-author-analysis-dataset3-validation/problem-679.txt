She - Sinema lie to us, just like Santos did in NY Sinema will be voted out on the next election. She better fill her pockets with corporate $ “Donations” before she is kick out of our government But, the loser Kerry Lakes wants to take her position These Criminal Fascist are hungry for destructive power We must vote out incompetence and vote against Fascism!
She lost her democratic donors though wall street loves her, she obviously won't get money from the Dems and shes toxic to the left so in a three way race she'll hurt the Republican more than a Democrat.
She only ran as a Democrat and won as a Democrat, only to betray her constituency by joining a party of anti-democratic morons.
She's more unpopular with AZ Democrats than she is with any other group and that was the support base that put her into office.
She's either a complete idiot who a sadist who revels in self destructing just to harm her constitutes. Like she could have played corporate shill in a less obvious and obnoxious way. She didn't even really need to endanger her popularity with Manchin there.
The only rational reason I can figure is that she decided she could make more money as a "walkaway" grifter on Fox and Friends or some shit.
