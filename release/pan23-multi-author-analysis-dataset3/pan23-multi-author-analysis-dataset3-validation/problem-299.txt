Thanks for this info! I've never heard of Pritzker before. It's exciting to learn that there might be some Dems who aren't in the spotlight who are considering running in 2024.
Are you saying Dems are grading him for reelection on a curve because he's done a great job on pursuing his agenda? Or are you saying grading him pursuing his agenda on a curve would result in a "great job?".
YES. I wish more people understood this. Politics are fucking boring and they are meant to be boring. I don't want to be entertained, I want to be governed. There's no shortage of venues for entertainment these days.
The worst thing I can say about Biden is he's fucking old, and honestly I don't think that's fair of me to hold against him, especially when I've been pleased by his presidency and wouldn't mind giving him another 4 years.
He’s old, which I don’t love, but I think we’d lose momentum if the party hems and haws about nominating him, and I think that if he voluntarily decides against a second term the GOP will use it to “prove” that democrats are weak. Him running again is the least worst choice, and the further we get from the Trump era the more (I hope) we see the buffoonery of the GOP backfiring on them.
