india was a soviet satellite and pak was a us satellite but unlike pak india is a well managed country which is hpe to do well with western investments and not spread radicalism and terrorism and focus on actual growth.
Trade is clearly a focus of the trip, but that there's another layer to this did not escape the German ambassador to India, Philipp Ackermann. He explained at a press briefing ahead of the trip: "India buying oil from Russia is none of our business. Basically, that's something that the Indian government decides ... what we would like to see, of course, is an Indian engagement at some stage.".
Lmao. You know why India has such a terrible HDI? you know why China is building its infrastructure up on the Ladakh region, while India celebrates videos of its army chasing Chinese away with sticks? Because the Indian nation is so full of hubris, it can't see that China has already beaten it. In every single way. Militarily, Economically, Geopolitically.
From the 90's to now, India moved ahead slightly over Pakistan across most of those indexes. China utterly eclipsed India. Like not even in the same ballpark. Actually most countries in the region did. Not as much as China, but many countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, The Philippines etc also make India look shit when used as comparison.
