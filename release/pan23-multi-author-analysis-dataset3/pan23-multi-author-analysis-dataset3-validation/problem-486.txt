They're in a tough spot. Bannon's strategy of "flood the zone with sht" carried over into 2022 polls, with a lot of new right-wing pollsters forecasting bigger GOP gains. They met criteria and were not way outside other polls - its not like non-partisans were polling a blue wave - so they couldn't exclude them, so it weighed down their model. Their defense was bad - they said Dems could do the same thing but aren't as if that validated the bad GOP polls - but ultimately fixing the model is going to be hard when polling has become a bad-faith activity for one party.
I'm sick of people EXPECTING close to 100% of us to support democrats, and then blaming us if democrats lose, because 10% of us voted republican a few times.
Republicans had worse results than expected but in overall mid term votes they beat Dems by 3 million — they just weren’t in places that affected the results.
3) it’s also possible low turnout vs 2020 to actual shifts in opinion moved the needle (Eg Rep voters are more regular voters not there is now more of them).
1) a decrease in Racial polarization would be a good thing for the country as a whole, if Republicans need Black/Latino Voters to win elections it will force a moderation in the party.
Of course the Republicans don’t really have anything to offer black and Hispanic voters besides racism and further exploitation, but the Democrats— once again— tend to shoot themselves in the foot on messaging.
Yes. Black people and Hispanics tend to be incredibly conservative in their views of LGBT, and Republicans definitely have been successful with their messaging that “the left” is trying to groom their children with sexually explicit and pro-LGBT propaganda. Black and Hispanic voters are also more likely to face substantial difficulties due to inflation wiping out their already low-on-average buying power while the Democrats keep telling everyone that things are going swell/okay (the economy is doing fine, for those of us who are upper middle class or higher).
