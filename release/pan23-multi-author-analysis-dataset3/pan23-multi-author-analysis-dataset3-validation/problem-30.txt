I don't think I can file for unemployment because this is my 2nd job. That and I have ran out of options in my small town for my profession. I'm an x-ray technologist. Plus they have not fired me. And I don't think I would qualify for unemployment if I quit.
Well thank you for answering another question I had in mind. Whether or not this redit group are actual lawyers and had the experience to help me with my inquiry.
If no lawyer is interested in taking your case, it be several things. They may not believe you have a case, they may not practice that type of law (you may be contacting the wrong sort of attorney), they may not be able to take on new clients at this time, they may have a conflict of interest. However, if the EEOC is also uninterested, I'm guessing it's the first - you don't really have a case for a hostile working environment, but you can take independent action (sue them) yourself if you want.
The EEOC investigated so I assume there at other details you didn't share but I don't see any evidence of hostile work environment in your narrative here. What protected Class are you being singled out for/treated differently due to/harrassed over and how many times did it occur?
