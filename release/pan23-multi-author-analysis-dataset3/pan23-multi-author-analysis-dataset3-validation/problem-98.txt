Great question! While I hope to hear our resident NY expert chime in, I can shed some light in the mean time. Three cities really defined American population hubs in the mid 1770s - Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. New York had grown very quickly over the previous 50 years or so, even drawing a young Ben Franklin looking for a new home in 1723. He commented on how merchant-central the town was and, unable to find printing work, took a suggestion to inquire with a printer new to Philadelphia in that town instead.
While NY grew, Boston actually shrank for a little while. Sometime in the mid 1760s New York passed Boston in population at about 15,000, becoming second only to Philadelphia for size in our colonial cities (population is hard to equate exactly as Philadelphia census' shrunk in geography and NY included rural areas of Manhattan in theirs, but it's safe to say Philly was dominant until the end of the 18th century). Elites in New York attended balls in extravegant gowns but traveled dark muddy streets to get there. It had all the fine form of a worldly city but with rough edges. Philly had about 40,000 to New York's 28,000. By comparison London had 750,000 and Paris about half that and Vienna at about 200,000. New York had started street lights in the 1760s, but only a decade later Le Barbier of Seville would be playing in the City of Lights as there were many playhouses in Paris. NYC had seen their first play in 1732, but it had been a traveling troop from London that performed it. In the 1750s theatres and space in taverns became built and available. During the war, however, there is no record of theatre except those organized by British forces for their soldiers. The philosophical groups of Philly exceeded those in NYC and the free black schools that would start around 1790 there had been set up for 20 years in Philly already (along with an all girl school). Philadelphia was unequivocally the colonial powerhouse city in terms of society in colonial America. What fueled Boston to influence so much was the writers, publishers, and statesmen of the city which were established long before those in New York would find an audience in the merchant city. So no, in 1776 very few (if any, and certainly not someone like Eliza Schuyler) would call NYC in the top 5 of world cities in terms of "culture" or greatness and certainly not better than Vienna, Paris, or the mighty London (which the colonial elite tried to emulate the trends of).
As we can see, Americans would be proud of New York but as a capital of commerce, not culture, and certainly not on a world scale - it was far from "The Greatest" (and this speaks nothing of anywhere but Europe and America). By the 1800s that changed. George Washinon attend the theatre on occasion as President residing in NYC. The Park Theatre opened in 1798 along with other art devoted centers, the New York Manumission Society had been formed and gained passage of their manumission act in 1799, and the population climbed above 30,000 in the city - it's high society culture soon passed that found in Philadelphia. Within a few decades, it would grow about 10 times in size. In 1811 a grand design was created for the layout of the city. In 1820 those oil street lamps were replaced by gas ones. The art commitment of the city, and the rapidly increasing commerce, shipping, and banking industries, allowed even more growth, quickly sending NYC to the status of select few cities that today could be called "The Greatest City in the World".
However, it appears that most claims of "greatest city in the world" before the late 19th century were London, not New York City or any other U.S. city. Though by the 1830s, there did appear to be some recognition that New York had developed into the greatest city within the United States.
In 1835, the Welsh writer Henry Walter in his History of England that New York "has grown up into the greatest city of the western hemisphere".
In 1846, John Fanning Watson of Philadelphia in the book Annals and Occurrences of New York City and State, in the Olden Time that New York City was "the greatest city, hitherto known to the Western world".
In 1864, Joseph Alfred Scoville of New York, writing under the pseudonym "Walter Barrett", in the book The Old Merchants of New York City that, in the forty years after the American Revolution, New York grew to be "the greatest city of this continent, and had fairly commenced to be the greatest city in the world".
Among Americans, the recognition of New York as the country's greatest city, not just by population but by cultural and commercial impact, was being recognized earlier, by the mid-19th century, at least among Northerners. Internationally, New York surely was being recognized as the most important city in the United States. But among Southerners, that recognition may have come later, not until the late 19th or early 20th century. And even today, I'm sure there are Californians who might talk up L.A. or San Francisco, Floridians who might prefer Miami, and Texans who might mention Dallas, or San Antonio (remember the Alamo!). A recent did find New York to be ranked by U.S. adults as "America's finest city". But another ranking found it to be among the . To each, their own.
