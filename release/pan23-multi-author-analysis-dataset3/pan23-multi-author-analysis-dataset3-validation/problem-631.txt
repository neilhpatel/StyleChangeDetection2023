Certainly you could lobby for such a law. I'm not sure you'd find a ton of support for that. I don't know why reporting crime would be landlord's duty.
Obviously you can negotiate with landlord to whatever outcome you both agree. But you have no options inherent from this event.
Nor, really, are you owed a response. Landlord simply need not take his time to respond to this, an ask for something he's not legally obligated to do.
As a practical matter, you should try to reach an agreement with your landlord and hopefully they'll have some sympathy. If you do reach an agreement, make sure it's in writing (email or text is sufficient, but it needs to be in writing).
You should also put all future correspondence with your landlord in writing, including notice of the moveout and to document when you relinquished possession.
As a practical matter, after you move out, they may not attempt to collect unpaid rent / termination fees. If they do, it'll probably be through a collections company rather than suing you because it's not worth the time and energy to sue you. Collections company might report it to a credit bureau, but if you get a letter/bill from a collections company, you should dispute the validity of the debt if they have included any inappropriate charges and if they are charging rent for time when the unit was rerented.
You should also document the condition of the apartment upon moving out in case they try to charge for damage.
