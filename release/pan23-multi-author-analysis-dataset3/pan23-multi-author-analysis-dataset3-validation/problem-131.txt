The player punched a ref because he was butthurt about being kicked out of the game. The ref escalated the violence further and we got this:
He sent off player Josemir Santos Abreu, 31, who refused to leave the field and began a fight with the referee. Abreu threw a punch, which prompted da Silva to draw a knife from his pocket and repeatedly stab Abreu. Abreu died on the way to the hospital.[3][7] When fans watching the game, including Abreu's friends and family, found out about his death,[8] they invaded the pitch[9] and stoned the referee, before decapitating him, quartering him,[10] and putting his head on a stake in the pitch.
Family of player stone the referee, decapitate him, quarter the fucking guy (arms and legs ripped or cut off) and put his head on a stake in the field - wtf is wrong with the world!
Stoned the referee, before decapitating him, quartering him, and putting his head on a stake in the pitch.
Doesn't seem like a typical response to same crazy referee stabbibng people but I'm not from Northern Brazil. It's such a lunacy, I don't even have proper words for it. I'm surprised they haven't eaten his heart.
