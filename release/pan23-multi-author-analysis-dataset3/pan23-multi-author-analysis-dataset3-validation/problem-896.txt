There's actually many different ways a tank can be better than another. Higher resistance to explosions, better armor, ability to intercept missiles, ability to fire faster (or with smaller missiles so you can get more inside), bigger space inside (so the people inside are more comfortable or you can put more people if needed), night vision and other gadgets, using fuel efficiently, etc.
But we are a parliamentary democracy. It's not the government the one that takes these decisions, but the parliament. PSOE can (and it's completely normal) pass resolutions in congress without their coalition's votes, by getting votes elsewhere. And luckily, the center-right would not dare not to support Ukraine unconditionally, while the far-right is in a weird and funny "we totally never supported Putin and no one here ever said he was an example to follow, yeah that never happened and that's why we are supporting Ukraine" state, so you can count on their vote, too.
I'm talking about the discourse of the right wing regarding the situation in Ukraine, which is nothing because they are just doing opposition to the government and making up problems where they aren't to hide that they are a bunch of incompetents.
Regarding politics, the party in government is "we do whatever we are being told by NATO", their coalition is "we shouldn't help Ukraine because war is bad and is better to not make the conflict last longer" and the right wing politics are "<fucking nothing>".
Most opinions I've seen are "supports", "don't care" (as in "is something I have no opinion about but war is bad in general") and "Ukraine is being invaded but we are not being told everything" with a vast majority being "supports" and "don't care.".
