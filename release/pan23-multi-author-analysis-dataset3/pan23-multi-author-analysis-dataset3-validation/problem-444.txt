Some progressive dems need to start running on overhauling the federal justice system and Supreme Court. Expand it to 21 members, make congress fill the court within a timely manner or else all benefits and pay for the congress people will be docked until they confirm somebody, bring back the filibuster, and rotate decisions between random 7 justices for each case.
That should leave us with more judges confirmed by both parties (yes, I know strongly partisan judges like Thomas or Alito had 80+ senate votes, so this isnâ€™t a sure thing) and a far less partisan court system.
Great, Now Roberts is gonna have to go and whine about how the American People don't view the Supreme Court as a fair organization, and is losing credibility and standing in the eyes of the citizens.
Don't get me wrong, I think that's also an ugly thing for a sitting Justice to be doing, but it's neither surprising nor as offensively brazen a display of bias and partiality as this is.
We are only just beginning to learn just how unbalanced the checks on judicial overreach are when a SCOTUS court forgoes any attempt to appear impartial. They are only answerable to Congress, the same political body which appoints them. It's a fundamental flaw in the system that can, and probably will, get much worse.
