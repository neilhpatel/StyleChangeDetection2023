A lesson? Ukraine literally lost 4 regions and thousands of troops. Not to mention all of the destroyed infrastructure. I don't think many of you understand what a war of attrition really means. So cocky.
Pushed back? Kyiv is still getting attacked daily and Russian boots have been on the ground since February.
This is what the Russians are currently targeting all across the country. Non-stop rocket barrages that see the Ukrainians using up their S-300 missiles to defend vital infastructure.
To put things in perspective, Ukraine started this war with about 100 s-300 systems, with up to 300 missile launchers (each system can connect to multiple launchers).
The Americans cant supply s-300 missiles, so now they must replace the entire Ukrainian fleet of S-300 systems with Patriot systems, or see Ukraine run out of air defence missiles.
(Russia has also learned to expect Ukrainian air strikes, and now actively uses their air defence equipment, instead of turning it off because it interfered with coms (!), which was the only reason the TB2 drones were effective).
February 2022 was a massive missed opportunity to smash Ukraine, which they didnâ€™t do because they wanted to capture the country relatively intact. They could have gone all out with missile and bomber strikes, but they decided not to.
