They'll probably try to accuse him of deliberately doing unlawful stuff with his executive actions, or dig through the Hunter Biden stuff until they find something that might look somewhat suspicious if you squint really hard and turn your head a certain way, or wait until he has some minor gaffe and then say he's not mentally competent and should be removed.
Your question isn't really that simple, because "high crimes and misdemeanors" doesn't have a clearly defined meaning. Pretty much anything the House comes up with can be considered a high crime or misdemeanor. They could accuse Biden of being a giant doodoohead in the impeachment articles, and that would be sufficient to remove him from office if they could get the votes for it in the House and Senate. They have a ton of freedom to come up with stuff to put into impeachment articles.
“when asked for his response to Republicans pushing the impeachment talk. He previously joked, "I don't know what the hell they're going to impeach me for.””.
At least with Trumps second impeachment over January 6th there was a chance of an actual impeachment succeeding. At the time there were some republicans who weren’t on the “well he’s leaving office anyways” or “mostly peaceful protestors” bandwagon.
If Biden is impeached for what ever they decide to come up with, there is literally a zero percent chance he’d be removed.
MAGA is vile and this effort to impeach Biden for nothing or anything is going to blow up in their faces. They'll be even more hated than they are now and people will be even more convinced with how dangerous these fascists loons are.
