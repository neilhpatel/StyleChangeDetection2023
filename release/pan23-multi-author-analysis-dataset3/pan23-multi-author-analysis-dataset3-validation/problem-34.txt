Imagine the chaos that would ensue if the United States required all imported products to be made by workers who were paid at least the US minimum wage.
You could probably get Saudi Arabia to behave just by threatening to cut off all products from companies in California. Like Hollywood movies, Apple products, and, well, tons and tons of porn. (Even if the porn is illegal, of course they are accessing it.).
1. 2014 had a really strong showing for Republicans overall. Not as good as 2010, but still really good. I remember they ended up gaining like 9 seats in the Senate alone.
4. He campaigned in areas that were predominantly very Liberal and not thought of as potential voters.
5. He was running against Martha Coakley, the Democratic nominee in the 2010 Massachusetts Senate Special Election, who lost to the Republican nominee, Scott Brown. Her loss ended a Democratic streak of maintaining that specific seat since 1952. She also lost the Democrats their supermajority in the Senate, making them no longer filibuster proof. She was also quite unpopular. She insulted Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling (Basically a death sentence in MA) and never really seemed interested in meeting her possible future constituents.
By the time his re-election came around in 2018, Massachusetts loved him, and would’ve easily re-elected him in 2022, but the Massachusetts Republican Party made it clear they would back a Trump endorsed candidate as opposed to Baker, so he didn’t attempt another run. And of course, the Trump backed Republican candidate lost the general election by record breaking numbers.
