Correct- though R voters are over 90% white, those getting abortions are about 66% non white. They’d ironically be increasing the non white population.
In addition to being anti abortion/birth control, they’re also anti gay and pro Christian Nationalist.
And, just to reiterate, I think what Republicans are doing about abortion is abhorrent. I just think we need to have honest debates about it instead of the unproductive mudslinging that dominates the discussion today.
So I'm all for reproductive rights, but in the minds of these people this type of argument is like saying "If you don't like assaulting homeless people, just don't do it. Don't interfere with other people's freedom to assault homeless people.".
And you almost get it, but then you realize something. Where are the black people in this black and white vision of america? For that matter, LGBT people? Independent women? Hell, what about a rebellious teenager who's into rock and roll? Well, every rebellious teenager went through a totally not scripted revelation and now likes jesus and classical hymns. And the other people? They don't exist. This is 50's sitcom world, after all.
Only, you notice how all that stuff I listed is fictional and not, like, 1950s newspaper articles? That's not an accident. This mythologized, fictionalized 1950s is what they're trying to resurrect. One where junior goes down to the local bike shop to get his first bike, saying hi to the milkman along the way with jaunty 50's sitcom music playing in the background. He gets a 25 cent gumball at the bike shop, and dreams of one day owning a car and a house and having a wife and 2 kids.
