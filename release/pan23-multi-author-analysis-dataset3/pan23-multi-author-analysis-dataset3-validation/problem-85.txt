Considering that weed is illegal in Texas, dob him in for that. Next time he posts videos of him plying young men with weed, record it and show it to the police.
Just take some screen recordings, and go to the police station. Tell them what you’ve seen, show them the recorded footage, and that you think he’s grooming them. If they have any sense, they’ll try and get him in the act.
The second they look into him for anything, they’re gonna catch him for dealing. I just want to make sure I have a presentable case before I contact law enforcement.
I just get the feeling the cops are gonna say “thanks, neat!” And then file the report away and do nothing about it.
The police, you'd report it to the police. It's not clear from your description if he's breaking or not. But you'd report it to the police and hopefully they'd investigate. Some of what we consider grooming behavior is not illegal in and of itself. Let the police handle it.
So explain that to the police and let them figure out their next move. It's not up to you to identify the boys involved, conduct an investigation or determine what charges, if any, are appropriate.
