The reputation of English cookery (or lack thereof) was in place well before rationing took effect , and the more recent thread somewhat modifies the older one. A. V. Kirwan's Host and Guest of 1864, for example, says that "The cookery of England is, with the greater part of the nation, an object, not of luxurious desire or morning meditation, but of plain necessity and solid comfort." Kirwan also quotes Voltaire saying "though (the English) have twenty-four religions, they have but one sauce", though that may well be apocryphal and appears to be variously attributed with different numbers of religions and sauces. By the 20th century Marcel Boulestin’s Simple French Cooking for English Homes of 1923 remains scathing; "I am also assured that many English cooks find cooking a tedious drudgery; perhaps that is because they have no imagination, or are not given a chance of showing initiative. It must certainly be extraordinarily dull to send up boiled potatoes and boiled cabbage meal after meal".
Because if you think about it, the basic meal in much of Northern Europe is also just a meat, a potato, and boiled vegetable of some sort. And American food also got a reputation for being bland and unhealthy, which came out of industrialization rather than rationing, only to see a resurgence of “traditional” American foods in the late 20th century. So the real story is probably in why the reputation of British food gets so heavily linked to that style of cooking, rather than the history of that style of food itself.
It comes up all the time that the “stereotype” of British food is bland, mushy, etc. Most of the answers I’m seeing are looking at the history of British food to see if something changed because of rationing.
I have this theory that a lot of "traditional British food" became popular due to rationing in WW2. I am thinking of foods like Baked Beanz and tinned tomatoes. How accurate is this, and how big is the lasting impact of WW2 rationing on British cuisine?](.
