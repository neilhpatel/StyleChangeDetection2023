Depends on the challenger. Gym Jordan? Hell no. I'd rather have McCarthy. David Valadao or Dan Newhouse though? They voted to impeach Trump. Either of those two would be better than McCarthy.
McCarthy will be the Speaker. At most, Democrats might be able to extract a few concessions from him. My bet would be concessions related to removing Democratic members from committees.
I mean, not really. They would need Republicans to vote with them. They're not going to vote for a Democrat for Speaker just because they don't like McCarthy.
And no Republican will go along with that because it will just be the extremists going against McCarthy and no one wants to be the guy that let the Democrats pick the Republican Speaker.
So yes, since Dems have more in common with McCarthy than whoever Gaetz and his clan want to put up they should make a handshake deal with him and put him in his speaker.
While that would be hilarious I don't know how that's better for the Democrats. They're better to try and squeeze concessions out of McCarthy and have some of their members vote for him.
Yes and those Republicans may vote against McCarthy but they will never vote with Democrats to elect a Democrat-approved Speaker. It would be political suicide.
