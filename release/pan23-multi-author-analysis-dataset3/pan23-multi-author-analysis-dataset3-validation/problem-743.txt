2. Does that mean that racism and classism are a conspiracy foisted upon the masses of the people to keep them in line. (Not in a real, conspiratorial sense. But it's complicated.).
I think that based on this evidence, and the fact that actual experts seem to largely agree that the codification of race in the legal codes of the colonies and then the united states were based on realpolitik, with consideration given to economic and political power these laws gave to the elite classes, which is then justified by and grounded in racist theory and rhetoric, which developed and changed over time in order to support the existing hierarchy. That said, I haven't actually been able to find whether any of the actors who put these initial policies in place (e.g. the Virginia Slave Acts) ever actually wrote about their motivations and said 'yes, Bacon's Rebellion was a problem".
Que Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 in which enslaved whites, Africans, and indentured servants rebelled against the ruling elites of Virginia. From an elite standpoint, as enslaved Africans and African laborers continued to create a larger portion of the workforce, it would make sense (from the elite planter's point of view) that they should be more fearful of a united lower-class revolt that was made up of all oppressed groups. Historian Alden Vaughan writes that " The benign situation of free blacks ended soon after Bacon's Rebellion. Breen and Innes assert that the sharp increase in slave imports, especially of unacculturated Africans, "exacerbated racial tensions" tensions whose existence the authors had heretofore largely denied. Whites began for the first time to discuss black inferiority because the importations "generated racist ideas or brought to the surface latent racist assumptions." Free blacks suffered as much as the newly imported slaves. Some black farmers moved to Maryland in search of better land. Those who stayed in Virginia faced declining prosperity, and 'increasingly their white neighbors treated them with distrust and disdain. In 1699 the legislature ordered free blacks to depart the colony within 6 months.".
