Exploratory Surgery is the name of the procedure and is a recognized type of surgery. (Like saying spay or mass removal) An exploratory surgery by name is a hunt to find a problem. In DFW (I work in the metroplex) a weekend exploratory at a 24 hour or er clinic is usually $2000-3000. Add on radiographs and other diagnostic and you can reach 4k fast. It would be cheaper on a Monday but your friend got weekend ER rates.
Sending out radiographs always means consulting a board certified radiologist. Your friend paid extra for that consult. If a radiologist is worried about something it raises the urgency the general veterinarian feels. If a radiologist tells me to go to surgery I will strongly recommend it. That is standard care.
Nothing in your story reads like a winnable malpractice veterinary claim from what I have learned in the seminars on protecting my clinic from lawsuits but I will leave that to the lawyers. She needs to file on her insurance for a reimbursement and find a different veterinarian who gives pre surgical estimates.
She would be better served to call a few other vet practices in town and ask what a simple exploratory surgery would be usual and customary charges. With that, see if what her vet charged was out of line. If so, use it to negotiate down the bill.
Our vet does procedures on the weekend, only sends weekend cases to vet hospital if beyond their capabilities or after hours.
1. Surgery was indicated. Nothing you posted would suggest otherwise. Dog's can't talk, and the x-ray indicated a possible blockage. Emergency surgery would be appropriate. The fact that surgery didn't find plastic (which is very hard to see on an x-ray), doesn't absolve your friend, it simply means that the surgery didn't find plastic or a blockage.
My main question stems from the fact that only one doctor looked at the proofs, and the doctor performing the surgery didn’t. The surgeon stated they would’ve been able to tell gastroenteritis without surgery, which implies fault of some kind.
Owners don’t know that you’re going into surgery regardless of the tests though. We going in expecting that the reason the diagnostic tools exist is to AVOID surgery. How would an ordinary person know that veterinarians are instructed to perform surgery regardless of test results??
