I’m guessing it was due to generational hatred toward Turkey by past abused culture that motivated the arsonist.
Well, Turkey has historically been a giant piece of shit to countries around it for hundreds of years before collapsing into multiple states, Turkey included.
Yeah, and the fact that the countries around turkey are assimilated, colonized by them and also that every country around turkey is speaking only Turkish clarifies how a giant piece of shit Turkey is.
Context: There’s a great amount of racism in Germany towards the Turkish because of many Turkish immigrants (think Hispanics in America).
Lived in both areas with high number of migrants/turks, and with native German people only. Guess which ones always offered to help me move stuff when in need, bring food occasionally or who I actually know what they do in life and vice versa.... and which part in town has a bad reputation among the native germans that I should never ever set my foot in these areas.
To this day, the only times I interact with my native german neighbors is when they knock on my door to get their package from amazon.
