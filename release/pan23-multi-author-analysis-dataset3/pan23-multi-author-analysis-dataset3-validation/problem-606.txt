For me the core difference between legalising weed and mushrooms.. pills, etc.. vs things like heroine and cocaine is how addictive they are. Do you go full ham and not limit people’s use of it if it’s legal? That’ll go wrong - look at the opioid problem big farma caused handing out much weaker opioids like candy. Do you restrict them to certain amounts per person? Same problem but now you’re just recruiting en masse for the illegal drug trade.
It’s frankly not obtuse at all, because we know the outcome so, so well lol. We’ve been seeing it for decades, the behaviour and chemical side of opioid addiction is well understood… We have massive dependency issues with all legal opioids.
End the stigma on drug use, the obsession with punishing drug use, and the for-profit prison system who intentionally turn addicts into criminals for financial gain. My guess is you’ve never had a loved one who was also a drug addict.
Sorry but you sound like someone that has never seen a person with an addiction to hard drugs. These "substances" (hard drugs) are addictive even in small doses and they can easily ruin a person's life.
The biggest danger of heroin nowadays is that its heroin, there is no safe doses to take that stuff in.
Yeah there is a reason they use morphine and not heroin in hospitals anymore. Even they are reluctant to give you morphine, so that should tell you something.
As for opioids only becoming addictive when you’re forced to take them… I mean, it seems a waste of time to indulge that.
