But the big tell is Trump. If he can avoid indictment with no penalty it's the end of our democratic institutions.
As long as their base is convinced that the other side wants to kill them dead for existing and that the Republicans are untouchable they will post-facto justify anything, with no limitations. The fact that their infiltration and destruction of our legal system means that it's increasingly clear they are legally untouchable is a catch 22 bonus for those in charge, and one they are milking for all that it is worth.
Hence why politically motivated economic warfare is so popular. It's a concrete example of the deal Republicans are offering true believers. And also why they have to deny association with anyone whom will actually face consequences for their actions, like the Pelosi attacker-if it's clear that they can't or won't actually protect their followers the lie gets shown.
With a wise and prudent electorate, the consequence of promoting demonstrably false allegations should be the loss of all credibility.
Anyone say's "true" is off the ballot for being incapable of deductive reasoning and properly informing themselves. People like this should be no where near the halls of power.
