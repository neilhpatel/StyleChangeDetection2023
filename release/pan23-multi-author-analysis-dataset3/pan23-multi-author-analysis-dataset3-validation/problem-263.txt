Yeah, and not even legitimate blackmail unless the adult here actually did something illegal with the child. The child stealing a car and getting in a crash on their way to meet someone they lied to... that person isn't responsible for any of it. Unless OP encouraged them to steal a car or drive recklessly, they really can't be held legally responsible for any of it.
Talking to a minor isn't illegal. Either this is a scam that relies on a lack of understanding of the law, or it's a very petulant child who has no understanding of the law.
But there are also adult scammers who pretend to be 15yo kids pretending to be adults in order to scam people.
But usually it's just a scam mill somewhere overseas, catfishing and blackmailing gullible horny young men.
"We caught her chatting with adults online, she tried to kill herself, we need $1800 for the ambulance bill".
I presume the scammers have list of options to select the claimed damages. "She stole a car to come meet you" is a new one to me.
"She was so profoundly scarred by flirting with you on that website that she needs therapy, $1500 please.".
