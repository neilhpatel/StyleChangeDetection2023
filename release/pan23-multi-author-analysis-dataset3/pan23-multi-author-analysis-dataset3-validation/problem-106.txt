I am so sorry for all the loss you've suffered. First, I am not a lawyer, but you or someone on your behalf will need to contact the office of vital records and obtain copies of your parents' death certificates. You'll need those in order to do so many things, like contact their bank, their mortgage company, all of the utilities, and social security. Did either of them have a social media account where there might be info for some relatives? If not, then the best I can recommend is staying with a friend and asking their parent to help you sort through all of this, and you may need to see about a lawyer that will represent a minor.
But you will need a lawyer to sort out your parents’ and grandmother’s estate—all their money and property—that now belong to you, but will be managed by your guardian or other responsible adult until you turn 18. Unfortunately, if your father was responsible for the car crash, the other victim could sue your parents’ estate and claim what they left to you. The life insurance and your grandmother’s estate should not be part of that, but you will almost certainly need a lawyer to protect your interests here.
As others have said I think, there might still be life insurance that you're entitled to, but it may take some sorting to figure that out. Your grandmother may even have some and you may be entitled to it.
If you're an only child, then your parents assets are now yours. That's an over simplification however, but if they have cash in a bank account, and there is no will saying it goes to someone else, then you are the beneficiary. This may take legal proceedings, someone else here will have to help you with that.
There are legal issues though. You will need a legally-appointed guardian. As a minor, there are a lot of basic things you can’t do, like have utility service in your name or fully control a bank account. Social services should be able to help you through that legal process.
You may also want to seek out legal help. There is certainly a legal aide near you, so google that with your location.
