Ukraine needs to capture melitipol to really break down any logistical opportunity Russia may have on Crimea, after the kerch strait bridge was targeted and damaged the peninsula is becoming more difficult for Russia to supply. Taking melitipol would really only leave the kerch strait or naval routes for resupply which seems potentially costly.
The closer Ukraine gets to Crimea though the more worried I'd be for putin to do something crazy, it seems very unlikely he survives to see Russian soldiers retreating from Crimea if an assault on Crimea ever did happen.
Obviously, there's a risk but only if Ukraine go rogue and attack Russian territory with them. They've attacked Crimea multiple times already. Putin has given multiple nuke red lines. Don't supply weapons or nukes, ok then I will annexe the territory I've taken it's now Russia don't attack it or nukes.
So I get the concern with ATACMS but this isn't an easily winnable war for Ukraine and they need much more weapons..
This isn't proof that Ukraine will get that far, but it seems pretty clear that Russia at least considers it possible.
However if there really is a threat of nukes, then Putin can still use them if for example Ukraine are in a position to take back Crimea. That's a very serious loss to Russia, how would Putin respond? We don't know. What we do know is that if the nuke threat is real then we're on a collision course to that prospect already but based on the evidence so far it appears to be a bluff.
