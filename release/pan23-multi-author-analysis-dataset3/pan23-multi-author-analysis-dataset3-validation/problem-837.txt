It's really that simple. Your stepmother can ask for ("charge you") money whenever she wants, but "no" is a complete sentence. She has no entitlement to those payments without your agreement, and I don't see any obvious reason you should agree to this demeaning treatment.
You should understand that setting this boundary may affect your relationship with your stepmother. Mostly, that's not a legal issue, but right you she's giving you a roof over your head. She's charging a lot - $1,000/week is more than rent would be in most of the US, other than the Bay Area or New York - but it's not really rent, as such, and you may have few protections if she responds to your boundary with "pay me or get the hell out.".
It would be legal for you to move out. It would be legal for you to open a bank account. It would be completely legal for you to put your ID somewhere safe that your mother cannot access - if you don't have anywhere else, a bank safety deposit box is an option. It would even be legal for you to contact the social security administration and get replacement SSN paperwork, using your ID.
You can obtain a replacement SSN card by contacting the Social Security Administration at this link:
You are under no obligation to pay “fines” to your stepmother. It is reasonable for your parents to ask you to pay rent and contribute towards food and utilities. However you may decide their idea of a reasonable rent is more than you are willing to pay and find housing elsewhere.
