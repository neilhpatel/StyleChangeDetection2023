Your tenancy continues until the property is vacated and returned to landlord or your roommate signs a new lease not including you.
I think the landlords issue here is that they have a year long lease still in effect, and he only took a verbal agreement with the tenants to end it early, which one tenant then rescinded. So he has nothing signed that lets him end the lease early.
Where did they say anything about ending the lease early by the way? As a matter fact they specifically said the opposite, the landlord extended the lease.
Not sure what you mean by extending the lease? If any terms of the lease are changed, you both would need to sign the “new” extended lease. If you signed the extension, you are responsible for the terms in the lease.
The landlord cannot enlarge or change or modify the terms of the lease without the consent of all parties. If it was a lease for a term, when it is up it is up. If proper notice was given, OP should be in the clear in my opinion. Landlord assumed that risk when they extended the lease without the permission of OP.
