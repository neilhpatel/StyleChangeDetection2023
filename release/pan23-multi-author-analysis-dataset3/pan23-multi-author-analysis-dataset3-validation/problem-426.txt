Fully approved drugs have also been removed from the market. Science is not infallible. But when it comes to a vaccine, there's no scientific support for the assertion that "side effects" are just going to show up in two years.
3) its impossible to see the long term effects (though these is plenty of data of 2 years for the mRNA vaccines). If you are concerned about possible effects get the J&J vaccine and not the mRNA ones. But be aware the likelihood of any serious side effects is minute compared to the likelihood of serious problems if you do get covid and are unvaccinated.
If you do not want to get the vaccine you can find another job. It's perfectly fine for a company to fire you for not getting vaccinated (absent a legitimate medical or religious reason). You should talk with your PCP or a specialist for your condition to see if there is any known link, and if so you may be able to avoid the vaccination requirement. If there are no long term effects of your seizures then it's still likely better to get the booster to prevent death from covid, but this is something to talk about with your doctor.
1) the vaccine is FDA approved. It has emergency use AUTHORIZATION. It's been authorized and approved.
2) animal trials are largely uninformative in vaccine trials and especially in this case. Viruses are highly animal specific. You notice how there aren't massive die offs of animals due to covid? It's because covid is either not infecting or not having the same harmful affects.
