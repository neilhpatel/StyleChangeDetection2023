First, the baseline: it's hard to find tons of economic data on inflation-adjusted GDP per capita. Lebanon should be automatically excluded, because it suffered a civil war during the period specified, and that can help explain why its GDP per capita remained hard to count, and even harder to increase. Syria, for some reason, has no inflation-adjusted numbers, and Jordan's starts only in 1975, per the World Bank. I could use non-inflation-adjusted numbers, but that wouldn't do too much to help. Also, the PPP measure (adjusting for purchasing power) doesn't go back far enough for this.
Nevertheless, there's a clear trend of difference, and the question is why. This table below shows what the GDP per capita of inflation-adjusted measurements was for Egypt, Jordan, and Israel, from 1975 to 1990:
What is the explanation for Israeli GDP already being so much higher in 1975? Is it related to the influx of many educated Jews from the West after 1948?
Also, this is tangential, but I understand that it was in the 1970's that a sometimes-gray market for West Bank Palestinian labour emerged in Israel? I've seen numbers for labourers that look quite substantial (something like 100,000 employees, with about a third being officially recorded); could access to this labour force with its peculiar features have had an appreciable impact on the Israeli economy?
