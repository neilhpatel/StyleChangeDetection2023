Ukraine made up about 20% of the industrial base of the USSR - and it contains massive mineral reserves (some of the richest known reserves of iron and uranium, with large reserves of coal, lithium, titanium and other mineral wealth), not to mention natural gas reserves. It also has massive agricultural output, in addition to its mineral and industrial wealth.
This wasn't Putin just lashing out at a random former Soviet state/Imperial Russian possession - reintegration of Ukraine would've turned Russia into an economic powerhouse that might have too much market power in vital areas to sustain sanctions on (they'd be exporting something like 23% of the world's wheat, for example, and they'd be bumping themselves up several spots in the lists for a number of other staple crop exports) while also stopping planned Ukrainian development in economic zones that Russia's economy is dependent on.
What they should instead do is focus on helping Ukraine and try to force Russia into a diplomacy where Putin and his gang is booted from the government, democratic institutions are introduced and made so it cant be undermined and lastly economic policies that not only will help Russia recover from the sanctions but also ensure that neoliberal disaster capitalism is NEVER initiated again in Russia like the 90's which is what lead us to this mess in the first place.
Furthermore this whole "forcing the whole world to play along" can have terrible consequences since not only are other nations forced to cut economic ties with Russia thus loosing valuable money but it would also cause them to feel resentful against The West, seeing their actions as forcing and strong-arming them into doing what they say or lose economic goods from The West which on top of making their sovereignty feeling violated along with how hypocritical it is for NATO to call Russia a terrorist state of the invasion of Ukraine while refusing to do the same thing for US due to Iraq results in these countries feeling alienated by Western powers and making them see The West as no different from Russia which is NOT what Western leaders want.
The problem is that actions like that will more or less help Putin by giving him the perfect excuse to say how The West and NATO is trying to isolate and ruin Russia by banning them from trading with other nations thanks to The West.
The primary reason for not doing it is because large chunks of NATO are dependent on Russian exports and a designation as a terrorist state triggers some large amount of sanctions/prohibition of trade.
The Secretary General of NATO will give a response to this resolution by the Parliamentary Assembly but there is no guarantee, at all, that NATO will also designate Russia as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.
Before people get carried away - this is not the military alliance NATO but rather a completely different interparliamentary group who only make recommendations to NATO.
I meant "not related" as in that they are not the same organization and are completely separate legal entities.
