Reflect on that a moment and then step back and recall what Chomsky said about how media filtering works.
That it is theoretically possible for wood pellets to be green makes them easy to sell, which increases the pressure on the limited capacity for green production. As prices go up the incentives to cheat increase. Without a global enforcement regime with powers to seize and imprison globally, there is no way to ensure that wood pellets do not defeat themselves.
The carbon neutrality of a legit pellet enterprise is only as good as their accounting for sequestration elsewhere, and they do not necessarily have control over that. One more forest fire than was accounted for at the start of the project and all that carbon that was supposed to cancel out the burning is up in the atmosphere.
The problem is not the danger of deforestation, but rather the emissions from burning wood and releasing it into the atmosphere. At least you don't get the ancient CO2 from coal or oil, but it's still multiple decades of CO2, and burning wood is also pretty dirty with a lot of fine particles and other gases that are troublesome.
Problem with burning is that it released CO2 immediately, and It takes decades to recapture the carbon, so really not carbon neutral for a long time.
This articles analysis limits their themselves to looking at initial CO2 use of biomass, rather than looking at the full lifecycle.
