It only takes one. Someone has to risk it but...if only one principal were to say "we are going to offer this class as an elective in addition to the state required curriculum, we have reviewed our options carefully and we feel we are not breaking any laws by offering this"...if DeSantis were to authorize someone to enter the school and enter the classroom and stop a teacher from teaching black history because the but hurt white governor finds it silly. Someone has to test the waters and see just how far they will take this. I know that DeSantis isn't loosing a single voter over this but I still think someone should see how much tax payer money they are willing to use the flex their muscles....sorry if I offend anyone but when your talking to people in the deep south who don't want civil rights discussed in school because they really fear the day little Timmy comes home and starts noticing that Aunt Karen is really mean to Spanish people and asks questions...but when DeSantis tries to run for president and he is in front of a national audience and he has to defend this stuff that is where he will fail.
Lets pretend there is nothing racist behind this...then this just becomes another element of the right wing war on education, I say right wing because even though I am a liberal I do know conservative people who highly value education, even if we disagree about access and cost we do agree the value of it and this DeSantis/Abbott agenda is on the fringe extreme. The thing is AP electives like black history enter into areas of history with lots of grey area where there may not be a right or wrong answer just a educated or not educated answer and that leads to open minds. What these people really want is a streamlined basic education for all that emphasizes memorization over understanding and accepting what your presented as fact...I will say this, a library science major may have a very hard time finding work in a university or government library or museum but...that person has the exact same education a business major does plus some and will have no problem finding a good job if they can't find their dream job. Someone who goes through 4 years of college is not somehow not unable to learn a trade if they just want an education before becoming a plumber or whatever...the major difference is those people inevitably don't vote on party lines, ask questions, get involved in things and at the end of the day the only reason DeSantis is in office is because the Florida voter base is made up of people who are terrified at the term "liberal" even if they can't define it. By further restricting education, they preserve that base.
Banning education is how you restrict information. A less informed generation becomes a potential new crop of Republicans. They generally question nothing and suspect everything because they are not taught critical thinking. . Republicans know their party is failing and losing younger voters every election. The only thing propping up the Republicans are extreme disinformation ran by their propaganda peddlers and insanely gerrymandered electoral maps. DeSantis wants to tell kids how to think and not think for themselves. Welcome to the new iteration of the UDoC educational system.
Simple. Blacks were born into chattel slavery in the US. All of their cultures, diety worship, heritage, and lineage were erased for hundreds of years. They were enslaved, beaten, murdered, and considered less less than human. They were forced to practice a white man's religion and worship a white God. Even after abolition they were discriminated against and murdered by whites for decades. Laws were constructed through Posse Comitatus to specifically oppress them. They had to fight to exist, to vote, to own land. Their leaders were assassinated during the civil rights era just trying to be equal on paper. They have had to fight the " white" throne every single year of every day they have lived in this country and still do. So ya. I think they might have earned the right before Mexicans, Italians, and Chinese in the United States.
