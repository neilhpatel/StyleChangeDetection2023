IANAL - In Michigan an engagement ring is considered a conditional gift, and some parties have tried to use that ruling to cover who is responsible for the venues and such. Some of this is going to depend on who signed what contract.
If you both signed the venue contract and there is a cancellation amount and she decides to just not pay anything, you will have to cover the whole amount to keep from going into breach of contract with the venue. If you both have already paid an amount and she wishes to be compensated her costs and you don't want to, then to recover those monies she will have to take you to small claims court. Depending on your reason for breaking things off, this could be very low risk for her and high risk for you.
If there is anything in writing where she stated she would pay a certain amount, save it. If you promised that you would pay a certain amount, that will probably come out.
If she paid for it/agreed to pay for it with no agreement that you'd pay her back, she would have a tough time getting anything out of you. Take the dress for instance, did she tell you how much that would cost? Did she expect you to pay for it? If someone was throwing a fancy party and she bought a fancy dress for that particular party, but then the host canceled last minute, could she sue the host? I guess she could try--but it would be difficult.
I think a lot of it would depend on whether she could prove that you knew you were going to cancel a long time ago, but didn't tell her until after she incurred all this expense. I think she'd have a decent case, then.
