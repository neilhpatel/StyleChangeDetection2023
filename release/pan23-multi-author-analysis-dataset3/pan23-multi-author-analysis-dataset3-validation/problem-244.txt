Now that you cancelled the return your best bet is to just leave this alone. If you get a call or visit from the police, do not talk to them at all because you're likely to incriminate yourself. Find a criminal defense attorney and let them do the talking.
The retailer would have no civil damages but the police could still opt to pursue the matter criminally.
It was an honest mistake and i explained that to them but i’m confused on how they can accuse me of fraud when it was an accident.
I am definitely not a scammer or fraudster and I let them know it was an accident! When I told them I cancelled the return they told me they would not be contacting law enforcement and that the situation was settled- would they still have a case even if the return was cancelled and refund was never issued?
I was never actually refunded, but I’m going to keep an eye on my account to make sure It doesn’t go through. When I called them back they said the return is cancelled on their end. However, I was never issued a refund.
