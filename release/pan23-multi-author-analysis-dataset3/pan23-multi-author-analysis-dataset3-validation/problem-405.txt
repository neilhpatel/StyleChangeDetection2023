It's also not trespass since, as the post says, the fire alarm being pulled is in a public parking lot.
Unless it was the landlord pulling the alarms, it's not a violation of your lease, which is what I was talking about. Someone being an asshole in a parking lot is not constructive eviction.
This is in no way the landlord's responsibility or fault, nor is it an interference with the tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises.
The other commenter does have a point that it depends on what your landlord can actually legally do to prevent this from happening.
Perhaps your landlord should secure the building so non residents can't access public tenant spaces. I lived in a building once where i needed a key to get into the building to even get to my apartment. Usps had a key to get to mail boxes, tho fedex and ups didn't (that caused some headaches but i never bothered to talk to my landlord about it) also kept solicitors out. I liked it (except the one time i locked myself out by accident) the reason it was done was due to homeless camping in the hallways under the stairs on the bottom level.
