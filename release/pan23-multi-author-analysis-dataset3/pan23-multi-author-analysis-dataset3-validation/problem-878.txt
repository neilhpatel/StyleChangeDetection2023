Yes I am. I'm also a registered conceal carry holder. I'll keep looking and planning for my escape later in the year. If we are both in agreeance to end the lease prematurely, will I have to pay her anything?
On the plus side, now you probably have an easy out if you want to break your lease early! Otherwise, I think you already know your lease is NOT going to be renewed.
As a landlord, if I do not put a clause in my lease about something I cannot then evict a tenant for said thing. Your landlord verbally told you to do something. She has to legally put it in writing and give you time to comply. Since it's not a violation of your lease she can't evict you but she does not have to renew your lease.
The landlord can terminate your lease before January 3, 2022 only if you are in violation of one or more terms of the lease. If you think it might go somewhere, you could try explaining your position, i.e., it's not against the lease, so you can't kick me out, and see what she says. Otherwise, there's not really anything to do until you are actually served with an eviction complaint. If you are, get an attorney.
