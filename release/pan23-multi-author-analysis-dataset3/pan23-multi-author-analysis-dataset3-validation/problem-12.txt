This is a very twisted interpretation. The camps were set up and organized by the RSHA (Reichssicherheitshauptamt = Reich Security Main Office) which was directed by Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, Gestapo and Minister of Internal Affairs (Head of Police) after '35. The SS ran the camps, and as such the SS was not part of the army. So, German regular soldiers (of those drafted into the regular army, the Wehrmacht), did generally not serve in the camps for this pure logistical reason -- it was not the army's prerogative.
So, of the SS serving in the camps (the so-called Totenkopf-SS, the "Skulls"-SS), the majority was German, but there were often local units and auxiliary police involved. Of the non-Germans serving in the camp, some countries were statistically "overrepresented" (e.g. Austria -- ca 20% of the Auschwitz SS guards were from Austria, which is less than 1/10th the size of Germany by population). So the picture is a little more complicated than that. The overall death apparatus of the Holocaust (camps, guards, execution squads, train logistics etc) roughly required about a million people actively participating, out of which approximately half was German.
Although an unreliable and undisciplined force — desertions and insubordination became increasingly common through 1943, resulting in the reassignment of Trawniki units away from several of the extermination camps to other sites — the Trawnikis nonetheless played a crucial role in the deadliest phase of the Nazi genocide. Peter Black, the author of , writes:
SS chief Heinrich Himmler learned relatively quickly that mass executions had a serious impact on the morale and psychological stability of the men carrying them out (observed in even the SS' own Einsatzgruppen, let alone the somewhat less ideologically-indoctrinated regular army.) The industrialisation of the Holocaust, and the adoption of first gas vans and then static gas chambers, was in large part an effort to increase the efficiency of the slaughter, but it was also intended to reduce the psychological stress on its culprits.
