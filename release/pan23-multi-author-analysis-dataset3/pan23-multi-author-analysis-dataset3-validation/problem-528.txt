What should I do in the meantime to protect myself and my siblings? I’ve been trying to get my mom to do something, but she doesn’t really know what to do or how to do it, and doesn’t really care.
My mom isn’t as worried as I am. I’m really pretty alone in this and I have no idea how to access my bank account unfortunately. I’m gonna try to find my birth certificate and social security, but about the bank account I don’t know what to do.
If you have access to your birth certificate, or have any ID like a driver's license or social security card, please keep it somewhere he can't get to it. If you have any bank account that his name is also on, close it out and open your own the day you turn 18.
If you’re concerned about your bank account, close it. If your mother has an account, even with the same bank and joint account with your father, she can open an account with you. Your father will not have access. If she’s worried about using the same bank, go to another one. Credit unions have rules on who can open accounts, but others do not. This will bring you into the loop, your father won’t have access, and you can probably remove your mom once your 18 if she signs off. However, if you’re worried about your money in regards to both of them, figure out how to get your money out of the account, and if you have a job, cash your check at a cash checking place (you’ll pay a little for this). Good luck, I’m sorry you’re going through this at your age.
