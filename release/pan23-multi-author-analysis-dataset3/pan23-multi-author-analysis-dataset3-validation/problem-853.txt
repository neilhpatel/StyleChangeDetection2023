So the plates need to stay on the car even when the new driver takes it? I can’t take them off? I will make sure to let the DMV know of the sale right away. I still have it insured, but that’s because I need to pick it up from the dealer when I get a chance. I didn’t have a second person with me when I went in cause I thought I’d get at least something for a trade in. I didn’t know if after it was home I could take it off or not. I’ll list it as cash only and I have a police station right by my house, so I’ll probably meet there. Thank you for all the advice! I’ll try the cars subreddit too for advice on getting the best value.
I suggest /r/cars for practical advice on getting money for your car and dealing with the tire kickers and fraudsters who tend to try and buy cheap ones. There's probably a lot of internet articles about it too.
List only truthful things in the ad. You don't have to mention the bad stuff (although it's nice if you do) but you probably shouldn't say "AC works great".
Write down the VIN, title number and license plate number while you still have the car. Then when you sell it, be sure to follow the directions on the oregon.gov / ODOT page about selling your car. Especially make sure to notify the DMV of the sale with their DMV2U tool so you have a record of the sale - that way if buyer doesn't register and gets ticketed, you can still show it's no longer your car.
Follow the DMV's instructions for reporting the sale to them promptly, so you won't be liable for tickets or towing or collisions.
