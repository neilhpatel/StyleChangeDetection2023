It's not ways so heavy handed. Usually Modi has his industrialist cronies buy out the media organization. For example, NDTV, the last Indian media that still spoke truth to power, was recently acquired by Adani via a shell company. But since they can't buy BBC, they have to resort to these sorts of tactics. I wouldn't be surprised if the BBC refuses to bend and suddenly the tax problems escalate to the BBC losing its Indian license.
I wish I was surprised, the BBC gets so much hate from Indians because they’re convinced it’s propaganda by the British government. It’s nuts, there is nothing to gain by the BBC being dishonest about India lmao.
I doubt portraying India as a backwards nation aids any attempt to exonerate themselves, they clearly don’t care for nationalism and it’s the reason they were banned in China so swiftly (and subsequently Russia following Ukraine invasion). They get a lot of slack but I think the BBC does a very good job at remaining impartial and sets a good standard for other media outlets, irregardless of what conspiracy theorists love to say….
Which is strange because the BBC are often slightly late to report stories (compared to other news media outlets) until they can verify some of the facts.
4) Just really weird and obviously biased 'news' this is an article which genuinely reports based on hearsay? :S.
3) Widely considered to be complicit in the coverup of high profile people who'm are implicated in podophilic scandals, such as Royals, Savile and the gang.
