Latest figures I've seen are between 90 and 100,000 dead with an equal number permanently disabled due to injury.
Actually Elite means being loyal enough to Vladimir Putin to be considered worth the expense of receiving full basic military gear.
Those disabled former soldiers are going to be a burden on the Russian government for decades to come.
This whole catastrophic debacle is going to be a burden on all of Russia for decades. So many long term consequences it is hard to grasp it all.
Not to mention the devastating effect on Ukraine. My mother does a lot of work with Ukrainian refugees here in Denmark, helping them get access to basic food, clothing etc when they arrive. The stories, photos and videos they have of the horrors going on go way, way beyond anything you would see in a news report. It's really hard on you psychologically to work with and help these people - which says a lot about the victims themselves. These depictions often contain the lost family and friends and knowing all that makes it even harder to watch.
