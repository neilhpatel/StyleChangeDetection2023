Drug overdoses with terminally ill seniors as euthanasia should be taken into account. I personally know of an old couple in their 80's who took their own lives together this way because they were both terminal but didn't want to spend their days in agony dying slowly.
When all you have to look forward to is more years of pain and the society you live in refuses to even discuss euthanasia, many people take matters into their own hands and this is where you end up.
If a country or society refuses to have an adult discussion about euthanasia, adults will make their own arrangements when the time has come.
This is not confined to the USA. Any country that does not offer ethical life termination is seeing a marked increase in overdose deaths.
While some drug deaths among seniors are from accidental misuse of drugs, many are suicides from overdosing on opioids, Kuerbis said.
A couple of psychiatrists here in eastern Pennsylvania are in trouble for overprescribing opioids, some of which have led to deaths. Including a psychiatrist I used to see.
