You may adopt without regard to your age, religion, gender, or if you have any other children at home. Same-sex couples may also adopt a child.".
Yes, that's what I was told as well. I don't know if we have to be married for that or not but whatever is necessary for my son to be safe from him. He wants us both gone clearly do I don't want him anywhere near us.
He didn't agree to the adoption in the previous post. Apparently that eliminates his legal tie no matter what. That's what I want to know. I don't want him legally tied to my son.
Because yeah, can't complete an adoption without the court. There's no way around that. Could try convincing him that the court will be involved regardless, either to determine custody + child support, or for the adoption.
You should consult with an attorney but it is quite likely that his parental rights will not be severed without his agreement.
You still need to file a petition to a judge and proceed in a family court. I highly suggest you seek a Colorado family lawyer so that you can get clarification.
