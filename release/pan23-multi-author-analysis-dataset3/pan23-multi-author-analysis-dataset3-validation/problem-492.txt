A big part of that has to do with fiction. The Gothic genre was invented in the late eighteenth century, originally as a return to medieval standards and medieval or early modern (and typically Continental) settings, and soon combined with the burgeoning Romantic movement to encompass the kind of wildness, horror, and excitement that was typically not a part of everyday life. The Mysteries of Udolpho (Ann Radcliffe, 1794), for instance, is about a poor noblewoman in late-sixteenth-century France who is orphaned, menaced by her Italian uncle, imprisoned in a castle, and escapes to marry her true love - there are bandits, long-lost heiresses, and ghosts. Radcliffe's earlier but less famous novel The Romance of the Forest (1791) is another Gothic novel, about a French family that goes into hiding in a ruined abbey to escape their creditors, encountering a skeleton in a chest, a girl thrown out of her home and blocked from her inheritance, a frightening account written by a seventeenth-century prisoner, attempted rape and murder, rescues, trials, and suicides. As people continued to write in the genre through the nineteenth century while largely using contemporary settings - frequently as lowbrow but widely consumed "penny dreadfuls", but aspects of it turn up in popular-and-now-classic novels like those by Dickens - we tend to associate highly dramatic fiction featuring improbable coincidences, supernatural events, and dark atmosphere with the period.
It's hard to say. It certainly makes sense that the American imagination would need to focus on something as the archetypal form of spooky architecture.
ADDENDUM: Also, do you have any idea what the architectural style of Disneyland's Haunted House would be? It seems to have far more Neo-Classical elements than the Addams mansion, for example, and for me it evokes the Antebellum South (which I think was intentional, since it is located in New Orleans Square).
Interesting! Do you think that's because Victorian houses feel too recent to inspire awe and terror in England (and the rest of the UK), where many structures from centuries ago (and even some from millennia ago, like Roman ruins and pre-Roman megaliths) still stand? Then again, I wonder how much age alone really contributes to the spooky factor, since medieval architecture is generally considered spookier than the Roman ruins that survive, just as Victorian architecture in North America is usually considered spookier than Georgian architecture.
