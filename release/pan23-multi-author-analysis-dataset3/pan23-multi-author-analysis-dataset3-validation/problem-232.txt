"No, you can't have these back, they're mine. No, you still can't have these back. I gave them all back already.
I swear I gave them all back. What do you mean I moved the documents to a different part of the property? I don't have any more documents.
"Shit, we shouldn't have these, here you go NARA. Also, if you need to investigate, investigate wherever you want, for as long as you need to, to find out how this happened, as this shouldn't be happening.".
Why aren't you investigating George H W Bush, who has been dead for several years, and his bowling alley Chinese restaurant!?
Uh it was though? They were found on Nov 2, handed over to NARA on Nov 3 by the letter of the law (who is the appropriate body to handle them, not the DoJ), NARA informed the DoJ on Nov 4 as they're supposed to. They didn't choose to tell the press until later, but there's literally no evidence Biden's lawyer went through them, and they informed the appropriate body as soon as they possibly could. Nothing ridiculous about it.
Confidential information (which is so far the only reported level Biden had) can be as mundane as a foreign travel schedule for high level officials. The kind of thing that might get accidentally put in a pile of papers and then in a closet.
