Your parents have a responsibility to provide your sister with a safe environment free from domestic violence. In addition to cooperating with the police, your parents should be taking steps to remove your brother from the household. They can do this by following your state's guidelines on terminating his tenancy and petitioning for a restraining order that includes your sister. If your sister's statement doesn't trigger a DCFS referral, you should be prepared to contact the agency yourself and encourage your sister to do so as well. You can reach out to them or by telephone. If your sister is not comfortable speaking with DCFS directly, she should confide in an adult who's a mandated reporter such as a teacher, doctor or guidance counselor.
Tell your sister to tell teachers, doctors, dentists, or anyone that is a mandated reporter what's happening. DCFS will document this. The more reports, the better. Tell her to tell them that she is afraid to go home and is afraid for her life. This will possibly trigger DCFS to come out to the site immediately.
OP, you need to call DCFS yourself and explain everything that happened. Explain that your parents are prioritizing your brother over your little sister's safety, and that the police should have made an arrest but did not. It seems like at no point the police were made aware that he assaulted a minor or it should have definitely ended in arrest. Stress that it is urgent she be somewhere safe. If you or your sisters are in Illinois and can take her in temporarily, that's a huge help. DCFS will be a lot happier to place her with a relative.
IANAL but I'm speaking from my experience as a mandated reporter in social work who has had to make a hell of a lot of protective services reports and push CPS action more than once. Here's the info for Illinois DCFS:
Good luck, OP. I hope your little sister stays safe and your parents wake up and realize they're failing her with their actions.
