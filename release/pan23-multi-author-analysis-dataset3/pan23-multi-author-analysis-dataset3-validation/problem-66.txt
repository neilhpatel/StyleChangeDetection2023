This is a vast and difficult topic, and one on which I have commented before, but also one where I don't feel I have quite the grasp of early Greek philosophy - especially the parts that survive only in fragments - necessary to really adress. Nevertheless I can offer some perspective.
Perhaps on the one hand we should take the view that Zoroaster may have been a Hesiod of sorts - he wasn't exactly doing philosophy but presumably fulfilling some sort of social role as a cleric, which seems to have eventually influenced philosophers (certainly, we could reasonably speculate that Plato's Form of the Good and the like were influenced by Indo-Iranian tendencies to deify abstractions of morally good things). But perhaps we should also take a broader view of what classical philosophers were actually doing - they weren't just dealing with syllogisms and worldly ethical questions, but also contending with religious and mythological ideas, wrestling with the place of religious ritual in society (as in _Euthyphro_ for example), and really doing all sorts of things in their philosophizing.
According to Eric Gerlach of Berkeley City College, In the Renaissance, the two greatest philosophers, Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, both Neo-Platonists, believed that there was one true philosophy which was passed from the Egyptian priests and Persian magi to Greek philosophers and Indian sages, and that this wisdom was incarnated on earth as Jesus.
Our modern view of "Western philosophy" comes filtered through first the scholastics, and later Renaissance/Enlightenment philosophers who extracted certain parts they considered philosophically valuable from ancient philosophers. Thomas Aquinas' take on the Euthyphro dilemma, for instance, is rather different from that of Plato. Instead of trying to construct an ordering, then, where our singular tradition of Western philosophy comes down from Zoroaster, I think it is better to re-evaluate ancient philosophy as a rich, multifaceted and multilateral tradition that took inspiration from many sides, not just ones we would consider traditionally "philosophical" enough.
The big caveat I will make is that rather than simply "reordering" the canonical view of "Western philosophy" and placing Zoroaster, rather than say Anaximandros, at the head of it, we should really look at this as a starting point for the _deconstruction_ of the notion of the Western Philosophical canon as having deep continuous roots stretching from Archaic Greek to Enlightenment times and beyond. The example I always like to bring up is Hesiod. Few would consider him a philosopher, yet his _Theogony_ had sufficient authority with philosophers that Plato, for example, felt the need to contend with it.
