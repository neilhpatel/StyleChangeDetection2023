This has somewhat bucked the trend though no? I remember a comment someone replied to a month ago "no president's administration has ever done well in a midterm with high inflation and economic issues".
Like it was an inevitability that the republicans would smash the Democrats. The fact that there's a chance for the democrats to hold on seems to have taken everyone by surprise.
It's hard to believe Democrat cries of voter disenfranchisement when they won't even field a candidate.
I think Warnock wins a runoff against Herschel and im from Arizona, i think we're getting closer to calling it a win for Kelly.
With that said, DNC basically needs to find some safer seats, AZ is a 1/3 state: 1/3 each of D,I,R, and eventually Warnock isn't going to keep winning runoffs.
Yep. The fact this is Warnock's second runoff in two elections isn't a good sign that they'll hold it. At least this time he gets to keep the seat for a while but Georgia Democrats are going to have to fight yo hold those seats.
Eventually the left, via the Democrats, need some more gains in the Senate to keep nominations like Supreme Ct. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson coming.
