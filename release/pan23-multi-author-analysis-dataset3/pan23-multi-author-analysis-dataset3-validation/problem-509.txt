Um yeah obviously I know how the US and the military industrial complex makes money. I was just thinking that perhaps you can point to a source that says the primary goal in Ukraine is to make money for the MIC. Turns out it's just your opinion and not factual. My opinion is that the primary goal is to defeat Russia and defend Ukraine. Secondary is to make money.
Where are you getting this information from? Sounds like Russian propaganda tbh, considering that the US actively tried to talk Putin out of invading and avoiding the entire war.
Most of the prowar protests that I've seen in Moscow were actually directed towards the US and NATO.
Yea there are people that support the war, and there are also plenty who oppose it. But outwardly opposing it has significant consequences so you won't even know about it unless you are talking to individuals in private.
I've never claimed there is an absence of support for the conflict by people in Russia but to pretend that the people wake up every day chanting death to Ukraine is absurd.
First and foremost, this is an excuse to grind the russian military down to dust for free by using the corpses of the Ukranians to do so.
