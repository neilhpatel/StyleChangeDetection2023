Republicans will not (and cannot) hold Santos accountable for his blatant lies. To do so would mean they're holding him to some objective truth and Republicans have done everything in their power over the last decade to actively destroy faith in such a thing.
The core Republican leadership could have (and I imagine wish they did) jettison those whining assholes so many times over the years. Hell, several of them are implicated in the January 6th insurrection attempt so it's not like Republican leadership would have to look far for a valid reason when, in reality, it's because they have no real policy doctrine except grifting wherever/whenever possible and do not have the best interest of the GOP at heart. But here we are, years later, watching McCarthy do the song and dance to keep them happy. It's both hilarious and depressing in how pathetic they all are.
They elected him under false pretenses. And while I absolutely think the Republican base in the district are fucking morons, that does not mean his blatant lies can, or should, be ignored.
Nope, they want the outrage so high that the Democrats do their work for them, while they make it an up hill battle, then act like victims for it.
