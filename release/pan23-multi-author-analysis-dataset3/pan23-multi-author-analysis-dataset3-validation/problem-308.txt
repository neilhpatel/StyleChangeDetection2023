I don't see how any of those questions are incriminating. But that's probably not the most important thing here.
Your actual question probably can't be answered without knowing more about the process. If this really is an extension of the interview process, then it's possible that questions asking about your religious faith indicate discriminatory hiring practices (as distinguished from the question itself being unlawful).
If you believe that you have suffered an adverse employment action specifically because of information about your religion that was collected by the persons making hiring decisions, you might have an employment discrimination case.
Point well taken; I am ashamed of myself for saying "illegal" rather than "really really really obvious grounds for a straightforward EEOC or other employment authority complaint".
The only one of the questions you describe that would be illegal in a job interview is about religious belief.
It’s not illegal to ask about religious belief in an interview. It’s generally illegal to base a hiring decision on a candidate’s religious beliefs, so most companies (rightly) view it as unwise to ask. But it’s not illegal.
