Neither of those makes the situation in Bangladesh any different but it helps add perspective to things.
Life in São Paulo is pretty amazing if you are on the top 1%, expectedly miserable elsewhere. Most people in the countryside have a more reasonable situation but it's pretty contaminated by lack of education and access to technology and techniques. Eventually some smart people climb out and it's quite interesting the fields they do that from, I've met an agricultural machinery mechanic that makes about 200k USD/year. Not even college educated, just very good at his job and using it on a high demand location. Qatar, in comparison, don't have that luxury; lack of freedom to climb out means the people with lions as pets are gonna stay that way regardless of what they contribute with. FIFA being complacent is just as bad in my view. They built this world cup with blood and are trying to pretend it's all happy days...
I'm not questioning not diminishing your point, I stated that as a form of measurement scale. For context, the average salary here is 509usd.
It’s about 50% of the average wage, which seems fair for what constitutes a minimum wage job. It’s just enough to live on if you are a single adult. Doesn’t seem too bad all things considered. Comparative to cost of living it’s about $23/hour for an American.
