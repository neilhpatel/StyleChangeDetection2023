He had insurance & I initially made a claim with them but opted to cancel it since they were giving lackluster assistance & absolute minimal coverage for my repairs to my vehicle(whereas my insurance is totaling the vehicle).
Thank you for the information. I did not realize I could make a claim with both insurance companies! My insurance has covered the deductible, as well as their ‘max’ amount of days with a rental, so I will absolutely be paying out of pocket for that, I was just not sure how long I could get away with claiming when I contact the SA.
You can get your insurance deductible, the additional rental car days and depending [I know this is true in Will] on what the insurance paid the balance of the value of your car.
Neither insurance company will pay for any more rental than needed and as I mentioned what gets paid for rental wise is you'll get the number of days that company deemed needed to buy a car.
His insurance company if they'll touch (I wouldn't) the rental will owe the day yours no longer owes until the day their procedures tells them too. If your insurance company pays 3 days, and they say 5 - you may get 2.
Would this be in addition to the 3 days my insurance has granted/paid for? I just turned that car in today & moving forward I see the rental is much more costly once I’m fully responsible for it.
To be clear, I will follow through with my insurance totaling the car out, and then come after his with the rental/other charges my insurance will not cover. I do not know there is anything other than the rental I am missing with this claim, but of course maybe I am not being very thorough with everything. I will be looping my insurance people in. Should I have them do the talking for me? I like the idea of getting both parties on a meeting. I will talk to mine to see if I can coordinate such a thing. I am certainly not trying to screw myself over here.
