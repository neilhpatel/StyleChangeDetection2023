Hopefully they'll help you get this kid into therapy stat, which... I understand maybe you couldn't afford it, but this is long past due.
You need to decide if you're willing to keep him because CPS would probably be willing to give you custody. If you're sure you do NOT want that, tell them that too. You're worried about your own child, etc.
They aren't always the evil they're made out to be. They'll give you resources to use. They may give you info on if you should be getting child support.
You need support, at least with cps involved there are resources to help you. Contact his school counselor and explain the situation. Sounds like he needs a therapist, family therapy also sounds helpful for everyone involved.
We’ve tried the counseling stuff, and had an appointment last week. He has told us that he needs some sort of help. But when we were done with the appointment he told us “just because I asked for help doesn’t mean I’ll actually take it” that’s when we knew we were done and wasting our time trying to help him anymore..
