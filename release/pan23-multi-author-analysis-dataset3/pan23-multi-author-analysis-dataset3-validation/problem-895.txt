I echo the need to get her into hospice. They will provide morphine which makes things painless and hurries the process along (the dosage can be increased as the time nears). This is done all the time in hospitals, and it's common knowledge. Given the present situation with Covid, the medical examiners, ambulance crews and everyone else who might be involved to question things are overwhelmed. You would likely not have any legal issues but hospice (if available, it can be done from her home) will make things official.
You may also want to consider calling Hospice Care. (Your doctor or hospital can give you a local number.) They are a wonderful support for the whole family and are familiar with the emotional and physical needs of both patient and family.
I agree about calling Final Exit. Their services are free and you can call and talk to them on the phone.
It may be helpful to make a video of her talking about her wishes and why she wants to take this route. You would want to make sure she appears alert and understands clearly what sheâ€™s talking about.
