The most dangerous, likely outcome is sectarian violence similar to the Troubles in Ireland. A full blown Civil War just isn’t plausible. The military is not likely to fracture, and with how big the military is, if a civil war started, it’d be over the moment the military stepped in.
Right, and those factions all fell into one side or the other once the war started, which is the opposite of what you are saying. A modern civil war in America would not look like Syria, it would look like 1860.
Contrary to popular opinion, we're not close to a civil war. This is because we can avoid that war by making our government functional again.
Agreed. But the Constitution doesn't guarantee majority rule. A permanent minority rule - via gerrymandering, independent state legislature or similar bullshit - is completely consistent with the Constitution, especially if the partisan hacks SCOTUS rules it is.
It really depends on how you define "civil war". What would you call it if a candidate, upon losing a Presidential election, claimed that they actually won and were supported in that claim by more people in positions of power than supported Trump's try at this?
You conclude that the sides will end up being the politicians against their constituents. But for the foreseeable future, if one party grabs and solidifies minority rule, you'll have a sizeable minority of the public supporting them. And the country is incredibly overstocked with guns.
