China's looking to build an alternate oil market based on the Chinese Yuan. A large part of the stability of the US dollars is OPEC deciding to trade oil in US Dollars, so China setting up the reinforcement to its currency is a method of reinforcing their currency and just competing with American commercial dominance. So China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela could all potentially sell into this alternate market, which in turn helps secure a reliable source of oil and other Fossil fuels imports.
With the rhetoric coming out of Europe and America anyhow as they attempt to transition to alternative energy, it makes more sense for opec related players to pivot to the developing world which will still need oil. As far as the yuan, Beijing wants to internationalize it and also protect its self from certain types of sanctions, however this isn’t out of the norm of any nation with a brain. Europe and japan have done this too.
To kill the dollar you need to give people a reason to believe that the dollar is not only worthless, but your currency is less worthless and your open to transparency and not tampering with it. It’s harder then it sounds and currencies taking over an oil market that’s already projected to shrink and much smaller then the financial markets for example won’t do anything.
An alternative oil market wouldn’t do anything to the stability of the dollar. There’s trillions of usd in transactions taking place everyday globally that make the oil market look insignificant.
