First some background on the political environment at the end of the Eighteenth Century: The actual Illuminati was a group derived from a power struggle among Freemasons in Bavaria in the 1770s. The members of the Illuminati desired to move their Masonic brethren toward the Radical Enlightenment, which promoted democracy, egalitarianism, and spinozist materialism. The Radical Enlightenment was largely unsuccessful in Germany, but radicals did find success in France. The increasingly extreme French revolutionary ideology under the Jacobins made the term “Jacobin” a pejorative throughout Europe and America. Radicals existed elsewhere including the infant United States and Great Britain. Anyone supporting democratic ideas were labeled as Jacobins, and assumed to really want anarchy and atheism.

I do not know much about the growth of the Illuminati conspiracy theories through the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century, but Eighteenth-Century British propaganda was extremely effective and lasted in our collective cultural memory.
Anti-Masonry - Conspiracy theories about masonic groups or cabals, sometimes descended from or controlled by the Illuminati, were rife in anti-masonic political rhetoric and literature throughout the 19th century in the United States (and in other countries at other times, according to the political climate). This especially found expression in incidents like the Taxil Hoax in the 1890s.
Usage of the Illuminati name and image by groups, both public and private - This was especially the case for certain occult groups descended or influenced by freemasonry. The Ordo Templi Orientis, for example, names the VIII° "Perfect Pontiff of the Illuminati"; the Theosophical Society used the term "Illuminati" not in the strict sense of referring to the Bavarian lodge, but as an adept or one who had been enlightened, etc. These groups were borrowing on the reputation of the Bavarian Illuminati, the same connections the Anti-Masons would cry against them for.
Mostly these were ideas and concepts more than specific references to the Bavarian Illuminati, which had become something of a footnote in the not-so-secret histories claimed and published by occult groups and conspiracy theorists. The most popular image of the Illuminati as the all-controlling head of a group of secret organizations that control the world is Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea's classic The Illuminatus! Trilogy (1975), which inspired a comic book adaptation, various games, and roleplaying game products like GURPS Illuminati (1992); and Umberto Eco's novel Foucault's Pendulum (1988).
