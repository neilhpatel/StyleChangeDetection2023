It is, and we use it. Spain's "native" population is decreasing really fast, and it's only the supply of new immigrants what keeps the population stable at 47 million.
Many high-skilled jobs simply either don't exist here, or pay low-skilled wages (which are extremely low for a Western European country). The result is that people in certain fields (physics, chemistry, compsci, biology, etc) can't find a job in these areas, and instead look for jobs elsewhere in Western Europe.
The only reason (imo) this youth exodus isn't higher is because Spain has certain positive traits that are hard to give up, at least for someone who has been raised here.
Spain also has a lack of jobs especially entry level jobs but it's easier to say the teenagers have no employable skills than actually looking at the real problem.
