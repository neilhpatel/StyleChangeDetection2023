Democrats could have won the House if courts had actually enforced gerrymandering laws, but this was Mitch McConnell's plan with all of the judicial appointments he rushed through while the republicans controlled the Senate.
If the Florida Supreme Court hadn't allowed Desantis to draw his map that was deemed illegal by 2 lower courts, the dems have a shot at retaining control.
Democrats could have won the house if Trump's supreme court didn't force us to use district maps that had been found to be illegal gerrymanders.
Author needs to quit their bullshit. Democrats did just about as well as they possibly could have given the structural disadvantages.
Except the dropoff in votes from 2018-22 pretty clearly shows how the Democratic party did worse this time around with the same basic structural disadvantages they had before.
Besides that, this whole notion that we ought to be grading the party on a curve because of the challenges they face is just idiotic. The Supreme Court and Republican Party is totally happy with the way things are going, whining about how unfair they're being isn't going to do shit. The only way things get better is if Democratic lawmakers quit doing stupid shit because they get called out on the stupid shit they're doing to screw us or they get primaried out in favor of people who don't do so much stupid shit.
