Plenty of blame to go around, and maybe Pete could avoid some of the negative attention if he were to do literally anything in relation to this disaster. Hold a press conference illustrating what we know and what is still being investigated. Do a press tour about what could be improved on with our rail systems. Present a plan to Congress that would make these disasters less likely in the future. This would be like if after 9/11 government leaders just went MIA for 3 weeks. His complete lack of addressing this before, during, or after the disaster is beyond incompetent and absolutely worthy of scorn.
With Biden's choice to tank union negotiations just 3 months ago clearly contributing to this disaster, your comment reminds me of Republicans' comments after school shootings, when they say, 'Now is not the time for politics.' Biden massively fucked up by fucking over unions, this is the fucking proof. Can we not hold anyone accountable anymore?!
So. Politics. Trying to spin the blame to the feds bc democrat president when the problem is due to a private company in a Republican controlled state. Gotcha.
Buttigieg. His apparent lack of initial concern over the disaster did not help the administration's cause, and the decision to break up the rail strike last year didn't help either.
