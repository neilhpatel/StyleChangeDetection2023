Just for future reference, there's a significant difference between authoritative and authoritarian. I take your meaning though. Do you think the corpses in the rubble piles created by American-made munitions would see the irony in all this? I rather imagine they would.
Of course. Problem is that the US, Israel and every other concerned party is dedicated to knowing before Tel Aviv, Riyadh or New York get incinerated.
Against a military that actually knows what its doing in a conventional war, Iran has no chance and they know it, hence the nuclear program.
If it ever looks like Iran getting a nuclear weapon is imminent, or if they do get one, Israel is without a shadow of doubt going to war to remove that capability from Iran. There is simply no possible path to Iran getting and maintaining nuclear capabilities without winning a massive war.
Iran has had the capability of building nuclear weapons for several years now. As part of the nuclear deal, they were obliged to send their enriched nuclear material overseas as assurances to other countries that it would not be used in the production of weapons.
Make no mistake; as they have done for the last 5 years Iran would like nothing more than to send their nuclear material overseas in exchange for sanctions relief. But as long as the United States refuses to remove sanctions, the only bargaining chip Iran has is to stockpile their enriched uranium.
When Trump left the deal, Iran continued to abide by that agreement for a couple of years, hoping to entice the United States back to the deal. Now that the Biden Administration has taken the same tone as Trump (despite promising to re-enter the deal) Iran has stopped sending the material to other countries. This means of course that they will be stockpiling it.
