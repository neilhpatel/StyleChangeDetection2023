We have a chair here who talks a big talk about investing in rural areas, but what she really means is we should wait for the DNC to start caring about rural, deep red states and when that happens and the money arrives, then we start investing in rural areas/counties…until then we kind of just do the basics. We’ve been hearing this pitch for years.

I’m curious because I’m sort of dealing with a useless Democratic state party myself and would love to hear about what’s going on with other state Dem parties.
Watch now how the party that champions “state rights” is gonna try to push a whole bunch of federal bullshit because more and more state governments are turning blue.
