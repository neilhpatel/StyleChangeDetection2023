The reason why they have been handed money is that their positions are key to ensure power in Russia. It's not possible to hold power over everyone alone without help and in a dictatorship, these key positions of power want a piece of the pie. This is why I think that these deaths are an indication that Putin is losing control because there are insufficient funds to maintain key positions of power in the same way as before.
Putin is the front at this point, he is still "in control" but someone else works in the background actually controlling the power. Those killings are done without Putin being involved really. At some point when the opposition is strong enough Putin is gonna get killed at the first dickhead that comes up to take control is the guy controlling the power.
It could be that, it could be Putin doing some purging, it could also be infighting between oligarcys, it could also be someone else trying to isolate Putin.
It occurred to me that at this moment in Russian history, CIA can assassinate anyone from Putin’s clique and rest of the clique will think that it was done by Putin’s order. And Putin himself will think that he did order the hit… but forgot about it.
