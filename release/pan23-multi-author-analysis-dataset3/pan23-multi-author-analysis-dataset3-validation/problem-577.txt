u/BroskiOats This is good advice. In order to the a quick inventory of everything you own, consider making a quick video (walking from room to room, slowly scanning over everything). That way you have photographic evidence of all your items if you need it. For the most expensive items, record the serial numbers. If possible, remove anything irreplaceable and store it outside the apartment (with friends or family) until you are confident the issue with the landlord has been resolved.
Before a landlord can remove you from a property there is proper procedure they must follow, even if you are behind on rent or for any reason.
There are a ton of other rules that a landlord must follow, but you'll need to look up and find out whether or not you live in a rent control city.
OP, if you have been in the place for under a year, they have to give a 30 day notice to leave without taking you to court. If it's been over a year, it has to be a 60 day notice. make sure you're current on rent and all that fun stuff. Given the fact that you're still there, it sounds like they have you a 60 day notice, and after those 60 days they can legally evict. Make sure you're current on rent, reach out to the landlord over text, and start to negotiate that extra 2 weeks or you will likely get an eviction. That notice to vacate must also specify a date as to when those 60 days come to an end, btw. Also, if you're in a lease then they should be coming to negotiate with you to break days lease.
Conversely, take a ton of pictures and videos of the place, because they're going to try and take your security deposit and keep it for themselves.
