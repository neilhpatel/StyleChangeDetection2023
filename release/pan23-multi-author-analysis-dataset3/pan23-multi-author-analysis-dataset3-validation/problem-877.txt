Every Ukrainian soldier killed is murder, without hyperbole, and every Russian soldier is a legitimate kill (if they haven't surrendered).
In most conflicts like this one, one side is going to be illegitimate in every one of their targets.
Well in a way nothing is a legitimate target because its an illegitimate war in the first place but in a world were each side had a good reason to battle, yea, its a no shit sherlock comment.
It's probably a comment about how they will target it and stuff around it will "pay the price" of being around a legitimate military target. School, hospital, residential building? Welcome to war where weapons near miss happens no matter how great the sales pitch from the corporation building it was.
Military equipment being used in a war is always a legitimate target. It’s a damn weird war when you aren’t allowed to shoot at the enemy’s weapons.
It’s not like all the other guns and systems we’ve sent over have a ‘Not allowed to shoot’ sign on them.
I honestly can’t figure out who the announcement was for. Do they think the Americans expect the Russians to just not try to blow up the stuff we gave Ukraine?
