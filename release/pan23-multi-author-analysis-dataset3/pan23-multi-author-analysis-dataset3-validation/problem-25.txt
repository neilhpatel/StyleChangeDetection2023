i think one thing that needs to be considered is, if the ex bf was not listed as a tenant proper, he could be considered a tenant at will, and, for instance, here in TX where u live, a tenant at will is not entitled to the same period of time for reasonable notice of one rent cycle that a regular tenant is entitled to. here, a tenant at will only requires a minimum of three days formal notice.
The homeowner or lessee will need to give the ex bf proper written notice as required to end their tenancy. In Michigan this is usually 30 days. If he will not leave willingly at that point the owner or lessee will need to pursue eviction through the courts.
As others have said, the estate needs to be probated and the executor of the estate needs to evict the boyfriend according to the laws of your state.
An important part of your question is whether your children have to continue to live with the boyfriend. The answer is they don't, because you're the one responsible for them.
You're responsible for the children as their surviving parent, not friends, and certainly not the boyfriend.
