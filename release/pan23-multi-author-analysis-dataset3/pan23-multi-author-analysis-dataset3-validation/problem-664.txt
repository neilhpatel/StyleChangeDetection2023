We've had one since the cold war, when we were first hearing about the possibility of spy balloons taking pics and sending them remotely. From what I remember, it's a missile designed to fly past the balloon, shoot a bola type ballast to its payload, that weighs it down without it crashing too hard so the payload could be examined in less than a thousand pieces.
Definitely could be true. With the advancements in photography, you could probably streak past the balloon in a jet and get enough footage to know what's what without needing to ground it.
The drones I can buy at my local store do not contain advanced signal intelligence, they might have a camera but not radar or any of the other suggested payloads this balloon may have had. For China to be sending these all over the world, the most likely answer is not a weather balloon.
If this were so innocent why was it not public knowledge? You have to have a transponder for these types of missions in America, is China such a liberal nation that citizens are allowed to freely launch aircraft larger than multiple school buses with no government oversight?
A vested interest in weather, but not enough of an interest to work together with other nations or communicate their activities until publicly called out? Weird that the balloon was somehow nothing but also is worth a reprisal according to the Chinese government.
Soon it will be revealed China let loose 99 of these balloons and in one of them thereâ€™s a special surprise inside one of them for the lucky person who takes it down.
