Weren't there tons of stipulations on nations accepting the Marhshall Plan aid regarding their defense capabilities? That would appeal mainly to nations that were truly obliterated. While Russia appears to be losing this thing, domestically they may be fucked, but not post WWII Japan/Germany levels of fucked.
We keep reading that Russia has suffered Strategic defeat, but they are still fighting and no end in sight. Strategic is nonsense, there needs to be tactical defeats, so Russians realise they can't continue. This is where NATO urgently must to step up to the plate and either join or give Ukraine all of the advanced support it needs. Russia will not suffer, but will just retire to its legitimate borders, Ukraine and the West can then get on with fixing our world.
Given the issues they face... blaming Putin, withdrawing, and showing willingness to work with the West is the smartest course of action.
The wider issue is those in power in Moscow that cling to the notion Russia is entitled to be a superpower.... & deserves to take, by force, whatever resources necessary to bring about USSR 2.0.
The longer the Russians double down, the less theyâ€™ll be able to pose security threats to other countries in the region. Raising 200k conscripts to attack Kyiv from Belarus a second time hopefully breaks the Russians back.
