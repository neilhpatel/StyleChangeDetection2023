When the fence is built, the non-building party owes nothing towards building and maintenance, unless they have agreed previously or at the time to do so. However, if you buy into a house with a boundary fence, you may be expected to take part in maintenance.
A boundary fence generally is any fence on or near the property line. It doesn't look like FL has a "good neighbor fence act", so there is no presumption that maintenance costs are shared for boundary fences, and that is really the more important part than whether it is a boundary fence. The default would be the party that installed the fence is responsible for maintenance, but it also depends on your governing docs, if there are local laws. Are there any HOA rules, or deed restrictions that address responsibility for boundary fences?
If your lease does make you responsible for HOA violations, and you are responsible for outside maintenance such as fence cleaning, then your next move would be to appeal the HOA's assertion that it's a boundary fence. As the fence is solidly inside your neighbors property line, it's entirely their problem and clearly not a boundary hence.
Instead, tell them your actual objections: it's entirely inside your neighbor's property, not on the line. Your obligation under the covenants (check this, of course) is only to maintain your property, not your neighbor's.
The HOA is saying this is a boundary fence, and also that it is your responsibility to maintain. You are saying this is not a boundary fence, it is set back, and it is not your responsibility to maintain. I would talk to a local real estate attorney and review the governing docs and local law.
