The F-16 is one of the most widely exported fighter jets out of the USA. It has an extremely long history of operation and training foreign crews on the airframe. Additionally, for a fighter jet, is relatively easy to learn to operate. Someone who already knows how to operate a fighter jet of any kind should be able to transition with ease and expediency.
I know the Iraqi pilots were in training for years when they began their program, and Iâ€™m fairly sure most if not all those guys had been flying MIGs beforehand or some sort of jet.
According to officials the US is expecting it to take around two years just to get Ukrainian pilots proficient with the aircraft. But mastering and actually being effective might take longer.
The sooner Ukraine starts to make that transition by training new pilots to fly western jets (specifically they should be training for F16s, F15s, and F/A18s. Though they might only likely get the 16s and 18s because NOBODY is getting rid of their 15s. One can dream though) the better. However thats something thats going to take possibly over a year, possibly multiple years. Modern jet combat is WAY more than putting your gun onto something and shooting. In fact, its none of that. Its all beyond visual range and arguably most of it is weapon deployment of missiles, working the radar, SA, etc. Which is not only very different between the Mig/SU and the US's fighters. But very complicated in general. And it's not just down the pilots, the ground crews have to learn how to work on this stuff too.
In aircraft they're trained on. Doing a sortie with little to no training is a suicide mission. You're not going to just hope in a F16 after flying in a SU27 and be able to drop a JDAM or launch a Maverick. You'd just in the sky waiting to die.
