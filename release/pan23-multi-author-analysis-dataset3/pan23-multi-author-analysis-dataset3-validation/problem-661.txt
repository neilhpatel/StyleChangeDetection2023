It's not mandatory to take lunch (though in the words of my manager when I emailed her about this, "it is never encouraged to skip lunch"); rather it's a luxury that we do get to have most days, so long as we aren't swamped.
So yeah if you skip lunch to keep working, particularly if you do so because there's work to be done which it sounds like the expectation, they don't get to pretend you weren't working when you were.
You say that your employer deducts ostensible lunch breaks, even though you are actually working during those breaks. But you don't say how many hours you work or how much your employer pays you for those hours, which makes it hard to figure out whether your employer is breaking rules A or B above, which are the requirement for a minimum wage and the requirement for overtime, respectively.
The short answer is "maybe." You'd need to have more facts in order to figure out whether you and your coworkers are getting ripped off. It's likely a violation of the law in any overtime workweek, but in any workweek in which you work less than 40 hours (including the disputed lunch breaks), there's likely not any violation.
Now in a workweek that is more than forty hours long, the enforcement position of the US DOL and courts has been that your employer must pay you your established rate for all hours. It's not possible, you see, to accurately pay additional halftime for all hours over 40, unless your employer accurately records your working time.
For a couple of pay periods, keep an accurate day by day and hour by hour count of when you work, including the breaks that are so shot full of interruptions as not to be breaks. Do the math: does your gross pay for each nonovertime workweek, divided by the number of hours you counted, come out to more than $7.25? Did you ever work overtime workweeks? If you can say yes to either of these questions, you can.
