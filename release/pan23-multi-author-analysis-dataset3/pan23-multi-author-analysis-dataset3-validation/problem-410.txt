I'd honestly call the cops at this point. From the sounds of things, laws are being broken and also not enforced by animal control. The amount of dogs alone is probably against city ordinance. I know where i live if you have more than 4 dogs in your house/property then they are seized and sometimes you get to choose which 4 to keep, but a lot of times not. And if they attacked anybody on the persons property if no signs were up warning of the dogs that in itself will have the dogs seized and a hefty fine imposed.
ETA: unless your neighbor has a no trespassing sign on their property, the dog still is considered a danger if it randomly attacks people on the property. You can't claim it's a guard dog if you don't have proper signs, there is owner responsibility to warn others about the dangers of their dogs. I own 2 10lbs dogs, I have a no trespassing sign and a beware of dog sign because in my backwards state were criminals have more rights then you, if some idiot decided to break into my house and my 10lbs dog bit them, I would get in trouble for not warning my robber about the danger of my 10lbs dogs. Again the need for verification of your local animal laws.
I'm not familiar with SC law or your local law, but in most areas after the first bite/attack from a dog, the dog is taken in to be evaluated, and if it is found to be aggressive, it's put down. You might have to research your local law to even see if it is being applied correctly.
Also get one or at least consult with a lawyer. You neighbor is responsible for any damages their dog causes. If your local animal control is not applying the law when it comes to aggressive dogs, I'd look into at least filing a complaint against them.
Take the owners to small claims court and sue for your doctors bills for your bite and vet bills for when your dog was attacked. Maybe if the owners have to pay out money they might start taking some responsibility for their dogs actions. Also encourage all of your neighbours to do the same.
