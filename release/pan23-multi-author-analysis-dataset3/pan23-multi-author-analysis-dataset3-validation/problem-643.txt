As far as I know there are no lawyers right now. I have only been contacted by the family. I want to contact a lawyer but I'm scared of involving lawyers/the courts when it could be resolved in the family. On the other hand, I know that speaking to the accuser is probably an awful idea. But if I ignore this until he turns 18, then what? I'm just so worried. I genuinely do not recall ever molesting him or forcing him to touch me. I don't even like to be touched on the arm, let alone in a more vulnerable spot.
But I think I just suffered a panic attack. I don't know how I could live another week like this. I can't sleep and my stomach turns when I eat.
No. I spoke with the parents. They said the cliche, "with time and love, everything can heal," "I see you as my own son.".
So for your sake. See this through the right way. You don’t need to call a bunch of people and plead your case to them. You don’t need to convince anyone of anything. That is your lawyers job. So get one ASAP and stay strong.
Keep your head and see this through. I plead guilty to a crime I did not commit simply because I was scared and wanted to remove my head from the guillotine. It’s haunted me forever.
