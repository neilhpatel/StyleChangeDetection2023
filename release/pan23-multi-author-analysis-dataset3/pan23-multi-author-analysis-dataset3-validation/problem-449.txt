Look, Russia was among those that said "Never Again" after world war 2. They reneged on their agreement to not wage wars of conquest, and did so in a way that includes some of the worst war crimes and crimes against humanity since Pol Pot while sitting there lying about it and threatening nuclear war basically every 36 hours.
The leadership of russia today is the middle management when the USSR dissolved. All the other soviet states have sort of moved past that. And if you know what was inside the USSR, you had the Soviet State of Russia!
Russia humiliated itself and is trying to blame the west by further debasing itself, its like the west comes in and finds a kid that pissed theirself (russia) and when they say the consequences of that need to be dealt with the kid threatens to shit on the ground.
Russia fucked up, and needs to own the loss, if they don't no one will trust Russia until those responsible are out of power.
Well that won’t be accepted by Russian leadership. They’re almost certainly going to reject anything that looks into war crimes. Either that or ignore the tribunal.
