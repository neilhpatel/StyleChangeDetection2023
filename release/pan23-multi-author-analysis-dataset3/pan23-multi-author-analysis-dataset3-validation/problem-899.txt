They're not stupid. Without US support and protection, they're just another impoverished island nation relying on tourism to stay afloat. Absolutely no disrespect intended, but the pragmatic truth is that their only intrinsic value is as a strategic military geographic position; they have no other real resources to trade, no mining, precious metals or logging, no serious industry. Nope, the good people of Samoa know that right now, all things considered, they are stronger as a US territory. No question that the US needs to treat them (and all other territories, like Puerto Rico) much better than we do.
No they don't want a Puerto Rico situation to develop where a bunch of rich mainlanders buys the land. On the other hand, if an American Citizen can't have full rights there, they shouldn't have them in the U.S. It's a good arrangement for both parties. Puerto Rico is such a mess primarily because of decades of local corruption. It is that simple. PR bankrupted itself, kicking the can down the road economically and no number of fluff pieces from John Oliver can cover that up.
