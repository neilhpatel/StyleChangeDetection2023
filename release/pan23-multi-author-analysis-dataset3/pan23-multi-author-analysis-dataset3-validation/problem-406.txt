Itâ€™s getting annoying seeing it so often. At this point, it kinda feels like Christians saying Jesus will come back, but of course it never will happen. At least Trump being prosecuted is plausible (though unlikely).
Or are you thinking that they could have indicted and arrested Trump without nailing down the details? Just throw some charges together (which would require revealing some details of the case, their sources, etc.), arrest him, and then worry about getting the details nailed down while he's out on bail? I'm not a lawyer but I don't think that's how it works.
Like it or not, Trump lost those protections on January 20, 2021. Any gloomy-doomy cynicism based on pretending otherwise is ignoring the facts.
None of this is a guarantee that he'll be charged, or that if he's charged he'll be convicted. But it's far from a situation that justifies either wishful thinking or gloomy-doomy cynicism.
So there's no need to get overly cynical yet. There is still a good chance we might see real justice here. And if we don't see real justice, the American people have a great, constitutionally protected ability to let the government know they fucked up. But let's wait for them to actually fuck up first.
