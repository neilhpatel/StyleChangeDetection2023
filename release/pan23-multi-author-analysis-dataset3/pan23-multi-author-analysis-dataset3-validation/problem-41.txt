There's a general expectation among scholars and enthusiasts alike that we should treat the textual material (occasionally even the really late stuff) as authentic traces of the Viking Age and highlight the material stuff only when it fits. Price works the other way around, and in his previous book (recently republished) , he basically started from a broad survey of the material evidence to shape his views on the written stuff. That comes into full bloom in Ash and Elm, so I think critiquing the one book risks missing the point of Price's overall intellectual program.
I'm hoping that the Viking Age can get reappraised in a similar fashion, and I see Price's work as moving in that direction, centering material culture and forcing us to see the texts from their perspective. Textual scholars have already pointed out many places where he's likely wrong, but that kind of back-and-forth is how we slowly arrive at a more accurate picture of the past. Price's work shouldn't be the only book someone reads on the Viking Age, but if it's one of a handful, I'd say it's a pretty good choice.
I also agree to his recommendation of the two latest overview books on the Vikings (one is Price's), mentioned in the question thread above.
