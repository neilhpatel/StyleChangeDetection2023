They may be able to apply the damage deposit towards your unpaid rent, in which case your deposit will need to repaid to the new landlord, however your rent will have been repaid to the first owner.
It is possible that you can ask the new landlord for x months to pay into the damage deposit back to full, the payments could end up being the same as the payment schedule with the old landlord.
You should discuss with the new owner's that you provided the previous owner with $XXXX as a security deposit and that you'll be expecting that returned (minus any damages) when you end your tenancy. The new Owner will owe you the security deposit, regardless of whether they do their due diligence to get it from the old owner.
Your security deposit only comes into play when you decide to end your tenancy. Is your current LL trying to end your tenancy? If not, then it's a non-issue. Your tenancy is not affected by the change in property ownership.
When a home is sold with a tenancy in place the new owners assume responsibility for your lease. The security deposit should be transferred to the new owners as part of their agreement to purchase. Even if they don't actually receive the deposit from your current landlord, that won't relieve them of the requirements of the lease when your tenancy eventually ends. Additionally, any back rent that may still be owed when the home is sold will still be due to the new owners.
