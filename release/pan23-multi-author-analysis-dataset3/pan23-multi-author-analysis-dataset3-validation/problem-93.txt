Washinon and many Western allies say the Leopards - which Germany made in the thousands during the Cold War and exported to its allies - are the only suitable option available in big enough numbers.
A German government source said Berlin would lift its objections if Washinon sends its own Abrams tanks. U.S. officials say the Abrams, which runs on powerful turbine engines, uses too much fuel for Kyiv's strained logistics system to keep many of them supplied at the front.
To be clear, the US is sending a very large number of armored fighting vehicles, but modern US tanks (Abrams), are extremely high maintenance gas guzzlers with some of the most advanced tech out there. Germany seems to be using this as a sticking point to avoid sending their own rather than for reasonable protest, other NATO countries are even sending their tanks.
Don't really get why Germany is being so hesitant when you already have Poland ready to re-export their tanks to Ukraine and the UK is sending challenger 2s.
US tanks are not the best option for Ukraine, LEO's seem to be the preferred option, so addressing Germany's fears should close the gap. So then the right solution would be to trade nuke deterrence/protection to Germany in exchange for donating tanks to Ukraine, would it not ?
Why do they have to go to the front, how about place them in larger cities (Kyiv) or the border with Ukraine and Belarus in case Russia tries to open another front. Strategic location to reduce fuel needs and maintenance and then use the Leopards for Offense/front line operations....I think there'd be a few loopholes in the agreement of USA sending tanks 1st, which opens the door for everyone else to send tanks. USA can send them, how they use them is a completely different issue.....
