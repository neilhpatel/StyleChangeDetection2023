Hey everyone! My name is Andrey Pertsev and I’m a Russian journalist with Meduza. My work also appears in Carnegie Russia and Riddle. I’m best known for having sources throughout the Russian government, and understanding the political machinations of the Russian Federation. I’m from Arkhangelsk, but I’ve been to a majority of Russia’s regions and know their political structures well.
I’m not in a position to express opinions of majority, most or even significant number of people in Russia. The thing is that people are not really hive minds, and with such vast differences between cultures, ethnicities and overall variation in conditions there is not a single thing we (they) can agree on.
There are certain discussions on sanctions, whether they are effective against the regime or not and what final purpose do they pursue. Overall people think that these sanctions are punishment for being born in specific country and/or being of specific nationality, and that whole world hates us (but with different strenh). I would say some people are at peace with it, others might think that it is a bit unfair. Some people don’t believe in better tomorrow or reintegration into civilization, at least in their lifetime.
