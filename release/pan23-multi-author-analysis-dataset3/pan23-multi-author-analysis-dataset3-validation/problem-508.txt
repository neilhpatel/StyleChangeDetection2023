Except she's clearly not saying that at all. She's saying she had no part in organizing it, which you could tell because there were no guns involved. How do you possibly get "if she'd had her way the deaths would be higher" out of this?
Because she's clearly arguing that she had nothing to do with Jan 6. It's the same as if someone said "I didn't rob the bank, if I did I would've done it totally differently and probably gotten away with more money." Are you really going to turn around and accuse that person of wanting to rob a bank?
“See that’s the whole joke, isn’t it. They say that whole thing was planned and I’m like, are you kidding me? A bunch of conservatives, second amendment supporters, went in the Capitol without guns, and they think that we organized that?".
Yes. She is saying that she would be part of or lead in an armed insurrection, willing to shoot police officers, and take over the capitol building by force with deadly consequences. This woman should be disqualified from any committees and censured (We know that won't happen).
