>>> Sixty days' notice from the landlord or 30 days' notice from the tenant is necessary to terminate a tenancy at will.
Georgia requires 30 days' notice when a tenant wants to terminate a month-to-month tenancy, so the requirement in the lease is redundant and the same requirement exists for your verbal lease. You and he can negotiate shorter notice, under any terms you both like, but the backstop is that if you give notice today, your obligations end with the next month of your lease. Conversely, though, you don't have a right to unilaterally pro-rate the notice period, even if you give notice mid-month, and while your roommate's behaviour is unusual, it's not clearly so dangerous or threatening that you would be legally justified in walking away from the tenancy. If you can't work it out, if you walk anyways, and if he takes it to court, he might get the full month, even if you're only there for half of it.
Having said all of that, one question you should ask yourself is whether you think your roommate is prepared to take this to court or not. It takes time and it's not free to do so (filing fees in your state start at about $60). You have at least an arguable defence if he does - while I think you wouldn't be legally justified in leaving, a judge might disagree depending on the specific facts, and your roommate's unreasonable behaviour _in total_ might affect your obligation.
Your roommate's high-handed language notwithstanding, you aren't in default of the agreement because there is no agreement. They will almost certainly not be able to enforce anything beyond 30 days' notice, even in the worst case.
Don't sweat the "wifi sniffing" argument. It feels important, but it's a complete red herring. In principle, this could be a crime, but in the context of your dispute and in the absence of any real harm arising out of it, I would be strongly tempted to treat it as a provocative but ultimately irrelevant distraction, and focus on leaving.
