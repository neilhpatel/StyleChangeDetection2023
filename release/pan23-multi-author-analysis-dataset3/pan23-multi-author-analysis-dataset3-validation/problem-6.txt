Bear in mind that the contract almost certainly has stipulations regarding obeying classroom rules and acceptable use of technology. Violations of either of which could result in your student's loss of a scholarship, suspension, or the school simply not accepting his enrollment in future years.
If you don't agree with the policies of the school your recourse would be to find a private school with policies you agree with or enroll in a public school.
Given that it's a private school in MN your contract with the school will dictate their rules and regulations and what fines, if any, the school can assess.
If this is a private school then they can set policies as they desire, including confiscating phones.
And while I agree they can set a policy to confiscate phones, my question was, is it legal to require people to pay to get them back. Whether it’s a school, a church, a doctors office, a daycare, a workplace, a guy on the street, the law doesn’t work that way. Taking someone’s property and then requiring payment to get it back can’t be legal.
Just because you CAN avoid being the victim of a crime, doesn’t justify the crime when it’s committed because someone fails to avoid it. Regardless of how easy it is to avoid. It’s still a crime, IF ITS ILLEGAL… I of course do not know if it is.
