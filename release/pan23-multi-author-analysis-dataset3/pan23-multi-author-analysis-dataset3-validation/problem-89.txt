Yes, though the landlord should have done this as soon as they were notified of the income change, and if it's most kinds of HUD housing any rent decrease should be retroactive to the month of the income decrease.
Right but this landlord is saying there IS cause, because the tenant has been "underpaying" their rent, though the tenant has provided more than the required documentation to prove that they are no longer receiving that second income.... It should be retroactive to the month where their income went down and from there they would go back to paying what they had prior to the additional income. The renter is correct in this situation, and though the landlord is technically also IF the renter had continued with the second job. Frankly if they did go forward with trying to evict, they would be unsuccessful and also be out the fees associated with the process up to that point as well. The advice already given to request the recertification of income is all that should be necessary to void this supposed bill moving forward, and contacting their local aid office for subsidized housing would likely be sufficient in nipping this as well.
If its the type of low income housing where you've been doing a yearly certification of your income with your landlord, ask for an "interim recertification.".
Yeah. That's pretty much the case. Because while we use the two must recent pay stubs to calculate the yearly income, we can't verify how much you made until the end of year. That's the only way we could actually check it. So while the guidelines say, anytime your income changes by $100 per month. In practice it's really aiming for catching at least semi permanent changes.
