\-That the invasion happens quickly, eliminating the ability of the international community to respond meaningfully.
\-That Russia—the "second most powerful army in the world," Russian General Valery Gerasimov said prior to the war's start—would dominate Ukraine on the battlefield.
Much of the... surprise... of the early days of the war was that Ukraine had actually prepared very effectively for the invasion, without telling anyone, including their western allies about it.
How is Russia afraid of NATO if at the beginning of their invasion they moved their troops near their border with NATO to aid in their invasion of Ukraine? Russia was never afraid of NATO because Russia knew NATO was never invading. NATO wouldn’t even be relevant anymore if it weren’t for Russia constantly bullying all of its neighbors.
Those same dynamics wouldn't necessarily exist, Russia is larger than Ukraine yes; but it's not larger than the allies supporting them.
What I've always wondered about is if U.S.A vs China wouldn't potentially be a mirror of Nazi Germany vs Russia in WW2.
