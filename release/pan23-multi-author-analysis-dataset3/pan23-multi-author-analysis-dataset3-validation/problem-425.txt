The US and the other countries had refused until recently to send tanks, long-range rockets and drones are out-of-question.
It's also important to know that the US doesn't place much of an emphasis on ground to ground rockets. We have them because Russia had proved their viability, and because they added a capability to ground assets that they might otherwise not have. In practice though? The US relies on its airforce, not rocket artillery.
That was more about the ammunition than the actual units (hence my use of "rockets", not system). HIMARS is an American-made system. Delivery goes to the US as an absolute priority. Then come the foreign contracts. Since the ammunition has made a dent in US stockpile, they will fill that back up first, then arm Poland.
Even without this 10b in HIMARS, if Poland was attacked all NATO members must defend against it, with all weapons at their disposal.
The Polish PM and representatives of the Polish Sejm are currently having meetings with the Chechen Government in Exile and are supporting Chechen independence. Polish PM recently said in an interview that Chechnya should be free.
