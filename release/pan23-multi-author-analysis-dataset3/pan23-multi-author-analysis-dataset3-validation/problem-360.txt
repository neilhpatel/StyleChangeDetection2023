The wording of your reply made it seem like you were referring to cold calling, but I take it you send mailers, etc.
But isn’t cold calling, as OP was talking about, illegal? Rule 7.3 states “[a] lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact solicit professional employment…”.
(b) A lawyer shall not solicit professional employment by written, recorded, or electronic communication or by in-person, telephone, or real-time electronic contact even when not otherwise prohibited by division (a), if either of the following applies:
(a) A lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone, or real-time electronic contact solicit professional employment when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain, unless either of the following applies:
(3) the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person to whom the communication is addressed is a minor or an incompetent or that the person's physical, emotional, or mental state makes it unlikely that the person could exercise reasonable judgment in employing a lawyer.
ETA: And yes, I do mailers. Not often anymore because my practice has exploded but it’s a last resort if I’m running very low on work. My mother does it for foreclosures/bankruptcies as well.
