Check with Comcast. If they need to run a drop through your yard for some reason they would certainly be talking to you about it. And tell neighbor once you’ve discussed with Comcast you’ll let him know if it’s OK.
Edit: Never mind....I scrolled down and see that a former Comcast tech has answered my question. Thanks anyway!
Great explanation. I have a question. Even if OP's property deed contains an easement that includes Comcast, wouldn't it still be more likely that Comcast would install a box on the neighbor's house? Why would Comcast dig through OP's property and not just go straight for the neighbor?
If the neighbor is telling the OP that Comcast is installing service from the OPS garage to their home is illegal.
I 200% agree. OP should call comcast and verify that the neighbors service is NOT being installed from the OPS garage, but rather than the pedestal in the neighbors easement by the roadway.
Also check with 811 to see if anyone has requested underground utility marking for your address or your neighbors.
