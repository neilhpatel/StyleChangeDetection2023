Birth control is only affecting HER body, not his. He is putting something in her body without consent. It may not be a crime but it isnâ€™t right either.
Not a crime. Looking at this in reverse, if the husband wanted a child but the wife did not and took birth control without telling him, no one would think of it as a crime. However, the fact that the couple is out the money for fertility treatments due to the husband's sabotage may be something the judge considers in dividing assets in the divorce.
A good lawyer might be able to get more money for her in the divorce based on the wasted/sabotaged costs of the fertility treatments.
If anything she might be able to recover the costs of the fertility treatment than the spermicide itself.
If she can prove the spermicide has damaged her body in anyway, she can sue to be made whole. Just reading about possible , it appears none of them are severe and would be otherwise difficult to prove that it was the cause. Definitely would be an uphill battle for her.
