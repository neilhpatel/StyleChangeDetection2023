I think people are confusing this occasion with her entrance to the theatre in April, mentioned by Pepys above, where she was (as described by another man of the era, Charles North) "all ye pageant now discoursed on: Her brests all laid out to view at a play house with scarlett trimd nipples." That could mean she was in a costume like those designed by Inigo Jones - but it could also mean a low-cut gown with rouged nipples kind of slipping out of the neckline. Seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth century sources have a habit of saying someone's breasts are fully uncovered when what they mean is that the tops of the breasts are uncovered, that there's cleavage on display.
Nothing in your long post disproves that low cut dresses and exposed breasts or nipples were a fashion of the mid-eighteenth century in France.
Also you mentioned rouged nipples - was drawing attention to the area around the nipples when wearing low cut dresses a feature of fashion at this time?
Whether or not women sometimes revealed their nipples in public is still under discussion among fashion historians. There are several French fashion prints from the eighteenth century that show women with their nipples on display, but they're problematic to interpret: for instance, and , both from the Galerie des Modes in 1778. The first example here is sexually-charged even without the exposure - this is a young woman, alone, meeting someone for a "rendez-vous" in a grove off of a fashionable avenue - and the Galerie has a habit of leaning on eroticism in poses and descriptions. ("The pose of this governess prevents her fine leg from being seen; her breast is lily-white and covered by a ruffled handkerchief, but it can be found by Lubin," is my favorite example of completely unnecessary sexy description.) As all of the people upvoting this question can attest, images of and talk of breasts produces results! Other examples of commercial prints that show women with exposed nipples seem to combine satire and sex appeal, such as , a bawdy joke about the British naval campaign against France in the Atlantic, in which the Lord Admiral patrolled near Brest to keep an eye on the French, or are just an excuse for voyeurism, such as , which doubles the voyeurism by letting the viewer look at the men looking at the woman in the print.
