It’s definitely worth calling for free consults with a couple of firms, but don’t hold your breath for a “great” outcome either. There may be fact specific things that do result in great news for you. That’s why you need the attorney, but also be prepared to have a lot of attorneys not willing to take it.
You need to consult with a malpractice attorney, but generally cosmetic surgery not turning out “right” doesn’t really go far. There are attorneys that take the cases, but have realistic expectations.
That’s why I said have realistic expectations. A lot of places will settle by comping the cost of the procedure rather than take the hit of having an actual malpractice suit.
From a practical perspective, an attorney may well take the case, because they can get paid to pressure the surgeon to comp your care if they did, in fact, screw it up.
This would fall under medical malpractice which is way to complex and fact specific for anyone here to even attempt to touch. You need to get a consult with a local malpractice attorney.
