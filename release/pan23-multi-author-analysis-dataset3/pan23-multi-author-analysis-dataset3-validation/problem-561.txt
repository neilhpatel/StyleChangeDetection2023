They legitimately believe every other white person is just afraid to be publicly racist, because they have zero empathy.
It's absolutely insane the amount of older white people that will say a bunch of racist shit to me, because I'm a tall white guy and they assume I'll agree.
As a scruffy white guy let me tell you- I am sick and tired of these people seeking affirmation that I agree with their backward hateful shit the moment they’re alone with me and they think no one is listening. I am not part of your secret club of bigots and the way I act in public is the way I really am- it must suck to slink around secretly thinking you’re better than everyone else because you have the same complexion I do.
Yeah whenever I'm with another white person and they say "you know, you can't say anything nowadays without people getting offended" I know the conversation is about to take a turn.
Have been privy to conversations that only racist white people have, I usually correct them quickly. They never do it again.
