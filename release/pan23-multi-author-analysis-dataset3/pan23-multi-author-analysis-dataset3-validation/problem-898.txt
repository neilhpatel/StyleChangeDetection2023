Ok, I went through the online thingy to self-verify docs, and I think where it is going haywire is the part where it is asking if your name has changed \from the document you are using to prove citizenship/legal presence\. You are using your "new" birth certificate & the answer is NO your name hasn't changed from that document.
The birth cert issued after adoption(with your adopted parents as the parents) would be considered your original birth certificate. No need for adoption papers, as your original birth cert would be with your adopted name = no name change you need to justify.
If the DMV (or dept of state for a passport application) isn't accepting this, then something is wrong with the birth certificate with your adoptive name & adoptive parents. You'll need to find out from the DMV, exactly why it isn't accepted.
If you have a passport, you wouldn't need a real id...but then, the passport would work in place of the birth cert requirement. Do you have a ssn? You would need that, too, for real id.
They need his adoption papers for him to get a Real ID license. I am asking about me for when I need to get mine. Sorry for the confusion. Edited to add info.
