He can get a separate chequing account at another bank. Start having all of his paycheque deposited there and move autopay for whatever utilities are in his name to the new account.
He needs to contact the credit card companies with the cards and either close the accounts (if he can afford to) or ask for new numbers because his cards are compromised. Her use of his credit cards is a problem, since it's technically financial fraud.
He can report her for the credit card fraud. That is very likely going to end up with her having some potentially serious criminal consequences.
He can separate from her and seek custody of the children. Child support will be determined by a court.
