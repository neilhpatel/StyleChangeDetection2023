This is what is going to hurt you except this is what is going to hurt you! Because any because anyone could claim what you are saying saying with just filming the Laptop being put on a bed. Try to call a lawyer to get a free consultation.
I agree 100%. OP is in a spot though. He has a video of Placing the item on the bed, but he Unfortunately did not take a video of himself leaving it there and leaving the residence.
God, I feel so bad for you Yes, people can be filthy enough- I do believe a judge could easily recognize you were set up. How long after you left did this person try contacting you to ask where the laptop was? I so hope they don't get by trying to take advantage of you.
