A major innovation that swept through universities and academia in the 17th century was the Mechanical Philosophy. Judging by your flair you are likely aware of this, but for the benefit of others this is the change in thinking about the world that led to what we understand as modern science.
It's a fascinating topic but unfortunately I dont feel equipped to give you a good answer - it was not my topic of study and it's been quite a few years now since I was at university. You could consult the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which is a good online resource, or ask a question her in AH.
Ultimately the Mechanical Philosophers were not able to come up with a satisfactory causal explanation of gravity.
The very fact that Newton proposed action at a distance to explain gravity is precisely why it was so controversial among Mechanical Philosophers.
Eventually Newton would break with the Mechanical Philosophy by proposing his own solution to the problem of gravity: that bodies attract each other at a distance without ever coming into contact. Newton knew this was an issue and famously stated that he made no claim as to how gravity works, just that it obeys the mathematical rules he proposed. Although the rest of Newton's work was largely within the Mechanical Philosophical tradition, it took a couple of generations to be widely accepted outside of Britain because his theory of gravity ran so counter to the Mechanical Philosophy. However eventually the power of Newton's approach became so obvious that this kind of criticism ceased.
Finally, I want to emphasize that even back then you could tell that Newton didn’t get everything right, despite the wild success of this theories in general. His theories failed to predict the orbit of Uranus or Mercury as well as the other planets, couldn’t explain situations where air resistance played a major factor, and had little to say about magnetism, a phenomena that was recently discovered and poorly understood during his lifetime. These were generally believed to be solvable within the Newtonian framework however, and some of them would be.
Newton's framework not only assumes the well known three laws, but also assumes Galilean relativity, which was of course not known as that, it was just what "was obvious" about how frame of reference changes worked.
