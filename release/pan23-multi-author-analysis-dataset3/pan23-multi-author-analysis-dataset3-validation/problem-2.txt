Most Last Wills have an Attestation Clause, which when signed by the witnesses, means that a probate court should not require the appearance of those witnesses.
Banks may feel/believe that there is liability to allow their employees to serve as a witness to a signing of a Last Will.
I usually insist on people who know that Testator to witness the Last Will in situations where I/we anticipate that someone will challenge the Last Will. I'll want/expect those witnesses to acknowledge that the Testator was not coerced into signing etc.
You could ask several bank customers to witness and if they know the situation, they'll simply sign it as a courtesy to you, although they'll have to add their addresses to the Last Will.
Yes, if you can go to your bank and they're willing to provide witnesses for you, they can do that. The problem is they'll probably only provide contact information through the bank, and if nobody can find them at the time you die and there's some contest about the will, the will may or may not be probated.
Honestly, if it's worth doing a will, it's worth hiring a local attorney. They will not only make sure it's drafted and executed correctly, they'll also keep a copy of it for you safely.
