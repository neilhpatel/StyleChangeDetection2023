The culture war stuff the right is pushing seems so insane until you realize the whole circus is designed to distract from the fact their only actual policy positions are cutting taxes for rich people and taking away health care and social security from people. Their actual policy positions are very unpopular.
However, it is not the gunman on the grassy knoll. Hell, it’s not even keeping classified documents at your Florida fuck pad. The smart thing for Democrats to do would be to acknowledge that, yeah maybe there is some fuckery with Hunter but c’mon y’all, this is really all you got?
I agree but since Republicans are going to do it anyone I have an opinion on the right way for Democrats to message this, which is of course unpopular with people on the far left.
They think it's going to turn off the "moderate" and "centrist" republicans by exposing how nuts conservatives are. They think this will push them into apathy about voting, or better yet get them to vote for centrist democrats. But democrats played this game in 2016 and lost. They thought spotlighting Trump would turn everyone off, but instead it just normalized him. Hardcore conservatives embraced him and used his presence to slide the overton window as far to the right as they could. Moderate republicans, it turns out, aren't very moderate and will find reasons to vote for the conservative unless it literally kills them.
We all know Republicans are terrible, so when they're terrible, no one cares, and conversely, Democrats are responsible, so everything is their fault.
Democrats should have learned they can't ignore anything Republicans do or say no matter how ridiculous because people will believe it. All Republican talking points must be addressed head on.
