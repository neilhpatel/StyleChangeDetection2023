Wow, what awful answers here. You have to be proven negligent. If your brakes unforeseeably fail, that is a valid defense. For people talking about a duty to maintain a vehicle, I think that’s missing the point of the question. There’s a big difference between “I bought this car five years ago and I’ve never had the brakes inspected” and “I just had the brakes replaced, drove out of the mechanic’s parking lot that told me I was good to go, and hit a pedestrian at the first intersection I came to because the brakes failed.” And there are plenty of places in between those extremes.
From a practical standpoint, good luck winning that case without some darn good evidence in your favor precisely because all those bad answers posted are the things jurors actually think.
But bottom line is, an injured party has to prove fault. So in the question asked, if the vehicle was properly maintained and the brake failure was truly unforeseeable and you did absolutely nothing negligent, then no, you are not legally liable.
That being said, if there really was a problem with the brakes, you can have a cause of action against the manufacturer/dealer/mechanic etc depending on what exactly happened.
If it was a manufacturing error in the pads/Rotors/Etc that can be proven to have caused the accident? No.
