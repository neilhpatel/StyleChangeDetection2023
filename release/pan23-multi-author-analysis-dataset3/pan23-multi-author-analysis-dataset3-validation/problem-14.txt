I'm curious (as a r/legaladvice lurker and PA resident). Does the list of calls responded to/visits made by the police have to be generated by the civilian? Shouldn't the police have a record of all those visits themselves?
Maybe ask that the police go to the complainant's property first and listen. If they hear something extreme they can then contact you, but they should not go straight to your property.
For a noise complaint to be legit, it should be experienced from the neighbor's property by the police, then they approach you if it is real.
One thing I would be asking the cops about is what constitutes a legitimate noise complaint. Your town most likely has some sort of quiet hours. 10pm-7am for example. Outside of that, and assuming that there is not a hazardous level of noise, there is really no reason for them to even respond. Making noise is not against the law or local ordinances if you are not within the quiet hours. By the standard the cops are setting, you could call in a noise complaint every time someone fires up their lawnmower in the middle of the afternoon, and they should go check it out. It's stupid that the cops are even giving this the time of day. Police budget must be pretty fat if they have extra time for this nonsense.
Didn't you mention your kid was middle school age? That's 12 or 13ish, right? Just curious...why could a middle school aged child not be "unattended in the yard?" Is there a legitimate legal issue with this?
