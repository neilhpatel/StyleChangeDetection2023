Definitely donâ€™t send that reply. You need to contact a lawyer and explain this all, and they can check with the DA to see how this could affect the case.
Either way, I'd consult an attorney and not send that response. I'm gonna sound like an asshole but law is one of the few fields that for whatever reason, people seem to think their Google research equals a law degree and I'm sorry to say that in like 99% of the cases (from my visual research lol) when a layperson writes a legal response or some petition or motion with the court, it is painfully obvious and often have picked up mostly right legal terms and law but typically apply them wrong, fail to realize their case falls under a certain exception, etc. Get an opinion from a NC attorney before possibly ruining a potential claim you may have because just because it worked out one way last time doesn't mean you didn't potentially fuck it up and just happened to get lucky.
Also, here, and sounds like in NC too from the response, you get to decide if you're filing the report to an extent (police aren't filing a case if they don't know about it) but once the state goes forward with charges, it is on them if they want to drop the case or not. The alleged victim can write an affidavit of nonprosecution but the prosecutor doesn't have to give a shit. Alleged victims write them all the time here and then look around all confused when they submit it and the prosecutor is like you know what? Nah, we're going forward.
I don't know NC law but I'm assuming they likely have restitution as part of the criminal case so provide the prosecutors proof of how much the damage cost and see if restitution can be paid to you as part of the resolution of the criminal case.
If you are contacted by the prosecutor please make it clear that you misunderstood your role as the victim in this case because of the way it was previously settled, and that you did not realize that your damages are not the only component of the criminal case. You can make it clear that you are not opposed to a plea deal if they decide to offer one, as you only wanted to preserve your relationship with your neighbors. (As this is a repeat offense, the prosecutor is much less likely to accept a plea of any kind and it was shrewd of the defense attorney to frame your misunderstanding of what 'dropping' entails and your improper request for damages as extortion. Don't correspond with him again, you don't want to give him any ammo to imply that your claims are frivolous or extortionate and damage the criminal and future civil case.
What he's saying is correct insofar that this a criminal proceeding that only the prosecutor can drop, and it IS inappropriate to phrase it that way. You simply misunderstood that because you were made 'whole' previously the prosecutor elected not to pursue it. You could convey to the prosecutor that you would request damages as a condition of any plea deal in the criminal case, but they have no obligation to include it or drop the case. Nothing here bars you from filing a civil suit for recovery of your damages at the conclusion of the criminal case, which is where and how damages are typically recovered.
