Yes, I just heard about another accident on the border of our district very recently. Thank you for asking this question. I haven't yet worked towards helping end this phenomenon, but I'll get started.
Once again, really grateful to serving with incredible legislators who have done a lot of work to protect reproductive rights Before I was sworn in, an omnibus bill re: reproductive rights and gender affirming care that protects health care providers and their patients from legal attacks by neighboring states and expands health care access and options across Illinois passed and was signed into law I'm still exploring how else we can support and protect patients coming in from neighboring states!
I am a 23-year-old woman who flipped a Republican-held district and was elected to the Illinois General Assembly to represent the 51st District. I've been busy setting up our brand-new district office and meeting legislative deadlines as the session takes off in full force. Ask me how I got here, ask me how you can do it too, and ask me about my plans for this legislative session. Ask me anything!
Thank you! I know it seems nitpicky to critique when you’ve got “bigger issues.” But I mean it as a genuine piece of advice, even if you already know it: don’t bury the lede. Be clear about who you are and what you want, using concise, clear, plain everyday language is essential. Reject the flowery vague jargon of political promises. Reject corporate language that obscures the point. Be direct. Then your work will speak for itself.
