Bilingualism then, was almost certainly fairly common in the pre-famine years, although we know from court records that many people were still monoglot Irish speakers and had to interact with the court through intepreters. The Irish folklore archive even records a multitude of jokes made at the expense of people who can speak only English.
There seems to be answers to the Scots-Gaelic and Welsh language aspects of the question, so I'll tackle the Irish question to the best of my ability.
There's been some good comments about the decline of Gaelic compared to Welsh, but one thing very important to remember is that Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are not comparable. Why? Because Welsh is the traditional language of Wales, but Scottish Gaelic is not the traditional language of Scotland. It's one of them. The original language, Pictish, died out, being replaced in the North and West by Gaelic, but in the South and East by an Anglo-Saxon dialect which became known as Scots. When 19% of Welsh people speak Welsh, that's 81% who've lost the ability to speak the language of their ancestors\ (well, actually a bit less due to immigration, but you understand what I mean). But 100% of Scots never spoke Gaelic. If you travelled back in time to, say, the 15th century, you would not find Edinburgh full of Gaelic speakers, but rather speakers of "Scots", the language of, well, the Scots, but one which was related to English.
