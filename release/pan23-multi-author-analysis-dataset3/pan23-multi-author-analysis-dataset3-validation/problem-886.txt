Had a transgender nephew, as clear cut a case as you would ever want to see, I mean, could’ve been a poster child for “this is what someone born in the wrong body looks like and does”.
Don't you think a cis kid would be suicidal if they were forced by society to live as a trans kid for the first 21 years of their life?
Don't you think a straight kid would be suicidal if they were forced by society to live as a gay kid for the first 21 years of their life?
Also I am sorry but is your argument making trans kids suffer more will stop them from killing themselves?
If you support the denial of gender affirming care, then the blood of dead trans kids is on your hands.
Beyond this, trans kids are extremely high (compared to cisgendered) risk for suicide, and much more so without medical care and an acknowledgement of who they are.
It’s the first time I’ve really said anything about this to people outside the family who’ve never had or never loved an actual trans child, and it’s difficult.
I hope everyone on here who responded so vehemently is actually trans or has a trans friend or relative and there not just being idealogical goblins.
