Oh, and when asked if the departments would audit the background checks on the other officers since they fucked up so bad on Edwards' background check they basically said, "lolz no." üòê.
So much for gun safety! Rules for thee, not for me. I see a lot of people crying for gun safety, but then ignoring the elephant in the room: law enforcement arming officers that shouldn't have guns.
Always surprises me how the people who back cops don't understand that they're not supposed to use their guns unless their life is in danger. Instead of pull gun, shoot, ask questions later.
But if you are in a situation where you must use your firearm, you‚Äôre shooting to kill. You‚Äôre not trying to like ‚Äúwing‚Äù somebody or shoot them in the leg or whatever. Once the decision has been made to use a firearm you‚Äôre choosing death as an option.
Because shooting for any other reason is still likely to result in death, and sometimes not the death of your intended target. If you're shooting then it should be to kill flat out. That's not the problem.
