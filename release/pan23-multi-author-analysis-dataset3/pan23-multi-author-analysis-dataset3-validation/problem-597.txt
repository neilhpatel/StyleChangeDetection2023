And Russia knows it. And Russia knows that we know it. And I'm convinced Russia knows that they can't keep up their "special operation" if Ukraine continues to receive consistent military and monetary support from the West. I believe Russia's strategy is a desperate one: To string out the stalemate long enough to break the widespread support of the West.
I know that Russia continually reminds us that their country has the ability to precipitate world destruction. And we would risk nuclear war with such a provocative statement. But I am convinced that the explanation for the continuous and innumerable threats are evidence of their impotence. And I do not believe the Russian military would follow orders to launch a preemptive nuclear attack.
If Russia was to use nukes sure nato should respond, but it must be incremental pressure based on the provocation.
If Russia is warning about something, it is a sure indication that it should continue. When Russia applauds something, it's best to double check if it's the right thing to do - more than likely, it isn't.
This blows my mind that we have as much pro- Russian sentiment in this country as we do now. I grew up with very conservative parents and the phrase “Better dead than Red.”.
