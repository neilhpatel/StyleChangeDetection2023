Unions need to do a better job of attracting middle class support. They need to put more focus on putting money into worker‘s pockets and less on social issues and political donations.
These are self defeating efforts. If unions do this, it virtually guarantees that half the country will actively oppose them (the current status quo), and makes broad support for unions impossible. If unions broadly seek to support dems, do reps have any political alternative to union busting?
Unions absolutely push political goals, hell there’s even a movement revolving around it called syndicalism. This has always been a thing, and is part of the union’s job to protect workers.
If a large union only facilitated collective bargaining, they’ll find themselves chipped away by the legislature, since the company they’re bargaining against has no such qualms paying off the state.
Blaming unions for not being appealing enough instead of the oligarchs who’ve devoted unlimited dark money to politicians to bust unions is kinda gross.
You're not wrong, the anti labor laws and regulations that bought and paid for politicians have put in place over the last 30 or so years have decimated labor and worker rights while keeping the wages low enough that there isn't even hope of fighting back.
