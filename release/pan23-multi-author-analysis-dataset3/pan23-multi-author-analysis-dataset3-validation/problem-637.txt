This is inaccurate. It’s neither the official stance of Finland and directly contradicts what the Finnish PM said just earlier today in a press release. It also doesnt reflect the direction of the public conversation on the topic in Finland that has been ongoing over the last few weeks. (Link to news article about Finnish PM’s comments on the subject:
Meanwhile, Finlands’ NATO ascencion is unlikely to happen before this summers' NATO summit, after Turkey’s has held elections.
The irony is that Turkey's Erdogan has stated that Turkey will approve Finland's NATO membership without hesitation. Finland has decided to join together with Sweden or not join at all. To be honest, that does seem to be the stupidest decision I have ever heard, and it appears to be entirely for show. When you consider that Finland has a long border with Russia while Sweden does not, it just seems ridiculous.
Are you comparing Ukraine, who has 1900km of land border with Russia to Sweden, country that would be landlocked inside a NATO bubble here? Are you seriously? Because that's an completely redundant and insensible comparison to make.
