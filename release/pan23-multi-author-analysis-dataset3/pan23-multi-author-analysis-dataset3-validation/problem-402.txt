But these machines are only as good as the way they are deployed. Meaning that you have to use them in a specific way and not just throw them into situations where they would fail. So what did using tanks correctly mean in World War II? Basically it meant using them in conjunction with other units. Tanks need to work with infantry as well as air units and artillery. Or else they will be countered. A perfect example of this is World War II and during the battle of Okinawa.
I know I used two examples from non WW2. But you tend to find similarities when you look at them and I wanted to give you the most powerful examples. If you look in the fall of France you’ll find Germany used tanks very well, although sometimes they did find problems if they did get detached from infantry. The red army was also extremely good in combined arms operations. The Soviet tanks sometimes penetrated so far into German lines that they would double back and transport infantry up to help cover them. The Americans and other allied armies used tanks extremely well in the Normandy breakout also.
The Germans saw success early in massing tanks together to attack the enemy, creating shock and mass that often overwhelmed defenders. Whereas early in the war the Allies dispersed their tanks, often in infantry support roles. This was especially evident during the Battle of France, where the Allies had more tanks of arguably superior quality, but the Germans constantly had local superiority in armor at decisive points due to massing their armor.
“The above method of isolating the troops from the tanks with surprise fire followed by close combat tactics is an example in the complete destruction of enemy tanks will be a great factor in deciding the victories in tank warfare” - 32nd Army.
Frankly, most popular accounts over-emphasise the concentration part and forget to explain the importance of combined arms and how exactly it differs from the "tanks as infantry support" doctrine, so people get some very unrealistic ideas about how WWII tank units really worked.
