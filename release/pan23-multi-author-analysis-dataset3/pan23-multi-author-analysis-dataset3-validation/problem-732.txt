The grandfather of Maharal, R Chaim, was a real person. In fact, he was probably two people; it seems as though both of Maharal's grandfathers were named Chaim. However, your family tree is still possibly wrong. An erroneous work called Megillas Yuchasin (the Scroll of Ancestry), written by a relative of Maharal, averred that R Chaim of Worms was Maharal's paternal grandfather. I checked a few of the many genealogies online which claim to include Maharal and a large number of them made this mistake. However, while it does seem clear that R Chaim was the father of Maharal's father, Betzalel, he was not from Worms and the information about him in the Megillas Yuchasin was incorrect. We basically know nothing about this R Chaim, except that he must have been born after the date that you mentioned- he probably lived from about 1460/70-1520 (for details of the calculation, see the article).
Okay, not needing to translate things helps! Actually writing in Hebrew fully doesn't though, as my English is much better lol.
(I know Hebrew if it will be easier for you to talk in Hebrew and you don't need to translate everything).
