Many articles that mention the rapid depopulation of the Americas following European contact mention a slew of diseases including cholera, typhus, smallpox, measles, diptheria, influenza, scarlet fever, and bubonic plague. However, I also see a slew of articles that say that bubonic plague didn't touch the western hemisphere until the late 1800s.
Considering I can't find a single documented outbreak of bubonic plague in the Americas from 1492-1897, did it really come with colonists, or did the lack of appropriate animal vectors keep it from spreading?
According to bubonic plague arrived in the U.S. in 1900, most likely with infected rats stowed away on steamship from Asia, and the first epidemics occurred in port cities around the turn of the century. As you mentioned, the late arrival could be due to the plague needing a vector (flea) and a reservoir (mostly rats, but not always), as well as the proper environmental conditions for both of those species to survive, and the proper human conditions to bring us in close proximity to the vector and the reservoir. That's a much more difficult chain of transmission than respiratory viruses like smallpox or measles which spread from human to human with ease. So, yes, it does look like the plague was a rather late addition to the disease pool in the Americas.
