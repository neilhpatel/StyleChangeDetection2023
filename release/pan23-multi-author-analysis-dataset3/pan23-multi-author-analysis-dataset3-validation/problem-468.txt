You would have to first convince these countries to give them up after they just send their old soviet tanks to Ukraine.
Ukraine needs new tanks before Russia starts its next huge push/mobilization and Ukraine is loosing ground little by little around Bakhmut to the Russian meatgrinder.
Ukrainians have already stated that they need thousands of tanks, though I hope the tanks + APCs and other defense/offensive weapons are able to do the job.
Tank warfare: The first person who spots an enemy tank is most likely to win in a confrontation. The APCs with laser GPS targeting will hopefully relay the enemy coordinates to tanks, HIMARs, ... and allow them to get the first shot off. In that case, the number of required tanks may be lower. That said, I'd err on giving the Ukrainians too many tanks even with the available tools like laser GPS targeting.
Ukraine is a war zone and I doubt it can account for a surplus of tanks beyond the ones it can readily man. There's already corruption in the government so I can see some of these tanks getting lost and ending up on the wrong side of the battlefield. Hope I'm wrong though.
