If they're out of their car and you're in yours, the sanest, safest, and most legally coherent thing to do is to continue your trip onwards to your intended destination and to call the police when it's safe to do so. The second they got out of their car, they stopped being able to maneuver to block you, and being somewhere else is far, far more likely to protect you than literally any other action you could take.
If you are boxed in and are therefore unable to use your vehicle as a means of escape or as a weapon itself - id still question why you’d get out of the car and into a standoff. This isn’t the old west, we don’t go 10 paces and QuickDraw.
Generally all motor vehicles are a 1500+lb box of steel, aluminum, plastic and safety glass - accompanied by a motor and 3-6 wheels for the purposes of propulsion.
Only if you’re truly boxed in and unable to maneuver the vehicle or it is has been disabled somehow. Even at a red light it’s hard to concede that all the other cars around you refuse to flee or box in even closer when they see some jacked person with a tire iron gesticulating aggressively at another driver.
