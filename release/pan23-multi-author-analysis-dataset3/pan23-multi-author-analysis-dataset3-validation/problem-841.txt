While it was illegal to own white people as slaves, "white" was a legal status decided in the courts. Whiteness was determined based on either common knowledge - whether someone was known in the community as white - or pseudoscientific evidence based on ancestral origin. There were occasionally, however, enslaved people who looked white - usually the offspring of white male slaveholders and their black female slaves. White slaveowners showed "special interest" in mixed-race/mulatto slaves: they were often bought and sold at higher prices, and mixed-race women were often marketed as sex slaves.
The argument was that the slaves in question were captured in military engagement and enslaved alongside black slaves and being that there were no white women, they married and had children with black ones.
Sally Hemmings for example has become rather famous over the years as the Black slave who was owned by Thomas Jefferson, and had several children by him. Now, some may already be aware that Sally was herself the product of a slave/master union, but not as many folks realize Sally's mother (Betty Hemings) was also a mixed-race slave born under similar circumstances - thus, the slave Sally Hemmings was not half Black, she was 1/4. Three of her four grandparents were white. And indeed, she has been described as 'fair' and 'light colored', with 'straight hair'.
Out of these four children, three lived in adulthood as white/had white spouses. They were able to easily 'pass' as white...but they were slaves.
So were they white slaves? Were they "white" at all? Most of us probably would have assumed so, especially at a glance (perhaps in no small part because Western/American culture frames white as the default). Certainly the same could be said about other mixed-race people with similar ancestry (Shailene Woodley, Wentworth Miller, the paler half of most biracial twins). So by that criterion, there were surely "white slaves"...who were nevertheless enslaved for their non-white ancestry.
No, it was not possible to own a white person as a slave in the United States. There's plenty more on this , but several of the now-removed comments attempt to answer this by talking about indentured servitude -- while indentured servitude is a form of unfree labor, like slavery, it is not in fact comparable to chattel slavery (the indentured servant had rights under law, was not born into a state of servitude, and the state of servitude was time-limited).
