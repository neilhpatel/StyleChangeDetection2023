Evangelicals froth at the mouth over the thought of children learning that trans/gay/non-binary people exist; saying it is an attempt to indoctrinate children by exposing them to it early.
Which is even more weird because her and I have had conversations about religion before, since I'm an ex-Mormon and pretty vocal about not agreeing with children being in church or indoctrinated with religious ideology at a young age. She agreed with me and said it was why she never forced any of her kids to go and that her family was never religious anyway. Now she's suddenly found god?
He has been very low contact the past few years, only going over for holidays to see the rest of his family. We found out from his sister a couple of weeks ago that his mom has started going to church, and Bible study groups, and hanging out with people from the church. Apparently she even joined a "protest" in front of our local Planned Parenthood recently, which really pissed off my SIL because my FMIL literally convinced her to get an abortion when she was 22 because FMIL didn't think SIL could handle a child, so she drove her to THAT EXACT PP to get it done. I guess she's driving my SIL absolutely nuts with all of her newfound religious bullshite and has jumped head first into that rabbit hole. She's also been bringing my highly autistic nephew (bf's brother's 9 yo kid) with her because she's his caretaker during the day, and SIL thinks she also gets a ton of sympathy because of his condition.
This is literally what happened to my future MIL. She went full antivaxx, QAnon, Trump, etc, started attacking people that didn't agree with her, so my bf put up major boundaries and basically cut her off for months and only talks to her when it involves other family. She's been playing the victim and saying that I told him not to talk to her, and that since he's a liberal cuck, he's listening to me. I never once said a word to him about his mother, I didn't even tell him about her attacking me over text multiple times until one time she said something unforgivable and my bf knew something was up, so I just handed him my phone and let him see the weeks of bullshit she'd been sending me. That was his last straw and he told her to fuck off and leave me alone, and that if she wanted to try and make him choose, he would choose me every time.
