You have to act FAST! My stepfather screwed me out of almost everything that was my mother's (long nonrelevant story) but you only have a certain amount of days to protest the will or else you're screwed so get an attorney ASAP to take care of this. After that nothing matters, except if the attorney does not contact your mother since she is still legally his wife you can file charges against him in the state he's practicing in.
That means after a while, if no last will is filed, your mother may have to file a probate case on the grounds that there is no last will and argue that she is your father sole beneficiary as his wife.
Therefore, you might find that you will have to hire an attorney to settle and open up a probate case so that your mother can obtain his estate assets.
If the beneficiary of those insurance policies is his estate and there was no last will and testament, your mother may have a legal right to the proceeds from those life insurance policies.
For example, if he owns a house and he was in title to it by himself, even though there was no last will, the girlfriend can continue to occupy it until your mother claims it as a beneficiary of the estate.
If, at the time of his death, he was the sole owner in title of the house in which he lived, that house would become part of his estate and might be worth fighting for even though the cost is high.
