In a total of 122 UN resolutions involving Israel, Ukraine voted against Israel in 95 of the resolutions and abstained in 27 of them. It did not vote in favor of Israel even once.
Somebody will argue that was years ago but unfortunately Instead of teaching new generation about terrible past Ukrainian government proclaimed past Nazi collaborators as a national heroes.
Also the past is important, babi yar was 80 years ago, most survivors are still alive and thier children are all alive , to ignore what Ukraine did to us is stupid, cause they killed 150k Jews in WW2 alone, and almost a million in the 20th century Alone , we said never forget and never forgive, and we stick by our promise to our ancestors.
Oh wow your understanding of geopolitics is so low it's shocking, it's in our best interest to stay out cause Russia let's us bomb Iran in Syria and Lebanon, any support with weapons with Ukraine would make Russia help Iran with the nukes arm our other enemies and to attack Israeli citizens with terrorist proxyies like hamas and Hezbollah , as stated by Putin himself. Maybe other countries should stick their neck out instead of a small country with 9 Million people seruonded by enemies.
I'm not rude I'm honest and I'm stating facts . your not Israeli , you don't know the risks we run into if we support Ukraine. You know nothing about the geopolitical map in the mena region and it's clearly not Israel's interest to help Ukraine, it's the us and Ukraines intrest.
Israel is already massively helping Ukraine by fighting Iran, and Israel is currently Iran's 1 enemy.
If Russia is broken in Ukraine they could lose their ability to prop up the anti Israel regime in Syria nor could they increase cooperation with Iran.
If Russia crumbles and fall, Iran would lose its biggest and most important ally (Putin might be overthrown) This could lead to free reigns in the region for Israel to confront Iran and their proxies without needing to cooperate with Russia. Russia helping to prop up Syria and Iran who both are anti Israel is not in Israels interest.
Its in Israels interest to strenghten Iran by allowing their alliance with Russia to solidify even more?
Is it delusional to think a strong Iran with alot stronger backing from Russia would be bad for Israel?
And i still feel breaking Russia would weaken Israels enemies while giving Israel a more free hand to defend their interests in their neighbourhood.
What Israel would gain in aligning with the west against Russia is increased unity and goodwill, and Israel has been losing goodwill internationally for a long time (deserved or not).
If Russia is broken as a power they will cease to be a powerfactor in Israels neighbourhood and maybe if they change regime the new one would be more friendly to democracy and the west.
If Russian defeat leads to regime change this new regime could be more pro west and unable to mess in Israels backyard.
If Iran helps Russia get a win do you honestly think this wont have any effects on the current situation in Syria?
Russia is already against Israel on Syria and Iran and if Iran helps them get better terms in Ukraine, Russia would be beholden to aid Iran much more in return in Syria and elsewhere. Not to mention the chance that Putin might be desperate enough to aid Irans nuclear programme.
Russia stated openly that they would support Iran with nukes if we intervine, so by your logic we should make them absolutely on the side of Iran instead of taking the chance they help them?
If Putin gives nukes to Iran to punish Israel for sending aid this would be bad for sure, i have no problem understanding this fear (plese link this threat) But Russia giving Iran satelites and more support after the war could mean increased tensions with Israel that would only increase as they rebuild strenght.
Israel might think Russia is breaking regardless and are happy to sit aside and not incur any losses in money,equipment,relations with Russia. But why then should countries like the US continue sending funds? If Israel only cares about their own issues and could not care less about the global system post ww2?
So Israel should put itself in danger ? Russia let's us bomb Iran in Syria and Lebanon, and they will attack us and help Iran and hamas if we help Ukraine, for our own national security we have to stay natural.
Not in a way that will be dangerous to us, we have spies everywhere in Iran , and Russia is proving to be a decaying army state , meanwhile supporting Ukraine will be worse for us.
So taking a stand against the new axis of evil where Iran, Israels mortal enemy, is a central actor is not a reason to aid Ukraine? Because Ukraine hurt their feelings?
My country has nothing to gain from Ukraine, we border Russia and they are pissed at us for our support to Ukraine. And we have reccord energy prices in a country that is frozen during winter and alot of us use electricity for heating. I cant burn wood to heat my place, i have heating cables in all my floors. My eletricbill is way higher.
