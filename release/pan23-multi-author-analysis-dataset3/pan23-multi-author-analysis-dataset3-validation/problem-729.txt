Ok, so I reached out to the SBA and they informed me to submit a death certificate and evidence that the business is closed. The lady said they would just close the account and eat the debt.
I found a UC filing that designated the business assets as collateral but again, all those assets are gone.
I believe the SBA would have legal recourse against the seller and the buyer since those assets were considered collateral for the loan, evident by the UCC filing. Since your father is no longer alive, his estate may be liable.
The issue is SBA had a UCC lien on the assets. They shouldn’t have been sold without notifying the SBA. And I’m sure the SBA would have requested to loan be paid back.
Do you know what type of SBA loan it was? You say Covid related, so it could be a PPP loan or an EIDL loan. A PPP loan was meant to be forgiven, so you could probably go through the process of having it forgiven. The smaller the better (under $150k you dont have to provide documentation). If an EIDL loan, well there are some stipulations the owners needed to follow. Liquidating the company may violate some of those stipulations (owner draws were limited I believe). Not sure your legal liability, but I would start by identifying the type of loan.
