2. They are willing to have murderers in charge of their GQP cult/party which shows the true depths of their depravity as people. Church going people mind you, 99% claim to be lovers of God and Jesus but are just fine with murderers running their party/cult/country.

At this point I just assume that every Republican I know has received or paid for an abortion, and that every single one of them thinks that their situation was a special exception that others donâ€™t get to have.
And yet when proof comes out all these Republicans paid for abortion, WEIRDLY, it isnt treated the same as it would if they had really done murder.
Anti abortion laws don't make abortion illegal - they just make abortion illegal for poor people. The rich will still get their abortions and, when they make contraception illegal for the poor, they'll be able to get that, too. It's about controlling the sex life of the working class.
