The injury is unrelated to work, but my husband needed to drive me to an appointment during work hours, and they pressed him for info, and he caved. I just really wanted to know whether or not it was legal for him to sign for me, our workplace is just what prompted me to ask.
Now, in my professional life, i constantly give other Attorneys permission to sign things for me. We usually don't go through all this, because there's often an email saying "yeah that looks good you can sign it for me And they just write in SCCLBR. Super common, not illegal, a bit of a cracked shell though if i then said "i never agreed to that.
But what if you cannot sign yourself, like OP? Yes, you could use your left hand, pen in your mouth, use your feet, or even draw a picture of an Albatross Chick. But let's say you REALLY can't do any of those things, or you'd rather not sketch a quick portrait of the cutest giant flying bird (again, the albatross chick). Then you can authorize anyone else to sign for you.
What should the Signer write? Well, in Texas we'd expect to see Signer sign his name, then write in "Sam Coleridge, on behalf of Alba T. Ross." (Alba is e Breeder's name, remember that now). BUT anything that shows that an Agent is signing on behalf of a Principal is sufficient. Let's Alba, through his Agent Sam, actually signed to buy 3 Austral Storm Petrels (a much smaller seabird) instead. When Alba goes to sue, the contract needs to identify who signed on behalf of Alba. That way both parties know who the witness would be. Alba can't claim he's not bound to the contract because "Sam actually signed." We just call Sam to the stand to testify. (did you sign this? for Alba? did Alba ask you to sign for him? did you sign this for yourself? etc etc).
