Street food, ever popular in Mexico, was a huge thing in the massive markets of Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco. Sahagun describes a large amount of tortillas served with various sides, from honey, to turkey eggs, to cactus pears. Mainly though, these food stalls served tortillas and some kind of sauce that was generally made with a base of chili and some other fruits or vegetables. Something resembling modern guacamole or salsas roja or verde wouldn't be out of place in these situations (though they wouldn't have included the Eurasian onions that are now ubiquitous in Mexico). Also extremely common as a street food would have been atolli in various varieties.
There's a lot more that can be said about Aztec cuisine. If you're interested in looking at the primary sources directly you could check out Sahagun's text or sections of Bernal Diaz Del Castillo's description of the Conquest (he discusses cuisine on occasion). These aren't exactly accessible texts, however. Instead I highly recommend America's First Cuisines by Sophie D. Coe. In addition to the Aztecs she also discusses the cuisines of the Maya and Inca.
Do we know if Spanish elites/landed conquistadores adopted much of the Aztec diet, or if they were mostly eating foods they brought over?
You mention that the Aztec culinary dog breed was driven to extinction by Spanish consumption. Does this mean Spaniards happily ate dog meat when they arrived in Aztec territory? I would have expected there to be some sort of cultural holdup towards consuming dog meat.
The wealthy would have eaten more meat than common people just like in other parts of the world at the time. Our best source for this, and most features of Aztec society, is Bernardino de Sahag√∫n's Florentine Codex (its modern name). He describes various foods that the wealthy ate, as well as quasi-recipes and lists of ingredients prepared for banquets. Basically, wealthy people would still primarily have eaten a corn-based diet, though in a wider variety. Instead of mainly consuming gruel or one kind of tortilla, they would eat many kinds of tortillas of different sizes, colors, and thickness. Tamales were also served in a similar variety, though they would also have a large variety of fillings.
Worthy of quoting is Sahagun's splendid description of the street food available in marktes, based on tamales and tortillas:
Sahagun describes many kinds of tortillas being "filled" before serving. This could mean the tortillas were folded, that something was actually baked inside the tortilla (like the modern panucho), that something was cooked on top of it, etc. Most often they were probably eaten like they are today, a combination of utensils and plate. Things could and would be served on top of them, but pieces would also be torn off to dip into things.
