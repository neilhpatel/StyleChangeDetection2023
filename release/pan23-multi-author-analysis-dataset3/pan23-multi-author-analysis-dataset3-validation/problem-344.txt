Usually, a protective order will restrict contact via distance as well as include the residence and workplace locations. If he's on the lease or otherwise deemed a tenant, the protective order would prevail requiring him to leave.
Who is the landlord and who is the tenant is going to be determined by their lease. i don't think you say whose names are on it. Though he wouldn't be a squatter anyway.
I wish there was something we could tell you to do to save your sister. I really, really do. I think the best I can do is "Keep the lines of communication open with her. be supportive and loving, even if you think she's making the wrong decision. It's vital that she sees you as a person who loves her and will always be supporting and a safe place for her.".
True. That's what I figured. She told me she wants her apartment back, and so she said that I should therefore "evict her" to comply with his weird demands and I was like - heck no. I'm not doing that when I am happy to have her here, but also confused about WHY she wouldn't just call the police?? She has the right to that apartment too, as you said. But she doesn't want him to go to jail, and she wants her apartment back. So yea - I agree. This man is full of hot air and doesn't have any concern over what evil things he did leading up to this point. She is not safe going back there... Wish she would stop listening to him.
Yes - It is incredibly terrifying. I think she has gone to see him a few times and it is crushing because I don't want anything to happen to her. I am scared of what he will do if he feels as hopeless as he SHOULD feel if he ever feels the consequences of nearly murdering my little sister... Trying to stay supportive of her and her decisions has been emotionally draining for everyone involved.
Thank you. They are both on the lease, and she pays, uhm, more consistently(?) than he does. It has always been a struggle for them to keep up with their bills, and I am trying to help as much as I can. It has been my opinion that she should get out of the lease. That doesn't seem to be something she wants to do, but with her husband throwing his weight around now, she seems think he is correct in saying that I must "evict" her in order for her to be entitled to the place where she pays rent.
That is not something I will do, both because it is unnecessary (I am happy to have her here - safer, and she doesn't pay for anything), but also because he seems to think he is entitled to an eviction notice despite that being just as much her place as it is his.
