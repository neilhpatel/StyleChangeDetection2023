They're not a political movement. They're PACs set up to duplicate the work of official government organizations and employees, but with greater political and fundraising flexibility. And yes, those are shadow organizations. It's not stigmatizing. It's just the definition of a shadow.
This article is using the correct terminology to describe organizations that are going to duplicate the work of and take cues from the "war rooms" in the White House. What do you call it when you're following someone around and trying to do what they do? You're shadowing them.
Yah, a political action committee. Not a political movement committee. Some political movements have PACs. There's no political movement in setting up war room PACs lmao. The purpose of these organizations is to counter Republican investigations. That's not a political movement. It is political action, though.
That's a well known term in political science though? A "shadow government" or "shadow cabinet" is expressly a phenomenon in parliamentary systems and it being adapted for American federalism isn't evil.
When folks say "shadow" they usually mean it has some sort of less legitimacy, or is an unofficial mirror of the government in structure and function. Neither of those things are true in this case. This is absolutely a garbage title of an article.
