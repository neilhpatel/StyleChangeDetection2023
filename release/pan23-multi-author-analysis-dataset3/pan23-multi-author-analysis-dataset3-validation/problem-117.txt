The good news for you is that while there is an eviction moratorium, there is no rent moratorium. They owe you rent for every month they live there, and you will easily win a lawsuit for that amount. Assuming they have assets, you should be able to collect. It will take some time after the moratorium ends, but you should be able to recover your money eventually.
Next time moratorium is only for non payment. It doesn’t prevent eviction for other reasons such as damages or repeated lease violations. I hope you’ve given her notice of lease violation for not putting utilities in her name. In most states, a certain number of the same violation in a defined period of time is grounds for eviction. In my state, 2 identical lease violations in a 6 month period is sufficient.
NAL. I’m a licensed property manager and broker in the state of Montana. I’ve done dozens of eviction through the years and some during Covid. This is not direct legal advice, just what I think is correct. Consult an attorney.
Consult an attorney. Yes, turning off electric or doing anything to disrupt utilities is illegal in most states. I don’t know where you are so I couldn’t say. Another commenter brought up that it is likely implied in your lease that you supply utilities one way or another, this is common.
Lawyer here, specifically one that does a lot of tenant work, but not your lawyer. While I am a tenant lawyer, I know how difficult tenants can be and the impact this past year has had on landlords. That being said, my conscious is clean to tell you...
