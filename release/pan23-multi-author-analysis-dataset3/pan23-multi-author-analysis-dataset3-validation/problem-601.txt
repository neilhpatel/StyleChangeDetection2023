There's a fund specifically set up so that vaccine manufacturers can continue to produce life-saving vaccines while compensating the (statistically few) who are injured due to vaccines.
42 US Code § 300aa–22 says that no vaccine manufacturer shall be held liable for any vaccine related injury or death as long as the vaccine was properly prepared and administered. Unless the injured party can provide proof that the manufacturer was negligent or failed to provide due care during manufacture of the vaccine.
In short, it is incredibly difficult to sue vaccine manufacturers, so it simply isn't normally done.
It certainly does. While the vaccines are under emergency approval they are covered under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, which is funded differently than the VCIP. When they gain full approval and become standard vaccines that everyone is given they will then fall under the purview of the VCIP.
The National Vaccine Injury Compensation program was put in place to handle those who are injured by a vaccine. There is a process to gaining approval for compensation, but this is basically the sole remedy for damages from a vaccine.
