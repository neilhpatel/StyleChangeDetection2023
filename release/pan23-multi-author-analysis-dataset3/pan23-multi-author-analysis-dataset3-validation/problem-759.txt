Trump saying that he used his mind to declassify documents, but not tell anyone he did so would still mean the documents remain classified, especially to those that work directly in those departments.
Trump declassified those docs before leaving office, and doesn't have to prove that he even issued an order to do so because the law governing Presidential declassification doesn't say he does.
And, if Trump has actually been found to have declassified his 300+ “formerly classified” documents then where is the public exhibit of all of Trump’s 300+ Mar-A-Lago confiscated documents since, according to the Republican Party, we can now presume as declassified? Declassified documents are available to the public for viewing are they not? Also, why did Trump decide to declassify these specific 300 documents?
Remember, they claim that Trump was able to declassify his documents with nothing written down because he's the President. Biden is now the president, why was he not able to declassify all 20 of those pieces of paper the second he was in office?
BTW, Biden's current totals: 20 total documents classified, 1 document marked top secret. Currently in process of returning, searching to verify there are not more.
