And defense contractors make billions. Sale of equipment to US so more weapons can go to Ukraine, and allies that want to defend against potential aggression.
As of now, they only have SOME territory they gained when the Ukraine did not have proper weapons to defend itself. Now that the Ukraine has weapons, the Russians are loosing more and more territory. The Russian's equipment has also proven to be inferior. And Russian soldiers have proven to be inferiorly trained.
Why should Ukraine "negotiate " with Russia after Russia has proved itself to be so inferior that its military is loosing to Ukraine.
Russia has no power to negotiate now, all Russia can do is try to destroy as much as possible while Ukraine continues to regain territory. They don't care if they bomb babies and children, their tactic is only to terrorize as much as possible. I have to wonder what the Russian soldiers are thinking, they do believe they are there to defend Russia but when the target is a theater, a daycare, a hospital, etc, don't they think how does this really help with our agenda here?
The way I look at it right now this is still a war between Russia and Ukraine directly, and other countries on either side are lending background support but not directly involved although I believe Russian forces have used Belarus as a staging and launching area. But the moment Lukashenko makes any move across the Ukraine border, however slight, all bets are off and any western countries that decide they wish to cross into Ukraine to help defend it (such as Poland) are absolutely free to do so.
In any case now is the time for certain Ukraine friends to stage massive forces on the Ukraine and Belarusian border and the moment any Belarusian feet tip toe into Ukraine, the same will happen by way of Ukraine's friends. And when Russia starts gaslighting or making nuclear threats, tell Russia to shove it up its ass. And then do a flyby of the edge of the Russian border with a couple of hundred F-35s and F-16s accompanied by a few F-22s.
