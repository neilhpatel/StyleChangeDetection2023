I understand the impulse, but all you can do is ask. If he refuses, that's that. If he apologizes, that's that. In either case, you have no options to force the issue.
If you feel that you would escalate until you get the result you want, then you should not put yourself in that situation. It can end very badly for you. Any use of force, threats, or other violent behaviour could see you ejected from the bar at best, and charged criminally at worst. "He deserved it" is not a defence at this point.
If you feel that his behaviour is inappropriate - and I would agree, it was - then you can speak to the bartender and ask them to kick him out. Whether they will or not is largely a business decision. If he assaults your wife again, she can call the police, as well.
You can protect your wife from imminent harm. That means you can steps that are necessary to prevent the unwanted touching. Stepping in front of him, pushing him out of the way. Things like that are probably OK. Punching him in the face after he tries to do it is not.
Not getting blackout drunk at a bar and not assaulting people would be a good start. You have no legal right to confront this person and assault them if they wonâ€™t apologize.
