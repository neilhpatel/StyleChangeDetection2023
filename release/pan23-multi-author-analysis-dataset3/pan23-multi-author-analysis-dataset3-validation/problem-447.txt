This is silly. The Democrats are the minority without a compromise like this. The question for them is this: is it better to be in the minority with a reasonable partner whom you can govern with or be in the minority and held to the whims of Marjorie Taylor Greene and her ilk? Because if this continues and the Republicans have no other off-ramp, they will eventually cave to the far right and concede to someone like Jim Jordan as Speaker.
„Sane republican“, I’m sorry but the last 10 years have convinced me that IF there were such rare creatures they willingly followed their parties mantra and acted like cowards in the face of inhumane behavior.
No what's silly is thinking that Republicans are "reasonable" and give a single solitary fuck about Democratic concessions. The Democrats have absolutely -nothing- to gain by trying to save the Republican Party.
Any Republican that gets seated as Speaker will spend the next two years shitting on Democrats. There is zero reason for a single Democrat to cross the aisle and vote for a Republican.
And the Dems can avoid this if they partner with the GOP. But not through Speaker Jeffries because the simple fact is, compromise doesn’t mean “give us everything we want or else.”.
Instead of that, you are essentially proposing that the Democrats pass up on really good deals to hold out for a perfect deal that they just can’t get.
