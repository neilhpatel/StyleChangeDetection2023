How is it perjury? Isn’t that a term that means a lie told in court? This has nothing to do with court….
He, the seller, says he doesn’t agree with the contract we initially signed nor the appraisal value of 90k. He says his realtor says he can easily get $115 thousand dollars. He says he will not sign the addendum because he will lose 15 thousand if he does. But he knows I’m due to get my child tax credit so if I sign a contract with him signing over my entire child tax credit PLUS a few hundred extra he will sign the addendum.
Now I own the home. However, I’m providing him 2000 every month. One attorney talked to me and said it COULD be a null contract because he had us sign it under duress. But he’s not a real estate attorney and he is too busy to help us. He said ask someone who knows real estate law.
You should go talk to a real estate attorney. You likely committed perjury though, by having a side deal. Since the seller likely signed the same documents stating they have no side deal, you may be able to get out of that. But having an attorney look at what you signed (both the regular and off the record deals) is the first step.
