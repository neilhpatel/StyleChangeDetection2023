They can threaten you in all sorts of ways. But you do not have to speak to them or answer their questions. If they have a reason to prosecute you, they can arrest you. In such a case, you will often be entitled to a public defender.
The 5th amendment gives you the right to not be "compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against [yourself]".
Apparently when you're using the fifth amendment you need to tell them that you're choosing to remain silent, or else they can use it against you in court.
In addition to all the "do not speak to the police" comments here, it may be in your best interest to verbalize that you are exercising your 5th Amendment Right To Remain Silent. Can't tell you how many videos I've seen on youtube where cases were decided on the fact that a defendant remained silent, but did not inform police that they were exercising their 5th Amendment right, therefore some bullshit happened. Plead the 5th then shut up. Let them talk at you all they want, don't say a damn word.
