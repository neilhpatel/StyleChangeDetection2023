If you live together they assume he has access/ permission to drive it more than a casual friend and require them to be listed. Sometimes you specifically exclude them if for whatever reason he would raise your rates. Insurance would not cover any accident he is responsible for.
If not, then your insurance company is pretty much out of the picture, and your recourse is to sue your ex-BF for the damage he did to your car.
You can sue him for the damage he caused to your car, and for any money you have to pay the property owner.
Because you are the registered owner, you are legally liable for damages arising from the ownership and use of the car.
Because he didn't have a license, wasn't listed on your insurance, and you allowed him to drive the car, then it's likely that your insurer will not cover your liability.
In my opinion the first thing you should do is review your insurance policy and determine if it will cover the liabilities because your ex-BF was driving. The worst they can say is "no".
