Bahahaha found the corporate establishment bootlicker! If you think Pelosi is “progressive” in any way or has pushed “progressive” legislation, boy have I got a bridge to sell you.
She did and does get people to vote for progressive legislation. I suppose a better argument you could have gone with was she is unable to bring people together moreso by herself.
Funnily enough here you go acting hawty but you fail to acknowledge the OP’s actual statement - that the bills are dying in the senate… because of republicans.
I mean, a cynic would say that she only brought these bills up as political theater, knowing they wouldn’t pass the senate. They could pass anything they wanted, as popular or as progressive as you like, knowing it was destined to fail, just for the headlines.
