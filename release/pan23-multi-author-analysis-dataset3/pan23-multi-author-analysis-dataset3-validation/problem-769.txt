Facism is the dictatorial rule of a central figure, using the forcible suppression of opposition and individual interests for the perceived good of the ruling group.
No, this would be fascism as the conservative government is utilizing the power of the state to punish a company for not following the dictates of the conservative party. That is fascism not communism.
Edit: There is literally even a phrase for this, red fascism. it also looks like this term had been bastardized by America as early as the 1940s to be synonymous with communism rather than a critique of so-called communists.
I don't even think communism is a good system, but misrepresenting what it actually is does no one any favors beyond the power brokers who see left wing policy as dangerous to their wealth and control.
Communism doesn't work because the theory relies on "If a person who's better than you comes up, its your responsibility as a communist to step down and let the better person led" which never fuckin happens. While Fascism works great in theory because its "How the fuck did you let someone better than you get anywhere close to overtaking you?".
