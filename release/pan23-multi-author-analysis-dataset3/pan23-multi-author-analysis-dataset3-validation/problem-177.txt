Can you show me the source? With the phrase in Arabic or the relevant language (though I'm guessing it would be Arabic). I'm not aware of any such inscription and I'm somewhat familiar with the inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock.
It would be strange but not unheard of for Saladin to call Christians polytheists. More normally, Christians would be some version of Frank, Christian, or Infidel. But there were Muslims who called Christians polytheists due to the doctrine of the Trinity. There was also some confusion about the veneration of Saints, with some Muslims seeing this as a polytheistic practice.
Muslim accounts of the crusades frequently call European crusaders polytheists, but European accounts always call the Muslims polytheists as well. Christians didn’t quite know what to make of Islam; it wasn’t Judaism, so was it a heretical form of Christianity? If it wasn’t Christianity or Judaism, then it must be the only other form of religion they knew about, polytheistic paganism. It’s interesting to note, though, that Muslims concluded that Christians were polytheists based on Christianity’s own doctrines, while Christians believed Muslims were polytheists based on...nothing.
Frederick’s question was ironic, but yours is not, so: why did Muslims think Christians were polytheists? There were still Christian communities in the Near East, but Muslim rulers paid little attention to them and weren’t very interested in the intricacies of Christian doctrine. They were even less interested in the far-away Christians in Europe. I wrote a little bit about this in a previous question last year:
As u/Al_Mamluk noted, the story goes that Frederick II visited the Dome of the Rock in 1229, after the sultan of Egypt al-Kamil made a treaty with Frederick and agreed to return Jerusalem to him. According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi:
Christians were typically described as “People of the Book” (ahl al-Kitab), since they’re mentioned in the Qur’an and Muslims were supposed to welcome and protect them. The other People of the Book were Jews and Zoroastrians, but all of the ahl al-Kitab were also often simply described as “unbelievers” (kafirun). Christians specifically, but not Jews, were sometimes called “polytheists” (mushrikun). A mushrik is someone who commits shirk, literally “association”, i.e. associating other beings with the one true God.
