I'm not sure what you mean by "moneyed interests". If you're talking about the old German or Prussian aristocracy he was personally opposed to any political power outside his own and that of the National Socialist movement (he decreed that no members of former royal houses be given command in the Wehrmacht following the death of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia and the public show of mourning that followed in 1940), and he pointedly ignored friendly overtures from the former Kaiser in exile following Holland's capitulation.
I'll be honest: that's an excellent question to which I don't have an answer. In fact I've never thought of it. It would make sense that the Weimar Republic would have nationalized some production following the wartime economy overseen by Ludendorff and Hindenburg in some manner, and I would think that the Nazis would have privatized any such enterprise, but I don't know that they did.
Follow up question: Can you say more about the extent to which the Nazi government allowed these private enterprises to remain autonomous or exerted control over them over the course of the Nazi's reign?
The Nazis believed that private run companies were much superior to state run ones and therefore they tried to avoid state companies when possible. If they did resort to state companies, they were still interested in privatizing them if anyone was willing to take them over.
