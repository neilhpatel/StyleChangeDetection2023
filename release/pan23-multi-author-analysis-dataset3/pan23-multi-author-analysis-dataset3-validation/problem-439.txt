An adverse possession claim goes away if there is permission. Adverse possession is Open, notorious, HOSTILE, exclusive, continuous for a set period of time. Hostile means against the property owners interest (ie, no permission granted).
Anyway, adverse possession requires "open and notorious" use of the other's real property. Unintentional use of the property does not start the adverse possession clock. So I think the earliest the adverse possession could have started - if it started at all - would have been when the neighbor informed OP of the deck's extension over the property line. It's not clear to me that adverse possession actually has started regarding the rotten deck, and that the clock may not start unless and until the nice but bad neighbor rebuilds the deck with intent to trespass.
In fact, if you just send him a letter by registered post every year saying “your deck is encroaching on my land, and I am allowing your deck to be there” - you essentially reset the clock every year (thus never allowing him to claim adverse possession).
A lawyer can send him a letter telling him to remove the deck from your property with X number of days and that he is to put the property back to the condition it was in before he altered it.
It may be worth notifying your neighbor via certified return receipt that his deck is on your property and you want it removed (it would 'cloud' your title if you were to sell. I think that if you are going to make this request, you should hire a different survey company to verify the lot line in case his survey is wrong.
