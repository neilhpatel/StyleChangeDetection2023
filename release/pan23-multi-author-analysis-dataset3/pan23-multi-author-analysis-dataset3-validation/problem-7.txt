yeah Trump totally knew absolutely nothing about all those times that all his inner circle was meeting with Russians repeatedly and often including Mike Flynn dining with Putin and Jill Stein, Manafort literally working for Russians by installing ANOTHER Putin puppet in Ukraine before running Trump's campaign "for free" or all the endless Rudy Guiliani Russian ties just to name the first of probably hundreds that come to mind, shit he had Russians meeting with his fucking family in Trump Tower pre-presidency around the time Trump suddenly FORCED the GOP/RNC to drop all explicit support from Ukraine from its literal party platform, in 2016.
Quit underselling the Trump Treason when its obvious to anyone thats even remotely followed politics and history for the last few decades.
I dont believe there was direct collusion trump was aware of, but i do believe putin meddled without trump being totally knowledgable about it. Im sure he had inklings, but their relationship seems less to me like a direct collaboration, it seems like trump definitely did a bit to pacify him for a time without capitulting too much of ACTUAL consequence, aside from embarassing himself at press conferences.
Ok, so while i am vehemently against donald trump's presidency, almost as a whole, i do think there is more than meets the eye with regards to Trump/Putin relations. I don't think it was as cut and dry "trump is a putin puppet" as most folks as far left as my views tend to seem to think.
Trump was kissing his ass, for sure, but he didnt pull a chamberlain and allow annexation of land, etc etc. He just simped like an E-boy on live television. Whether you view that as being on the same level is your call.
