Yeah exactly. I’ve been in an extremely drug induced psychosis and the world is not what it seems when you’re in that shit.
Honestly it sounds like your friends drug use has triggered psychosis, specifically something known as capgras delusions. A common side effect of meth use is psychosis and she right now needs professional psychiatric intervention aside from filing for divorce.
And I must dispute “highly unlikely.” I was similarly leery, at first, thinking it was a meth induced delusional psychosis. But I’ve seen and compared enough pictures to become convinced. Even accounting for “meth face” and possible haircut/style choices, the bone structure is off. Plus OG T’s hair had always been straight, even when it was long. Whereas new guys hair is a curly mess. And while there’s a close semblance in the nose/lips, the eyes are distinctively different. And he once had a notable tooth gap, whereas this current guy does not. Tooth decay from meth use wouldn’t explain that, I don’t think.
So say she does file, doesn’t mention any of this and given there’s few to no shared assets and no children, the process is resolved fairly quickly. Divorce papers are issued. This guy isn’t T but signs them anyway. So does R. Nowhere in this process, including the agreement submitted to the court that officially dissolves their marriage, is a notary required?
