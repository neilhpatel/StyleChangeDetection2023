/u/Frigorifico has written a lenhy response here, but I think their perspective is missing several key points and is at times flat out wrong. They are essentially repeating a claim which I have seen several times, which is that the creation of "Han identity" is a sort top-down government initiative to classify people as Han, in order to create an appearance of unity.
Mark Elliott suggests a somewhat more institutional and Manchu-centric angle, where, to take the Banner case, the Qianlong Emperor saw in the Banner system a useful means of reinforcing Manchu identity and so reassigned the Han Bannermen in order to achieve this.
As you correctly point out, there is actually very little continuity between Chinese states (although there was certainly a lot of cultural continuity), and much of the sense of Han identiy was in response to foreign conquerors, especially the Qing dynasty but also the Yuan and even earlier conquerors like the Jin or the Northern Dynasties.
As both Crossley and Laura Hostetler have argued, there were Western influences on Qing colonial and imperial policy, but the main reason for the similarity was similar challenges of being Eurasian empires, rather than deliberate emulation.
As for western influence, I mean that happened before the Qing were even the Qing, because the Ming used cannons derived from Portuguese and Dutch designs, and the Qing captured, emulated and sought to counter them.
