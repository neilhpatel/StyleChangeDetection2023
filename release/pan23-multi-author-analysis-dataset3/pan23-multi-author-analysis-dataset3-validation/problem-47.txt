So, tax fraud, whether run through an LLC or not, is still tax fraud. In order to have a tax deduction it must be ordinary and necessary expenses in connection with the pursuit of income. No one "makes money" by deducting legitimate business expenses.
Owning a business allows you to deduct legitimate business expenses. Things like gas, car repairs and insurance might be deductible. So, a cab driver or truck driver can deduct those expenses. A guy selling beer Koozies on E-Bay? Nope. Time? "He writes off 40 hours a week of his work into his business" Nope.
He does have a working job on top of his business or really multiple working jobs. His business is a kind of service and product selling rolled in one.
Then my question if it's not legal for him to write off his 40 hours a week and child support. How has he been doing it for so many years? IRS just says looks good and stamps it?
No, the IRS doesn't just say "looks good and stamps it". Your friend is taking advantage of a system that relies on Taxpayer honesty and has an enforcement department that is severely underfunded and understaffed.
So your acquaintance is either exaggerating his write-offs or is due for a rude awakening. How does he make money? Does he have a job someplace or does his business actually perform some service?
