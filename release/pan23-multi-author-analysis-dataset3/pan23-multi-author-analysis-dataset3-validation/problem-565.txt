And if a Democrat does respond to one of these subpoenas walk out after 60 minutes of questions. Hillary Clinton was very foolish to let herself be questioned for over ten hours. Don’t play GOP games. When the questions become silly and conspiracy inspired get up and walk out.
Yes, she did look weak as portrayed in right wing media. The purpose of these GOP performance hearings is to make Democrats like Hillary Clinton look bad. Hillary and Bill Clinton have been subjected to a campaign by the right wing since the 90s to portray them as corrupt and evil. You can deny it all you want but right wing media has been very effective in characterizing Democrats as weak. There is currently a very persistent campaign in right wing media to make Joe Biden look weak, evil and dumb.
Then they will run one of those scummy campaigns where its Biden vs Biden on the ballot to confuse voters.
Consider, for a moment, that if Republicans had something on Biden, they would have used it already.
That’s funny because I actually see this as a strenh for Biden. He’s not going to let fucking Kevin McCarthy put the screws to his boy for two years.
1. Look at the clown leading the charge. McCarthy thinks this bullshit is going to work because his Benghazi bullshit worked. Well this isn’t 2013 dipshit and Hunter Biden is no where near the polarizing political target Hillary Clinton was….
Nope. House Republicans are going to pay a political price for this shitshow. The Biden Administration was discussing this exact topic three months ago. That tells me they’re ready to deal with this.
