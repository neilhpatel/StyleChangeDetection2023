If you've suffered some specific tangible loss from the mold, you might speak with a lawyer about recovering that loss.
Surely you both want an end to this tenancy. It sounds like you should discuss the terms of that end. In most situations and under most leases, landlord can probably end your tenancy by claiming the property is uninhabitable as is (that sounds like your test results).
The law says that landlords in Texas have a duty to remove conditions that “materially affect the physical health or safety of an ordinary tenant” if all of the following are true:
1. The mold was caused by a plumbing leak behind a wall - know way of knowing until the drywall got wet.
The condition was not caused by the tenant (renter), the tenant’s family, or the tenant's guests; and.
The tenant is not delinquent in rent at the time of giving the landlord notice to repair or remedy.
The landlord is obligated to repair the leak and any damage. The landlord is not necessarily required to do anything about the mold. The leak is fixed, so some water and bleach should kill off any mold or mildew remaining.
There is currently no federal law covering a landlord's responsibilities when it comes to mold. Also, Texas doesn’t have any laws that specifically address a landlord’s duties or liability when it comes to mold prevention and remediation.
