It is sometimes important to have representation in history, though, so in that case, it does matter. Like for those who try to claim such and such gender/sexuality is a modern invention, having historical examples helps shush them.
To start broadly: European historians need to be aware of many issues when discussing sexuality in pre-modern contexts. The first is that, at least in a Western context, gayness as a property of a person rather than an action they undertake is a modern (with origins in the 19th century) concept. There's also the reality that same-gender friendships in the pre-modern era could be, by our considerations, quite effusive even when we feel confident they are completely platonic. A third consideration is that, as same-gender sex was considered shameful at best and evil at worst in early modern Europe, we cannot entirely rely on outside sources because their biases about the figure in question could easily lead them to make or refrain from making accusations of same-gender sexual activity; similarly, we cannot rely on even private letters by the alleged because they would have sought to avoid incriminating themselves.
King James VI/I (henceforth James I) gets into the thick of these issues. To briefly summarize the historical record, he was very close with at least three men: the Duke of Lennox, Robert Carr, and, most famously, the Duke of Buckingham. These relationships were remarked for their closeness by observers and were lenhy in nature. A hidden passage between the bedrooms of the King and the Duke of Buckingham have been uncovered. He was also, frankly, quite "soft", anti-war, intellectual, nervous, and reserved—stereotypes about "gay" behavior that have transcended many changes to gender roles over the centuries.
To sum up: declaring a historical figure as straight or gayqueer can easily be presentist, typically requires leaps of faith with little concrete evidence, and often lies within the context of complicated historiography. We recognize today that it is improper to declare someone "gay" without them outing themselves or, at least, concrete evidence to the fact—when speaking about people who cannot speak for themselves, we must be doubly careful not to claim more than the evidence available provides.
This impression does not reflect how most current historians view sexuality, and indeed goes to the idea that's shown in the original post: that historians go out of their way to declare everyone "straight until proven otherwise". If this impression is gained in the modern day from actual interactions with historians, rather than from memes, it's probably most often gained from historians simply refusing to declare someone queer when some feel they "should". There's some rhetorical and even emotional value, certainly, in declaring historical figures queer after so long of that being outright denied, but I do not think that acting beyond evidence is the correct answer to acting beyond evidence.
Noting, then, that there’s A LOT more queer about history than people normally think, I conclude by suggesting that part of our role - if we take the job ethically - is to actually do justice for everything in the past that we consider. This means connecting with it, respecting it for what it is/does, and carrying those resonances forward in what we write. We have to do a good job of registering the queerness of the past in its own queer terms. That may mean being willing to see connections where there appear to be gaps (could they have been LGBTQ+?) OR being willing to let go of our own perspectives and vocabulary to better understand theirs. That process is important for treating the people of the past with the dignity they merit; not being willing to engage in it (whether out of a refusal to see the queerness OR an insistence that we find a genealogy for queers today) is the real act of erasure, since it opts to overwrite the individuals’ own voices, perspectives, and contexts rather than illuminate them.
From the LGBT+ side: In effect, the impression oftentimes is that historians will only "allow" a historical figure to be declared gay or otherwise non-straight if there's that "concrete evidence", while stating a historical figure was heterosexual (or, rather, not stating they weren't heterosexual - the base, underspecified, societal assumption) is not held to the same standard of rigour. As you mention, concrete evidence of LGB identity is often scarce, for multiple reasons, whereas "evidence of heterosexuality" can often be taken to just be "they had a child", which, looking at LGB people existing today, is not really proof someone is straight.
