I edited it from my original sentence of "your second employer is likely screwing you on taxes." I agree, it's unlikely he's a proper 1099 independent contractor.
Hmm, it's still not real likely that you're a 1099 independent contractor as opposed to a W2 employee, but it's not impossible. Do you invoice for your hours worked, because a 1099 contractor doesn't recipient paychecks or pay stubs? Who sets your hours? Do you buy your own tooling and get to deduct for it? Do you pay to use their machines and get to deduct for it? If your answer no to those questions it points to your being improperly classified as an independent contractor and your employer talking advantage of you tax wise.
One question: unless you own your own machines and are doing this work in your own shop, setting your own hours, how are you a contractor and not an employee? It's possible your second employer is screwing you on taxes.
The second employer is just paying me for my time, there are no benefits. You could say I set my own time as I don't work every day. I'm still waiting on my first paystub, but from what I understand, I am responsible for deducting my own taxes. There's about a million more members here than on tax advice so I was hoping a broader reach might help.
