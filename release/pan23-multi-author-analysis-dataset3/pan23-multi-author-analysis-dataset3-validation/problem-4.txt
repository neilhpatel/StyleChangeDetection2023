As I understand it, the past week Russia has been stepping up it's offensives on Ukraine's defensive lines with their expendable new recruits. The goal seems to be to make one or more breakthroughs to force Ukraine to have to commit its reserves to stabilise their front line. Russia would then start their major offensive further north while much of the Ukrainian reserves are tied up and unable to respond effectively. So far it doesn't seem to be working as Ukrainian defensive lines have held, or they are being smart and withdrawing to more effective defensive positions.
If Ukraine sets good defensive positions, fallback lines, and detailed plans don't think this russian offensive will manage a full breakthrough. The most important thing is anti tank weaponry. Javelins, NLAWs, Stugnas, RPGs, etc. Losing 15 tanks a days sums up 1800 tanks in 4 months. And it may well be a conservative number for a big offensive.
A general russian offensive with no air support will likely fail to achieve meaningful objetives. The defense in Vuhledar was prepared by ukrianian special operations forces and it has been a total disaster for Russia. In the north they could have better conditions for good attacks but i'm sure Ukraine has prepared for it. And, with Wagner diminishing capabilities to hire and reinforce infantry things could get nasty. Don't know, the Russians made their preparations as well but it seems like this is a rushed offensive to get some sort of advance this month before the war hits the one year mark.
Can we just admire how brazenly stupid it is that everyone knows Russia is going to launch a new offensive, where it will be and when? This is how you get massive casualties in modern warfare, where in democratic countries this would call for leaderships head. Then again, I guess all the Russian command deaths takes away any strategic common sense for them.
Given the terrible performance of the Russian High Command, it should be unsurprising that the Russians seem unaware of this concept:
