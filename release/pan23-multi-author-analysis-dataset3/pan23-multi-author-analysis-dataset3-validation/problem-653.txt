Russia has already lost, Putin is just murdering his own people at this point. Ukraine will not give in. More and more advanced weapons will keep flowing in.
They should get all the weapons they need. Ukraine never asked for this war. But the brave courageous people of Ukraine have stood up to Dictator Putin so please give them what they need.
Giving all that money for Ukraine Is good for the fight against Russian Imperialism. Something that could help america's allies and america Itaelf In the future. For you populists anything that inolves us aid is evil. You are out of touch with the modern world. Ukraine's far right parties got only 2.5% of the vote, Ukraine Is one of the least antisemitic countries in Europe, most of Azov is dead and they needed them out of desperation and most of Azov weren't nazis anyway. Blah blah blah. We pro Ukrainians have to say stuff like this over and over again because you anti Ukrainians keep forgetting It.
You don't think Russia could have just annihilated Ukraine by now? That's not their goal, despite what you've been told.
It's like you've lived in a cave for the passed 20 Yeats and have learned nothing from our foreign policy blunders.
This is how to look at it, French Canadians start being and killing English speaking Canadians and encroaching on the US border, so the United States invades Canada to stop the French.
