For sure. Someone is getting scammed but I don't see how it would work or why the items would be shipped to my house which means they have my information as well....
You can RTS the items back to the vendor, or contact your local Postal Inspector to report the possible fraud.
If it's a stolen card scam, they are ordering these items and hoping they can grab them off your porch or out of your mailbox before you notice.
When a customer receives a package they didn't order, it may be a result of a scam sometimes called "brushing." "Brushing" scams occur when bad actors send packages to publically available names and addresses.
If you receive a package that you didn't order, check with friends and family or contact Customer Service to confirm it's not a gift to you.
You can report the package to Customer Service, and they may ask you for a photo of the shipping label on the package. Amazon investigates reports of "brushing" and will take action on bad actors that violate our policies, including suspending or removing selling privileges, withholding payments, and working with law enforcement.
