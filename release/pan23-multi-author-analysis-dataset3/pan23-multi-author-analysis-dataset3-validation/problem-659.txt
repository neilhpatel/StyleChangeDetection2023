What this guy said. He’s paying you doesn’t matter if he’s skimming his IRA or savings or selling Bitcoin on Robinhood. If he’s paying you then you claim taxes.
You have to report your income on your taxes. And you will pay more in taxes since they are paying you (and employing you) illegally than if they were not.
Employers all over the country LOVE to misclassify people who should be employees as independent contractors as it saves them a ton of money on taxes, insurance, etc. And the employee pays a lot of that, but they also don't get any protections. It's so bad that the IRS even has very easy forms to submit if you believe you have been misclassified, these are forms SS-8 and 8919.
Like many states, but more so in CA than anywhere, the law assumes that anyone who works is an employee, not an independent contractor, unless you work in an exempt profession (hairstylist, attorney, dentist).
In many more lenient states, you still cannot legally be an independent contractor if your work is in the same field as the business. You are self-employed (in all states) if you are a 1099 and you have multiple clients. The IRS rules on this are clear, which apply even in states that aren't more restrictive. Any more than someone who works as a Walmart cashier. A DJ who has their own gear and travels around playing various places, that's one narrow area where someone can be an IC.
