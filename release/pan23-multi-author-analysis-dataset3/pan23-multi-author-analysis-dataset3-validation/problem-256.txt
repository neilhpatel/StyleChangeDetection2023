Fleeing abuse, with no intent to disappear for ever or deprive the abusive parent of the child permanently - is not kidnapping. AT MOST it might be custodial interference.
But - is he named on the birth certificate? If not - he has no parental rights until a judge says he does. So no kidnapping, no custodial interference - no father, no possible crime.
Is he named on the birth certificate as the father, but there are doubts he really is the father? She can include that in her request for a domestic violence protection order.
If she alleges abuse in her initial Request, the judge should issue a Temporary Restraining Order that will bar contact, attempts to determine her whereabouts, or come within 100 yards of her. She can also add on the child to the restraining order as a protected party. The TRO will last for approx 21 days and then there will be a hearing. At the hearing, the judge will make a finding or not of domestic violence and can issue a permanent restraining order for up to 5 years which can be renewed indefinitely.
