The worst part is that turnout in urban areas (the largest being Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati) decreased from 2018.
Part of the reason is because Trump wasn’t in office to piss people off, but part of it is that Ohioans are being beaten down by an undemocratic system. Some people start to wonder what the point is.
If turnout in those areas was flat or increased modestly, you’d see a very narrow race and possibly a Tim Ryan victory.
If we can overwhelmingly pass a constitutional amendment to ban partisan gerrymandering and then they do it anyway and the courts don’t stop them, do we even have a democracy anymore in Ohio?
And the thing in Florida about giving felons back their voting rights, then the legislature decided to tack on "and they have to have paid back all their court fines and fees, and if the court system doesn't know itself how much they owe then tough shit.".
Yep. Same thing happened in Florida when people voted for $15 minimum wage. Right after that the state decides to pass a law that says you can be paid half that for up to 6 months as a "training wage." The people have very little power over corrupt American government. Now not even voting seems to matter.
