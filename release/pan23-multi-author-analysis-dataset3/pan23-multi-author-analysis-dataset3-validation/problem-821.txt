...there is no written process for how to request any kind of accommodation, ESA or otherwise. And to top, it all of, it sounds like the property manager who has been assigned to the property has no clue what an ESA is...
It is becoming very apparent that neither the HoA nor the property managing company that was hired, know what they are doing. I might just go ahead with the adoption process, and if they have an issue with the dog after I get him, I'll figure it out afterward.
I already requested the information regarding policies when I found out about the apparent "no dogs" rule, and nothing that was sent to me mentions the word "dog".
If the HOA attempts to enforce a pet policy and attempts to fine you or take other action for the mere ownership of the dog, contact an attorney that works with Fair Housing issues. it may cost a few hundred bucks, but a letter from your attorney will likely end it. Of not, the attorney will help you with legal action, and will likely be able to have the association pay for your legal fees (depending on your state, I assume).
If there is some sort of restriction, send your HOA a written request for an "Accommodation for my disability". In your request, advise them that your health professional has directed you to obtain a therapy dog, and that you will be obtaining and housing that animal immediately. Request that they provide a written variance from any rule preventing you from maintaining that animal in your residence and in the common areas of the association.
