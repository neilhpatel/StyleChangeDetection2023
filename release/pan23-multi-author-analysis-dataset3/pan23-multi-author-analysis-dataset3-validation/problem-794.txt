The Defense Production Act specifically is for use to provide for national defense. You'll be hard pressed to justify using it to sell weapons and services to another country.
Why not just ask the pentagon to give Ukraine the long range weapons they have been asking for? Why force someone that doesn't want to be a weapons manufacturer to become a weapons manufacturer?
Same reason that the pentagon does not outright give Ukraine long range weapons. They don't want them to have that capability at this point in time. The pentagon is not run by Elon Musk so people are less outraged about it.
There is a lot to criticise Elon Musk for and I don’t deny that at all. This one doesn’t really stand up to scrutiny though. SpaceX and Starlink - under his direct command - have poured millions upon millions of resources into helping Ukraine fight this threat.
The whole spat is because the DoD is refusing to provide Starlink to Ukraine, so Ukraine has to buy it from SpaceX using the financial aid slush fund as individual customers, on SpaceX's terms.
Musk would LOVE to comply with a DPA order because then the USG would have to give SpaceX a contract for the service.
spoiler: Weaponization of DoD-provided Starlink terminals would likely not be allowed either. We added software locks to HIMARS to limit Ukraine's targets.
SpaceX is allowing it to be used for war-time communications. Their red line is apparently using Starlink to make like the drone boats and probably whatever hit Engels airbase in December 2022.
