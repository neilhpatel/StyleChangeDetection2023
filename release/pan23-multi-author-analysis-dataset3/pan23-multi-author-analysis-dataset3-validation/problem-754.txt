But if you're not in Athens, then are you out of luck? Probably not. Greek writers were able to export their plays across the Mediterranean, so other city-states and non-Greek nations could read and perform these texts. Chris Dearden notes, for example, that the plays of Epicharmus (a late 6th/early 5th century dramatist) were performed in Syracuse throughout the fifth century, and works by the Athenian playwright Euripides were being performed in Sicily toward the end of the century. It seems likely that local troupes performed these plays, rather than exporting actors with the plays, though it does seem that Athenian actors did occasionally travel to and perform at other city-states. They also wound up writing some of their own plays. Plato tells us that in Sicily and Southern Italy, theatre was used in competition similar to in Athens.
Did the Athenians pioneer the conventions of theater in the classical world? It seems like all the famous Greek playwrights Euripides/Sophocles/Aeschylus/Aristophanes are from Athens as is so much information about drama in classical Greece.
Around the 5th Century is the height of Greek playwriting with the authors Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles writing comedies and tragedies adapting heroic tales and legends. I love the quote describing these plays that “Naturalism was neither achieved nor desired” (Lattimore). These stories would be based on legends and heroic tales. They would never have been tolerated to be about current affairs in Greece or about recent peoples. We do have some plays about Persians and their wars but they were acceptable because they were removed from their society. By the time Euripides comes around, the chorus’ role has been minimized and even disregarded in places.
