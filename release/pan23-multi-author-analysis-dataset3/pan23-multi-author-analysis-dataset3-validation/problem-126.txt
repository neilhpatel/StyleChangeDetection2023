meh, it is what it is. People seemingly forgot that Brazil imports 80% of its fertilizers, and Russia is the no.1 provider. No Brazilian government, regardless of who won the election, will completely burn ties with Russia because they are an important and profitable trade partner. We could have elected Tebet, Cirio, Bolsonaro, etc. and they'd all be equally hesitant to go full "Fuck you Putin".
Jokes aside, also yes, Lula plays the same amoral and Machiavellian political game that every successful national leader has. Lula is not Cool Guy Hippy Fighting For Goodness. He's boring ole' President of Brazil, and his objective is to make Brazil stronger, and he doesn't see any benefit for Brazil in sanctioning Russia or taking a hard stance on the Ukrainian war.
It’s not really an excuse to say something so absolutely brain dead, but it’s why Brazil is tacitly siding with Russia.
Also Brazil is insanely reliant upon Russia in trade but Lula would still believe this even if they weren't.
Lula probably believes that Russia's success, at the expense of the EU-USA, is an overall benefit for the Third World of which Brazil is a part of. He's distrustful of the USA, and historically the French also like to poke Brazil over the Amazon and cause tensions over Brazilian sovereignty over the rainforest. Additionally, as a Leftist, Lula still sees the USA and Western Europe as the supporters of the Rightist Juntas which ruled much of Latin America during the Cold War.
Sure, but here is where Lula's personal feelings might come into play: He's super stoked about the whole BRICS thing and having a sort of Third Worldist (+Russia) bloc of countries which can oppose the European Union and the United States.
If the West (that the people in r/Brasil have recently decided they do not belong to, apparently - the tankie brigading there does not stop) did not collectively back Lula on a few weeks ago, you would have had a fucking coup in Brasília.
The fact Lula apparently cannot do 1+1 is unfortunately a sign that the threat to Brazilian democracy did not subside and might in fact be much worse than antecipated. The disease that created Bolsonarismo is not exclusive to the far right.
