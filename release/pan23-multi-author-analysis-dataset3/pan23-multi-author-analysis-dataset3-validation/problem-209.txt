Not even elect. Appoint. For life. It’s not dissimilar from religious deference to clergy. These folks seek to empower judges to decide what is the morally appropriate decision (in the eyes of religious conservatives only) and to be assertive in changing the legal landscape to reflect it.
If conservatives genuinely believed that the purpose of the Constitution is to empower good rule, they would also believe the inevitable consequence of that that no conservative would ever be allowed anywhere near any decision-making space.
“the central aim of the constitutional order is to promote good rule, not to ‘protect liberty’ as an end in itself” — or, in layman’s terms, that the Constitution empowers the government to pursue conservative political ends, even when those ends conflict with individual rights as most Americans understand them.".
Ah yes. The party who doesn't think that the government should be allowed to tell people to wear masks during a global pandemic and who opposes any efforts to keep pollution from negatively impacting everyone currently living on the planet and all future generations to come, now has some ideas about common good.
