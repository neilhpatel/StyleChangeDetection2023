A protest is a dialogue of the people, by the people, and for the people. For example, if you're upset at where things are headed- step outside alongside your friends, neighbors, and compatriots, bang on some pans, yell out some slogans, get some anger out, and maybe organize some next steps.
Protests can be effective as a tool of change. There are other tools in the toolbox, mind you, and the state is aware of that. Why else do you think they (the state) would attempt to quell protests using violence if there were no point to them?
The thing, the protesters having weapons probably wouldn't make this that much better since the government would just have better weapons. And those weapons do nothing without some sort of legal foundation for the protesters to grab onto.
If they are going to do that sort of thing, no only would protestors need to wear face shields or riot shields, but they would need something to fight back with.
These protestors are GOING TO HAVE to get violent. I know the vast majority of Iranian people are peaceful, and that is the issue.
