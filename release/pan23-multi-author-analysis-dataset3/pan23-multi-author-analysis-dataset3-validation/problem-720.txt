Before I proceed, I must address this point: my answer will be political because your question is inherently political. Indeed, the entire concept of Indigeneity (as we will see below) is political. There is no way around this, so I'm afraid we will have to dive head first into political argy-bargy. I will try not to bore you too much, so please bear with me. I promise it will be worth it.
As a concept, Indigeneity cannot meaningfully exist without settler colonialism. In order for a people to be Indigenous, there has to be another people who aren't indigenous, otherwise the term loses all meaning. If it simply meant living in the place your parents were born in, then most of the world would be classified as Indigenous. However, this is clearly trivial. Nothing new is revealed if we mean Indigenous in the sense stated above. We must look elsewhere, which is where settler colonialism comes in. This is a process by which a land is taken over and its native population (those who were there at the time of invasion and conquest) are expelled or exterminated, and another population is implanted to replace them. This is what has happened, and continues to happen, in the United States, Australia, Israel, and several other countries. Here, we see that what determines indigeneity is one's relationship to the land being taken, and one's place in the society constructed over this taken land. In the case of the American Indians, they are clearly losing the land, and they are clearly oppressed to the benefit of the (white) settler population. It must now be stated that "settler" does not mean that one has moved to a place (otherwise the entire human race would be settlers), but that one benefits from and partakes in the displacement of a people from the land which they once possessed. In the United States, whites established farms, businesses, etc on land stolen from the Indians. Closely related to settler colonialism is the construction of race, to which we now turn.
Unless by "settler colonialism" you mean the specific subset of colonialism you describe? But in that case it's inaccurate to say that "as a concept, Indigeneity cannot meaningfully exist without settler colonialism". It certainly exists in all those other instances of colonialism.
No, "colonist" is a better term for that. Settling somewhere is neutral, and someone who moves somewhere where nobody lived previously is also a settler.
