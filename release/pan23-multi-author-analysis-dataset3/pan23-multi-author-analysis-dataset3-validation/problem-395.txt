Military style weapons have been banned in Canada for decades. "Assault style" is a meaningless label.
Assault style? What does that even mean? How about using some sort of objective measure for starters (e.g., weapons with a capacity of Just because a rifle is black or has a pistol grip or looks scary to someone doesnâ€™t make it any more dangerous than a regular looking rifle with a wooden stock.
But they are different and the only real operational difference between a military weapon and a civilian firearm is the selective rate of fire and magazine capacity.
Is it true that pretty much any skilled gun enthusiast could take lower-velocity rifle rounds, and add extra bulk propellant to the cartridge to get the same result? Yes. It would be difficult to regulate, but no more so than any of the other stupid rules they've tried to enforce.
You can try to define why these weapons are so much more dangerous in civilian hands by all kinds of weird criteria. That the weapon "looks" military. (or you can call it an "assault rifle", as a layperson, or as a disingenuous media person), or that the weapon has a 30-rd magazine, are kind of irrelevant. The main relevant factor is how much more deadly these bullets are, than a standard bullet.
These very deadly rounds are the product of an integrated design between the weapon itself, and the ammunition. The bullet travels at a supersonic (in air) speed, but when it strikes a harder material (like flesh), the supersonic (in flesh) shockwave causes the bullet to tumble, which propagates much larger and more damaging shockwaves through the flesh, so instead of creating a smooth, small hole, the size of the bullet, it creates a large, ragged hole filled with shredded meat, and damaged tissue.
So I think it would be a very simple thing to draw the line at the velocity (and specific shape) of the bullet. If the velocity and shape are such that it causes this tumbling effect in flesh, then fucking BAN it.
