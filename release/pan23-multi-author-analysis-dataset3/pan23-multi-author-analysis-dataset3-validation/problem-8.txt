Some humans are pieces of crap, and some of the pieces of crap are in the police force, but i would hate to live in a society without a police force because none of the pieces of crap would ever be locked up.
Police need to be demilitarized and they all need to go back on physical beats in neighborhoods to interact with communities and prove they're not all monsters who don't actually want to help society.
The police come in for the scraps after the crime was committed, and most of the time don't actually do anything helpful whilst escalating the situation.
Then you keep moving up the food chain of law enforcement globally and realize they're effectively like corporate Earth where in they just say it's not their job and push it off. (Even interpol doesn't really do their job considering how many worldwide fugitives are just dicking around freely?).
Literally there is data and maps that show likelihood of areas of crime and they could be physically walking the beat, as mentioned previously, so when they saw a crime happening or about to happen they could actually prevent it from getting worse.
