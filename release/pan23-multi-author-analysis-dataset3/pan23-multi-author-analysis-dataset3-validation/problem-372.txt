Justice Clarence Thomas, in particular, has made public statements that have caused many people (myself included) to become apprehensive that he may take the position that if social media platforms moderate content in ways that he would describe as "biased", then they are operating beyond the bounds of Section 230, and should therefore lose its protections.
The case is tragic. Nohemi Gonzalez was murdered by ISIS in a 2015 terrorist attack on Paris. Her family asserts that Google’s YouTube bears some responsibility for her death, because the platform’s recommendation system promoted videos that radicalised viewers and mobilised them as terrorists. The family argues Section 230 should not shield the platform from liability for its algorithmic promotion of the videos.
Why is the liability of a platform like Youtube for hosting certain content being talked about in the same breath as the liability of the same platform for promoting that content? Those seem like two fundamentally different questions. Hosting content is something that is inherently user-generated, whereas promoting content is an active step taken by the platform. Should these not be treated as distinct legal questions rather than a single case?
