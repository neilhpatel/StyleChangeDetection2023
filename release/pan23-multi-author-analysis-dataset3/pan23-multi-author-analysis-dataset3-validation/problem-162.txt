I'm not sure what the Walmart footage would have to do with vindicating anyone. The race was on a public street around the corner from the Walmart. It's doubtful there's any footage from the Walmart of the location.
Get a lawyer, have him plead not guilty. If he was truthful and cooperative with the offices, that should be a plus for him and the prosecutor might be willing to work with him on getting the charges dropped or reduced.
(4) One downside of 50 arrests is that it will take some time for the prosecutor's office to work through all of them. This is probably not going to be solved this week. Be patient and listen to the lawyer.
(5) Although it's hard for you to see this right now, this is an excellent life lesson for your kid. 17-year-olds aren't exactly known for good decision-making. But, I'll bet that he's going to be a little more cautious with "Huh, I wonder what's going on over there.".
Sure. Yes. Of course. But how often do you throw out the receipt or not even take one if you're running into the store for just a few items. If they didn't have the receipt and would have a hard time getting the security data from Walmart which they won't provide without an inquiry at the very least from the police, this would be another way to show that they were there.
The Walmart security footage is circumstantial evidence that he wasn't there to spectate, but to shop at Walmart. While not definitive of innocence in and of itself, it's exculpatory evidence and raises reasonable doubt as to culpability.
