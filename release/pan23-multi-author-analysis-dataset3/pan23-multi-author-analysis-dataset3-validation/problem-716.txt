That’s how I know people are brain dead from throating Fox News, thinking that by giving Ukraine money and weapons, they themselves are somehow personally affected and are against sending aid.
Don’t know who ‘we’ is in this case but sending billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Ukraine to beat back the Russians seems like a great option and is indeed being done.
Oh, oh, I know, we could go in and make the Russians stop and leave Ukrainian soil, and get everyone involved in war crimes to a tribunal. And we should help the Ukrainians to use force if the Russians won't do any of that willingly and they're fighting back.
Russia won't admit defeat and even if they get kicked out of Ukraine, Putin will find a silly way to spin the result as a victory of some sort.
Think about it, did the US have to defeat the USSR in a conventional war? No, and yet the USSR, which was much more powerful and influential for its time than Russia, simply collapsed after a botched invasion (Afghanistan) and under economic pressure.
I do feel bad for any Russian civilians who are against the war and against Putin's regime, I really do and unlike many others in the west I am sure that they do exist, but there's no other way. Forcing Russia as a country into depression and preferably decades of internal fighting and instability is needed to send a message that this sort of behavior won't work and will backfire.
