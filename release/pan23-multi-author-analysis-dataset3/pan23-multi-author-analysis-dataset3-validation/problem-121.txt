Anyways though, that is digressing a little. To get back on track, as I said, this idea of Columbus being the lone beacon of truth is grounded in the Enlightenment view of the middle ages, and while it doesn't seem entirely clear that he was the absolute first person to propose it, it is generally agreed that Washinon Irving's 1828 "The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus" was the book that pushed the idea into the popular mindset. Irving's biography was a smash hit, and he was given numerous awards in recognition of the work, most notably in the circumstances membership in the Real Academia de la Historia.
It is a claim that does get mentioned, but to my knowledge (and to be sure I'm not a Columbus scholar, I'm approaching this more as someone who knows the 19th century Columbus mythos), there has never been any solid, compelling evidence produced to support it.
I'm not sure how much agreement there was among scholars regarding the circumference by 1492 in Spain, but Columbus's argument was not bizarre and probably would have seemed decently based on other calculations going back to ancient authorities.
Specifically wondering about the obvious high regard for Columbus during the time in which so many places in the Americas were named for him, which makes more sense if by then his voyage was considered maverick genius and not of a doubtful gamble that just happened to work out.
I've frequently come across the idea that this isn't nearly as true as the now popular narrative makes it out to be, because Columbus wasn't purely operating off of his navigational miscalculations in the first place.
While this doesn't actually vindicate Columbus, it does add some nuance to the idea that he just completely screwed up and only survived, much less succeeded, out of sheer dumb luck.
