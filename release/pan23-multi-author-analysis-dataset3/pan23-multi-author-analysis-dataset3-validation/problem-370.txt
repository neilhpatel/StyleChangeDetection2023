JDAMs (which are on the way) will really help them break Russia's lines. Ukraine's military has been constantly improving whereas Russia has just been falling further and further. JDAMs could be the next improvement which allows them to apply a lot more air power.
If Ukraine doesn't get better weapons, they're not going to be able to break the stalemate that has developed and Russia will have successfully stolen some land.
Ukraine should have every type of weapon and a counter to everything that Russia is attacking them with. There's no escalation if they only do what Russia does, and they'll be doing much less than that, because they'll be striking at military targets.
They've been blessed that during this time they could sit some guys in a trench formation with machine guns and have Russia order endless charges into it.
They have needed a chance to rotate some, give medical care to others, give training to the new troops, move equipment around and repair others.
This and Ukraine has said they need some time to recoup. In a year they fought back an attack on Kyiv, a massive Russian pivot in the East, and then had two monstrous offensive victories.
