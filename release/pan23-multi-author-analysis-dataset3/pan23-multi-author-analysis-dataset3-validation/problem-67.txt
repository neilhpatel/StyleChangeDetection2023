You are either a subtenant of your ex or a direct tenant of the apartment complex. Either way, since you don't have a written lease, you are a month-to-month tenant. You are entitled to 21-days written notice to vacate upon termination of your tenancy. If you are still in the unit after the notice period, your landlord can move to evict you through the courts.
If they have to take you through the eviction process, they can charge you the rent up to the eviction date, which will be based on month to month and is much more expensive. They can also charge you for some or all of the costs associated with the eviction and the costs of any utilities incurred (water, gas, electricity, etc.). You'll also have an eviction on your "record".
I believe your ex is the one that has to give you notice, and if necessary file in court to evict you. The apartment management / landlord has recourse by suing and/or evicting your ex for failing to return possession of the apartment to them (because she left an entire human being behind).
Very likely the apartment complex cannot legally take action against you, as I believe you would be considered your ex's subtenant. That does not mean they won't try. It would be wise to keep a piece of mail (ideally not junk mail) on your person or easily accessible (e.g. in your car) in case you need to attempt to prove your residence to police.
