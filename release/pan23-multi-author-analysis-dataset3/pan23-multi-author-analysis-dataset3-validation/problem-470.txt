Also, selling military hardware was always a considerable chunk of their revenue. I bet a lot of nations wont be buying their shitty soviet era weaponery.
they still will, Russia sells arms to non-Nato friendly countries that cant buy from the west.. like China, Iran, Pakistan, North Korea ETC.
Post Cold War US+western policy toward potential rivals like Russia and China is pretty ethical. We offer full economic and geopolitical cooperation, as long as they operate within the framework of international law and political borders- which happen to be favorable to us. But China was able to begin their economic colonialism in Africa, and their string of pearls and belt and road initiative, under very cooperative conditions. It only started breaking down when the CCP became a one person party and they began interfering with freedom of navigation in the Pacific. They strenhened their position greatly while we treated them as a trade partner first, and potential strategic rival second. Russia was treated in the same way, but their economy grew slowly, and their Soviet weapons stockpile just got rustier.
The current Russian regime is an enemy of humanity, including their own people who are used as cannon fodder.
Things are only going to get worse for them now that their Chechen and Wagner PMC groups are openly complaining about Russia's military cutting them off from ammo and supplies. It's going to be hard to force poor Russian men to charge into a killing field when you don't have anyone behind them threatening to torture and kill them if they don't.
Russia took from February to Dec to lose 100 thousand men in 2022. They've lost 50 thousand in the first 2 months of 2023. They're on pace to lose nearly 300 thousand men total by Christmas if they keep this pace up.
If all they have to rely on is Russian officers threatening the conscripts and enlisted men, then it likely won't be too long before they start fragging the local leadership and deserting in small groups.
