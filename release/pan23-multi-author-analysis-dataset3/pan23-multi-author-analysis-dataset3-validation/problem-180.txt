There's no law that says that you have to tell your boss that you'll also be working another job. It's how, exactly he manages to work two jobs at the same time without running afoul of any agreements he has with those employers that's going to be relevant.
It seems to leave room for the employer to say, “having another full time job means you can’t dedicate yourself to this one In the capacity we need, therefore we are going to end the working relationship with you. “.
Any agreements/contracts he has with those various employers would be relevant, and could end up with his termination from one, some, or all of those jobs, or perhaps on the wrong end of a lawsuit if such agreements/contracts are breached to that degree and provide for that level of recourse to the employer.
Current Contract says: "During the term of the employment, I will not engage in any other employment activity directly related to the business in which is the company is now involoved, nor I will engage in any other activities that conflict with my obligations to the company.".
