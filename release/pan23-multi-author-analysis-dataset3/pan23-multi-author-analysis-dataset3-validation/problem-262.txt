"In a country that has been racked by one mass shooting after another, you might be relieved to hear that Congress is finally taking action in the face of all this horrific gun violence: Four Republicans are sponsoring a bill to declare the AR-15 America’s national gun.
....Reps. Barry Moore (Ala.), Andrew S. Clyde (Ga.), Lauren Boebert (Colo.) and, of course, George Santos (N.Y.) have looked at our gun violence epidemic and said: There is something we can do. HR 1095 is excited “to declare an AR-15 style rifle chambered in a .223 Reminon round or a 5.56x45mm NATO round to be the National Gun of the United States.”".
I am not a gun person, so maybe someone else can correct me if I am wrong but the AR-15 and M4 can be just as powerful, just chamber the AR-15 in 5.56x45mm. The actual difference between the .223 round and the 5.56 round are very small, the largest difference with the firearm is that the M4 is select fire. Meaning you can switch to burst or fully automatic firing modes or something like that.
It doesnt matter what the firearm was designed for. People like firearms for all kinds of reasons, the point I was trying to make is that the firearm did not gain widespread popularity until Democrats tried to ban it.
There are two sorts of people standing in the way of actually passing gun control reforms. The people like boerbert and the people like you. I can think of no surer way to sour the public buy-in on gun control than essentially banning ownership of hunting rifles lol.
If you say a firearm is a national gun, that's going to strenhen any argument that it's so common it is exempt from regulation.
If you were trying to limit access to a specific firearm, you wouldnt intentionally draw attention to it.
