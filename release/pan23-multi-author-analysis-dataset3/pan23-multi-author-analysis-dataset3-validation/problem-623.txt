For example you want to head to the range with your AK. So you lock it in the heavy duty tool box in your truck bed. Some states that's the right thing to do. Some states it would be right ONLY if you kept the ammo in the glove box. Some states it would be a felony because it's not a "factory installed storage area".
I mean, not that the Tennessee police aren't doing a bang up job lately. I can see this being a thing when it comes to transportation in a vehicle. Every state has different and weird laws about how you have to transport firearms in a vehicle and what is considered "concealed".
Where this differs from law now is that generally, rifles, shotguns, etc. have to be stored out of reach and/or unloaded when in a vehicle, whereas a concealed (loaded) handgun is allowed.
Im not familiar with TN laws, but here in PA having a firearm loaded or capable of being loaded in a vehicle counts as concealed carry. Without a LTCF the ammunition or firearm has to be stored where the driver does not have access. With an LTCF they can be loaded, including pistol AK variants.
The bill does not mention the AK47, it changes the text of current conceal carry laws from "Handguns" to "Firearms". That is all. The comment about the AK47 was added by someone else as a way to scare people and drive up engagement.
