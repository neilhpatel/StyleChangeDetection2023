Are all samurai clans descended from the clans that lived in the Kanto plains, and they spread out over the entire archipelago as they gained lands? Or were local strongmen/nobles raised(lowered?) to samurai and adopted the military style of the samurai?
The samurai at the time had been used to over a century of Ashikaga rule. The Ashikaga shogunate was based in Muromachi, Kyoto. Ironically, they changed the seat of the shogunate from Kamakura to Kyoto for the same reason the Empire of Japan would move their capital from Kyoto to Tokyo at the end of the Boshin War. The founder, Ashikaga Takauji, had just finished putting down a corrupt administration resulting from reinstalling power to the Emperor. Power was taken from Kamakura to Kyoto. By installing the Ashikaga shogunate in Kyoto, he showed Japan that the shogunate was back where things mattered (Kyoto).
For example, in the Sengoku period, samurai were too focused fighting each other for Kyoto to even glance at Hokkaido. By that time, as a result of most wars being civil wars, the Japanese were not used to settling and preferred taking over lands that were already developed. Being sent to a land that had very few inhabitants was considered punishment. The only time of expansionism in the Azuchi-Momoya period would be when Hideyoshi unifies Japan. He turned his eyes to Joseon (Korea) and the prosperous Ming dynasty (China). The campaign ended in disaster partially because the samurai were unfamiliar with entering a foreign land. They expected the local populace to serve them, but instead they fled, causing the fields to go untended and famine to break among their ranks. After the disastrous campaign, Tokugawa Ieyasu, as the new Shogun, declared a state of isolationism for Japan. No ships were to enter or leave Japan. Expansionism would be taboo for 250 years until the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1853.
