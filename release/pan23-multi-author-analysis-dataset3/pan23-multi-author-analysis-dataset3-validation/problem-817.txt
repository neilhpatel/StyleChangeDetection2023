That seems so nuts to me.. at my place of work, it’s really difficult to fire someone for underperforming, but if they are ever caught lying it’s immediate termination. Those people must really be desperate or just have absolutely no morals.
I appreciate the perspective and that is something I will have to ponder. I'm actually a hiring manager in IT and if I caught one of my people lying, that's it, they're toast. I have absolutely zero tolerance for lies. On the other hand, we get to work with HR on setting the job posting requirements so they would never be "insane" for us.
It’s not always about morals I work in IT and it’s common for HR to put either insane requirements or stuff that isn’t even related to the job on the job posting. So if you ever want an interview for some jobs you have to either outright lie or fudge the truth on the application.
Then when you get the actual interview with the IT people you can find out what the job really requires. If you don’t lie or bend the truth you won’t ever get the interview because you won’t make it past the HR person with no clue what the job is.
