His administration's policy has been incredibly progressive with what he's pushed and how he's used his bully pulpit.
Using rose colored glasses to look at his Senate record is incredibly disingenuous when he's made some massive changes to his personal feelings on issues.
using rose colored glasses would be pretending he doesn't have a senate record. take an honest look at how he spent the overwhelming bulk of his career. DOMA, the patriot act, the crime bill, all manner of financial de-regulations, there's a vote against social progress with his name on it for just about every conceivable issue.
given biden's senate record of pretty consistently standing on the conservative side of any social or economic issue, this shouldn't even surprise the party.
he's made some massive changes to his outward stances on issues, based on what his consultants say a democratic president can get away with. for example, he was pro-hyde amendment until 2019. i highly doubt that he actually came to all these moral reckonings in the closing stage of his career, after decades of saying & voting for the opposite of what he now claims to care about.
