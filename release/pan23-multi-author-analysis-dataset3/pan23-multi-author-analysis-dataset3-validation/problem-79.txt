The therapist says by law they will not accept any communication from the landlord and that I have to be the one to submit the form.
The letter is not a problem for the landlord, they will have to have it for my apartment record. The form (that I was only ever given one page of that needed my signature) needs to be signed off on by the therapist.
Even if the therapist is correct about the law (and they may not be, all you should have to do is to authorize them to sign it in writing) just get the forms from the therapist and hand them back.
There may be something I'm missing here, sorry. The title says "landlord is refusing" but then you write the letter is not a problem, the therapist is refusing. Do you mean that the landlord won't personally hand you the documents, and that your therapist won't sign anything unless you personally hand it to the therapist? If so, this sounds more like musical chairs than anything else. With both parties being stubborn and refusing to sit when the music stops. Ask your therapist to hand you the documents, then take the documents, and hand them right back.
