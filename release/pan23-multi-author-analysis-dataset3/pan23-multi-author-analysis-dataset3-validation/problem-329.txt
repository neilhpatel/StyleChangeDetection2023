We actually dropped the insurance company after that incident as we felt they weren’t fighting for us in the case, but I’m sure they still have all of the case info on file.
Looking over the paperwork we received from our old insurance company, upon paying out the person who sued me, they stated “there is no duty to defend or indemnify you against any future lawsuit arising out of this incident.”.
Insurance adjuster here: if your claim was settled by your insurance company then it's very likely that the claimant signed a release stating they are accepting settlement as part of an agreement to release you from any future suits against you and the company.
The only thing that concerns me is that it sounds like a limited liability release only limits them from suing me and my previous insurance company, but they can go after their insurance company for an underinsured motorist claim, and then they’ll come after me.
They were my insurance, it was their job to protect me and in my opinion, they didn’t do their job during the lawsuit and instead caved, paid the max they could, and said “ you cannot sue us again.” So now I’m stuck where I am now, where I’m being sued for additional claims, because they did a limited liability release versus a general release.
Just to point out, if they sued you and your insurance paid out, their attorneys handled this, they would have done a release as part of the settlement that released you from all future claims, to not have done so would put the attorney handling the case at risk of malpractice and you going after their bar card. They are not allowed to payout policy max then point them at you for the rest, if no settlement can be reached then it goes to court and you might even have a separate council from the insurance company. Since that obviously did not happen your insurance company should be handling this. They may even have a claim against the other attorney for abuse of process for not fully researching the case and agreement prior to filing.
