He said he’d call me back next week once I’ve thought about it. What if I just called him back saying it’s not convenient for me, I’m not required, and I want nothing more to do with this?
Understood, thanks. Is there relevance that this person posts videos of themselves nude and doing sexual acts on Onlyfans and pornhub? I was aware of this already and didn’t think sending this picture to a friend would somehow get me in trouble. I’m still confused how someone who does this for a living is talking to the police about a picture of them.
There are only cons to talking to the police. Don’t go into the police station to give a statement, and don’t answer if they call again. If you’re arrested, don’t say anything besides telling them you’re exercising your right to remain silent and asking for a lawyer.
Don't talk to the police or give a written statement. Dont' answer any more questions, not even "what color is the sky?" or "who do you like in this year's Super Bowl." No questions.
Don't help them by giving them more information. "I will not answer any more questions without an attorney present". If you're charged, get a lawyer.
They may or may not have enough information to charge you with something. If they do, they will. So if they don't charge you, it generally means they do not currently have enough evidence.
