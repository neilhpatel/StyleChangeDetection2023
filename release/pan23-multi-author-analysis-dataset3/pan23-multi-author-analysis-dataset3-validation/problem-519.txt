The skull and crossbones originated with pirates, but its use has not always been accurately depicted in popular culture.
To what extent could the tradition of pirates around the world be linked to those of the Caribbean or vice versa, building off of your note about the skull and crossbones originating (possibly) with barbary pirates?
So, the skull and crossbones originated with pirates, but has often been used in popular culture without historical accuracy. Pirate ships did not sail around flying a black flag; they only unveiled their true colors when attacking. Mere possession of a pirate flag was enough to send a captain and crew to the gallows, so it would normally be kept hidden.
Only once within attacking distance would a pirate ship strike their false colours and fly their true flag. "Why fly a pirate flag at all?" I hear you ask? Intimidation! Sailors would share stories of pirate vessels, and the reputations of their captains and crews would become attached to their iconography, particularly if the crew were known to be brutal in their reprisals. Pirate flags were not to signal to other pirates, or to advertise the allegiance of the vessel. Pirate flags have one very specific audience: The crew of the ship you are actively trying to board.
