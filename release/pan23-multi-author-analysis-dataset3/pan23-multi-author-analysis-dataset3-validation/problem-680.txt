The bottom line is that while you do have the option of suing your sugar mommy for giving you a fraudulent cheque or making a fraudulent deposit in your account, odds are, you'll never find her. This kind of scam is unfortunately common, and it's very easy to do it internationally from a country with lax law enforcement.
I understand that they reversed the deposit. What I don't understand is how you ended up with a negative balance.
I don't understand why your account is so much in the negative. When you deposit a bad check, they reverse out the amount of the check and often a fee for having deposited a bad check.
For the bank to act that quickly would mean that the bank recognized that the check was fake, not that it was a legitimate check deposited under false pretenses.
I asked one of my bank reps about that over the phone and she essentially just said that “the business claimed the check was deposited falsely” or something along those lines, and that my bank had to issue them that amount of money back because of it. I was (and still am) confused about that as well.
