To pull all the above together, the key thing to get across is that while the Qing remained in power, all the events that are retrospectively framed as 'national humiliations' in which external powers unilaterally brought down a unified, unitary 'China' were nothing of the sort. The Han response to these events was to continue to assert the notion of Chinese strenh, and pin the blame on the Manchus for being uncaring rulers who allowed China to be defeated. In a sense, the 'trauma' had already existed in the form of the Manchu conquest, or rather was construed as such. Only after the ethnically-rooted revolt of 1911 did the narrative shift to the idea of China's being weakened entirely from beyond the Qing Empire, as opposed to having its always-latent strenh constrained by its own rulers.
3. Cowardly Manchu conciliators at the provincial level had an interest in trying to hamstring attempts to prosecute the war effort in full. Yao Ying, the intendant of Taiwan, had, on the orders of the court, seen to the execution of some 200 Indian and British prisoners-of-war in 1841, but would, after the war, be brought to trial when this was highlighted by the British negotiators at Nanjing. The prosecution would be led by Kiyeng (the head negotiator at Nanjing) and Iliyang (the military commissioner for Fujian appointed shortly before the executions, who had not been privy to the execution orders before they were carried out). While in this case there was no actual Manchu obstruction during the war, what seemed like a postwar exacting of revenge by the conciliators through persecuting Han heroes was taken as a sign of their ultimate disinterest in winning.
Also, I seem to remember reading internet diatribes that at the war's end Japan was broke (financially), and the reparation was many times the Japanese, government's annual income, and had the Qing just refused to surrender for another few months they would've won. How true is this?
