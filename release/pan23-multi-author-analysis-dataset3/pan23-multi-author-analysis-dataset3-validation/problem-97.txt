It is true that engagement rings constitute a special type of gift, which automatically has strings attached in some states. However, even if the ring was considered in the entirety (not just the diamond) the ring only needs to be returned if you do not get married.
It is possible that your fiancé's parents set conditions on the gift before they gave him the diamond. You'd have to ask him, as he'd know. If they didn't, then it's his, free and clear, and thus yours now that he's given it to you; if they did, then he might be on the hook to return it if the conditions are not met (or to pay to replace it, if he can't return it).
There _is_ such a thing as a "conditional gift," which can be revoked if the conditions are not met. Engagement gifts are one of the more common examples: often, engagement rings are given in the expectation that you will marry, and if you don't, the ring must be returned. However, the details vary from place to place.
OP, that does change my advice, slightly. It does sound like they set a condition: that you use the diamond for an engagement ring for your fiancée. You've met that condition, so I doubt they have any grounds to demand it back. Your intended setting boundaries with them doesn't give them the opportunity to add new conditions.
