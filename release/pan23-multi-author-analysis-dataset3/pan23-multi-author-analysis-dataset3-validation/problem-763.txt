You're far to causal with accusations of racism. Maybe this is racially motivated but maybe it's not. The point is we don't know and just assuming racism with zero evidence is ridiculous.
Or you just end up throwing around frivolous accusation and make it that much easier for actual racists to hide. If you're always accusing people, why should anyone take it seriously?
Also, after reading the quote that got her in trouble, it's incredibly ironic how she says accusing her of antisemitism is meant to derail any debate and then accuse Republicans of Islamophobia.
Well I can’t approve of them stripping someone of committee assignments for antisemitic remarks when they are enabling republicans who are literal Christian nationalists is all. It’s clear what this is to me and it’s not about antisemitism.
Politics aside, I’ll say as a Jewish person that what Omar said is antisemitic. I don’t care if you are left or right, I just don’t like that’s it’s the people who aren’t Jewish that are deciding what is and isn’t antisemitism. I find it scary that the votes are completely one side or the other based on party, not an individuals personal beliefs on the matter.
