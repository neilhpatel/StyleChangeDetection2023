To be fair and eliminate errors, I suppose two groups of people should each count the same set of ballots and compare results. If there's a mismatch in the counts, they do it again and again until they get a match. Really folks, computers were designed to do these things for us.
Remember who designs and builds the hardware and software. There could be errors or vulnerabilities; though unlikely, it's certainly possible.
Also remember, it takes an army to cause fraud on paper. It takes 1 person to cause widespread fraud in the digital world.
Computers are wonderful but, as long as software is involved there is potential for fraud. The US has decided to make many many many public positions electable and as a result, voting and counting takes a long time. The trade-off is accepting that the risk of digitizing the election is worth it. Personally I feel paper ballots are the way to go for the top tier positions from President down to state reps. Anything more granular than that can be digitized.
