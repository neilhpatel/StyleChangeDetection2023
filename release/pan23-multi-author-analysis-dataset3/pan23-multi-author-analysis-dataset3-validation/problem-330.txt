I think a united Scandinavia isn't going to happen simply because it's too late at this point. The question is more whether everyone is going to fully join the EU now. There's no reason to be making a union within a union.
The US wanted West-Germany to re-arm and what would become NATO was being floated around. The French neither liked the idea of a US led alliance, nor an independent German army, so they made their own little EU army idea.
That's kinda my point, France wants to create a united EU army, but you can bet your ass they plan on being in charge of it because no one would reasonably do otherwise. It's not a matter of not being able to play nicely with others, the British wouldn't have been the leader of the Allies, and then a significant member of NATO if it were otherwise. It's a matter of influence, military policy and practicality. The country in the EU with the most current independent foreign conflict experience is France since they still hold significant influence and interests in Northwestern Africa. Their current military policy and doctrines are one of the only ones in the EU with an allowance for foreign interference. You can bet that if a united EU army ever came into being, they would want to maintain that political and doctrinal stance.
Right, France wants to consolidate the EU countries into 1 unified military, but you can bet that their idea of how that would work is the unified EU military will use their command staff, their military equipment, and their procedures.
One could argue what would be the need of a Euro specific army if you have organisations like NATO and the UN that basically include Europe?
The EU had many good things going for it, countries who have repeatedly failed to provide credible military support in Europe wanting a unified military to satisfy defence contracts is not one of them.
The UK was against a unified EU military when it was a member as well, because not everything is progress and a bunch of countries who have failed to show leadership militarily and have essentially delegated European security to the United States combining into one still results in a situation where countries are delegating responsibility to the United States.
