You need to pursue a step-parent adoption if you want your child's biological mother's rights to be terminated.
As everyone is saying, the mother would need to voluntarily give up her parental rights, and then your wife would need to adopt the kid.
Either give your child's mother an incentive to give up her rights so that your wife can adopt your child, or anticipate leaving your wife a custody dispute.
If, somehow, you were able to pull that off, your child's legal parents would be your wife and the child's biological mother. You would have no parental rights at all.
I certainly understand, but parental rights aren't a thing you can assign. If you could "give your rights" to your wife, then step-parent adoption wouldn't be a thing.
You can indicate in your will that you want your wife to have physical custody of your child. However, although your wishes will be given weight, a court will ultimately make a decision based on what is in the best interests of your child.
In Florida, the only way you are going to be able to give up your own parental rights is to petition a court to voluntarily surrender the child for purposes of adoption. It is unlikely that a court would allow you to surrender your rights to your own wife so she could legally adopt the child.
