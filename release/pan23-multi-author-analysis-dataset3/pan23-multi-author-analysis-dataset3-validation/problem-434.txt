The first town in England that may have been thought of as a ‘capital’ was most likely Colchester. This is where the Romans had set up their main town after the invasion. Archaeologists from The Museum of London now believe that the Romans moved their capital to London after the Boudiccan revolt of 60CE. There are several theories behind why, but some of the most important ones are that it was somewhere that shipping could reach (unlike Colchester) and It was the nearest place to the sea where the Thames could be bridged. There is also the fascinating concept that, as London had not been a pre-Roman hub, it was a definite stamp on the country. London was, for want of a better expression, a ‘new build’ as opposed to an old Celtic settlement being re-used as a Roman base. This was the Romans making a statement. The capital was Roman through and through.
Winchester remained the capital until the 12th century, after the Norman invasion. Norman control of England was centred around London due to its geographical positioning (again) and wealth. The City of London was given special rights and privileges not shared by other towns, and the defensive structures and Palaces built in the area made it a fairly sensible capital for a kingdom that, at least in the eyes of the ruling classes, stretched across the channel into Northern France.
So the political capital of Norman England became 'Westminster', where King and Parliament was, which was quite a bit different from 'The City of London' in medieval times. The palace was continually used as royal residence till the Tudor era, when there was a fire nearby, which prompted Henry VIII to move to the Palace of Whitehall, also located in Westminster. Eventually they changed to Buckingham, but the two palace sites, Westminster and Whitehall became synonymous with the seat of Parliament - which was, of course, because they were palaces, and medieval parliament used to meet at the current palace of their time.
As far as I know, there really wasn't a specific piece of legislature stating so-and-so city is the capital of England in medieval times, and the capital was where the monarch chose to hold court principally. Which was where they lived, hence Westminster in medieval times. Which was also, not considered 'London', as 'London' (meaning the 'City', from the Saxon era Lundenburg), Southwark and Westminster were considered quite separate entities.
