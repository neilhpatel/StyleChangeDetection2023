I’m not concerned about us owing the deposit, I’m concerned about whether they can successfully sue our friend for it, particularly if it wasn’t mentioned in the new lease that the deposit was transferring.
If you’re signing a new lease with the tenants, make sure the security deposit amount is listed and whether it’s been already paid or not. It’ll become an issue at some point that you’ll have to figure it out - might as well figure it out now.
The lease is attached to the property. So you now owe the tenants security deposit back when they move out.
I don’t know any way that suit would be successful. The lease transfers with the house, and they haven’t moved out yet, so there’s no issue with the disposition of the deposit. If they get into court, I’m sure the first answer will be whether the old owner transferred the deposit to the new owner (you). It could get sticky if the answer is no.
You can probably stop this in it’s tracks by letting the tenants know that you, as the new landlord, have the deposit in the amount of $$ and it’s subject to the terms of the lease.
