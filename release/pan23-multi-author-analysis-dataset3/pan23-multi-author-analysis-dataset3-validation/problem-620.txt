Paul was their original choice for moving into the apartment; however we submitted an application and he was the back up. So to answer 1. Yes he had an official rental application submitted.
2. The lease says with landlords permission. They asked us to sublet the place out. Just by chance, Paul was a friend of a friend whom unbeknownst to me was originally going to live here - the landlord basically said yes to him until we applied for the apartment.
I'm not sure what "basically said yes" means, but if Paul met the landlord's rental requirements before, he probably meets the requirements now. If the landlord turns down a renter who they should approve, they break their ability to claim missing rent for your early departure.
2) Does your lease state that subletting is prohibited unless you have the landlord's written permission?
However, the landlord could claim that they should not be expected to modify the lease (by consenting to a sublet) in order to mitigate their losses.
On the other hand, the landlord has undermined this assertion by previously agreeing in writing to allow a sublet.
The sublet issue is less clear, but the landlord may already have failed to mitigate by agreeing to and then refusing the sublet.
