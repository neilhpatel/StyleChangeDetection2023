Very broadly speaking, archers were not deployed in a manner where they would be forced to shoot towards their own troops. The visual reference of archers shooting in tight volleys is not only very much ingrained in our minds due to movies, but also not practical in a real context due to limitations in communications as well as the inability for archers to hold onto their shots until they were given the command to loose. Movies also over-emphasise the high-angle volleys, which is mostly done for cinematic effect, but are also due to other practical considerations such as safety, camera angles/tricks, and due to the low power of the bows (or mechanical launchers) requiring them to be lobbed at high angles. In practical battlefield archery, while long-distance volleys were likely to have been used, much of archery was actually done in direct shooting, as this is the role in which archers are most effective due to power, penetration and accuracy.
What we can learn from this is that, ideally, archers were deployed in positions where they did not have to move, had clear line of fire on their enemy, were able to shoot directly and without harassment, and were protected by infantry. There was seldom a need to shoot over, toward or at their own line as they were not deployed in that fashion - the infantry line did not advance until the melee was inevitable and the archers withdrew and allowed the infantry to fight. The volume of arrows that the English archer formations were able to output deterred enemies from attacking them directly, causing them to be funnelled towards the infantry, which made archers more effective as they were also able to shoot into the flanks of infantry and cavalry.
While sources are sometimes ambiguous on how English archers were deployed, which also varied depending on the terrain and nature of the battle, it is generally agreed that in normal circumstances, the English archers (who could number over 5000, in an army of 7000 to 10,000) were deployed in "wings" on the flanks of the main body of dismounted men-at-arms, ideally in a raised position (such as a hill) and fighting defensively. The objective of this deployment was to funnel the enemy into the central body of footmen, given that soldiers were less inclined to march straight thousands of archers shooting at them. The archers would open the battle at long distance (exact distances are vague, but this could be 150m to over 250m), and they became very accurate and more effective when the battle closed to 50m or less, as they were now capable of using direct shooting with heavier armour-piercing arrows, sometimes shooting at cavalry as they were nearly right on top of them. When the enemy closed to engage in melee, the archers stepped back and the footmen advanced to carry the fight, leaving the archers to reposition, continue shooting at targets of opportunity at close distance, or join the melee with their swords and mallets.
Note that the original question was framed in the context of medieval English warfare, which is not representative of all forms of warfare and uses of archers in battle. While the English were known to have used cavalry in their armies, their preferred method of fighting - especially during the Hundred Years War - was to dismount their men-at-arms to fight on foot with archers on the wings to funnel the enemy into their line.
Elsewhere (and even in English battles, such as Crecy), archers were often deployed in the front to act as skirmishers to open the battle.
I'd been led to believe by games like Total War that archers would be deployed in front of the infantry while the flanks were reserved for cavalry. Is this just a common myth or was this tactic used as well?
