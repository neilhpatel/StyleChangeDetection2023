The bad news is that they hold most of the cards. Washinon State's that mandates auto insurance also allows them to ask the DOL to suspend your license if you don't pay for damages in an uninsured collision. They don't even have to sue and win; the DOL will suspend your license if they believe there is a probability that you are liable and were uninsured.
Yes. If you can show the Dept. of Licensing that you have an agreement with the injured party that they've accepted to "settle" their demands, you can get your license suspension avoided or reinstated.
Bankruptcy (specifically Chapter 7) to discharge this debt and make you eligible for reinstatement of your soon-to--be-suspended drivers license.
Because SR-22 insurance is so expensive, you should carefully consider whether you can get along in life without a private automobile, since you're very probably also going to have a suspended license for a while.
Call GEICO and ask if they will negotiate a settlement directly with you. If they won't your last option is to negotiate a settlement with the collection agency acting on GEICO's behalf.
I'm assuming settlement in this specific case means, if nothing else, working out a payment plan with either Geico or the Collection agency? I know the letter I got from the collection agency said I have til Nov. 7 to contact them so I'm just trying to figure out what I should be doing before that date since I obviously don't have many options. Additionally: If I am paying these damages on some sort of payment plan, will that potentially help me avoid having my license suspended?
