Thanks so much; this is excellent. I think you really capture the complexity of the situation. I might add that, while the early 20th century changes in women's status were largely top-down, as you point out, there was a second-wave feminist movement that took shape in the early 1960s and that is responsible for some amount of gains in the status of women, especially vis-a-vis healthcare and working conditions. I wouldn't want the activists' labors to be erased here.
A sort of tl;dr is that many Muslim-majority countries experienced a resurgence of religiosity in the late 20th century as a result of economic disappointments, cold war machinations from world powers combined, and a larger global groundswell against western imperialism.
What my larger point tries to speak to, though, is that Western powers and Muslim-majority countries were much closer together before the 1970s, and that since, many Western countries have become less religious but many Muslim-majority countries have become moreso.
Teasing things apart: First, there are a lot of Muslim-majority countries, but I think you're more interested in countries wherein Islam is the state religion. That includes formal Islamic Republics (Afghanistan, Iran, Mauritania and Pakistan) and countries not specifically named that (Iraq, Yemen, Algeria, Maldives and Bangladesh) but in praxis similar. Lots of other countries are secular but Muslim-majority, eg Azerbaijan, Gambia, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, etc. For what its worth, England, Denmark, Argentina, Costa Rica, Liechtenstein, etc. all have some form of state Christianity. Anyhow, i presume we're focusing here on Islam as state religion.
Next is the fact that education is extremely important in Islam. Even the more conservative Islamic intellectuals agreed that withholding information to Muslims is forbidden. (There are some exceptions, as always) There was a debate surrounding Greek philosophy, but as far as I know it was never outright banned or considered heretical. People who were against Greek philosophy (or European technology) would still argue against them and explain why they serve no purpose and should not be studied, but studying Greek philosophy and European technology would still be allowed. There is no comparable to the persecution of Galileo and Copernicus and there is no Index in Islamic societies.
