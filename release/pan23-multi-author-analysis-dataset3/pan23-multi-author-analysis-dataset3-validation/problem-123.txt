Typically if you consent to blood work they can run whatever test they want unless it specifically states the test to be run and only that test. They sure as hell can’t Bill you for tests that don’t pertain to the reason the blood was drawn for though. (Note: this will vary from state to state).
Example: in Colorado they often if not always test cord blood for drugs and may not mention it but it’s in the paperwork and you are not charged extra for it. The way they test blood reveals everything because a mass spectrometer shows every element in whatever sample is fed into it.
This is also why some employers use mass spectrometry for drug testing because EVERYTHING is shown, not just illicit substances. (Some jobs don’t like people abusing prescription drugs just as much as illegal ones.).
Its not relevant. But I used to do drug testing, and I was clarifying the science part cuz I was annoyed that _Bob_A_Feet_ said that employers use mass spectrometry to detect everything. There's way more to it. You need a chromatography system (ie gas chromatograpy, liquid chromatography, etc) attached to the mass spec. And yea, you can detect almost everything, but drug testing labs only look for certain ions that are used to determine the presence of a drug. The point of the mass spec is to filter out the ions you need to determine presence. Without knowing those ions for those drugs, you dont actually know what you have in thr sample you're testing and lose out on efficiency. The method used on the GCMS or LCMSMS also varies from drug to drug; one method could run a sample in 5min to detect cocaine, but take 20min to detect meth.You also need to factor in the extraction method used on the sample. There isnt a universal extraction method used to detect all drugs. So one person's sample could be split into different portions so that they can test for multiple drugs; one extracrion method could destroy the cocaine in the sample, but be used to help pull opiates. Just because a sample is postive in the preliminary test, doesnt mean it will always be postive in the confirmatory test. GCMS/LCMSMS are considered confirmatory methods, but for something to be truly postive, the result has to be above the limit of detection and limit of quantitation and the minimum thresold of what is considered postive for that drug (different drugs have different acceptance criteria).
But not LSD. Mass specs for drug testing are regularly attached to a gas chromatograph and LSD degrades in the gas chromatograph long before it even reaches the mass spec. To test for LSD, you would need a liquid chromatograph with a triple quad mass spec. However, no one tests for LSD (at least the biggist drug testing place I used to work for didnt have LSD testing available). And LC-MS/MS is stupid expensive for smaller drug testing companies. LC-MS/MS is slowly becoming more common, however the R&D aspect of figuring out a rugged method for sample extraction and to have it work on LC-MS/MS is hard and time consuming, and it has to meet certain requirements before production use. There are advantages and disasvantages of GCMS vs LCMSMS. But yea...LSD is the exception from what Ive seen.
