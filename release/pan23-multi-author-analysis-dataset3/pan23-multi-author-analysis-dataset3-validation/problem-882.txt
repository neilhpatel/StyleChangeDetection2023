I am just amazed at how he thought that this was a good idea to publicly announce this. This does not help his case at all. It just shows to the party that he really has no interests in fighting for the cause of his party (Given the fact that we know that they currently don't have any). It just really speak from a leadership perspective on how to address situations, crisis, or even meeting demands for funding.
If you can't rally your members to vote for you to take the speaker of the house, then you are going have a hard time negotiating with your members and the democrats.
So, to the holdouts case, they can either have no power under the GOP, or no power under a Dem leader who will not have a majority to pass anything and they can deflect onto him being unable to get things done.
So... not saying that the House Republicans are alpha strategists, but what if they are willing to let Jeffries be the Speaker just so that the GOP, who are still in the majority, can clog everything up and blame the Democrats for all of the stalemates?
Republicans acting surprised that the people who didn't care if the government shut down or we defaulted in our debt as long as they got a political win don't give a fuck if the mainstream republicans lose as long as they collect a win is hillarious.
