Yeah, take a copy of your copy of the contract, hand them it and say “this is the contract we signed”, and leave. Hell, I’d just be mailing it to them.
You have a signed contract, you have absolutely no reason to sign a new one unless it is more favorable to you than the current one.
I would just make a payment of the original agreed amount on your contract for the month and you're covered because its on your contract. Don't expect them to do you any favors and be lenient because of contract issues. Make your payment anyway.
Do not pay cash. Hard stop. That sounds shady. Any business should accept a bank cut check. It is the same as cash.
You said elsewhere that they only accept cash at the office. You have two options: come in and pay the amount you agreed to, and if they refuse, have them write it down that they refuse. (Optionally, if they refuse that, take out your phone and record yourself trying to pay). Or... just use your bank's bill pay to send the payment to their office.
Send the payment amount on your contract. You can typically get a bank check for an extra dollar and they draw the money and write the check from the bank itself.
