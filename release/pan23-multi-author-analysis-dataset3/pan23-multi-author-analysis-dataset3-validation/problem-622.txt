NAL, I am not a lawyer but they can’t charge you for company assets. You are essentially paying the car note when it will never be yours. My husband is a mechanic and he is required to have his own tools to work on vehicles but at the end of the day they are his tools. If he quits they go with him. They are stealing from you.
Your brother and brother-in-law are stealing from you. When you were using your own truck for work, you should have been reimbursed for the company miles you drove. Most companies that reimburse mileage require employees to keep a log book of all the journeys they take, e.g. my company reimburses sales reps for their mileage, but they have to keep a log of times, dates, odometer readings and names of clients/prospects visited.
The department of labor in your state and; if there are enough employees, the federal department of labor; would be very interested. If you file a complaint, be aware that your relationship with these two thieves will be difficult to say the least.
In terms of company vehicles, the employee cannot be charged for operating those. Some companies will allow employees to use the vehicles for personal use, but they typically have rules about that, not least of which is end each day with a full tank of fuel, and start it the same way (or sometimes just work weeks, given not many people rack up a lot of miles after work on a weekday).
No technically they typed up a policy sheet we all had to sign saying the trucks weren’t for personal use and could only be used for work but they understand we do use them on occasion for personal use but he does not have us keep track of personal miles and charge us based on those miles which I would be fine with. I clean pools and get paid per pool he takes $3 for every pool I do (which is about $650 to $740 a month depending on time of the year) for the company truck and instead of documenting that pay loss being for the truck he just makes it look like I get paid $3 less a pool for no reason.
