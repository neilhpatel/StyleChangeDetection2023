To answer your actual question, earlier fairy tales were not for children. The "fairy tales is only for children" is a recent thing.
There are no "original version" of most fairy tales. In norwegian we have a useful distinction: folkeeventyr og kunsteventyr. More or less folk-tales and constructed tales. Most famous fairy tales are folk tales. Passed down orally for hundreds of generations and changed slowly to fit in the current cultural context. Asbjørnsen and Moe, Brothers Grim, and many others travelled their country, collected and wrote down the tales they heard. Because they were written down they stayed constant, and are still in the same form they were in the early 1800s, and we see them as "original" because of that. Disneys stories are actually keeping with traditions, because they took fairy tales and put them in a form that would fit their current time.
These literary fairytales were inspired by folk oral tradition, but they were the product of single authors and did not adhere to the "rules" or the genres of folklore. Literary fairytales took many forms, but again, because of they were literature, they could end horribly and yet still seem like a folktale.
Disney did borrow stories from collections of actual folk tradition and from these authors who were writing their own "fairytales": "Snow White," "Cinderella," and "Sleeping Beauty" - the original "big three" - were each taken from oral folktales, and as such, the original stories ended happily. They were, as indicated, stories told for adults, and they were, as such, occasionally violent and had elements not appropriate for children. The various collectors (Perrault and the Brothers Grimm, for example) tended to "cleanse" and shorten the tales for publication, in part as a process of recording the stories before electronic recording machines, but also because they pitched these book for children. This began the process of perceiving the folktale/Märchen/folkeeventyr as intended for children - even though this was not the case.
Folklore - the actual oral tradition of the folk - assume many genres. In addition, folklore has inspired a literary tradition that seems like folklore, but is distinct from oral tradition.
