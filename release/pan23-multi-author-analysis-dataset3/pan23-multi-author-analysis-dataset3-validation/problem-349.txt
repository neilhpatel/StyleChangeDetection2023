If they wanted to not have Biden as President they should have impeached Trump and run a guy 30 years younger.
Unless it applies to all lawmakers across the board regardless of age it should not apply to Biden. You don't get to arbitrarily make up new rules because Biden stutters, which is precisely what you are doing.
Look at you pushing the "both sides" bullshit as hard as possible. Let me remind you that Reagaon's Alzheimer's was an open secret and there's been zero movement to prevent the next Reagan from the conservatives. They enshrine the old loon like a saint.
and yet you still cast judgement like it's a monolith. When everyone takes a uniform, fairly administered and evaluated competency exam we can demand one for whoever the current president is but until then people demanding it of biden are just pumping up fascist rhetoric. That's all this story does. That's all you're doing.
That's not a thing. Sorry but the fascists aren't making up new rules for non fascist leaders. This is the part in the story where right wing fascists tell us "some pigs (theirs) are more equal than others".
But the reason I ultimately disagree with you (despite your juking to the contrary) is there is no way to make it fair in the currently political climate and thus the only reason to argue this now is to attack Biden because he stutters.
