Everybody knows t was the leader of the senate that orchestrated the coup and seizure of power for the empire. The only difference is that in star wars his name was Senator Palatine and in America his name is Senator McConnell.
Naw it came off in a negative way. Like making the claim by the original gen z appears blatantly manufactured. It gives a subconsciously negative overall vibe. Besides the fact that even with such a minimal turnout that your number presents it still was a significant increase from most election years when it comes to that age bracket getting involved and voting.
And I think there may also be other tactics, like closing polling locations that get done on the district level, often leading to much longer lines and making it much more of a hassle to vote in urban areas, leading to lower turnout.
Look… it’s partly true what you’re saying but, you’re overlooking the gerrymandering, making it an uphill battle or disenfranchising people to where their democratic votes no longer count.
You're correct that it doesn't directly affect state-wide races but it does let them micro-control other voter suppression tactics since they do it district by district.
