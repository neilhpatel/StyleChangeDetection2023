Uhh, yes he did lmao. Documents exist regarding his direct order of the Final Solution from various sources amongst his line of command.
You can’t charge Bolsanaro with genocide if there’s no evidence of Bolsanaro setting up an actual system. Hateful speech or comments isn’t genocide under the convention, you need actual evidence of the act being perpetrated by the individual or incitement of it. Unless Bolsanaro was explicitly directing individuals to commit it, then you’re dead in the water on any legal angle.
But regardless, you’re not refuting my point. Hitler wasn’t indicted as an aggressor of genocide based on comments about the Jews, many of which were far more aggressive than this, he was indicted because he had a system that collectively committed genocide underneath him and evidence he had overseen it.
Hitler didn’t personally act out the holocaust, in fact there is no evidence he actually ordered it directly. But since he was in charge of the regime that did it and he made statements encouraging it, we hold him responsible.
