I'm not sure Russia knows Russia's endgame anymore. Their original plan failed and they're now stuck in a much different war than they had anticipated.
Their goal now may simply be to save face by not losing, weakening and destabilizing Ukraine, demonstrating Russia's ability to project military power on it's neighbors, and having some Ukrainian territory to show for it all in the end.
At this point they have realized they're likely not taking it, ever, and their best hope of keeping any of the land (and keeping Putin from falling out of a window) is to pressure Ukraine to accept some unfavorable peace deal in exchange for an end of the destruction.
It's really hard to be selfish and complain about energy prices when you see Ukraine standing up to Russia despite the terror, and I don't see support for Ukraine in the West (at least within Europe) wavering either.
They don't really have the means to strike that far into Russia because they don't have long range missiles just yet and they probably won't get any because western countries don't want Ukraine to strike into Russia. Ukraine could lose this war if they don't get long range missiles to strike into Russian territory to destroy bombers, critical infrastructure, etc.
If the Ukrainians can keep supplied then the Russians will most likely run out of munitions and soldiers to throw at them and Ukraine will push them back. But if Ukraine cannot keep up with the supplies then the sheer amount of Russians coming will overwhelm them at great cost. But putin would be fine with that as long as he gets the land. It would truly be the Zap Brannigan tactic but it may honestly work.
It's really hard to say whether putin will accept a minor victory, just keeping the land he has now. But its definitely the case that he wants to punish Ukraine for defying him and hurting his image even if he doesn't end up taking the territory. If putin keeps any territory then you should fully expect the genocide of any Ukrainians left on that territory. It's already started with forcefully drafting Ukrainians to fight on the front lines, kidnapping children, and executing dissidents and whole villages.
I don't disagree with you there. I think it'll come to the next big assault when putin unleashes the 200000 he's training on Ukraine. I imagine it'll be a more bloody and brutal version of the initial invasion. If it fails though I don't see them winning with any future assault. Or maybe not. I'm only speculating and I don't imagine myself as very knowledgeable about military tactics. I just hope putin doesn't win and Ukraine can liberate itself.
