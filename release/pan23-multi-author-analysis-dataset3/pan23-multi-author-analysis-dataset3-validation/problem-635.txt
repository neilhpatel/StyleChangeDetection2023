I appreciate your help! What confused me is the dad who is on the birth certificate and signed the affidavit of parentage is not disputing being the father. Moreover, the mother initially said she had an at-home DNA test done on dad 1 at the hospital to prove he was the father- no one actually saw these results. It wasn't until she signed over rights this week (instead of going to trial) that she went to mystery dad.
Is this as simple as someone thinking they could potentially be the father and getting a DNA test? Does this mean presumably anyone could file a paternity suit?
Mystery Man would need to file a paternity suit - that is, he needs to challenge the paternity of the child in court.
Legally, the person who is currently on the birth certificate and who signed the affidavit of parentage is the father.
It’s not really relevant to the legal matters but how can there be 12 month and 14 month old siblings with potentially different fathers? To be siblings, they would at least have to have the same mother and biology doesn’t work that way (whole new kid in 2 months? Is this an alien pregnancy?).
