Here's the thing to know about co-signing... There's effectively no difference between being a co-signer and a primary borrower on a mortgage.
There are a lot of people on here who would tell you that you should never co-sign a mortgage. I tend to stay away from absolute statements like that, but I do think you need to make a very honest assessment as to why you would be willing to take such risks, and whether it's "worth it" to you.
As to whether to put your name on the house (or the deed)... It might be required by the mortgage company. Even if it's not, you should ask for this. With your name on the mortgage, but not the deed, you'd be subjecting yourself to all of the expense of home ownership, without actually holding any ownership in the house. Your sister could decide she no longer wants to pay the mortgage, not does she want to sell the house, and just allow the back balance to accrue and your credit to get ruined, and the only thing you could do to protect yourself would be to pay the mortgage yourself.
You should be prepared to cover the entire mortgage payment if your sister can't/won't, without having any ownership interest in the house. It's a bad idea unless the money would just mean nothing to you.
