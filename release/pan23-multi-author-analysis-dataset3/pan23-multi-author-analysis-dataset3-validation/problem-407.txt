Radicalised fighters were a strategy that was backed by the U.S - Saudi Arabia - Pakistan alliance against the Soviets during the Afghan-Soviet War!
However, do agree with the fact that the outcome of the U.S abandoning Afghanistan could have been worse...
The US knew Afghanistan was going to drop like this ten years before it did. Obama refused to make this happen whereas Trump and Biden did. There was no other outcome, at least not past 2003 when we invaded Iraq. The only way a liberal Afghanistan could happen is if a liberal Pakistan happened, and that was out of the cards once we let them have nuclear weapons in 1998.
It was for the best. Nobody wants to admit it but the Fall Of Kabul could have either been an organized US airlift with suicide bombings happening outside US-secured areas or a Siege Of Kabul with violent urban combat, mass slaughter of innocents, and huge aerial bombardment as the US cut and run. The money meant everyone in power would just eject, allowing a clear path for a US-initiated evacuation of key personnel and a cooperative Taliban. This saved lives, even if the outcome was not what we wanted.
