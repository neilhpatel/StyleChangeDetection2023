â€¢ Did other former Nobles or important figures get estates? Or was that just something for Mackensen?
(This question was also inspired by watching Enemy at the Gates last night where Ed Harris is described as a "Bavarian Nobleman vs a Russian Peasant... the essence of Class Struggle." But I know it's a pretty inaccurate movie.).
Yes. Christ's Apostles spread out around the known world in 33 AD, taking with them the rituals and beliefs that survived to this day in places as far away as India(1) and Ethiopia(2).
Rabbis, to be clear, existed since the Maccabbees, with the victories of the Maccabbees against occupying Hellenistic Greeks and the loss of confidence in the Levitical Priesthood. A sort of "assembly" of learned Pharisees (including but who were mainly not from the tribe of Levi) got together and advised the king on the law, oral tradition, or Torah. The loss in confidence was due to the Hellenistic cultural practices of the Jewish ruling class, which were seen as outside gentile influences on the Jews. With Jews living outside of Israel, and the world becoming more international, the issue of maintaining traditional Jewish law in a cosmopolitan situation was intended to be resolved by elders educated in the law of the Torah(3).
The central tenets of rabbinic Judaism, centered around synagogue and law (Separate from the temple), daily and weekly prayers, which most of which were codified and fairly standardized by 70AD, and in particular, making the rabbinical class the ultimate arbiter of law (interpretation and exegesis) and ritual above the priestly class (who were primarily Sadducees). These were around for a long time before the end of the talmudic and gaonic eras.
