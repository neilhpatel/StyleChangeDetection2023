They've happened a bunch of times before and many countries didn't notice until looking back, they could fly way higher than any fighter can get, and they can't be shot down over any population at all.
Plus all the usual stuff. Imagery possibly without clouds or atmospheric considerations. Persistence over areas if the wind permits. A dramatically reduced cost vs. a satellite.
Plausible deniability. The potential ability to jettison the payload in the ocean if you're found out (or from anywhere and hope it doesn't survive the 60,000ft fall).
Balloons can pick up signals such as individual cell phones, even from that height. And track their location. And for interesting traffic, if China has the keys - decrypt any encrypted traffic (or save it for a day when they do have the keys / when encryption vulnerabilities are found). Don't forget the most popularized one was flying over lots of military sites.
probably because the jets and warships were more distracting. maybe the balloons are just to see how far they can send objects into airspaces without a reaction. maybe its intercepting transmissions but a lot of people say there are a lot easier ways to do that.
