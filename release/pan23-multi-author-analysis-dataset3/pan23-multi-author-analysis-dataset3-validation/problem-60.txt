This subject is not purely historical, as it is still on the edge of living memory and the discussion is ongoing, as there are political and special interest groups involved.
In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
When we speak about genocide we speak of actions which are a part of a larger, concerted, organized, and officially sanctioned program that has as its aim the complete eradication of a people based on either racial, ethnic, religious, sexual, or any other superficial difference. The most important part of this understanding is that the aim of a genocide is complete eradication of a people. To make them extinct. To erase them from the world and and from history. Using this definition as a lens for understanding, we see the actions taken by Nazis against undesirables in Europe fit this criteria exactly, therefore it is accurate and consistent to refer to the Holocaust as a genocide. Similarly one can understand the Hutu attacks against Tutsi Rwandans as a genocide since the facts of what happened in Rwanda fit under our definition of genocide. The Rwandan genocide was; racially motivated, highly organized, officially sanctioned (this might come down to what "official" means in a country fighting a civil war, but certainly we can see where power resided in Rwandan society and delineate in this way), and had as its stated goal the complete elimination of the Tutsi race.
