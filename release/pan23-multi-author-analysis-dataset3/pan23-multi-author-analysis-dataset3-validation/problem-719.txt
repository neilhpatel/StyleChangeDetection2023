It is worth pointing out that a democrat controlled Congress and President made it illegal for those rail workers to strike over these safety concerns.
That, and all the rail workers saying rail owners have zero concern for the safety of the trains or the well being of the workers.
>“The solution is that people don’t have to come to work to try to operate trains after they’ve had heart attacks and broken legs. But right now, where we are is caught between shutting down the economy and getting enough Republicans to join us in making sure that people have access to sick leave.”.
Oh and that time were the rail workers wanted to fix it and Republicans said they would shut down the economy.

Republicans should have voted with the rail workers. Democrats should have let Republicans vote to shut down the economy. Rail OWNERS should have given their employees sick leave and a family life with dignity.
