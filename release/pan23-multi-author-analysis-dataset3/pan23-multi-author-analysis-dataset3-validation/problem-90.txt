The test was meant to end with a crash in the ocean. If we just laugh at what appears to be an idiot continually crashing into the ocean, then we are ignoring a very serious nuclear missile program in the hands of a rogue state. Do you really think Kim was trying to hit Japan or South Korea and it failed?
Kim can threaten to nuke Seoul, and that's enough, but now he can threaten to nuke anyone else. That doesnâ€™t seem to be terribly beneficial.
China and Russia don't see it that way. They support NK because they are a buffer against the West, but NK is also a liability. A rogue state that likes to poke its neighbors with ICBMs and ADIZ intrusions for attention isn't a good look, and it brings a lot of outside military attention to the region, something China for sure does not want.
Yeah, the RoK has talked about going nuclear, and so have many other countries for good reason, but it doesn't matter if NK attacked Seoul or the West Coast because shit hits the fan either way.
I'm not saying Kim thought through like this but the ICBMs might have benefit of putting doubts on the RoK-US alliance as far as US might not want to sacrifice LA/SF for Seoul when shit really hits the fan. But that doubt could bring other reactions. For example, RoK might go nuclear as a response because RoK doesn't have as much trust on the US nuclear umbrella.
