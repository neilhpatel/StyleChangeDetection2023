You seem to be having a hard time disassociating what happened to you from what you are now facing. Yes, he's the victim in THIS PARTICULAR LEGAL SITUATION (regardless of whether it's true or not). He's the victim, you're the defendant, and the state is prosecuting you. Your defense strategy is to blame the "victim" for your actions because of some past thing that again is largely irrelevant to the charges you're being alleged to have committed. That is a bad defense because the "victim" isn't responsible for your actions. You made the choice to contact him.
Your attorney is right. He's the victim in this situation. What he did to you is largely irrelevant to the charges against you. These are two different, independent actions. There's no legal defense for a harassment charge that excuses it because the victim did something horrible to you. You can ask for another attorney but the other one is going to have the exact same stance because that's how the law works and they're trying to give you the most effective defense possible. Your proposed defense is not the most effective.
Those are things you can try to use in your defense. We dont have all the details so no one here can help you with your defense.
