Marc Jongen from the far-right AfD called it a crime against humanity, while accusing the voting parties to have played down other Communist crimes in the past. He also rejects any parallels to Russias current behaviour towards Ukraine.
Right wingers: "Russia is taking a stand against the degenerate West by going to war in Ukraine". They are nostalgic for the Romanovs and Orthodox Christianity and whatnot (ignoring the diversity and large non-Christian population of Russia).
It clearly was? In much of India it's regarded as such. Realizing Churchill is popular in the West was a huge culture shock for my father when he immigrated. In India he's despised.
Left wingers: "Russia is fighting the imperial core of capitalism in their special operation, NATO left them no choice". They are nostalgic for the USSR (ignoring that Russia hasn't been communist since the 90s).
For whatever reason this seems to be the posture of every communist party in any country, even though Russia isn't the USSR anymore nor is it communist.
No one who is actually a socialist likes Nazism, no one who actually likes democracy likes North Korea, and no one who is actually a leftist liked the USSR.
