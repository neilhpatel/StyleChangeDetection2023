At this point it doesn't appear they are willing to accept responsibility. The idea is to have someone else look at it and use that information in small claims to get the dealer to pay you back.
If system records every time the voltage error occurs, any mechanic would be able to pull that up and show you.
You document the issues now. Do you have any email communications with the dealership about this? Take pictures of everything before you leave the dealership.
I wouldn't have them diagnose it at all. Pickup your car and take it to another shop to be diagnosed.
The windshield ... how many miles did they put on the car since it was in the shop? Likely very few, the odds of cracking a windshield (rock chips are by far the most common cause) during those few miles of test drives are very low. Not 100% impossible, but if you were to take it to court you would need proof to reach the more likely than not standard. Because the way a judge will see it is that it went 10 miles in their care and its more likely than not that it didnt happen in those 10 miles as opposed to the other 60k miles. Just being realistic.
