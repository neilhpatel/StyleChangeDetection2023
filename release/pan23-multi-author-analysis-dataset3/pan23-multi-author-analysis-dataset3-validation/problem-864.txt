Today it was mostly quiet, but there were a couple of missile launches from Belgorod around 4pm, they weren’t aimed at Kharkiv, but at Kupiansk, or at least in its direction. We don’t know where it landed exactly, and there were no reports of explosions from anywhere, but Kupiansk has been getting hit regularly after it was liberated, it is being both shelled and hit with missiles.
It’s not getting talked about much, but the border regions in Russia actually get shelled by our forces a lot. There are constant reports in Belgorod’s and Kursk’s telegram channels about their villages and towns either getting destroyed by shelling or losing electricity, because we do target their substations in retaliation, at least the ones that we can reach.
The villages and towns that get targeted by our forces are most of the time evacuated and being used by the Russian military, so they can’t claim that we are targeting civilians. It’s funny how they were accusing us of using civilians as shields while we were protecting our cities from being overrun by the Russian horde, but then they turn around and do the exact thing they were accusing us of.
On the other hand, there's a cohort of people screaming "war crime" at everything simply because they desperately try to frame both side as "equally bad" -- because pushing "Russia good" directly won't work now.
It is right to point out what is wrong with Russian culture, it is wrong to describe the Russian nation in essential terms that suggest an inability to change, and wrong not to acknowledge that many of them want something better. Nationhood is not destiny any more than genetics.
I think she is wrong to frame it that way. Ukraine was an integral part of the Soviet Empire and yet is moving ever closer to Europe, and by choice. Russia has not done the same, but there is a universe in which Russia escaped autocracy and became a member of the free world in good standing. Unfortunately, it was not this one, but it could have been.
