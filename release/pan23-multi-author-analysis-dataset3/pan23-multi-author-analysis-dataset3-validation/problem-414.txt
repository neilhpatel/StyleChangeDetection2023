Thank you! Than answers the question very clearly. From a modern standpoint, even while trying to think through the mindset of a slave owning society (even one like Rome that wasn't determined by a rigid ethnic devide between Master and slave like in the colonial Americas), it's just so hard to imagine people being willing to enslave their own children, even if they were illegitimate and raised more comfortably than others.
One thing that is clear when you read about ancient attitudes on slavery: most of the elites realised how cruel it was (Euripides and Seneca, for example, talk about the suffering of slaves, while being slaveowners) but they also thought it was just the way the world was, that it would be there forever. Just as people today say “the kids in the sweatshops would be even worse off without jobs” or “cows would die out if we didn’t farm them”.
In Rome, as in most ancient societies, it is the social class of the mother that decides the status of the child, so a slave mother + free father = slave child. Insofar as the parent’s social class influenced what happened to the child, it is worth considering the different nature of slavery for elite and slightly less-elite Romans (I’ll use this distinction because, by the time of Julius Caesar and Cicero, the old patrician vs plebeian divide was no longer such a rigid divide - Crassus, possibly the richest Roman of the time, was from an old plebeian family).
If you’d like a very modern and very readable but scholarly overview of slavery in the ancient Mediterranean, be sure to try Ancient Greek and Roman Slavery by Peter Hunt.
