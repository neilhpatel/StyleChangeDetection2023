It was later revealed that he had cheated on the requirements to get his party electable, so they were barred from retrying for a period, which meant his party was not electable for the 2022 election - So he just went as himself.
He was in a traffic accident in 2005 which caused personality-altering brain damage, which makes him unable to tolerate flaws in other people. (In his own words).
Edit to add: He got 79 votes in the Swedish election (dual citizen), so they might as well call him a Swedish MP.
Edit: His party got way less (at most 4,288 since that is the total votes for indepednets) in the 2022 Danish election, I was looking at 2019.
He isn't. The guy possibly on Russian payroll is Frick who proposed the idea to Paludan. There is still no reaosn to think Paludan is on Russian payroll, he is a useful idiot. If you had read the (admittedly shitty) article you would have known.
ehm yeah sure this news article here seem pretty questionable. they have been burning the koran for a freaking long time now, way before the ukraine war.
A guy who has been known to be burning Korans for like ten years now has been linked to Russia? So in what ways was he aiding Russia for the other 10 years he was burning the Koran?
