There are already avenues for being compensated and punishment if you steal an old employers idea and use it at your new employer. Non competes are unnecessary.
If its a billion dollar idea, paying an employee their salary for a year or two to protect it is a pittance and the cost of business.
If the idea you're trying to protect isn't worth more than an employees salary for a year or two, then that employee didn't need a non-compete anyways.
That's nothing to a company running these kind of agreements but it will snare a lot of the grunt workforce who shouldn't be under noncompetes to begin with.
On the other hand, I have friends that work for software companies in various roles, and their agreements state that they can't work for a company that makes a competing product. When your company makes a wide range of products, an agreement like that basically locks you out of entire industries.
My noncompete seems reasonable - I work for Company A, providing contract engineering services to Company B. My noncompete basically only says I can't work directly for Company B within 12 or 18 months of leaving Company A, or they'll effectively have to keep paying my contract during that time. It's there to discourage companies from cutting out the middleman (Company A).
"Seller non-competes" are likely to be excluded from this ban since they're not related to "employees" but also should probably not be banned. A seller non-compete prevents the seller of a business from immediately turning around an setting up a competing business to the one that they just sold. That's a very important buyer protection, as for most of the businesses out there the majority of their valuation comes from "goodwill" - an intangible asset that represents the collective relationships, knowledge, brand value, and strategic positioning of the business (i.e. a business might only have $100k worth of physical assets but be valued at $1 million, with the other $900k being "goodwill). Because goodwill isn't tangible and at least partially anchored to the seller's knowledge and relationships, a seller could potentially claw it back with a competing business. That would mean they'd essentially be selling something but then turning around and stealing what they got paid for. For that reason, sellers of businesses usually have some duration of non-compete which is designed to give the buyer a window in which to anchor that goodwill to them.
IMO it is fair for a business to ask someone not to compete IF it is attached to significant, offsetting compensation. In the case of seller non-competes, that means getting paid a valuation of your business that attaches a significant financial value to the intangible assets of the business. In the case of non-competes for employees, that means paying them full wages (or an equivalent severance bonus) for the duration of the period where they're being asked not to compete.
