Why would it be illegal or unethical? There are anti-discrimination laws that prevent employers from pursuing aspects of your medical history that might give them grounds to determine that you are disabled and discriminate against you on that basis, but COVID testing and vaccinations aren't part of that.
The law was similar, yes. But there wasn't really enough time for employers to decide that it was necessary to require the vaccine in large enough numbers for people to notice.
Outside of that, though, there are a lot of other vaccines that various industries require that aren't part of the standard list that everyone gets. For example, many industries that require their employees to be out in the desert or forests here in AZ require vaccinations for rabies and Hepatitis A.
The others have brought up things like hostpitals and schools, which almost always require a standard battery of vaccines. It's often required for anyone who is going to be in close quarters either with people who are ill, or with people who are immunocompromised (so, like, home health providers or caregivers).
Many employers do, in fact, ask for other vaccine records. It's just that more employers are asking for COVID records specifically because it's a problem across all industries right now.
