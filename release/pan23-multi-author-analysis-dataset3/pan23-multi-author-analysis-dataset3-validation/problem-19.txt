They are allowing their guests to shower and sleep there during the day. The lease says they can have guests for up to 10 days. But at this point they have stuck around for almost month. Using power and water and other utilities.
Yeah - seems like a bit of a grey area as they are obviously not just guests but people treating our unit as a homeless shelter. Our tenants don’t pay for utilities as they are included in their “rent” so having two extra people down there means we are now officially subsiding their utilities as well.
When you chose to include utility usage in the flat-rate rent, you accepted the risk that your tenants (and their guests) would use the utilities more than you expected. You're welcome to decline to renew their lease when it expires.
Your tenants are entitled to have guests visit them every day if they want, and those guests are allowed to use the utilities. If they aren't staying overnight, it doesn't sound like they're violating the terms of the lease.
Your tenants can have guests over. There's nothing you can do to prevent them from allowing their guests to visit as frequently as they want, even if it is more often than you prefer. Of course, if the lease places restrictions on overnight guests, you are welcome to enforce that, but you can't stop your tenants from hanging out with their friends in their home several times a day.
If your tenants' guests are engaged in illegal activity on the premises, or they are otherwise violating the terms of the lease, you may be able to take action. But if your tenants are just having friends over more often than you would like, that's not something you have control over, even if they are taking showers.
