No one can answer that. Maybe they like your husband less than other people. Maybe they didn't like that the swear was used in the context of whining about working at work.
If I had to give a guess, probably because he was using it to demean his coworkers by implying he does all the work and complaining about his job, signaling he wasn't happy there.
Because the managers decided not to fire them. Why? We can't possibly answer that as we aren't there.
Assuming US and no union or contract, yes, he can be fired for saying "fuck" in the workplace. He is an at-will employee and can be terminated for any non-discriminatory reason.
If HR fired him, it is highly unlikely you have any sort of case against that -much less a legal case.
“I do everything around this fucking place” is extremely unprofessional and I can’t imagine how your husband would think that is okay. Especially around co-workers (“below him”) or not.
Your husband was an assistant manager, upper end of the chain; professionalism is so important. If that 18 year old cashier curses, write him up. If his boss’s boss curses, bigger ‘fines to pay’. That’s reality.
