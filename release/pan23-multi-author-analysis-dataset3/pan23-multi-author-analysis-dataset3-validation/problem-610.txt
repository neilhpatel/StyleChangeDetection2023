however, the general thought you have here isn't correct unless i'm misreading it... the lease someone signs governs the period of the lease. after that has elapsed and goes to month to month, the landlord is free to modify the rental terms monthly (assuming those changes conform with the law) and if OP doesn't accept these changes, they can end the lease and if OP doesn't abide by the changes, the landlord can evict.
There might be other parts of the lease that talk about modifications to the lease with notice; it won't matter for this 60-day notice issue but it could matter for other things. You should check for instance that the landlord gave you enough notice to raise the rent.
Apparently 30 days notice is the maximum that can be required by statute in California, so it doesn't really depend on this part of the lease.
Assuming that's the case, remind him that the lease says 30 days notice, and don't agree to give 60 days notice. Then you can give 30 days notice when you want to leave.
Legally speaking, the signed lease is what applies. The signed lease may include a provision that allows the landlord to change certain things like the rent with appropriate notice, but unless the landlord can change any provision of the lease, the 60 day notice thing is not something you are forced to accept.
Good find. OP - apparently because of the law in California, a lease requirement for 60 days notice wouldn't be enforceable.
They did not actually, my lease ends at the end of the month, I got my increase notice on the 5th, 25 days before the lease ends. What can I do about this?
