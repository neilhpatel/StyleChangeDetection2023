While it's not quite your question, I asked a question earlier this year on the similarities between Continental and Insular Celts. The excellent answers from /u/depanneur explain how there isn't much in common between them, which undermines the value of "Celtic" as a cultural group.
But, as to why it's an issue: none of the modern Celtic nations ever identified as Celtic, and perhaps no "Celtic" language speakers would ever have identified that way (not all linguists agree on the origins of the term, some claim its Celtic and others believe it to be Greek.) The use of the term is based off of links to language groups, and the suggestion that perhaps Celtic people migrated. If we accept the hypothesis that there wasn't any migration, and that Celtic wasn't the language of a particular group and instead was used by a variety of different groups, then what solid reasons do we have for identifying Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall & Brittany with "Celtic?" Why would we link them?
While I don't think there's any contention around classifying the continental Celtic languages as Celtic, or linking them to the modern, insular Celtic languages, more recent scholarship has suggested that there was no migration, and that perhaps the Celtic language was a form of lingua franca used up and down the Atlantic seabord for trade.
I can't speak to the broader question - I don't know much outside my own area of expertise - but I did want to say that the modern Celtic languages are not loosely related, they are very clearly and very strongly related.
My main area of expertise is insular Celtic, and thus I'll do my best but I won't consider myself an expert on the subject of dissecting continental Celtic! That being said: yes. With the continental Celtic languages especially, much of what we have is fragments, names or random nouns in the middle of other languages, or brief inscriptions. Galatian, for example which we do have written in the Greek alphabet, has a handful of nouns that are included in Greek sources, but no actual source texts. As far as I'm aware all of these words are inflected as if they were Greek, and Freeman (whose study The Galatian Language is the most comprehensive I'm aware of) suggests other potential Galatian words, but these can't be confirmed. We don't have a Galatian source texts against which to check them. I'll admit I'm not sure, in terms of Greek scholarship, whether or not we can definitively rule them out as being Greek - I don't know if the stems are so vastly unfamiliar to Greek that we can say for certain that they aren't Greek words - but if we can't then that would add another layer into the mix.
Apart from these possibilities, however, we don't know how much Greek influenced southern Gaulish language, especially in its everyday usage : variants specifically found in Gallo-Greek such as the patronymic -akos or -ios instead of -iknos aren't attributed to a Greek influence so far.
Greek influence of Gaulish epigraphy, besides the script of course, can't be dismissed : for instance with the Accusative Plural in -o- themes where an expected -us is rendered as -os.It is possible as well that Gallo-Greek epigraphy kept the Nominative Singular of the same themes as -os; when it might have evolved to -o earlier than the Ist century AD.
