As a Slovene, I can say the same. Our dumb prime minister said a while ago that the Western Balkans are on Russia's side. Our dumb foreign minister said there can be no peace or stability in Europe without Russia. We're still waiting for comments from our dumb Karen of a president. It's a shitshow, led by sympathizers of the old communist regime.
Actually, we are considerably less fucked-up than we were under the right wing government. At least we are not turning into the next Hungary, heh. Progress?
Dont worry, its only fucked up if you are a disappointed right-winger, letting off steam in a reddit comment section.
Reddit's attitude towards any nation when their politicians say dumb and evil things: "Oh dear, oh dear. Gorgeous.".
But than again. I know redditors from USA and other unaffected countries, that never knew war or suffering, know better...
Remember that Croatia went trough similar thing in 90s-2000s , 10+ years of war that seen thousands of dead and misplaced and from which Croatia never fully recovered.
So I think that if anyone has relevant opinion on this, and can really sympathise with Ukraine, its Croatia.
