That doesn't make it better. He still prioritized a celebrity and gave up a ton of leverage. It's a really shitty deal and sends a terrible message to the nation. Fuck, it would have been better if he didn't make the deal at all.
Why are you backtracking? Your initial reaction was 100% correct. We traded the merchant of death for a celebrity and didn't even get the Russians to throw in a no-name teacher. I voted for Biden, but he needed to do better. This is fucked up.
That's just obfuscating bullshit. We traded the merchant of death for a celebrity and didn't even get the Russians to toss in a no-name teacher. This is so fucking stupid, and Whelan's family should be pissed.
I hate the fact that this won't happen. I hate the fact that she was only freed because she is a celebrity. I hate the fact that this stupid trade didn't even include a no-name teacher. It's so fucking stupid, all of it.
Because it’s a fucked up and irrelevant point. It implies you think anyone that protests the U.S. deserves to rot in jail. I truly don’t get how you can’t see that, but I know you don’t.
The fuck you can't. I spent 16 years in the military. You absolutely can change plans and orders up until the second the orders take effect. If you want to change something after it takes effect, it only takes a new set of orders. We stopped a whole ass attack in the middle of the invasion in 2003 because Rumsfeld made something a higher priority. The only one who is clueless is the guy talking about policy without knowing how the policy is enacted and carried out. They did not have any tactical advantage until we provided it. To paraphrase Sun Tzu, "When your enemy is fucking up, don't interrupt him." Even if he was somehow absolutely committed and couldn't possibly change it, he should have told our allies the plan so they weren't left holding the bag. We still have Americans in Afghanistan because Biden's State Dept hasn't gotten them out and there is no plan to because it's not in the news anymore.
