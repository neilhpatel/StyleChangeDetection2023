Unfortunately, there is no law in Michigan that states the youngest age a child can be left home alone.
Also note: the Michigan Child Protection Handbook says that as a rule of thumb, a child 10 years old and younger is not responsible enough to be left home alone.
> The State of Michigan Child Protection Handbook states (on page 16) â€œAccording to the Child Protection Law, there is no legal age that a child can be left home alone. It is determined on a case-by-case basis but as a rule of thumb, a child 10 years old and younger is not responsible enough to be left home alone.
If there is no law stating specific ages a child can be left home alone in your state, then that decision is most likely left up to the judgment of CPS. They typically base it on the individual child's ability to take care of themselves and ability to react appropriately to emergency situations.
Contact CPS. Even if there is nothing they can substantiate now, your ex will be given a case number and any future calls will be able to show a pattern of behavior regarding the child's safety (case numbers follow individuals. Any future calls under your exs name will be attached to the original call.).
1. Call CPS. Call every time you know it has happened even if you are just saying the same thing again.
To be blunt, you are passed getting him to see this is serious and change. Right now, if you leave your son alone with him and he is not able to keep your child safe, either because he is drunk or because he isn't present, you are also being neglectful by leaving your son with an inadequate caregiver. I'm glad you have plans to not leave your son alone with him anymore and I'm sorry you are in this position.
No, it's not okay. This is neglect. Are you living with your son's father or separately? Assuming separately, is there a custody agreement in place and what does it say?
