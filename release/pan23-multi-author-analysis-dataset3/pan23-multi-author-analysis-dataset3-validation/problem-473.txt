There's a big difference between "I feel like there's a lack of evidence to support that it was strictly a war crime, but it happened" vs "YOU JEWS NEVER HAD GENOCIDE PROBLEMS STUPID JEW JEW JEW JEW".
The purpose of a Nazi saying "The Holocaust didn't happen" isn't to deny the truth to themselves -- they know it happened. What they're doing is signalling to others that they're Nazis and hate Jews, making themselves visible for like-minded as well as creating an atmosphere of intimidation. The usual victim cult thing also plays into it, "The Holocaust is a Jewish conspiracy to strangle the German people" kind of talk, "Join us and we'll save Germany from that attack, and yes of course murder Jews because while the Holocaust didn't happen it should have".
Based on an incomplete set of premises, possibly. I'm sure it's easy to hang out in online places with tons of people with the same tunnel vision.
Excluded middle. Please, if you want to claim that your argument is "logical" don't make such beginner mistakes. But to the point:
And that’s not the argument I’m making. If what you say incites violence, especially if what you are saying is fabricated, you should be dealt with swiftly. Someone who has influence over hundred of thousand if not millions of people is held to a different standard. No one forced them to get up on the podium and speak.
