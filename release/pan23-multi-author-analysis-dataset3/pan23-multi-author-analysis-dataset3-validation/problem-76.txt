It's good that something is done about mental healthcare but there's no evidence that this would do much. To quote the recently:
This isn't to say that investing in good mental health policies (there's a lot of bad ones) would help with a lot of things, just not person on person gun violence.
Anytime a Republican talks about mental health, they're just trying to deflect from a gun debate long enough for people to move on.
Let's be clear, when Republicans talk about mental health bills, they mean evaluation of things they perceive as abnormal to protect them from those things. See: start throwing LGBTQ+ people in asylums, removing their rights to things as well as putting them on a federal list that shows up in job background checks.
They would be happy to legislate mental illness controls so they could start creating lists and claiming LGBTQ is a mental illness and those people need to be regulated.
People need to recognize there's nothing but stigma to be invented and legislated whenever mental health bills are raised.

Nothing good can possibly come from Republicans trying to redirect the gun conversation into mental health. How about not letting domestic abusers have guns? Oh, wait, those are their people though...
