While there was a piece of unimproved real estate, it had practically no value due to location, so I called the county where the taxes were past due to let them know the owner was dead and no one would be paying them (to let the collector know to plan to tax sale it.). Then I called the neighbor to let them know, so they would secure it, and they would go to the tax sale. It was up to them to then do the quiet title action to combine it with theirs.
I called Ford credit to tell them to come get the car that had a lien against it and very little mileage driven. Eventually they sent a repo driver to pick it up (who didn’t know the situation and was amazed I was nice to him and handed over the keys.).
IANAL. There is only one circumstance where either you or your sister are legally liable for your father's credit card debts - if either or both of you signed as guarantor of those debts, then you would be liable. I've never seen a credit card with a guarantor, but then I don't deal with credit cards (particularly for those whose credit is so bad they need a guarantor) very often.
The debt collector knows that you don't owe them money, that the estate does. They are using emotional blackmail and threats of litigation in the hope that you'll pay the debt. Don't. Refer them to the probate court and stop taking their calls. If they send mail, return it unopened. Alternatively, you can write back telling them you are not responsible, but if do this they will keep after you. If they won't give up or try to hit your credit score, report them to your state regulator, and consult an attorney.
Life insurance is only part of the estate if the beneficiary is "The Estate of \[Your Father\]". If the beneficiary of the life policy was you, your sister, or both of you, these were your funds to do with as you wish. You did not need to use them to pay off his debts.
That being said, debt collectors do everything they can to get family to assume the debts, even when you’re not legally required to. Don’t trust their word for anything. It’s highly unlikely they sue over $800 if they think there’s a chance the estate is insolvent.
