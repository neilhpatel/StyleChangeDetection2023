Dreamcatchers are generally believed to be related to the legends of the Spider Lady, who contrary to what might be the expectation of a modern European audience, was actually a good figure to indigenous American peoples across the very broad range of Western North America. Spiders feature positively in Southwestern (Puebloan and Dine cultures), Plains (Siouan and Oji-Cree cultures), and others as well, but let's focus here particularly. I do not believe all of those cultures, despite having good spiders in their legends, have quite particularly the Spider Lady we are looking for.
Yes, they originate from the cultures of the northern Plains, and particularly the Ojibwa and Lakota nations have legends pertaining to their origin.
Also, are you able to talk about dreamcatchers in cultures who had their own trade relationships with the Ojibwe and Lakota? When I was a child I got my first dreamcatcher at an Oneida powwow and I am wondering if dreamcatchers were long used among the Haudenosaunee or if this is likely to be the product of recent pan-Indianism.
I do want to reiterate however, that I'm not arguing that what the dreamcatcher means to any living person or recent ancestor has to be genealogically connected to the scalp hoop. There are examples of a certain artifact form transforming it's meaning radically across time throughout human history.
