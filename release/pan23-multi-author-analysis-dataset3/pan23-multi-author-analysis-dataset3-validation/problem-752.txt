As a PMC if they're paid to commit violent acts in support a political group that is terrorism. So yes. Terrorists don't have to personally believe in the cause, just have to be organized with the group and contribute to causing terrorist acts.
I'm all for calling out a bunch of terrorists, but the same stroke should apply to other similar organizations.
However, if we start calling them a terrorist group, it opens up a way for the Russians to sleaze their way out of responsibility for them. They can say that the Group went well outside of their scope of operations and can publicly disavow them, but quietly allow them to dissolve and reorganize into something else in name only. I know what Ukraine wants, but there's a point to making sure this group of mercs is tied directly to the Kremlin.
Now hear me out. The Wagner Group is a mercenary group. However, as one, it still operates under contract, which means that it has to have its conduct covered by parts of said contract's other signer...the Russian Federation. The Russians, as us Americans now from Iraq and Afghanistan, are going to have to answer for their conduct. Or if there were any bit of justice in the world, everyone else would be pissed and forever hold this over the Russians. Which I know will never happen, especially since everyone just kind of forgot about Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989.
