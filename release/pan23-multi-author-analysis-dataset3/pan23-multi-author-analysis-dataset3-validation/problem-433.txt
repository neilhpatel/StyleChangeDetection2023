Zelensky's face is going to be on Ukraine's future currency, he's their George Washinon/Abraham Lincoln, the guy who fought off a numerically superior enemy/led the country through its darkest hour. Even Especially if Russia were able to assassinate him tomorrow, Ukraine would just keep fighting.
If Russia keeps sending their men to die in Ukraine for as long as Russia tried to hold Afghanistan they'll hit over a million dead Russians in 8 and a half years.
You'd need the political will to force Russia to hand them over which may include continuing missile attacks on Ukrainian cities while they demand the return of the stolen people.
Ukraine hitting the Crimean bridge, on the other hand, did have a specific military purpose, since Russia is using it to supply their invasion force in the south; they also hit it months after Russia invaded for the second time.
The only difference between what they're doing now and what they had been doing previously is that there is no specific military purpose to these later strikes: they are not supporting the advance of troops in an invasion, but simply terrorising Ukrainians behind the front lines, where Russia is getting battered.
Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, and decimated whatever Ukrainian infrastructure they couldn't seize in Donetsk and Luhansk in the following years. They then invaded again early in 2022, during which they seized and destroyed even more Ukrainian infrastructure.
Look at Mariupol before and after Russia's invasion and say again with a straight face that 'they started first by attacking the Crimean bridge'.
