Neither "child molester" nor "pedophile" are legal designations and neither term would apply to the person you've described. As this happened overseas, NJ laws are irrelevant. In Italy, the age of consent is 14 and incest is only illegal in limited circumstances. The girl should seek counselling.
Since she has moved on after he died, why are you pressing the issue? If you want to have a discussion about the reasoning behind age of consent laws, please post to r/legaladviceofftopic.
Some jurisdictions have the age of consent and the age of adulthood the same, but most do not. Most jurisdictions consider older teens to have the ability to consent to sex, even if they are not yet fully an adult. Some jurisdictions have close in age exceptions or other age-related parameters (e.g. a teen who is still a minor may be able to consent with a partner who is within 4 years of age from them, but any older or with an adult in a position of authority over them and it becomes statutory rape), but some do not and just say if you're older than this age, you can consent to activity with anyone.
The age of consent means that you must be this old to give consent for sexual activity. If you are below that age and you have sex, it is by default rape because you could not consent due to your age.
So really, it depends on where you are. I am not familiar with Italian law, but a quick google search does not suggest this encounter would have been illegal on the basis of age alone. She was old enough under Italian law to consent.
