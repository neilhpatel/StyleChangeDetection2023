Yes I had left everything there and still possess a house key and my mail is being sent there. I have retrieved some of my items since then and it was not an issue but she has now escalated it to this level.
Yeah I just want to get the rest of my stuff and be done with it, so I just want to make sure I'm not liable for any legal repercussions. Is my mom able to give me "permission" as she is on title for the house? I have decided to get a police escort regardless.
Ok, thanks for that info, I didn't know if the address would play a part. I'm not a minor and another comment mentioned to ask my mom to grant me permission, and that is an available option. My issue is I don't feel safe with her there and that same comment mentioned requesting police presence if she is there, so those are probably the 2 best options.
Another way to go is to call the police non-emergency line, explain what’s going on, and ask for police presence when you go to get your things. Sister will likely behave better in front of an official authority.
Have your mom text you asking you to come over. If your mom is on the title, she might need to be made aware of what the sister is doing/saying/threatening. Screenshot the text with the invite in case things get nasty. I’d assume that getting permission from one owner voids any tresspassing claim.
As far as the trespassing question; the address on your license has no bearing here, as a license is not a lease agreement. What would matter are the rental & tenants' rights laws where you live, and possibly your age (whether or not you are a minor) as well as who your legal guardian is if you are indeed a minor.
