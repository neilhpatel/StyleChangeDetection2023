You have insurance (at least you'd better). She calls your insurance company, files a claim, they handle it and get a legal release from her that guarantees you won't see a lawsuit later. Her deductibles on her insurance are completely irrelevant.
Doing this yourself, without an attorney, is foolhardy. Notarization has no magical powers and will not protect you. Your insurance company will.
I do have insurance yes. So a release of liability form even if notarized still wouldn’t be concrete? Me and her obviously would like to avoid insurance if possible, we both don’t want our rates going up of course. But if you’re saying I should be better safe than sorry and go through insurance then I’d feel more comfortable doing that.
Yes, you would be better off going through insurance. And your insurance policy probably has a clause requiring you to report this accident anyway.
Ideally in an accident you wouldn't admit liability, but if you were at fault you might offer or agree to a set amount of compensation in settlement of and for a full release of any actual or potential claims. The settlement agreement often doesn't mention either party's liability at all.
