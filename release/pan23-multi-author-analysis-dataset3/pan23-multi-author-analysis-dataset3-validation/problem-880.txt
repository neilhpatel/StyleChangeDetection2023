So if I understood you right, the others kingdoms reformed themselves and centralized too but since they did it earlier those reforms had time to weaken + Qin got free land to develop in Sichuan where it couldn't be threatened .
On Sichuan, yes, but also given the non Chinese elites in Shu were diposed after their failed revolt Qin was also able to fully implement without the interference of a preexisting aristocracy.
They did! To one extent or another, almost every state during the warring states implemented reforms along the lines of Shang Yang, though in all likelihood none went as far as Qin.
This already suggests a few reasons that Qin was able to pursue greater, more comprehensive reforms than other states. The lateness of their reforms, at least partially caused by their position on the edge of what was then the Chinese world and small educated class, mean that they had a lot more to learn from. That they had a much smaller pool of potential administrators also made them more willing to accept immigrants from other states-all states at this time did, but Qin did to a far greater degree. This meant, again, they could learn more about what works and what doesn't.
