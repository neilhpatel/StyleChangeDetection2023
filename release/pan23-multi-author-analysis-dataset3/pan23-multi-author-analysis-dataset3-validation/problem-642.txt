You can try calling your state department of livestock. Game cams, livestock guardian dogs, having an actual presence on the property.
Livestock guardian dogs are a really important part of having livestock. Not just against animal predators. Highly suggest looking into reputable breeders in the area.
Donkeys are unreliable and temperamental. They're a bit like geese. Geese are amazing at guarding their flock but they are also extremely temperamental and need to be raised from a baby to accept their flock and vice versa and even then sometimes it doesn't happen. Donkeys are even less reliable than geese and also prefer to guard birds/flocks than sheep. Livestock guardian breeds have been bred specifically for this exact reason for centuries and are the most reliable animal to protect livestock and property. They're naturally suspicious of strangers, almost entirely nocturnal, and are typically fairly fuckin big as far as dogs go. Also, I deal with Donkeys daily and I'd take on 10 angry Donkeys than 2 properly trained LGDs any day.
