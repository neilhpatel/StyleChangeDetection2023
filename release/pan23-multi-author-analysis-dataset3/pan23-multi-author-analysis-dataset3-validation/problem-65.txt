Not paying your current landlord is going to cause you to not be able to find a new place, and you WILL eventually have to pay that amount, plus possible interest and penalties.
If you don't pay your rent, even while you are moving out in 2 months, landlord will file for eviction. Then take you to court to get the money back. Did you pay last month rent when started the original lease?
There was not one, I paid him a deposit equal to my rent. However we have no problem paying him back when we can. And are not thinking of squatting or anything like that.
Well, this is a private rental, we have no contract, and we would literally be homeless unless we save our money to get a new place. I guess I am just screwed.
Sorry to clarify. The landlords girlfriend had a close friend of hers move in. Told us he was cool. He was not. He is schizophrenic and also has been to Patton for the criminally insane for stalking reasons of some kind. And has flipped on us multiple times. She was going to get a restraining order but she asked us to give him a chance if he stopped interacting and stopped drinking. Things calmed down, she kept the restraining order paper work and talked to the cops on record at court just in case. Now we have this.
Sorry, California, and no, we have no written new lease, we had one when we first moved in but that long since expired. So we have just continued to pay him. The original deal was for a year.
