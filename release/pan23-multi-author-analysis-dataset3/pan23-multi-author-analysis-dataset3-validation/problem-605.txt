I mean, the whole point of the article was that this General was right on the cusp of sending the Guard in there to fuck the Insurrectionists up. Obviously he didn’t, but it was a close call. If Trump actually tried making the announcement that he wasn’t leaving office and they were going to institute martial law, it doesn’t sound like the General was just going to sit on his hands for that shit.
The (acting) secretary of defense , even if they took longer than they should, it didn’t matter that Trump was deliberately ignoring the situation or Pence was demanding they deploy.
Of course there is. One that recognizes defending the constitution includes honoring the constitutional chain of command and authority vested in the President (ArtII.S2.C1.1.11).
The oath of enlistment is similar and says “…and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me…” so at a minimum, anyone who listed to his orders would be breaking their oath.
But, assuming you are defending his inaction, I'll say, first, the for military officers includes an obligation to "support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic[.]" There's no possible interpretation of that oath that treats allowing a mob to besiege and sack the Capitol as upholding the oath. And the oath is also a law Congress passed, so you can't claim "rule of law matters" while also supporting violating one's oath of office that was passed by Congress. If rule of law matters, then so does upholding one's oath.
One cannot violate the Constitution, even at the President's direction, and uphold one's oath. And the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Supreme over even the President, whose oath of office also requires upholding the Constitution. If the President and the Constitution are in conflict, the Constitution wins.
Fifth, even if there's a statute that might otherwise prevent him from acting, when a statute and the Constitution are in conflict, the Constitution always takes precedence ("This Constitution . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land," .
And the Constitution says it's the supreme law of the land. Supreme over even the President. Like I said, if the President and the Constitution are in conflict, the Constitution wins. The military, even enlisted, are not expected to blindly follow orders. By your logic, Trump could've ordered the military to execute Biden, and they would've been obligated to obey that order. But we know that's not the case, that by just giving the order, Trump would be guilty of at least one crime, and that anyone who attempted or actually followed through would also be guilty of at least one crime as well. The President isn't a dictator.
