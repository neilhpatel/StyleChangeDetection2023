Disclaimer: I am not a professional historian and I do not have a background in Israeli/Palestinian politics. I will use reliable sources and avoid editorializing the facts. I'd also like to stress that nothing I write here should be read to imply a moral equivalence between Zionism and anti-Zionism. I hope the mods have mercy on me.
But as that answer eloquently notes, Soviet antisemitism wasn't just rooted in pragmatic political maneuvers. on Soviet anti-Zionist writing finds that Soviet Jewishness was mostly irreconcilable with traditional shtetl life. A Soviet Jew had to subsume parts of their identity to conform to the new Bolshevik state, and despite the efforts of young Jewish leaders, anti-Zionism eventually became the official policy of the Kremlin. Many Soviet Jews fruitlessly tried to fit a round Zionist peg into a square Leninist hole. Zionism as a distraction from class struggles, which meant Zionism stood in the way of the proletariat revolution.
The Soviet campaign was not just to paint Zionism as Jewish self-determination or Israel's existence and racist as a result. It wasn't just to oppose "nationalism" and thereby oppose Zionism as well. Instead, the Soviets painted Zionism as a "world threat". As Howard Sachar put it in A History of the Jews in the Modern World, the reason the Arab states lost was because of an "all-powerful international force" that was composed of "Jewish communities everywhere", not just Israel. The Kremlin now spoke of "the power of world Jewry", and "Zionists" were portrayed as "rich Jewish bourgeoisie", contrasted with the good Soviet communist. Zionism was seen as synonymous with global capitalism and excess, and the Soviets exported this ideology fervently, claiming that the United States was just a puppet of the Zionists, and telling the Muslim world that Israel and the US would try to turn the Muslim world into a Jewish territory.
The Soviet Union's anti-Israel position, motivated in part by its alliance with the Arab states and in part by antisemitism, is well-documented. However, not a lot of folks are aware that the Soviets did their best to export antisemitism to other countries as well, especially out of the belief that Zionism was part of a global conspiracy heralded by capitalism.
Can someone explain more about how we know the Soviet Union's official lines condemning the nationalist, capitalist, and apartheid elements of Zionism were nothing more than a smokescreen for the apparently universal antisemitism in the USSR? Were there any Soviet leaders or spokespeople who condemned Zionism without relying on overtly antisemitic tropes, or who pushed back against those tropes?
The USSR's first overtly anti-Zionist policies as part of a larger package of policies against all political non-Communist movements. After a slew of arrests, deportations, and convictions, most Zionist movements went underground, though a couple openly pro-Soviet Zionist groups continued to tread water. Many of the arrested Zionists ended up in prison camps, but they could earn a ticket to Palestine if they recanted and stipulated that "the goals of Zionism were indeed anti-Soviet and/or counter-revolutionary." The Soviet Union wanted to give the impression that Zionism posed a terrorist threat and that their anti-Zionist policies were defensive, not antisemitic. We can see the Soviets trying to pull the strings of "global opinion" here.
I think it was likely more the former than the latter, since the support by the Soviets did not seem notable. This came after the USSR had reestablished and normalized relations with Israel, and as I mentioned, less than a month before the Soviet Union's dissolution. It's certainly hard to know if it was moral conviction, since Gorbachev was speaking of "Zionist propaganda" and saying that in a "civilized society" there should be "no antisemitism" and "no Zionism" in 1986. Gorbachev ultimately described the moves as motivated by human rights, for what it's worth, and may indeed have been motivated as such. He was also welcomed as a hero in Israel by 1992, which shows how rapid the shift was, and indicates it was probably a lot more political than anything else.
