It also bothers me when people say they’re like that because they’re repressed and never see a naked woman. While that doesn’t help, it isn’t the real reason there’s so much rape. It isn’t about horniness, it’s about being socialized to see women as objects that exist for your pleasure.
I grew up Mormon in Utah but always knew lots of men from several different cultures who were really misogynistic. Mormonism is really really sexist and abusive towards women but it’s just a really nuanced topic. Honestly, Mormon men raping women is actually not as common as you’d expect, unless you’re talking about their wives, whom they definitely sexually, physically, and emotionally abuse. But like men are actually held surprisingly accountable for having sex outside of marriage; personally, I think it goes back to the church’s polygamous past- the boys were punished brutally for stealing the old men’s women so a young boy found to be having sex is usually as punished as a young girl. They don’t actually believe men don’t have self control and it isn’t their fault.
And you can’t brainwash your men when your women are educated and free-thinking. It’s basically why churches have punished women since the beginning of time.
