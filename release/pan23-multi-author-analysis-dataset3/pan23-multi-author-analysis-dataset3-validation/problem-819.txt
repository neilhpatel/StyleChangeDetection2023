So while there were sizeable urban populations throughout the medieval period - Paris, London, Chester etc. - the overwhelming majority of the European population lived in an agrarian, rural context in which the village, rather than the town, was the predominant settlement. That doesn't mean that you weren't familiar with town - indeed in England you're rarely more than 20-30 miles away from a market town - but that your main centres of food production were not necessarily urban. While baking was absolutely not usually carried out at home apart from kitchens of the wealthy, it doesn't necessarily mean that people were travelling to the nearest town for their daily bread. Indeed, most town markets were held on a weekly basis and the right to hold a market was actually tightly controlled by royal charter and could frequently be the cause of significant legal squabbles. In the vast majority of cases, especially within the context of a village, baking would be carried out in communal ovens.
Typically, villagers would pay a miller to grind their flour, which they would either then use to make a dough at home and take to the communal oven, or pay a baker to make into dough and then cook for them. The baker, if there was one, was the individual responsible primarily for the operation of the oven itself, rather than necessarily how we might understand a modern baker, who sources flour, prepares bread and then hopes to sell it all. Bakers would have mass-baked bread and then distributed it, but this would have been to pre-existing customers who had previously supplied the flour.
Given that a fee was typically charged for the use of both the mill and the oven, baking could be somewhat lucrative. In France in particular, 'seignorial' ovens were popular (to the extent that private ovens could be banned, thus making the population reliant on the local lord) as a money-spinner, which could be doubly lucrative if the lord also owned the local mill. Even in an urban context, it's likely that you would purchase flour and then approach a baker rather than hope the market would have a baker with bread to spare.
Might a baker have bread ready to go and you just trade flour and some coins for it, or would your own flour be used to bake your own bread, and you have to wait for it?
Did local rural bakers receive coin for making and baking the bread or was it a barter where I give you 2 kilos of flour in exchange for 1 loaf of bread that used 1.5 kilos of flour?
