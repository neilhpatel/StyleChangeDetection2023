Related question if that’s okay, but why was almost the reverse true on the lead up to the French Revolution only a decade later? The king was pushing really hard for very unpopular tax reform, and he kept having to hire new ministers to try, and fail, to implement them before he’d fire them and hire a new one. But instead of being mad at the king, most protests blamed those policies on the nobility and on the finance and justice ministers. After the failed Assembly of the Notables, the people even marched saying “long live the king, down with Brienne and Lamoignon.” All this, despite the fact that the transcript of the Assembly of the Notables was published openly to the public, so it’s not like the king’s intentions were secret, and the king even did the typical absolutist thing of doing a lit de justice ceremony ordering the parlement to carry out his plan, but the public still largely blamed the ministers and nobility.
Good point about the tax reform “leveling” things out between the people and the nobility, but it was my impression that even though the people favored the taxes, they were still opposed to a monarch instituting tax reform without popular representation, or at least that’s what the book says, and tells me that one of the demands of the third state was popular representation when adjusting taxes. So is there a reason they seemed totally fine with the king exercising his power absolutely for this reform specifically, or do you think it’s more that they were more preoccupied with the hereditary privileges of the nobility that this one reform being pushed by the king wasn’t a big deal comparatively so they still saw the king as an “ally?”.
And when you think about it, it actually makes sense: the aim of the King was to assert his power, with no contestation, and the only potential resistance to that power was the nobility, the part of the population that actually had legitimate (in the context of a more than a thousand year old Kingdom) privileges and power since time immemorial. And what Louis XVI was doing was telling that nobility that they would have to give up privileges that they always had and start paying taxes like commoners.
If you're talking about the target of the aborted tax reform of Louis XVI cabinet, then you're talking about the nobility. And it turns out that one of the most important privilège of the nobility was to not be taxed by the King.
