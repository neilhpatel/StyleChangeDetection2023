The private sale exemption is not a loophole, it was a compromise that the gun controllers agreed to since only FFLs are allowed to use the database. This is why gun owners won't compromise with your side, today's compromise is tomorrow's "dangerous loophole" that needs to be banned.
And yet when it is put to the ballot gun control fails more often than it succeeds, particularly when its advocates are forced to provide specifics.
Anyway, gun owners have compromised more than enough given that the gun controllers have indicated they won't stop until every state has a de facto ban in place. You want more gun control laws, start by proposing something you are willing to repeal. Let's start with the NFA restrictions on suppressors and full auto firearms.
Now I’m not arguing against gun reform. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different outcomes; but simply waving a magic wand and saying all guns are illegal will not solve things. Because there will always be people with guns in this country, they’ll just be in the hands of criminals and the police. That isn’t even addressing the fact that confiscating firearms will involve a non-zero number of deaths in its execution.
