Do you imagine the bill would have passed had the funds been kept public rather than being awarded to private business to do the work? I suspect that the "bipartisan" part of "bipartisan infrastructure bill" would have been dropped so fast it would make your head spin.
Unfortunately there exists a vast swath of people who believe that private enterprise is vastly superior to public works, and since there are enough of them that they own a significant portion of Congress, you gotta play ball with them or you get nothing.
Do republicans want a socialist government that controls all aspects of our society so they can blame the government and hold the leaders accountable when anything goes wrong, or do they want freedom so corporations can do whatever the fuck they want and let the free market sort it out? (in this case I guess people would stop buying stuff that was transported by this train company to run them out of business?....and another, better, safer train company would seize that opportunity?).
How can you say democrats should be responsible for this but then cry and fight every time they try to pass laws to hold corporations accountable for their actions?
I need a Democrat who will defend labor, not betray them to Republican and corporate interests. Centrist Dems especially have to recognize when you reach critical mass that gets workers to strike, these aren't mundane demands of a spoiled child, but that something is seriously wrong, so wrong that a huge group of people gathered together to yell for help.
The backlash is some actually thought there was a party that was batting a bit for workers rights; and when they came up and said this shits crazy going to get people killed (removing safety, lack of maintenance (lower staff), and overwork with no rest) and he son'd them hard.
