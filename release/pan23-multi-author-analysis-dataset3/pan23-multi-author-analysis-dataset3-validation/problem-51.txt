Since the linked post by /u/iphikrates does an excellent job of covering the roles of fitness in Classical Greece, I'll restrict myself to a brief comment on artistic conventions here.
Michelangelo's David is of course inspired by the Greco-Roman practice of depicting certain figures - usual gods or eminent men - as nude and muscular. This practice was nothing more and nothing less than a convention - a stylization of reality intended to communicate something about the subject. A few classical men (especially young athletes - more on that in a moment) really did have six-packs and rippling muscles. The great majority did not; but if they were important enough, they might still be represented as a paragon of fitness.
Nudity, as mentioned, had many meanings, which shifted over time. In the classical period, most nudes represented gods or eminent citizens. During the Hellenic period, however, artistic nudity became more...well, artistic, applied to a variety of subjects in non-commemorative contexts (one thinks of the famous Dying Gaul and old fisherman sculptures). In the Hellenistic era, non-citizens (women, barbarians, etc) could and did appear in the nude. But this was much rarer in the classical era. A slave could have served as a nude model, but would not have a suitable subject for explicit depiction as a slave.
This is kind of tangential, but is there a reason it would be inappropriate to depict a slave in the nude? I read that the charioteer of Delphi may have been modeled on a slave, which is a possible explanation for why it was clothed.
