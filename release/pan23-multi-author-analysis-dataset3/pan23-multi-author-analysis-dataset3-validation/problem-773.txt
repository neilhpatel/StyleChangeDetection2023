Just make sure you don’t give them, or any third party they bring in (a supposed lawyer or notary or whatever), any kind of money. If you keep getting strung along for access to the money, the money doesn’t exist and it’s definitely a scam. The best scams are those where the mark wants to believe it’s true.
Honestly, it could be either a scam or legit. What I personally would do is offer her $10k, which I would actually give to her if she went by my terms and gave me the info. I'd make that offer and leave it at that, and refuse to discuss it further. If she is a druggy and it's real, she will probably end up taking that offer because $10k is better than nothing (but you better make sure you don't get robbed if you end up there in person.) If she never agreed to it, I'd assume it's a scam and move on with my life.
If they want half up front, then it’s a scam. Walk away. How did this so called family member find out about it? Why did it take 7 years? Who is the executor of the estate? All wills are probated and read by the attorney who prepared it. If your husband is in the will he would have been notified. How do you know this person is a family member? Did your husband have a business relationship with the deceased? Did they own real estate together, or have joint bank accounts or joint brokerage accounts? Was your husband the beneficiary of an insurance policy on the friend’s life? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then where could the $300,000 be located that hasn’t already come up during the last 7 years? Inactive accounts or unclaimed property are flagged by the financial institution and eventually escheated to the state of residence. Similarly, money kept in a safe deposit box where annual fees have not been paid will go to the state after the bank opens the box. This all sounds like a scam to me.
For sure it does sound like a scam. My only thing is that my husband knows the family member who called and has actually met them and dealt with them in person. They were very heavy into drugs when he had met them while living with his friend. We're not sure if the family member is still into drugs, but the my husband said that they have probably tried everything they could to get a hold of the money and can't because it's in his name which is why they turned to him. My husband looks at it as even if he split it with them after getting it it's still $150,000 more than what we had. I told my husband that if his friend left it to my husband - NOT the family member - then his friend absolutely did not want his family having it and he shouldn't split it with them because chances are they are still into drugs and what not. Said family member got his friend's house and didn't pay on it so it also got foreclosed on it and lost...the whole situation is just weird.
