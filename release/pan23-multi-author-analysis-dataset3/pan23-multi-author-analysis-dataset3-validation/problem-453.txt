But these dates, deadlines have been known, admin should have been recruiting like the census bureau does, hiring more staff, renting warehouses for processing as well as temp housing. Quote is weak.
Understand but is the Dept of Immigration out of money? DHS? Because this deadline has been on the horizon for all to see, just seems no one prepped for this and that is disturbing. Just because you can’t solve the immensity of immigration doesn’t mean you don’t fix what you can and ahead of time is always better.
There have been a lot of very smart people working on the immigration problem for a very long time and it just hasn't made much progress. The Biden administration has managed to get more funding, But there is a backlog of problems in addition to an increase in the number of immigrants applying at the border.
The US processes over a million immigration applicants per year. That's more than any other country. We also accept diverse races, religions, and ethnic groups.
The FY 2023 Budget includes $913.6M, 4,001 positions; and 3,014 full-time equivalents (FTE) in discretionary budget authority for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This funding level represents an increase of $444.1M above the FY 2022 President's Budget.
Budget has already been allocated for 2022, and the year is almost over. Despite efforts to improve, the immigration system is overstretched and inefficient; the average wait time for immigration cases has skyrocketed from around a year in 1998 to around two and a half years in 2021.
Surges at the border have strained resources more each year. Specialized jobs and facilities are required. The system has been overwhelmed for a long time.
