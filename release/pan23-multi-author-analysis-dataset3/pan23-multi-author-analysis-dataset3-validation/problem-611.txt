How do we know people didn't buy Houdinis authorship? Were letters sent insinuating as such (seems like they'd want to avoid publishing that) or did people criticise the style as being similar to Lovecraft in terms of pose (which I have been lead to believe was not very popular with Weird Tales' readers.
There was no criticism over the prose stylings in subsequent issues; Lovecraft was one of the most popular authors at Weird Tales based on fan response, it was mostly later critics that found his style a little purple-shading-into-ultraviolet.
Yeah, the editors moderated their own letters page ("The Eyrie") so no chance of that getting through, but the tone and style of the various "Houdini" pieces were so different, and Lovecraft's style so distinct, that it was a bit of an open secret. Lovecraft himself made no secret of the fact that he wrote it in letters of the period.
Houdini's association with Weird Tales largely ended as the pulp changed hands and a new editor, Farnsworth Wright, was brought on board; his association with Lovecraft would linger a bit longer, and Lovecraft and his friend C. M. Eddy Jr. were working on a manuscript for Houdini titled The Cancer of Superstition at the time of the great magician's death in 1926.
The editor changed the title, and Lovecraft lost the thread - as with many subsequent revisions, he couldn't resist putting his own spin on the narrative, and the story ends up being less about Houdini's great escapology skills than the real horrors he faces down below the sands of Egypt - but appeared (as "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs") in the double-size anniverary May-June-July 1924 issue of Weird Tales, a smashing success...under Houdini's name, although few people were fooled.
Struggling to recoup his losses from his failed film, Houdini entered into an agreement with Weird Tales, lending his name and likeness, penning brief articles disproving spiritualism, and allowing them to publish fanciful versions of some of his adventures - which were to be ghost-written by other writers and published under Houdini's name. (By some accounts, Houdini might also have claimed to own a stake in the publishing company, but there is no direct evidence of this.).
