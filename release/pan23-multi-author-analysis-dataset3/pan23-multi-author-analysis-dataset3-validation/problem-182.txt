You can still have whatever shindig you want a year from now, but as 10/23/21, the State of CA, and presumably whatever religion solemnized the marriage, considers you married.
So, all that boils down to is that you were 100%-married last Saturday, in the eyes of whatever religion performed the ceremony, and in the eyes of the state, even if you do manage to get a hold of the marriage license. (You really don't want to have a valid, yet unrecorded, marriage; that opens up a huge legal can of worms.) To undo your marriage, you'd likely need to get divorced; CA, like most states, offers annulment, ( ), but you do not appear to fit any of the criteria to obtain one.
CA Family Code Section 423 ( ) requires the officiant to return the licence, so after it was filled out and signed, it no longer belonged to you.
CA Family law 306: Except as provided in Section 307, a marriage shall be licensed, solemnized, and authenticated, and the authenticated marriage license shall be returned to the county recorder of the county where the marriage license was issued, as provided in this part. Noncompliance with this part by a nonparty to the marriage does not invalidate the marriage.
You'd really rather go through all the trouble to get your marriage annulled and then get married a second time, than just leave it be? This is astonishing.
