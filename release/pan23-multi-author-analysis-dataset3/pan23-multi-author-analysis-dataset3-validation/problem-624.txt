Noone believes Ukraine is coming through this unscathed. The losses borne by civilians alone are catastrophic. The damage to their infrastructure is immense. Their airforce is sadly outdated and although they have given a GREAT accounting of themselves, it's more that Russia hasn't properly utilized their air power. Same can be said with the ground war. Yes Ukraine has fought gallantly with weapons supplied by the west, but once again Russia has managed to mismanage their assets in ways that will be scoffed at for centuries.
1) Russia has tried to conquer Ukraine for expansionist reasons (which is to some extent filtered through Western media, but Putin's own speeches and media have only reinforced this idea).
Wouldn't it be easier for Putin to just... brainwash his people into believing that Russia has now successfully re-conquered all the old USSR territories? If anybody else says otherwise just fucking deny it. Lmfao.
I mean, nobody in Russia can dispute what Putin is saying, right? Fuck it, "Hello Russian people, today we invaded the world, the US is defeated. China submitted, everyone else is a vassal state to us, and Russia is great.".
Yep. That was his hail mary. Listen to mtg her buddy matt g. talk about cutting off Ukraine $$. Putin was hoping for enough of a midterm win to make that noise a reality.
