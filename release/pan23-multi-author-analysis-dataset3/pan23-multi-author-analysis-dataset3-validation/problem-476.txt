I'm going to talk about conditions in England, because that's the area that I know best. Bear in mind that the picture may be slightly different in other countries. In short, the answer is that marrying for love would have been far more common than many people might assume. What we know for certain is that 'peasant' or lower-class women tended to marry much later than noblewomen did: it was not uncommon for noblewomen to be betrothed during their childhood and married off in their early teens in order to secure advantageous political alliances or economically advantageous inheritances. For peasant women the picture was very different. Many young women would go into service in their early to mid teens, often moving from the countryside to towns. They might then work in service until their early twenties, at which point they would marry somebody of a similar age to themselves, and set up their own household. Service in this sense means more than just being a domestic servant - at a time when nearly all crafts and industries were carried out by individual craftsmen, from their own homes, service would very often involve learning a trade. Some trades, indeed, were dominated by women: for most of the 1300 and 1400s, for example, brewing was primarily carried out by women.

There are two important pieces of evidence to see medieval people seizing control of their own marriage decisions in some cases. First, plenty of marriage cases come up in late medieval canon courts where one person sues another claiming they had exchanged consent and are married. Second, in the Reformation/Counter-Reformation era, marriage-by-consent-alone goes right out. As European society became more focused on external social order ("social discipline" is the scholarly term), secret/impulsive/individual marriage decisions no longer fit.
