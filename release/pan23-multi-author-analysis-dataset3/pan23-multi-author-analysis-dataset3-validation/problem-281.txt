I'm sorry you're right that was probably unclear I've updated the body of my post. I just want to know if I have any ground to stand on or how I would pursue legal action.
That is incredibly helpful thank you! I didn't know I could sue both or that courts would even do that. What type of lawyer do you think I should consult? I'm also in the process of filing a complaint with the governing board for mortgage brokers.
You could also make a complaint against the broker with whoever regulates mortgage brokers in your province.
You COULD perhaps report the broker to the police for fraud. But, this could end up causing problems for your parents with their lender.
Ah, I see. Then in the ordinary course of things you'd sue both, and let the court sort out liability.
