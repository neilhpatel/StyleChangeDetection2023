/u/Crrpit already linked the digest (Which is maintained by one of the finest people I happen to be), and I myself linked the twitter and facebook down below. They showcase the many amazingly answered questions we get each week.
Edit: I'm hijacking my own top level thread because I just remembered two other things that might make your reading even more pleasurable. Firstly there's this fancy made by a community member. When installed it will actually change the comment count to better reflect how many actual comments are in the thread.
There is also the thing about the bot that always comment in the first comment of every thread. The sub if you read is aimed for questions that doesn't have a good answer with a preliminar search on Google or Wikipedia.
I saw a similar question a time ago, the response was that the sub doesn't allow half answers, or not referenced ones. So basically only people that have an authority in the field or good sources can respond. The point of all of these is actually to avoid being like r/askhistory, and keep experts and value their answers.
