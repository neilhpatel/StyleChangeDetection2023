As a linguist I only have one issue with your answer. You mention in your response that "I have known Scandinavian immigrants whose eldest children knew the language of their homeland, but the youngest ones never heard anything but English in their households.".
Edit: The point of my post is to say that usually, adults who immigrate to the US will maintain their native language as the main language of the home. But this does not affect the fact that their children become English speakers, or the fact that their grandchildren will almost certainly be native speakers of English, and will very possibly not be able to speak their grandparents language with any degree of fluency.
Emigrants without English as a native language arrived with an innate feature that made them stand out, and so learning English was a high priority: I have known Scandinavian immigrants whose eldest children knew the language of their homeland, but the youngest ones never heard anything but English in their households: the urge to blend in can be fierce for immigrants as they attempt to shed "innate" features such as language.
I have specialized in Northern Europeans in the leaving part, but from the point of view of the arrivals, there is obviously more diversity. Eastern Europeans tended to arrive later, so the difference of their experience was a matter of language/culture compounded by encountering a different America. Language and religion was often factors that enhanced the "otherness" of Eastern Europeans, and that forced them to address the issues they encountered, each in their own ways.
The celebration and/or recognition of ethnicity in the United States is a tricky matter. When it comes to people of European descent, a great deal of it comes down to choices of the participants and the community. This is particularly true of Protestant British immigrants: these people could blend in and become "Americans" - looking and acting a lot like white Americans who had been settled on the continent for generations, or they could decide to emphasize their origin.
