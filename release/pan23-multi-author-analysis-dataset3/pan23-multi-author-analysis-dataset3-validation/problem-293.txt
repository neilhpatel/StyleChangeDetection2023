”I didn’t say I was “sworn” in… I just sat down by myself, sat on a rusty nail and “swore” rather loudly “in” the chamber.”.
But congressman-elect, we have the clip of you saying specifically “I was sworn in.” How many lies do you intend to tell?
George Santos shared a falsehood on his first day on Capitol Hill: that he had been sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives. While the statement on his official website drew instant criticism because the New York Republican has been accused of fabricating key details of his biography, he wasn’t the only one to send out an erroneous announcement.
The mistake shows the potential pitfalls of scheduling press releases on the assumption Washinon politics will go smoothly.
No elected member of the House was sworn in Tuesday, including Rep.-elect Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as House Republicans, who secured the majority in November, failed to elect a speaker after McCarthy’s bid was thwarted. Incoming members cannot be sworn in until a speaker is chosen. The House is scheduled to convene at noon on Wednesday, and a fourth round of voting is expected.
Identical statements were posted on the websites of other incoming freshman lawmakers, including for Robert Garcia, a California Democrat; Michael Lawler, a New York Republican; and Yadira Caraveo, a Colorado Democrat.
