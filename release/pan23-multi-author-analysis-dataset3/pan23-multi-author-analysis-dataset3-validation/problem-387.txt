Many artworks are made with materials that degrade over time. For this reason it can be tricky to display objects that are very old, damaged, or at risk of decay if exposed to the public.
Trace amounts of acid in a paper or medium (paint etc) may not degrade an artwork within the artist's lifespan, but given enough time it will cause issues. Oxidation, when a work is exposed to air, can also cause problems -- this is why paper yellows with age, for example. High humidity obviously introduces moisture which is no good, but even worse is fluctuating humidity (when it rises and falls significantly) which can cause objects to warp and degrade.
Light, and especially sunlight, is harmful to the longevity of most things but is a particularly severe risk for organic artifacts, textiles, and works on paper like old books, drawings, prints, documents etc. If you see old documents on permanent exhibition it is probable that they are copies because being exposed to light 24/7 all year would fade them beyond repair. When displaying originals, museums often put these objects in rooms with dim lights and for short periods of time.
It's so weird for me to think about all the artifacts that a museum may have, and that only a small fraction is shown. It's almost like a crime. Like, I understand why not display damaged or fragile work, but if it's well preserved why not show it?
