To elaborate on your point regarding horses, it's worth noting just how much of a difference they made during the war. For logistical reasons, the British were never really able to field the sort of cavalry forces in the colonies as they could on, say, mainland Europe. Not only did this shortage make fighting battles more difficult, but it also made it nearly impossible to persue retreating Americans.
Typically, once one side broke off and began to retreat, the victor would send their cavalry into the disorganized mob and inflict further (often heavy) casualties. Without their cavalry at hand, the British couldn't give chase and the Americans were able to keep their losses to an absolute minimum when the battles didn't go in their favor. This made it difficult for the British to desisively defeat American armies, especially when, as you mentioned, American reenforcements were so plentiful towards the end of the war, and they could easily replenish the men lost in battle.
It should be pointed out that even decades after the revolutionary war a lack of cavalry beyond dragoons plagued the US army and was a big factor in why few of the battles of the American civil war were truly decisive, the inability of either side to successfully pursue enemy armies meant that even after significant defeats they tended to remain coherent military formations and would be reinforced back to fighting strenh. It’s easy to assume there was no use for cavalry in what to many was a proto-industrial war but just years later cavalry performed decisive roles in several European wars(Prusso-Austrian, Franco-Prussian, etc).
I’m not saying they should have had heavy cavalry, light cavalry should be perfectly capable of pursuit of a defeated enemy(heavy cavalry would actually not be as useful in a pursuit since the whole point of heavy cavalry is shock warfare) but the American cavalry was incapable of that pursuit, the terrain in which many battles of the American civil war were fought is actually comparable to say the terrain of the battle of Koniggratz, where the Prussians took over 20,000 prisoners, half of which were taken in the hour immediately after the battle by the Prussian cavalry.
I know that it was considered "common knowledge" at the time that there was no need for cold steel cavalry due to the rough and wooded terrain of the Eastern United States but that was primarily an argument against Napoleonic style cavalry forces which were very much a battlefield force to be reckoned with rather than a pursuit element. The fact that cavalry has been effectively used in Europe for 3000 years from the mountains of Greece to the Highlands of Scotland and the plains of Spain to the steppes of Crimea suggests that cavalry can very much be effectively used in just about any terrain. I mean John Sobiesky managed to charge 18000 cavalry over Kahlenberg which is basically a wooded hill in the Alps for gods sake (literally).
