Your landlord has no control over whether you file a claim with your insurance or not. That's between you and your insurance company.
That's between you and your insurance company, you would still be directly responsible to the landlord.
You have no control over whether your landlord pursues you themselves, or files with their insurance. That's between them and their insurance company. With a claim like this, it also makes relatively little difference, as the insurer is fairly likely to pay out, subrogate, and pursue you on behalf of the landlord.
If that's all the lease requires, and that's covered by your policy, then you performed the terms of the lease and cannot be evicted. That's separate from your liability for damage, though - it's up to _you_ to ensure your insurance, if any, meets _your_ needs.
If your policy, for some reason, doesn't include damage to your own unit, then you might find that you're about to eat some of the cost of the repairs. Given the amount, I would talk to a lawyer before responding to either your insurance or your landlord, as a policy like that is unusual, but it's not impossible that you've purchased a policy that left you exposed to this risk.
The reason I suggested that you speak to an insurance lawyer is that a policy covering the cost of damage to other units but not the cost of damage to your own is _passing_ weird, to the point that I suspect your adjuster is not being honest with you.
