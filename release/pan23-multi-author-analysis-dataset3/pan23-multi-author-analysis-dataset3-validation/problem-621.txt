Your opening, "there was no such thing as "Christians" in the first century" is kinda haunting me. I think you are referring to the fact that documents using the word "Christians" aren't found until the second century, e.g., Pliny the Younger's letters. But I am wondering how true your phrase may be in a broader sense of actually: no Christians yet.
We read Paul's letters as if they are to "Christian" churches, i.e., Christian churches as we understand "Christian" churches.
Paul never uses the words "Christian" or "Christianity." He says "in Christ," most of the time, and addresses his letters to "ekklesiai," which is a very generic word in Greek and is better translated "assembly" or "gathering" than "church." The book of Acts uses "the Way," and the one time the word "Christian" appears, it's written in such a way that it sounds like outsiders are calling them that, rather than an insider term.
I would say that even the assumption that early Jesus folk thought of themselves as Jews is really limiting, because while it's probably true for many of them, it wasn't for many others. Also, we have the same problem with "Jew" as we do with "Christian," which is that it's taken on a lot of meanings in the past 2000 years that may or may not be helpful for this period, in terms of understanding ideology and culture.
Also, just like the term “Christian,” the term “Roman empire” has a lot of modern assumptions and hindsight behind it that ancient people didn’t necessarily share, one aspect of which is ideological unity. People in the farther eastern provinces would probably have experienced Roman power very differently than people in Italy or even Greece, and people in Ephesus would have had a fundamentally different experience of Rome than people in Jerusalem. Many people in the empire would never have considered thinking of themselves as not Roman, no matter how they experienced it, and many others didn’t think of themselves as Roman at all even if they were very privileged. As groups, Christians and Romans were less unified than we tend to assume.
