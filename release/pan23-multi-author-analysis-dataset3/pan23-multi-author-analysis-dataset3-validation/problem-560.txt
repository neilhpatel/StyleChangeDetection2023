You’re welcome to think that. I’ve rented rooms from other people who are long term lease holders/residents and was always aware I was in a temporary position and didnt say IM HOME.
How do we have the same rights if I’m signed onto a lease and she’s just subletting from me. I have the power to ask her to leave, not vice versa. The landlord is aware that I would be renting the room out to someone month to month on a shorter term basis.
I follow that you’re the only one on the lease but most tenant-landlord lease agreements require any sublease to be approved by landlord.
Presuming you have a true sublease relation, (generally) you must follow the same eviction proceedings as provided for in your lease else specified in your sublease agreement.
There’s a lot more to this but I think starting with the contract between you and your landlord is the best place and (hopefully) the written agreement you formed between you and your co-tenant subleasee.
It’s Good that the landlord knew of your intent- but it’s still unclear if the landlord approved the sublet. Again - this is only important if (1) maine allows for this to be contracted and not innate in tenancy agreements and (2) your contract set forth a procedure for notice of sublet.
was there a written agreement between the two of you prior to her moving in outlining such terms and conditions? How is rent split? Utility responsibilities?
