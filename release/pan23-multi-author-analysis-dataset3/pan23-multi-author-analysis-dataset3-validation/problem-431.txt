Thanks for addressing the question . I believe I would say what is in the letter just more personable but it comes down to the same. I'm moving out as a result of ongoing noise, cigarette smoke (in an alleged smoke free building), and disturbances. I don't know the exact date yet but latest date is \_\_\_\_. I wouldn't be expanding on the letter as it's quite thorough. The end result is the same. I'm leaving, I have a new place. You won't pursue further rents and will return my deposit.

The first approach here is to contact the landlord and ask for a release from your lease. “This construction isn’t what I was going for; can we end the lease early?” is and approach that doesn’t compromise your case but gives you a chance to get peacefully out.
