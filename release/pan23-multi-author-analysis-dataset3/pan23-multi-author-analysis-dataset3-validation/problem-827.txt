First, contact the landlord regarding these charges. You don’t need to pay the full cost of carpet repair, you only need to pay the depreciated value. Was the carpet new when you moved in? Carpet has an expected life of around five years. So if the carpet was two years old when you moved in, and three years old when you moved out, there should be 2 years of use left. If the dog destroyed it, you owe the landlord for those lost 2 years, or 2/5 of the total price of the repair. They should have copies of those records, and the record of the repair costs for you. Why are you being charged carpet cleaning fees if the carpet was ripped out and replaced because it was torn?
Ask for copies of the repair bill for the window, and photographs of the damage. Does the cousin have any evidence that she didn’t cause the damage, like having it noted on a move-in report?
Once you have this information from the landlord, and agree on the charges, you may need to pay the full amount yourself. You can then sue the cousin in small claims using the information provided by the landlord.
Your only real option is for you and/or your girlfriend to pay for the damages and then sue your ex-roommate in small claims court. Save your pictures etc. for use there.
