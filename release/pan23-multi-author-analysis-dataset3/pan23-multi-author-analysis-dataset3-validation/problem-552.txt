If they do appear, they are required to tell the truth. If they don't tell the truth they could be charged with perjury. If they didn't tell the truth to the police during the investigation or deceived the police and telling the truth in court makes that obvious, they might be charged with obstruction of justice. In either of these two circumstances they may have the right to "take the Fifth" [Amendment] and not to testify in order to avoid incriminating themselves.

Has the person who took the transcripts shared copies electronically or told people about it electronically, and if so do you have copies to prove this?
