I won't speculate about what would happen if such forces met in battle. But the lesson most scholars have drawn from the encounter between the pike phalanx and the legion is that the latter's low-level tactical flexibility gave it an enormous edge against the relatively cumbersome, monolithic phalanx. This is because the phalanx was intended to win pitched battles against similarly monolithic formations - which was not what the Swiss pikeman was for, and which was not how the Swiss pikeman operated.
In the first few engagements between these two styles the Swiss formations, with veteran infantry and practiced tactics, tended to beat the Landsknecht. But once the German formations matured, they were more flexible and had more tools with which to fight the Swiss. The popularization of the Landsknecht style really signaled the collapse of Swiss dominance on the battlefield. While they were able to innovate, especially when in foreign service, the Swiss instead mirrored other European styles of warfare. This became especially true as we look forward into the high point of the Pike and Shot era, where formations were tailored to really maximize the advantages of both guns and pikes.
Compared with the pike formation use in the Classical world where the phalanx was a heavy hitting, slow moving unit, the two seems to be completely different types of units, created in different circumstances to serve different purposes - they only happen to use the same base weapon.
