Is your freedom worth more than the freedom of others to not die from your actions? Your freedom ends when you’re infringing on other peoples rights to not die from another persons “wants”.
Your choice is to not spend your time there. To come onto their private property they are allowed to set some rules. I’m not allowed to come bulldozing down your fence because I WANT to come onto your lawn. No generally it’s agreed that I ask permission. Private property is funny that way.
Edit: any store is a place of private business and can dictate the terms of being on their property.
If it is a private business you can just not go there. Your ability to access goods from a private business such as a grocery store is contingent on following the appropriate rules and regulations set forth by the establishment.
Good news is most businesses have pick up options now, so if wearing a mask is that much of an infringement to ya you can always be a patron where they have pick up options.
A mask is like a clothing item more than a “medical device.” An establishment requiring it is just like requiring shoes, pants, and/or shirts.
1) yes it's a medical device if it's a surgical mask but that doesn't mean a store can't make you wear one.
Face masks or other facial coverings does not meet FDA definition of a medical device. Please see for more information.
