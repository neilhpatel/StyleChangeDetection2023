France is a great example, they effectively decarbonised their entire electricity sector by embracing nuclear, and removed almost all reliance on foreign FF resources. Of course, they're still reliant on foreign uranium and thorium, but I these are generally from friendly stable countries AND they have multiple suppliers.
Honestly, I'm sure all this anti nuclear is just false flag from the fossil fuel industry. They paint nuclear as the boogeyman, when in reality nuclear could have killed fossil fuel in most technologically advanced countries (those that have the highest energy demand).
The problem is, the same kind of people opposed nuclear energy, effectively limiting the government's options to renewables (which in Germany's case can never cover 100% of energy needs) and (Russian) gas.
That is certainly a possibility, and I was toying with the idea that the whole German anti-nuclear stance was influenced by Russia which would (a) get a stable customer for its gas and (b) tie Germany close to itself politically. Well, that bombed, literally.
