You can discuss the war, just not sanctions. The G20 is to discuss issues that concern everyone like development or climate change. Sanctions are a Western thing, other countries won't follow them anyway so why bother discussing them?
If countries in the G20 don't feel comfortable discussing the Russia issue then they shouldn't even be in the G20. The G20 is literally about discussing the global economy, world issues & climate change among other things.
A lot of the "talks" that happen at the G20 also happen when it's not in session as well. All the Indian government will achieve in doing is not being at the big boy table when leaders meet for "lunches" and quietly discuss the biggest issue on the table.
Oh, do you mean that little BBC documentary THE MODI QUESTION that was banned in India and the Indian government raided the BBC offices in India for a "totally separate" reason??
nah. they're going to play the same game China is. In the past it was a strategic decision to purchase weapons of war from the soviets, and then the russians, and now they know they have to find new suppliers, but can game the sanctions by buying russian oil at a discount and selling the refined products to the west.
They are in this for India, not for russia. If they had arms to sell they would. but there's no reality where they ally and send in troops.
