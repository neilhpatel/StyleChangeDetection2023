From what I understand these are aircraft Russia built to be sold. They’ve been trying to offload these for a while now. Iran is giving drones, drone components and support in Ukraine so this deal is likely a handshake for the support..so I doubt Russia will miss on delivery. The Su-35 is still a very capable aircraft and should not be underestimated in the hands of a good pilot. However, since these birds were built for sale they most likely don’t have the hardware and other things built into them that would compensate for having non experienced pilots. These aircraft with Iranian pilots won’t really make Iran any more capable than they already are.
I did! Russia has been trying really hard to make their hardware marketable. They wish they raked in what nato countries did. Russia has a hard time finding friends to sell to.
The only positive for Iran on this is that their airspace is now more difficult to operate in. That’s it. The Su-35 is a 4.5 gen aircraft. An F-22 or an F-35 would fire the first shot before the Su-35 even knew it was there. Additionally, the high maneuverability of the Su-35 comes at a cost. It’s is extremely visible! So a modern AA system would be a major headache for this aircraft. Is it better than what iran has now? Sure. That’s it though.
That’s just demonstrably not true. They aren’t sending t62s into combat because they want to. They aren’t using smart munitions because they are running out. We’ve seen their ‘vast supplies’ and yet they can’t equip their drafted soldiers with uniforms. All that stuff was just rotting away on paper. If it ever existed, it’s long gone.
If we ignore Israel, Germany, UK, France, China, India... So everyone who doesn't buy Russia's leftovers, then sure, nobody has newer tanks than T62s..
Look at the present reality; Russia can’t resupply front line trips to fight a much smaller enemy. They can’t move ammo, They can’t move medical supplies or food. They are exhausting their surplus shit to make up for stuff they can’t produce, and there’s only so much shit left. They are throwing bodies for a pyrric victory in Soledar because they are getting disproportionately wrecked elsewhere (also the reason why they are targeting civilian infrastructure with their small number of precision guided shit).
Russia has been stealing from itself for years. They have been skimming off at every level of their military procurement and storage process. Their army is a paper tiger.
