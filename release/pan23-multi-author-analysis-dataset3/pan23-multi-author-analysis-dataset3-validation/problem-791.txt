This is an exciting question to answer although also embarrassing that the anarchist in my username is spelled incorrectly.
This is all history in living memory so I can tell you, I have met people who became punks from the 70s on, including the founders of America's two largest anarchist publishing houses, PM and AK Press, who have done more to revive anarchism in America than anyone else. I dunno how much is written about it, but as it's been passed to me orally, an interest in punk and politics led these people to anarchism, and their initially superficial engagement with the cultural posture of anarchism became a deeper engagement with its history and politics.
I would say lots of punk has become very disenfranchised and is definitely not anarchistic in nature, however there are very anarchistic groups like that of the folk punk culture that prioritize anarchism and anarchist thought over resemblance to traditional punk culture. that’s not to say that they aren’t punk and don’t identify with punk but they do prioritize anarchism in the most part. (most of the time, of course there are exceptions but as a group they can be defined as anarchist over punk, if anyone has a different opinion i’d love to discuss it).
Yeah, I think I should have been a little more explicit in what is really my thesis about this issue: Punk is the thing that revived anarchism, full stop.
i think punk has a bit more genuine interplay and interest in anarchism than this comment suggests. it's maybe best thought of as a fistful of aesthetic appropriation by the Sex Pistols mirrored by an organic and unrelated flowering of interest in anarchism and related ideas by other participants.
I think it should be noted that other than the title of a song the Sex Pistols had nothing really to do with the intersection of punk subculture and anarchism. Crass would be where to start looking at that, many of those people were former hippies living in a commune. I’m not sure anyone active in the subculture would even consider the Sex Pistols a punk band by any modern criteria.
I tried to illustrate that by mentioning that AK and PM were founded by punks, and by suggesting that sincere anarcho-punk bands like Crass were as important as fake ones like the Sex Pistols. I don't think that punk has "ruined anarchism" or anything, but that it is the single greatest contributing factor to anarchism being a subculture, and that overall it's a bit of a double edged sword.
and this isn’t to say that there aren’t punk bands who are anarchists either bands like crass, the dead kennedy’s, and the reagan youth are all really good examples of anarchist bands that also identify as part of punk culture.
it probably is a double-edged sword from non-punk anarchists' reputation's perspective, but i just wanted to gesture (poorly, as it turns out) at the idea that many anarchist and anarchist-adjacent ideas are at the core of what punk has meant for decades. a strong DIY culture, anti-commercialism, self-reliance, and community-oriented living are all indisputably anarchist principles and defining features of punk. the fact that colorful hair, piercings, stick-and-poke tattoos, and patched-up vests are significantly more visible should not suggest that the interest in legitimate anarchist thought is any less important to many (although certainly not most) of the people OP is referring to.
As for an anarchist society it really depends on who you ask; anarchists have generally been more interested in working on the world as it is rather than sketching out a future. Anarchism is a critical disciplined concerned with dynamics of domination so most anarchists would be skeptical of whatever one might propose.
More recently I think Against Me is much beloved by many anarchists though their 'anarchist credentials' have been challenged by various people at different times and some anarchists think that they repudiated anarchism.
Some anarchists would say 'only the technology I can produce myself' but that's a recent development in anarchism and represents a minority opinion within anarchism.
As for me, I tend to think of the transition to anarchism involving prefigurative politics, that is, that the means of establishing an anarchist society will match the intended end (quite unlike an ideology where, say, the state has to get bigger before withering away.).
