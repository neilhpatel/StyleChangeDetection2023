Your veins are coursing with plastic, weather patterns are shifting into unpredictability that threatens the food supply, and giant methane craters are exploding in the tundra, but have you TRIED just BEING OPTIMISTIC? .
Yeah. It's hard to overstate how good the US and Russia have been dismantling their arsenals from Cold War peaks. Both have drawn down over 90% of their nuclear weapons, and the largest bottleneck in removing more is that dismantling the things is slow and expensive.
The United States in the 60's had over 30k nuclear bombs or warheads and by 1986 the Soviets had 45k nuclear bombs and warheads. Many of these were tactical nukes meant to be used by fighter jets or short range missiles on the frontline of battles.
Because Russian and the United States agreed to stop building more nukes and shrink their arsenal(The united States in the 60's had 30k nuclear warheads and the Russians caught up in the 80's with 45k nuclear warheads).
Why is China building more nukes while the US and Russia are dramatically decreasing nuclear arsenals?
Why is China refusing a weapons ceiling on nuclear weapons and far outpacing other secondary nuclear powers production in peacetime?
And since we're talking about fairness, if we consider the fact that China has played a roll in nuclear proliferation in Pakistan and North Korea, why should it stop there?
This is despite the US convincing South Korea to not pursue domestic nuclear weapons that could threaten China and North Korea.
Also, China is also heavily responsible for the nuclear proliferation of North Korea, which now has anywhere from 40-114 Nuclear weapons and is now actively threatening numerous states.
Expanding a historical nuclear arsenal by 438% in 13 years during peacetime and disarmament is anything but reasonable, especially from a nation that's openly stated a commitment to a Ukraine-style invasion of Taiwan and has an expansionistic mindset (9-Dash Line).
