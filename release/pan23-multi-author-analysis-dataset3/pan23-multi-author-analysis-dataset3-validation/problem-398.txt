Ok i am going to contribute for the kid and be there but how can i be sure i wont get put on child support even if i am contributing, Thanks for your reply.
Instead of worrying about paying child support, first be sure the child is yours. If it is not, and you’re barely around and paying here and there, the child will grow up thinking you’re a deadbeat. That’s not something you should wish on them. Then if it is yours, child support should be no problem as that is what parents do... support their child.
First of all, she does not put you on child support. Child support is a legal obligation for parents of a child to financially support said child. And from your post that would be your obligation not her whim.
I’m not sure what you’re asking here. Are you saying you would give the mother spare money just as long as you don’t get a child support order? That’s not exactly how this works.
However, most of this story doesn’t read as someone being straightforward with you. I would suggest you petition the court for a paternity test and custody (should those results be positive). If this is your child, then it is now also your responsibility for which helping to raise them which should be a priority.
If the mother is on state aid they will automatically seek out the father in Illinois and start the process for ordering child support. If you seek shared custody then an order will most likely be entered as well. The courts are concerned about the best interests of the child which includes financial, parental and familial support.
