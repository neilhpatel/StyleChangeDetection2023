You contact the police (with the assistance of your parents. They NEED to know what's going on). Report what you know. The victims should file their own report(s)- but you tell the police what you know, i.e. "On February 30th, 2019, I witnessed Charles (the accused) forcibly kiss Shirly (Victim 1).".
Right. /u/alrightdasuhdascool has these people making statements to him, but the police's first step is to do what? Yep, to interview the victim. If there's no victim to speak to, there's nothing they can really do. They're not going to interrogate every woman at the school.
The school board is going to say "what is this mountain of 'evidence' and what are we supposed to do, what did the police say?" You are wasting time and decreasing the chances that any justice happens, by dragging your feet about going to the police (or really, convincing victims to not go to the police) and by attempting to gather evidence without using proper protocols. These so-called "prominent accounts" may not even be admissible. You need to stop and let the state handle it, because as said above, you could be decreasing not increases the chances that this person sees any justice. Good luck.
