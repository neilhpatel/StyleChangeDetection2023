Emancipation is not something you obtain to get away from your parents so you can support yourself, it's something you obtain AFTER you have already been supporting yourself. This means that you have a full time job and have been living on your own and paying all of your own bills. If you are not doing this, you will not be emancipated. If you are doing these things, then by the time you get through the court system you will likely be 18 and able to leave home anyway.
In fairness, these are risks you will also face in less than a year, unless you and your parents agree you should live at home after you turn 18. But, for now, that can be later's problem. Free room and board is valuable no matter how you slice it, so long as you're safe under your parents' roof.
Emancipation also will not change who you are. Only _you_ can do that. If you are struggling, that's alright. If you are having trouble with drugs, that's alright, too, in a sense, or at least it's understandable. Emancipation, however, will not fix any of that. It'll only make you homeless, on top of it, unless you can find a job and an apartment on top of your schooling. It will, in other words, make your life harder, earlier.
Emancipation is mostly legal recognition for minors who are already _de facto_ independent of their parents and who are able to provide for themselves. A student who is failing in classes and living at home is not likely to be made independent prematurely, because it sets them up for failure.
I'm not going to say you need to listen to your parents. If that was what was going to help, I don't think you'd be in that situation. I do think you need more support, though, and not less. Are there any youth groups nearby that do things you care about? Does your school have a counsellor or any connections with a social worker you could talk to? It's clear you need help, and it doesn't sound like your parents are equipped to give you the help you need. You deserve support that works for you, wherever it comes from.
