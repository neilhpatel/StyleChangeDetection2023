And sadly, no. Our property management office signed a contract with the ISP saying that the residents aren’t allowed to use any other ISP. Something that we were unaware of; that isn’t mention at all in the lease.
Sorry to bother you again, but if you don’t mind, I have another question. So coincidentally, the building’s internet came back on today and they sent out an email saying it’s been fixed and that they’re doing what they can so it doesn’t happen again (obviously lying). But the problem is, the internet is the worst it has ever been. So bad, it’s like having no internet. Our download speed is 3.22 mbps. After a few tests, that was the first one that hit 3. Our upload is 22.01 mbps. Is there any minimum quality of internet that must be met if internet is forced on you?
I don’t think it possible for them to average at 25 mbps though. Their service caps out at 25, so with so many people being on it, it can’t actually hit that. And when we googled their average speeds nationally, it was at 21.1 mbps.
Exactly, the latest definition in 2021 IS 25 Mbps, so since their agreement is for that, they ARE providing high speed internet. For your gaming and streaming, you likely want more than 25Mbps. Also, it simply needs to AVERAGE that as a download speed.
I thought high speed internet was 25 mbps. If they can’t ever hit that because of there always people being on it, then how does that count as high speed?
