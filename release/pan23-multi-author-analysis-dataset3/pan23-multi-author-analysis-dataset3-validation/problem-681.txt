Whatever, Netflix can show whatever it wants, I just hope people will be smart enough to know the facts and the whole picture.
Agreed that both sides did their share of bad. But portraying Palestinians as poor victims being "Cleansed" by the evil Israeli soldiers is a complete injustice to reality.
Portray Israelis "Ethnic cleansing" Palestinians, while casually forgetting to show the fact it was after a war declared by the Palestinians and 7 other Arab nations (!), with the publicly stated goal of genocide for the Jews.
Oh so palestinians declared genocidal war to Israelis, that makes right for Israelis to declare genocidal war to palestinians. Is their god given right.
oh well, my bad. I guess its really nice Israelies didn't attempt genocide. Considering all atrocities in all these years, imagine if they did.
How easy is to put all palestinians in the same bag. Most palestinians at the time had little to say on the matter, yet the civilians are the one to suffer the consequences of the decisions of their corrupt leaders, for several generations now.
