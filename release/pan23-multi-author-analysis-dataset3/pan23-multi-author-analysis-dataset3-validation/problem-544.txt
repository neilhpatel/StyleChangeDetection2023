Re: pest hunting - cats are given protections in various hadiths and also positively mentioned in the talmud, so I suspect it isn't only pest hunting that caused suspicion of dogs.
I'm personally skeptical of the connection between Muslim regard of dogs as ritually unclean (a view it shares with Judaism which can be traced to the dog's role as a pest-hunter) and Zoroastrian reverence of dogs.
The claim that anti-dog attitudes in Islam is due to contact with Zoroastrians is one I have never been able to substantiate - Judaism has similar concerns of ritual purity wrt dogs.
Mary Boyce, a scholar of Zoroastrianism, says it's likely Islam adopted a hostile attitude towards dogs due to the Zoroastrian respect for dogs. In her book Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, page 158 says early Islam was not anti-dogs, and it was something Islamic scripture adopted later on when they came into contact with Zoroastrians.
It seems plausible enough that some Muslims would have provoked Zoroastrians by maltreating dogs, but it's really a stretch to think this was such a systematic practice. From what I have seen, if local amirs or even sometimes more powerful rulers were intent on forcibly converting (or enslaving, or depriving of property...) Zoroastrians, they just went ahead and did it.
