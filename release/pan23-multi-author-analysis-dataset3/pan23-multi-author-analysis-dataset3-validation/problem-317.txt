There is already open evidence of tax evasion by Trump prosecuted successfully by the DOJ on a co-conspirator: Michael Cohen.
This deliberate concealment of the program from congress, even after being order to testify, was actually a large part of the justification for the courts allowing the release of Trump’s taxes. The provable fact that there was a secret tax program being concealed from congress was what congress used to prove there was a legitimate legislative purpose for retrieving presidential returns. It resulted in unanimous votes at every level of appeal to allow congress to see Trump’s returns.
That was actually tried and the results were utterly infuriating. The mandatory audit program has been, and continues to be deliberately concealed from congress. Describing how the program works, when returns are and are not audited, and how the audits are conducted do not require any confidential data to be revealed. And yet the head of the IRS has said for years that he’s not at liberty to discuss the program with congress because the tax returns are confidential.
You mean his claim he made in 2015/2016 when running for President that the IRS publicly explained wouldn’t keep him from disclosing his tax returns?
They didn’t do them for the first two fucking years and didn’t start doing them until a Democrat took over the House Ways and Means Committee and asked where they were.
