no, what's going is simpler. He is still a US citizen and none of the 'law' which is lorded over us here in the states was suspended when he decided to do this bullshit. The prosecuters are loathe to carry on with the the charade we know as the rule of law because trump is such a big target, taking him on and winning in legal way we all know and love will unleash all these rich people's aggressive nastyiness on each other. What's holding it all back is their acceptance of their their take on the rule of law...which again, simply, means we do what we want, you do what we say.. That's the true rule of law and that's what's fighting against trump before in public. The lawyers, the legal system, is staffed by true believers - people who dedicated their lives and minds to thinking up all these legal magesteria, bits of rules and case laws, they've been convinced it all matters against someone, the rich like Trump, who literally never had any intention to follow the rules or anyone tell him no. But these lawyers, these judges, these people, all understand, had the same ivy league educations in real politics etc, they all know the threat he's giving them and they are just waiting, judging and settting up for it. That's the game their playing.
That's why they play the race card. If the proles ever wised up and saw what was happening Trump and his ilk would be strung up in quick order.
Doesn't matter what country. The wealthy get away with everything, never pay a price. If you're poor, or not white you'll be sure to pay no matter what.
