You are right. Not worth it. No reason to embrace anything new. It’s not like the government incentivizes anything else. Harvesting oil is clearly ideal long term and tech never grows and improves with funding so what is the point. Fuck, put lead back in gas. It never hurt anybody and catalytic converters were just big government overreach. Not sure why we even made advances in petroleum chemistry starting in the 70s…just cost money. Leaded gas is good enough for North Korea and Afghanistan and Iraq so clearly we are morons ripping ourself off for no real reason…oh wait even those countries are making an effort. We would be stupid to even try if there wasn’t a magical perfect solution already funded that required zero improvement. That’s why I don’t bitch about oil wars because they just make sense and it would be moronic to encourage energy change and also regulate resource acquisition and fund tech to minimize the need for detrimental human activity. I’m all about going back to sail based ocean navigation too because who is the government to tell us anything else is possible and to stay industrially relevant.
Who looks after gasoline and diesel? Where did that infrastructure come from? What is the difference? Government uses subsidies to incentivize business and that is how you grow and stay relevant as the world’s tech changes. That is sort of their point.
Ok so my question still stands unless your point is that adapting is stupid and nobody should start investing and incentivizing new tech. Your comment agrees with my point…it takes time…but you have to start doing it or you get left behind. I feel like you are arguing with me while agreeing with what I said.
I’m not arguing that at all. I encourage the transition . I’m only bringing up the fact that there are challenges in doing it. Norway has oil wealth to highly subsidize new car purchases, that isn’t the case everywhere. I’m in Canada, having a coast to coast charging network has started, but nowhere near enough to satisfy everyone suddenly switching over. And the fact, if you want an EV, you’ll be waiting for a few years and can’t count on a $38,000 subsidy to purchase. So it’s also expensive, especially considering the economic climate we’re in.
Oil and gas have been around for many, many years. EV is a new technology requiring totally new infrastructure. The world doesn't change on a dime, and there are many companies, politicians who still advocate for no change. That's where the problem arises.
The EV battery recycling is starting, but needs to keep up with demand. Just like charging infrastructure does. That’s my only point in this. And unfortunately there’s politicians still fighting any change.
