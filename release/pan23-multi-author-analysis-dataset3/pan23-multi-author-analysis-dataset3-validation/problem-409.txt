The CCP welded their own civilians into their apartment buildings to enforce Covid lockdowns up until December, and when a fire broke out and killed some people in a western city they denied it and stomped out protests against the lockdowns. This happened with uniform support over the entire country of over 1 billion people. Sure there is one party in the US that is constantly trying to remove rights, but looking into both the US and China from the outside and pretending that the US does not have much greater freedom than China is stupid. Honestly, seeing another European trying to shit on the US for what is otherwise a clear distinction makes you look clownish too.
Oh yeah? Let's discuss this then. There are some 500 million + surveillance cameras in China, for a population of over 1 billion. How many surveillance cameras are in the US? China has been developing advanced AI facial recognition to track as many individuals that they can, and use that to their effect whenever it is necessary to remove dissidents. This has been so prevalent that recently there have been students who designed T-shirts to confuse the camera's facial-tracking ability. Have you heard of We-Chat, the native Chinese app that citizens use for everything from text conversations and buying groceries, etc? This app makes some things more convenient, but it tracks everything. Everyone you are in contact with, the locations you visit and all your messages and calls. If you say anything that disapproves of the leadership you are arrested and interrogated. Do you think the protestors from last year, who were caught on the many cameras in the cities they were in, what do you think the authorities simply had to use to find them?
I did not write that out correctly; the CCP has a fully-agreed upon motive to remove dissidents from the population. There is no disagreement about this within the ruling class, it is party policy no matter who you are or where you are in China.
I feel like if TikTok was owned by the Chinese government the way you think it is, they wouldn’t have had the problems with the Chinese government they’ve had.
My country doesn’t have a two-party system which makes it harder to influence the system than it does yours. Any government, regardless of which end of the political spectrum it exists on, needs to work with the other parties to get anything done.
