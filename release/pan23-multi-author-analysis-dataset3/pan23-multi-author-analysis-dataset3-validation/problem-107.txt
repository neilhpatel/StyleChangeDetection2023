Thank you for your consideration. I'm having trouble finding what a reasonable fine would be for violating the covenants. Any recommendations on how to calculate a reasonable fine?
Good advice, thank you. If we found out which agency Jammy Dodger is going through to rent and sent them a notice that Jammy Dodger is not allowed to lease, do we open ourselves up to tortious interference?
Maybe they could compel the owner not to \renew\ the lease, but they cannot force the breaking of a legally executed lease.
Can the board get an injunction against the homeowner to terminate the lease early, subject to lease provisions?
The HOA cannot force the tenant out, only the property owner or the courts can do that. If the owner leases the property you may be able to fine the owner but you cannot do a thing to the tenant.
What's likely is that your HOA will act against the owner, not the tenant. Once any procedural irregularities are ironed out, if the owner is in violation of the HOA's rules, (see clause 11), which create a debt towards the HOA owed by the owner. If that debt goes unpaid, the HOA can place a lien against the property; if the debt grows to be substantial and the HOA feels it's in their interests to spend the money, the HOA can foreclose on that lien to force the sale of the property.
