While your second point may well be true, the first seems dubious? Or at least, the very beginning of it, about the electoral system. The point about parties fighting for workers votes along other lines may be true.
New Zealand used FPP until 1996 (and now uses a mixed system, not PR). The two largest parties are the National Party and the Labour Party, again a party founded to defend workers rights, and one which, while not radically socialist, has given NZ stronger worker protections than the US.
1.Generally, workers' interests are promoted by class-based parties of the left, which fare better under proportional representation (PR) compared to first past the post as in the US. (Notice how most countries in Scandinavia and Continental Europe have PR). This is because under first past the post voters' interests can be aggregated along multiple location-based criteria, and social class is only one of them. You need to have electoral districts segregated by class in order for left-wing parties to strive under first past the post (which was not the case in the US).
I think that if we were to dive deeper into the histories of class formation in the FPP countries that you mentioned, we would find explanations for the differences, but those would be highly heterogeneous.
I certainly agree with your point that there are differences within the group of countries with FPP, but we need to separate the two points.
My point was mainly about the differences between PR and FPP. FPP certainly tends to produce more right-wing governments. (2006) show that in 17 advanced democracies between 1945 and 1998, among the countries with PR the ratio of right to left-wing governments, was 0.26 (i.e. more left-wing), whereas among the countries with FPP it was 0.75 (i.e. more right-wing).
