So their political system depends entirely on individual skill at intrigue and success within infighting to move forward? That makes the government sound even less stable.
There's no case where the saudi situation is better than just having strict, clear succession laws and then following them.
The running of the Wilson administration for the year after his debilitating stroke happened behind closed doors as well, but the lack of clear leadership at suck a critical time in the immediate aftermath of the first world war probably had wide-ranging impacts on global affairs.
Here in the States a terrorist or hostile power could slaughter half our government and we'd have things back running within weeks, because we have such clear protocols. ).
Yeah. Maybe they'll start building some of the building at this side, but that's a big maybe. I wouldn't be surprised if they dig out a significant amount of the line, but that won't mean anything if they don't build something to stop the sand from coming back lol.
We're running out of the right kind of sand for making concrete, it's expected to be a huge issue in the not too distant future.
Obviously not double but if a country with endless cash wants another concrete factory built I'm pretty sure it can happen.
