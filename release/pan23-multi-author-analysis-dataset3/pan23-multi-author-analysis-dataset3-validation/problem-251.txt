Plus the dems have a chance to pull the ole reddit switcharoo and say that because the nation was founded by the use of the smoothbore flintlock musket during our revolution that should be the national gun. Or maybe the Kentucky rifle giving the south a bit of a bone.
We have state and national things. state flowers and animals and even the national bird. Yeah it's dumb and just pandering but it isn't like having a national "thing" is entirely alien.
Personally I would say that the national gun of America should either be the classic 1911 or the M1 garand. Because of their history. Something a bit more special than the Honda civic of rifles.
Yes, AR-15s are American. Other countries produce knock-offs, but the OG was made by Colt. That said, it's not an iconic American gun. It's claim to fame is that it looks like an iconic American gun, but an AR-15 is not a M16.
National gun is silly but if you want American gun you should go with something that looks like a cowboy in an old Western had in his holster.
While I love the 1911, I think the Peacemaker, visually, makes the most sense as an American gun that is recognizable. Putting a 1911 up there is going to look pretty generic. An M4/M16 style gun looks pretty American though, I associate those rifles with the US military. Really a winchester 3030 would probably work as well, that's a pretty iconic gun.
All this shit is pretty dumb though. The eagle's already got arrows. The fucked up think about the AR-15 is that it's primarily used in domestic terror attacks, it's not used as a global show of force, it's an indication of "hey, move here and maybe you'll get shot by one of these while innocently ordering McDonalds", not "if you are our enemy get ready for our bump stock modified SEMI-auto small caliber rifle".
I feel like you either need to go with a classic American gun, or a true expression of US might, in which case, I think we should just stick an F-22 there or something, maybe a drone or a ballistic missile.
