You might want to inventory your home by walking through every room and outside with a video camera in case they take offense to being asked to leave and start stealing or wrecking the place. Desperate people do desperate things.
Keep track of all dates and happenings related to their being there. The date they moved in, what they said their plans were, the date you asked them to leave, and what was said, etc.
There’s a good chance you’re violating your lease with your landlord, so explain to them you’ll lose the place if they don’t move out.
Forcing out or preventing one of your tenants from accessing their home is in the realm of an illegal self-help eviction that has a good chance of biting you in the ass, if that's what you're getting at here.
If you want them gone, I would recommend you go the purely legal route with either a cash-for-keys arrangement, or proper, advance notice to vacate followed by an eviction.
An alternative to advance notice followed by an eviction is to offer them something of value (generally, a gigantic pile of cash or whatever) to leave of their own accord, payable only once they and all their stuff are fully moved out and they're standing outside your front door handing the keys back.
They may be your tenants at this point, meaning they'd be entitled to advance notice (commonly 30 days, but highly location-dependent) to vacate from you followed by a formal eviction proceeding in court if they refuse to leave after that amount of time.
read on another post, rather than 30 days notice and then filing for eviction, give them 30 days notice that you will be charging rent. then if they dont pay you can file for eviction for non-payment of rent and take them to court after the eviction to get the back rent. Eviction can take several months.
