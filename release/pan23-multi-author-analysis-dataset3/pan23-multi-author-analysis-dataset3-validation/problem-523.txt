If No, then NTA, as that's just normal way of life. I hope you also brought your army and castle with you to your new employer's side. Your old employer should be trying to buy you back.
If Yes, then YTA. I don't know care what your excuses/reasons are, that's just cowardice. Your head should be on a pike.
We need to know the exact circumstances you went to your new employers. Specifically did you do so during the middle of an active campaign?
Okay, look it was during an active campaign and I know that sounds bad, but I mean, what else was I supposed to do? Wait till the campaign was over when the opportunity to leverage myself a nice promotion and pay bump had passed me by? Unlikely And besides, it's not like my old employer was even inconvenienced by my jumping ship In fact, they got wind of it right before I left! As a result, no lasting damage took place by my departure.
She's been very supportive of my choice to jump ship. In fact, she's been incredibly helpful in helping me jump over to my new employer by putting me in touch with one of their recruiters who she happened to be friends with. What are the odds?!?
