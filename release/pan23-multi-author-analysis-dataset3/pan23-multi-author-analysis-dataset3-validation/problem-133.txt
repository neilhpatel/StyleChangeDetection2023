Funny enough, that is somewhat re-assuring to me. It is a critical mass where it cannot be outright shunned and silenced in the society, but I know that I have more people behind me on my side than I do in front of me in opposition.
Our culture is just now starting to shed that baggage, but it definitely isnâ€™t more than 75% of people and I fear it might only be half or worse.
Fascism was the common element as Europe & their Colonies transitioned from tribal republics, empires, serfdom, and capitalism. The racism and the feelings of supremacy have always been there and driven the political agenda.
racism and white supremacy are aspects of western oriented fascism... but it is fascism none the less. all of us in marginalized, racialized, or otherized by this system understand it. we feel it in our bones.
saw some PPRI polling yesterday that placed it at 29% actual fascist adherents, and another 6% of fascist sympathizers... 35% total...
the trick is getting the dominant culture... the "normal" people to recognize all of the abnormal inhuman shit that they allow because it doesn't directly affect them.
