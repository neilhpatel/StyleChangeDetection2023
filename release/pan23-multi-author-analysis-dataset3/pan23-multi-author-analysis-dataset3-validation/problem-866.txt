The answer to that lies in the focus of the political and historical centres of both cultural regions.
Even minding that, in Denmark the nobility pretty much spoke only german until the nationalization in the 19. century.
Thanks to their important position in trade and their occasionally important position in politics, Denmark, despite seeming like a very small country today, maintained its independence â€” at least from Germany. With the rise of the early modern era the possibility of a new culture coming to dominate Denmark became lesser, and so, even today, Danes are Scandinavians and not Germans.
First, I'll explain why crossing the straits in Denmark is not a very big deal, then I'll explain how scandinavian culture came to differentiate itself from german culture.
It is always risky to speculate, but I would like to claim that if the Danes had not displaced the Heruli, then it is plausible that modern day Denmark would be more Germanic than Scandinavian.
As the Germanic peoples entered the iron age, the first mention of the Danes comes, and these were apparently of the same people as the Suetidi/Suehans (Swedes), having displaced the Herul people.
