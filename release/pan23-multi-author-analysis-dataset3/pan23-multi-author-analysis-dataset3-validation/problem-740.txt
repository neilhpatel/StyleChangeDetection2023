Very much agree. Maintaining a beachhead as well as an almost constant chain of supply to an island is beyond a tough task. Bring in the certain possibility of bombing runs and naval artillery from Taiwan and whoever else joins the fray, you got yourself a new corral reef made out of Chinese equipment.
For China to take Taiwan it'll have to either conduct a brutal air war in which the island is bombed until the rubble bounces or they'll have to land troops on the beach-heads.
Taiwan's own anti-aircraft capabilities might need some work, but as the entire country is comfortably within range of US airbases on Okinawa, China would have to fight hard for air superiority should the US become involved.
All of which means that, in order to take Taiwan, especially out from under American protection, China would have to be willing to take MASSIVE losses, not just of men, but of difficult to replace military hardware.
I think that China knows that it needs to get some experience in actual warfighting before it takes the plunge into "reintegration" of Taiwan.
If China doesn't launch any expeditionary armed conflicts, the odds of reintegrating Taiwan by military force are essentially 0.
If China wants to retake Taiwan by 2049, they are going to need to have at least one "small war" under their belt, if not two or three before \2040. Since ticking off India would be a "big war" I would expect that China would probably focus on Africa instead, at least for their first foray into Armed conflict in generations.
And unless the Chinese are willing to escalate that conflict into strikes against the American west coast, the conflict will be extremely one-sided in terms of who suffers the long term losses.
I thought that would draw more toward the line of, the two warring countries have irreconcilably different politics that neither is willing to easily give ground, thereby causing such a war to escalate violently.
