As far as the UK goes, it is taught at university level as good practice in essay writing and discussions. I'll give some reasons people have told me for this:
I'm using the term in a (post-)New Left sense following the Bourdieulian use to describe unfixed definitions holding both cultural and social influences. For instance, "Slave" acts as a degrading term implying a social structure of power that we do not adhere to in many societies; previously, "Slave" had been a legal term denoting neither moral (in Western Imperialism) nor ethical degradation (for traders) and implied an economic wealth.
Firstly, with "enslaver" and "slave owner" we're dealing with a matter of perception in regards to what a person is referred to when subjected to slave systems. The term "slave owner" clearly implies two things, that there are slaves and that you can own one. The problems with this for contemporary society relate to morality and legality. In terms of morality, we understand that no-one is merely a "slave", or ever was, they are 'enslaved people' as the moral blame is moved to the perpetrator, being the "enslaver" (i.e. the one in the wrong). It also recognises and breaks down the power system of "owner" in that we now recognise no legal rights to own "slaves" and, relating back to morality, no authority to justify this. A historians use of the term "enslaver" therefore is a dialectic turn that recognises both the humanity of the enslaved and the power and legal systems which upheld the institution of slave ownership.
That distinction wouldn't apply to "enslaver"/"slave-owner", since slave-owners generally had agency, being wealthy and able to free their slaves at will.
