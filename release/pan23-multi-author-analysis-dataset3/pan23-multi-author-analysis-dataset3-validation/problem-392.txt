They could have but it’s easier and cheaper to deal with one plane full of angry passengers than to deal with all the problems that come from having an aircraft in the wrong place.
Granted, the airline is only liable for the price of the ticket, so disrupting a shitload of other flights doesn’t compare to the cost of just flying back and refunding people’s tickets.
Returning probably affected the airline less than diverting, but it almost certain harmed the passengers on this flight more.
(ANZ will say, probably correctly, that diverting would have forced them to cancel the return flight, harming all of the JFK-Auckland passengers. But I'd argue that canceling a flight in advance hurts a passenger less than making them sit on a flight to nowhere for 16 hours.).
I think that operations folks sometimes disregard the impact on passengers of being forced to return or divert to an unnecessarily far destination that is more convenient for the carrier. That sort of "soft" factor is harder to calculate than operational disruptions.
I'm guessing that diverting to LA or Houston would have meant that the pilots could not legally fly the plane onward to New York or back to Auckland without taking a rest period. And, because Air New Zealand has relatively few flights to the U.S., they may not have had any other pilots in the U.S. who could continue the flight. So the plane would be stuck, somewhere, until the pilots satisfied their legal (and, perhaps, contractual) rest period.
I guess you don’t have most of these issues going back to the original airport because most planes just hop back and forth, so it and the crew were gonna be there soon anyway?
The plane was supposed to land, drop off its passengers, pick up new passengers and return to original starting point. Doing a U-turn back to where they started would have actually saved them time, since they technically didn’t have to drop off or pick up any passengers.
