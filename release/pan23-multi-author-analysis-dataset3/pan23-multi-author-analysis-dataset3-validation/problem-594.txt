Maryland doesn't even have a law addressing landlord's entry, so your lease will control. If entry isn't addressed in the lease, the entry would generally need to be reasonable.
Yes, the lease does specify that they can request access to entry for the purposes of showing to potential renters or buyers. It does specify with 24 hour notice, but beyond that it says nothing about how many times they can show it. We have requested that they do it at reasonable times, which to them meant 9-5pm Monday - Friday and Saturday and sundays 12pm - 7pm. So we have people walking through one or more times a day, 4-5 days a week.
More than once a day, four to five times a week is arguably unreasonable. You are welcome to request that they limit the number of days, and number of showings on those days.
You wouldn't have a right to demand cessation of showings entirely, but you can request that they be a reasonable amount and at reasonable times.
You kind of only have the rights you're willing to stand on, and if you let them come at any time they choose to schedule then allowance is permission.
And no realtor wants to show an apartment while the unhappy tenant is present. So the simple statement that you will be very unhappy if they attempt to show up outside of the schedule you've provided maybe enough to dissuade them from even attempting it.
Require each showing to be arranged 24 hours in advance, and if you're not in an arranged showing time and you happen to be home, make sure your chain is on the door to prevent knock and walk entry at random unscheduled periods of time.
Keep in mind that they can "request access" (according to what you've said, and presuming that that's an actual quote from the lease) but that doesn't necessarily say that you have to grant access. You still control the property as the tenant and have a reasonable expectation of quiet enjoyment of your property.
I agree wholly with /u/Biondina here in that your right to quiet enjoyment prohibits excessive entry by the landlord or their agent, and your responsibility is to allow only reasonable times/dates/frequency. I would assert that fifteen showings in a month is excessive, and unquestionably assert that rate for two more months is way over reasonable. I realize the LL is selling, and while in practical theory I agree with InternetGhost, I disagree that you should allow it to continue simply for the sake of them stopping sooner because it is easier for them to find a buyer. Your rights as a tenant is the landlords' problem to deal with in selling; it is not the tenant's problem to deal with the landlord's wishes or what is easiest for them. It just doesn't work that way. It might be difficult timing for the LL to show as often as they want with a tenant, but that's par for the course as a landlord. It's something they need to manage.
