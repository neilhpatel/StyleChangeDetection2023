IMHO I think there is a difference. The religious leader or representative has more power. Therefore there’s a higher bar for praise, ie the leader doesn’t merit as much praise for simple “catching up”.
Now my opinion doesn’t cover my thoughts on religion, unfair rules, protest etc so I won’t elaborate. Id just like to understand whether we disagree on the above point of praise for the leader. I’d really like to hear more about what you think about that so I can understand your perspective better.
I appreciate your response and I agree with all your points. But my question was is there a difference in the level of power that a religious leader has vs a person protesting against a religious-based law as in in Iran.
On the other hand, a protestor in Iran today is probably more at risk than a senior cleric hypothetically dissenting; one's risking their job and social status, the other their life.
I’m just uncomfortable with the comparison between an Iranian protestor and a Hindu leader. To me, that’s a very different level of sacrifice and bravery.
