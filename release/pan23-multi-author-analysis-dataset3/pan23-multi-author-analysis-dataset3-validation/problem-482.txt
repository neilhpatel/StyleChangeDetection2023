From now on same-sex couples can legally get married and adopt in the country of Andorra and transgender people can legally change their name and gender.
In Italy, Greece, Czech Republic and Estonia, gay people can get civil unioned, which is basically the same as marriage. And in many of the other countries, gay couples also get some rights/recognition.
But you could allow adoption while also only having same sex civil union. You could even have same sex adoption without even having same sex civil union. It's 2 different things though obviously closely related(because the resistance to both comes from the same homophobia).
Unfortunately, it's the separate but equal part that directly contributes to the societal perception of gay people as inherently unequal. I sure as hell know I felt unequal until my country got full marriage equality, despite civil unions being functionally the same.
And if marriage is no different than a civil union, then why are people fighting so hard to deny gay people one but not the other? Maybe everyone who's not being deliberately blind to the difference can see that there is one.
Not a single EU country that has civil unions but no gay marriage allows joint adoption. That feels like a big one But thankfully you're here to tell all gay people to just suck it up, since though it may not be ideal, it doesn't bother you, the arbiter of what rights minorities deserve.
