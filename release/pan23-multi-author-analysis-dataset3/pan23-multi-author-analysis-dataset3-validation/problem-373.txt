And one of the bloodiest wars in recent memory with Saddam using chemical warfare against Iranians also not one sided like this thread seems to imply the two sides have great reason to have disdain for each other.
For a very related statistic, Iraq is about 40% Sunni and Iran has been meddling in Iraqi affairs for decades after the end of the Iraq / Iran War - especially after Saddam was deposed.
Yeah, Iraq was afraid that Iran would export the '79 Revolution (which was won by theocratic Shias) to Iraq which had a sizable Shia population. Iran was exploiting sectarian tensions in Iraq as a ploy to undermine the secular Baathist government (which was still a pretty shit authoritarian government). Obviously it doesn't justify Iraq invading Iran, but that war was nearly inevitable.
Iraq and Iran were going to war no matter what the US did, we just gave them weapons to make it hurt Iran more. Stop thinking countries outside of the US don’t have agency over their own choices, it’s dumb and wrong.
