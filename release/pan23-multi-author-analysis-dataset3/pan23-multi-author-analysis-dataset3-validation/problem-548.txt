Can we please wait for polls to close before we start the doom and gloom? I know it's a rough and frankly scary day in general. But remember, old boomers and above don't work so they have plenty of time to vote early today. It happens at every election and they always vote on the red side of things so it will seem skewed to the right at the start.
The GOP questioning the results election just before the election only makes sense if their polling suggests they will do badly. Why would they keep peddling this nonsense if they expected to win?
It sounds morbid, but covid has killed over 1 million people in the US, primarily from older demographics who tend to vote for the GOP. We have seen Georgia go blue by a number below the amount of covid deaths they had up to that point in 2020. The question is how large of an influence does this factor have?
