Unless the firearm is transported unloaded and secured in a trunk or other locked container (not your glove box) it would be considered a concealed firearm in CA, and you would be required to have a concealed firearm permit to carry it.
If that is the case you're either not living in reality or are dreaming up a way to illegally conceal carry a firearm that will land you in trouble.
For whatever reason, people seem to take offense to the stipulations of the law and how the firearm will be used. I’m under no intent to argue or be an asshole to people, so take what I say with “well what about this part of the law?” out of my curiosity for legal action instead of “well look I found this loophole I’m right and you’re wrong so ha ha fuck you”. Because everyone just decided to take offense to everything I’m saying today.
If you were paying attention at all to my original post instead of focusing on your “gotcha” quips you can see in my that I gave clear and specific parameters on how I would be transporting it. I’m asking for legalities of intent for using the weapon as a self defense tool while transporting it legally, not the semantics on how it would be transported. I’m not sure what exactly you’re trying to expose by consistently circling back to an already established circumstance, but the banter that’s begotten from your inability to pay attention and continual exercise of an opinion based on that inattentiveness is unhelpful.
