What does your lease say about your responsibility with regard to your utilities? And are you both on a lease with a landlord, or are you subletting from the roommate? What is the actual cost for utilities each month?
If you go ahead and pay the utilities balance to get things current, then you could likely sue your roommate for her portion.
Right now you're owed ($75 months) - (Actual half of utilities months), and you can sue for that. You may need to pay the utilities to keep them on / turn them back on. In which case you would add the full cost of that to what you are suing for (since you would be paying your half again plus her half now).
I'm not sure why you are thinking of suing your roommate unless you are claiming $75 is more than your share should be (which is not clear from your post). If it is approximately equal, or less, than your share of the utilities would be, then there is nothing to sue for.
i'd clarify op used utilities and owes her share of that. op is owed any difference between 75 and what her portion should have been depending on her agreement.
You'd be owed the difference between the amount billed and the amount she charged, not the entire $75/mo back. The fact she's not paid the utility doesn't change that calculus. It's entirely her problem since it's in her name. You paid your share to her.
