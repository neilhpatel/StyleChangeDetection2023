It doesn't matter when the landlord thinks the lease ends. As soon as you've paid $9,000 (and not overstayed) then you're done.
Tell the landlord you're OK with ending the lease early (Nov. 30 instead of Dec. 31) and he can keep the extra rent payment.
If he didnâ€™t want you there on December 1st he should have written the lease to end on November 30th.
If he was foolish enough to state that the lease ends Dec. 31, you could offer to leave by Nov. 30 if he repays your deposit in full by then.
If you have never missed a payment and have indeed paid the full 9000 you can leave November 30th as per your lease states. In some cases you can move out as long as the full amount of the term is paid. However if you still have property there after December 1st he can charge you rent because you're still technically "present" in regards to the property. Now like I said before if you haven't missed a payment, not only can you move out but if he withholds your deposit and there is no damage left take him to small claims and get your deposit back since I'm assuming most landlord's at the very least do one months rent for a deposit. Sometimes first and last months. He's trying to play you if he charges anything outside of these terms.
