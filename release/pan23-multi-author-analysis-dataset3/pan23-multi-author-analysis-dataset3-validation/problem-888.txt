I HIGHLY recommend reading the entire comment but the highlight of it to answer your question would be:
>Tolkien did not invent the pointed ears, nor was it an inheritance from medieval literature/art or from the folk themselves (at least in any general way). Pointed ears would defeat the purpose of many of the widespread Northern European legends since they would be a "dead giveaway" of the elfin nature of an encounter, while legends often unfold this truth slowly in the narrative. We need, therefore, to look at the artists who were fulfilling an emerging need for children's literature and a general fascination will all things elfin during the Victorian period.
u/itsallfolklore answered a question about the origin of the commonly accepted pointy elf ears in this giving good reasons as to what time period the idea might have emerged.
For the history of items associated with elves, we must begin with the oral traditions that depict them, for that is the root of all that followed. First of all, the British elf belongs to a large group of kindred supernatural beings ranging from the Irish fairies/sidhe to the Scandinavian entities of various names depending on local dialect. Across this geographic expanse, there are a great deal of similarities and a large body of migratory legends shared throughout the region. Differences, of course, also existed.
Stith Thomson's motif index lists a vast array of possibilities; one can find, for example, the motif F232.3 Fairies with unusually large ears, but this does not lead us to pointed ears, and it is a rare motif. Given that oral tradition was the common property of hundreds of thousands of speakers from Ireland to Sweden (over a great many generations), I would not be surprised to find an example of pointed ears, but this was not the norm.
