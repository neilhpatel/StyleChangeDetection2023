At the start of the war some russian pundits were saying they should "station" troops in Finland too. Some Finnish smartass on twitter said "But there are already 160,000 Russian troops in Finland.".
Yes, quite frankly. The Russian invasion of Ukraine justifiably makes Finland nervous, whatever reason one believes motivated the former, because largely it applies to Finland as well. For example:
Easy challenge, as an American: The American Continental Army won the American war of Independence against the far superior British Army, with utterly shit morale, the height of training comprising of a bitter winter boot camp under command a man who didn't speak the troops' language, a command structure that was basically whoever showed up (the head of artillery was a raised as a pacificist Quaker bookseller, and had never fired a cannon before taking up that post, whereas all British artillarymen were in a strictly merit based career track, for example; Knox learned everything he knew from a book), and woeful supplies (there were serious proposals to arm men with bows and arrows due to a lack of gunpowder).
You don't need an army to "chase imperial Russian glory", you need an army to be successful in doing so. And I don't think Finland fears a successful Russian invasion after the Ukraine debacle, but rather the kind of pain and suffering Russia is inflicting on Ukraine's civilians right now, for which a functioning or efficient army is not necessary.
Do YOU know anything about current events, or that Finland wasn't actively threatened by Russia, pre-Ukraine invasion? I'll sit and wait, while you supply those sources detailing all the threats Russia imposed upon Finland, c1990-2013.
Weird, it's almost as if the sole threat to Finland, is the threat a NATO-member offers to Russia. Gosh, that sounds a lot like...geopolitical self-defense from Russia.
The Russian Army has none of those things. It's literally falling apart. So, if a Russian invasion isn't a threat to Finland there's no need for them to join NATO.
Aaand, Finland needs EXTRA help defending against a broken Russian army that has given no indication of invading...why?
Finland has been actively arming itself against its Russian neighbor for awhile. And the most you have to present as evidence is the same thing NATO does to Russia.
Speaking of threats and pushing troops close to a country's border, NATO has been an active threat to Russia since well before Putin got there. And your solution is to threaten Russia MORE?? Gee...now what could possibly go wrong?
