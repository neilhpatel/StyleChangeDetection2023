If there really is a charge against you you will find out by getting something official like a summons. If that happens, get a defense lawyer.
I expect it's a scam and they're going to try to ask for money. But if it WAS from the police, there's no reason to call - you don't want to talk to them anyway.
I'm not sure. I would think that if it was a sting they'd want more evidence so they'd probably try to get you to show up and arrest you after you hand over the money.
I'm not a lawyer but I do believe it's only a crime once you meet up and actually hand over money. This is just a scam just like the one where you're talking to a girl then get a call from the "father" saying shes a minor. Then they demand ml money or goto the police.Then they spoof a local to you police department pretending to be a detective. If this happens do not call that number. Goto google then search for the police department that he says he works at. Call the number google gave you and then ask if there is someone there hy that name then explain you got a call and trying to see if it's a scam. You do not need to tell them the reason of the sczmt(talking to minor) just say you're being extorted for money. But do what everyone is saying. Block that number then live your life. If a cop comes to the door and asks questions you tell then no questions unless it's to my attorney. You have nothing to worry about seriously. This scam has sky rocketed like 1000% recently. Just search this sub and you'll see LOTS of people asking similar stuff to this.
Just remember police are not your friends they are not on your side so if you do talk to a real cop do not tell them anything that could incriminate yourself. just basic I'm being extorted for money. Good Luck.
