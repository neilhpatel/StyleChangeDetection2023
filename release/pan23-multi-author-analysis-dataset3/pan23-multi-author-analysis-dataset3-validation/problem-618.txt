IMO, that was ... short, but pointless. OF COURSE they will claim that you have to license stuff from them - the question is, is it enforceable ESPECIALLY when it comes to public domain works? It's no secret, browsing their selections, they have a LOT of works that are absolutely public domain - lots of govt. videos, for example.
No, but that they are trying to license copies of things like govt. films, which by their nature ARE public domain, and claim to be able to license such works, shows quite a bit of blatant dishonesty on their end.
Yes, many companies have realized they can license images and footage that is in the public domain. They justify the fees as the cost of their research, tracking down high res files, cleaning up scans for better visibility, etc. Is it ethical? Perhaps not. But if you want to use the footage you'd have to do all the legwork that the company already did and track down the original source who can give you permission and the file. You can't just use their file.
