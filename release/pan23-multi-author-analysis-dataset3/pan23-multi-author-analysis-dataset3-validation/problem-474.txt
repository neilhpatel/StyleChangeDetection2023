A report to the police to start would be prudent. That could likely be trespassing as well as property damage.
If it were me, after my neighbor trespassed one time and cut down my tree, I would absolutely not allow them back onto the property again. I'd hire professionals to clean up the felled tree and tack that cost onto the lawsuit against him. But that's just me.
The neighbor would likely have been entitled to trim the portion of the tree overhanging his property, but not to the extent that it would kill the tree -- and certainly not the entire tree, on your property.
Some trees are worth a lot, some not so much -- it can depend on both type and age of the tree. If you feel this tree was worth a good amount, suing your neighbor for the value of that tree would be an option -- an arborist would be able to give you a good estimate of what the tree might have been worth.
Definitely contact the police and if needed an arborist to assess the value of the tree. Depending on the age and type of tree it could be worth quite a bit.
Well, then that Tree has value. OP, if your neighbor didn't like your tree, then cutting it down, and making it your problem, would make this simple. But since neighbor volunteered to haul it off, then the lumber has potential value.
And the neighbor was so happy, he even admitted to cutting it, and is willing to haul it off your property at no cost?
