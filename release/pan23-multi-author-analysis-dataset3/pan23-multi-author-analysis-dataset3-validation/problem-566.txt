They had lots of flammable material, and it was likely an accident. There's some speculation that there was a birthday celebration (with lit candles) for the people living there, though I'm not sure if it's confirmed to be what started it.
The fact that the other two responses you have (at this point) are "clearly there were Palestinian terrorists in the building and they messed up while making rockets" and "obviously it was arson from Israeli extremists" is incredibly depressing.
But when they declare their intentions to destroy Israel, send tens of thousands of rockets aimed blindly on our citizens and use much of the building materials allowed in to create a huge underground tunnel network in order to carry out attacks within Israel, what are we supposed to do.
Hamas hide their bases on residential buildings and build tunnels under the cities so when Israel send a rocket to one of their bases, civilians die and they go on the internet and claim “oh cruel and powerful state of Israel funded by the US government attacking us that we are so meaningless”.
I reckon the terrorist government Palestinians elected is more responsible for that, given that they spend their UN funding on Rockets despite getting almost the same amount of UN funding as Israel does.
