-We told her that she could only visit their mom once a week at the home because her visits, according to the nurses, were upsetting their mom. She started visiting her through the window, a kind nurse opened the window, not knowing we’d asked for limited visits and his sister CLIMBED IN THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW.
Thank you for responding! We thought we HAD to do it and we weren’t sure if we’d be liable for anything if we didn’t. Who will make decisions for her if we don’t?
How is she thwarting your decisions? You have POA. Assuming they don't have POA, you can fully ignore the sister and do what you think is right. If she tries to stop you, you can take any necessary actions on behalf of your mother to stop that interference.
Your control of the estate and your diligent care of Mom is actually also you protecting yourself. After all a well-managed estate provides for mom's needs without burdening your actual financial circumstance.
Similarly, you can use money from the mother's assets to pay for her care costs until medicaid take over. There are elder care attorneys who can walk you through all of this.
You really need an elder care specialty lawyer. And remember that that expense goes to Mom's estate.
