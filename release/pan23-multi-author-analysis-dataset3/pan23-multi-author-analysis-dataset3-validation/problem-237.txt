Bill can’t move if he has a pending sentence lol. That in and of itself violates the law. If he pled guilty to a felony, leaving the state is another crime.
I guess the answer to number 2 depends on how involved you want to get. Technically, since he hasn’t done it yet, there’s no law being broken. Does he have anyone specifically he has to report to that you would contact?
Well, at the very least, he can’t move yet. If/when he does, he has 24 hours to notify law enforcement that he moved. Some states even require you notify them before you move depending on the crime you committed.
To answer the first, there are different laws and levels of sex offender in every state. You don’t have to know the answer. I would suggest if and when Bill moves you call the sheriffs department in the jurisdiction he moved too and ask to speak with the sex crimes division. Again, report only truthful information that you are aware of. Do NOT embellish or make anything up. Their sex crimes division can easily reach out to IN and find the information they need. And they will know best how to handle it.
To answer your second question, you might as well call the prosecutors office. As long as you tell the truth to the best of your knowledge, you are legally in the clear. Though it is possible Bill finds out you made the call and comes after you in a non legal way. The prosecutor can determine what if any actions to take based on the info you provide.
We know the contact information of state’s prosecutor in the current court case, so we could call him. I don’t know if he has a probation officer.
I’m also concerned about the fact that Jane and her mother believe Bill that he doesn’t have to register in WI. Their judgement and belief in what he says is concerning — I’m not sure how anyone can believe that “lifetime registrant” means most states except Wisconsin for some reason.
Thank you. Ultimately, I’m concerned about the young children of Jane’s extended family, should Jane and Bill move into the matriarchal house to care for Jane’s mother. Jane’s mother also has a mentally disabled adult in her care.
