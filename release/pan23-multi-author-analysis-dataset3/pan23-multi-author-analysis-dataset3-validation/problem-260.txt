If Ukraine can win the war (with significant support from America), this will be one of the most successful first terms ins history (domestically and internationally).
My understanding is that your grocery bill wonâ€™t go down. Prices that rise due to inflation maintain that price (and obviously go higher with future inflation). Inflation just slows to normal levels.
Lower inflation means the prices stop rising as quickly as they have been -- not that they'll come back down. Prices almost never come back down; what needs to happen is for wage increases to outpace inflation so that individual purchasing power rises.
It does seem inflation is beginning to recede at least in some areas groceries are still stubbornly high and i worry we wont see a lot of items come back down because of corporate greed.
If inflation is indeed going down, why is this not reflected in the grocery store? A 12 pack of eggs is currently 8 dollars in New York. 8 dollars! That shit was like 1.50 pre pandemic. Something needs to be done to stop these companies from absolutely destroying us with their corporate greed.
