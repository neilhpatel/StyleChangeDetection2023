But sister is 16 and can speak up and say she doesn’t want to leave. They have proof the parents have not been able to care for her to the point of giving her to them. Parents have not been to visit or call regularly. Do the parents truly have a safe living situation now? Are they still precarious in their living situation? There are so many things that can affect child custody.
You don't have a huge chance of success of gaining official custody. Courts very, very strongly favor parents unless there is strong evidence of neglect or abuse. The fact that there appears to have been educational neglect is in your favor but them being poor doesn't disqualify them from being parents.
My ultimate point here, is that if you and they can come to an amicable agreement that is in the best interest of your SIL, that is the best chance for success. Maybe that means your SIL spends holidays and summers with her parents and stays with you for the school year. Maybe that means arranging more phone calls and ways for your SIL to stay in contact with her parents. Obviously, you're going to need to get buy-in from your SIL to maintain the regular communication with her parents.
It really is so difficult to have to send a loved one back into a not so good living situation. I hope you have some success in convincing her parents to keep her with you.
I’m not sure why you would encourage the daughter to be alienated from her parents by continuing to live with you. She should finish her school year in TN and move back to her parents. Once there she can do what she wants and can negotiate with her parents to relocate for continuing education. From the parents point of view it appears like betrayal of trust. And every judge in the country will rule against you.
