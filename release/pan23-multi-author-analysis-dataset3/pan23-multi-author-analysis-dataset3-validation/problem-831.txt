The native name of the country, Deutschland, is derived from Proto-Germanic, what my [Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic] ( reconstructs as "þiudiskaz+landą" meaning "land/country of the people." However, a unified Germany is a rather recent affair, and so Deutschland wasn't really in use in German international relations - the Prussians would call themselves Prussians, and the Austrians would call themselves Austrians and so on and so forth. Most foreigners had no need to remember the Germans' name for themselves, as their relations were never with Germany as a whole. Instead, many peoples used their own names, of various origin.
To start, this is hardly just an "in English" question. Many nations are referred to by alternative names in other countries, with a few in particular having especially many names. Greece, Germany, and China have many different names, from many different sources, acquired over many many years.
But that's just Germany - India is a different story, as I'd China, as is Greece. Each example of odd exonyms is unique, and needs individual examination. But I want to stress that this isn't a "English" question. The Persians call the Greeks "Ionians," and the Irish call the English "Saxons.".
Re. China calling America Meiguo 美国: this is the phonetic approximation of the target country's self-name, combined with the word 'nation' guo 国. Many of the Chinese spellings of countries are this structure or fully phoentic: Jianada 加拿大 Canada, Yingguo 英国 England, Xibanya 西班牙 Spain (España), Moxige 墨西哥 Mexico, etc.
