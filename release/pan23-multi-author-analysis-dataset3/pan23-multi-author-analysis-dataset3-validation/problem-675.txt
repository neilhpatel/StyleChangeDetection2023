It should be no surprise, primed as we are now, that formality was as entrenched in international discourse as it was internal discourse. That is, conduct among and between officers of the same army was just as formal and ritual as sending compliments to enemy officers. Even orders are given with attention paid to polite discourse.

Parleys were quite common during the course of eighteenth-century warfare, but they most frequently occurred in specific settings:
