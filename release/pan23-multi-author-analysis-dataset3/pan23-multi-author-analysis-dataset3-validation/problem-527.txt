Before getting to the article and some of its accurate and inaccurate claims, it's worth talking a little bit about forced reproduction (a term that most historians of the subject prefer to "breeding," given the latter's dehumanizing implications) in American slavery and what we know about it.
Scholars of slavery in the antebellum United States are actually still debating whether or not forced reproduction occurred. In my opinion, people who deny that some slaveholders attempted to coerce the people they owned into having children in the name of profit are a bit naive, and ignoring plenty of direct testimony speaking to the practice.
Williams had explained up to this point that her enslaver, a man named Hawkins, wasn't as awful as her previous enslaver, a man named Black. Williams remembered brutal working conditions, frequent incidents of torture, and insufficient food while Black owned her. Hawkins, in contrast, was less violent and cruel, and provided better food. He also did something that Williams expressed gratitude for even decades later: he purchased her and her father and her mother together, after her father begged him not to tear apart their family. From this we can see how uncommon such behavior was from slaveholders. But Williams had more to say about Hawkins (the following excerpt contains racial slurs which I have not censored. It is possible that Williams's interviewer exaggerated her dialect in transcribing her testimony, as many WPA interviewers did, but we can't know for certain):
I'm not disputing that the transcription was unnecessarily literal, and either a conscious or unconscious attempt to make the speaker seem more uneducated than her white peers, but these spellings are not nonsense. They likely indicate a real pronunciation difference between the speaker and the author.
