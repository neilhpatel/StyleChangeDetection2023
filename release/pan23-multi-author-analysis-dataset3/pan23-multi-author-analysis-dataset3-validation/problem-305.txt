Artist or busybody? It’s a thin line between this and censorship. Or vandalism. And the piece that is “annoying” to you might have useful information for others. So generally, you have no right to alter or obliterate messages merely because they annoy you. That is more of an ethics issue, but also why Banks and others work in secret.
From a legal standpoint, defacing someone else’s property, even if to cover up other unwanted advertisements or art (another thin line with sketchy legal definitions) generally counts as vandalism. The trick would be to get the property owner’s permission.
To avoid liability only do this to things you own or get permission from the owners of things you don't.
The same way that painting over it would be. If it is not yours and/or you lack the owners permission you have no legal right to alter/deface/damage property in this manner.
There is no legal difference between paint and stickers when used to alter/deface/damage the property of others without their permission. Both can usually be removed with varying degrees of difficulty and both are usually considered vandalism. Just don't.
There is no magic loophole allowing you to do this to other peoples property without possible legal consequences.
