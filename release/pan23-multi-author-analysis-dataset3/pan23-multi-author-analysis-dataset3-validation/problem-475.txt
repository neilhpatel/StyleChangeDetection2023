Interesting details you've pointed out. I wouldn't have known that this was a poor portrayal. I think you're onto something when you mention the marginalization of the Vietnamese perspective. I read a long time ago that there was actually an ARVN unit that reached the top of the hill first, but they don't appear at all in the film. Still, I liked the movie overall.
The portrayal shown in the film, however, is not particularly good. There is not even a mention of who this person really is beyond his name and that he is a defector (something that is only obvious to the viewer if they know what the Chieu Hoi program is), but beyond that, nothing. He is demonized for no reason other than to make the FNGs (and the viewers) aware of the enemy's capability. Instead of using the moment to add some additional nuance, that there were North Vietnamese who wanted to work for the Americans (!), it becomes a useless 'us vs. them' display with little connection to reality. This continued marginalization of Vietnamese voices and perspectives in American depictions of the Vietnam War fails to add complexity to the Vietnam War as depicted in popular culture and leaves South and North Vietnamese men and women as silent stereotypes. Han, the Kit Carson Scout in the film, would have understood everything S. Frantz was saying -- after all, Han had studied English at Kit Carson Scout school before being assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and likely had American friends amongst his fellow soldiers.
While there were plenty of American soldiers who distrusted the Kit Carson Scouts, commanders at least attempted to make grunts trust them. The role of the scouts were to protect American soldiers, to prevent them from falling into ambushes or from stepping into a booby trap. They were incredibly effective at their job and there are countless of accounts of not only their heroism in battle but of how they prevented the deaths of many American soldiers. Yet this came with a cost. For North Vietnamese defectors, it would be impossible for them to return home and their families would likely suffer because of their defection (through ostracization, losing job opportunities, being publicly humiliated, etc.) , something which prevented many North Vietnamese soldiers from defecting in the first place (only 2,000 North Vietnamese defected in comparison with 150,000 South Vietnamese).
