Thanks! I struggled with exactly how to word the question. I am a native English speaker and the GVS is covered. I was trying to ask a broader question about shorter and longer changes.
Right it’s taxonomy which is imperfect. So that goes back to my original question. Which cultures/languages could a modern time traveler go back in time and understand the spoken language then as a current native speaker?
If we can say that some cultures are older than others, then we should be able to say the same things about the language they used.
Well that depends partially on what your native language is, since languages change at different rates. The FAQ , including bits and pieces about how languages changed and developed. I can only find two languages for the “how far back could I still communicate” type of question, though: English and Mandarin.
If you feel like sharing your native language and assuming it's not English or Mandarin (addressed by /u/jelvinjs7 already), we can take a stab at the answer.
