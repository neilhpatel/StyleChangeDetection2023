Awesome stuff as usual! One follow-up I have – because of course my follow-up is about this: Do these sources have much discussion of possible Taiping influence on Sun? I've encountered claims that Sun saw himself as a bit of a latter-day Hong Xiuquan and claimed the Taiping as predecessors to his own planned revolution, and while I've repeated them myself I've come to realise I'm not sure how significant that aspect was.
I would say that the Taiping certainly had considerable influence on Sun; I don't know about him seeing himself as a contemporary Hong Xiuquan, but I wouldn't rule it out. The precursor to the Tongmenghui and the KMT was the very anti-Manchu xingzhonghui, "Revive China Society," also formed by Sun. The motto was 驅除韃虜，恢復中華，創立合眾政府 - Expel Tartar barbarians, Revive Zhonghua, and establish a unified government.
Sun had received various patronage from the Japanese, who were interested in using him in the future as a tool to assert Japanese dominance over China. Obviously they quickly learned he had no interest in this and shifted their support to warlord Zhang Zuolin, but there were still a few wealthy Japanese interested in seeing a successful Sun as a means to build on pan-Asianism. But still, pan-Asianism wouldn't take off until the 1930s, so Sun needed a more powerful, meaningful, and proactive ally. An actual foreign entity willing to supply him with what he needed. He was hoping to find that support in the West, but the answer ended up being just to the north all along.
All this is to say that Sun kept his personal beliefs separate from any political ones. Regardless of how the Japanese or Soviets felt about Christianity, something Sun may have kept close to him, was irrelevant.
Other than that, Sun regularly worked with and maintained relationships with non-Christians throughout China and Japan. Like I said, for many people its easy to separate their personal and public figure. Sun was generally closer to his Christian friends, and most of those Christians would make up a large portion of the KMT down the road. Most of his early political friends/allies were either Cantonese from Hong Kong like Yeung Ku-wan, and/or abroad Christians like Tse Tsan-tai. Those two founded the Hong Kong-based anti-Qing Furen Literary Society that Sun stumbled into when he was studying in Hong Kong.
