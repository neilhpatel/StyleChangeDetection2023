Every 10 years is the census and re-apportionment to rebalance the House of Representatives. and because various states gain or lose seats, the maps also typically get redrawn to fit the new number of districts required.
After the 2002 midterms, Republicans gained control of Texas’ legislature for the first time since Reconstruction (like 130 years). Democrats hat 17 of 32 House Seats after the 2002 midterms. The newly Republican legislature did not like this, redrew the maps and in the 2004 election R’s were able flip 6 house seats and took the majority 21-11.
We would have to go back to 2017/2018 to see if a similar number of bills were being passed with bipartisan support to see how it compares when Republicans are in control.
Must be why so many of the Republicans that voted against such acts end up praising them as an accomplishment to their constituents. I feel like you're overlooking the fact that in a democracy the majority should outweigh the minority in terms of policy enactment. However Republicans continue to poison bills and sabotage them until Democrats remove provisions from bills to make them more partisan, then when voting time comes Republicans torpedo then anyways.
Democrats tried working with Republicans on a number of bills over the last 15 years and Republicans are always the ones that negotiate in bad faith.
Democrats have tried working with Republicans on a number of bills, but Republicans basically refuse to come to the table to negotiate, and it's always because of some "provisions that made then unpalatable to GOP". Basically anything the Democrats want, the Republicans say is a "non-starter". That isn't compromise.
