You are correct in that. Mortgage/house in her name and tenant making payments. Has missed 26 of the last 50 payments and hasn't paid since February.
The contract is notarized and signed by both parties...as far as I know it's valid. But the attorney we just spoke to regarded the contract as null and void since it wasn't filed in court and is 15+ years old. I know nothing about the legality of this situation.
Yes, it is quite the mess and should have been handled a long time ago. The contract should've never been signed without an attorney to begin with. But here we are today.
It is my understanding that the tenant has a forbearance plan in place with the mortgage company. We are planning to find out more Monday about the specifics of this.
She was in a difficult place in her life and signed the contract without consulting an attorney. I can't speak directly for her, but I'm not sure to what extent she read/comprehended what she was agreeing to. The house/mortgage is still in my mom's name.
Title: My mother signed a Lease-to-Purchase contract in 2005 with her neighbor. The contract expired in 2015. The house is now falling apart and getting complaints from the city. The tenant has invested money in home improvements and refuses to leave without being compensated. The house is in her name.
