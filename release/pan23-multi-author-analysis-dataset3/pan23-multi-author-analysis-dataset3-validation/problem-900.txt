Seeing as how Palestinian supporters are so critical of war crimes, yes although this will quickly be swept under the rug while they whine about Israel.
If the Palestinians truly wanted freedom, they should have fought a little harder the multiple times they invaded Israeli territory to cleanse the Middle East of Jews..
If the Palestinians had the military superiority over the Israelis I have no doubt that they would implement genocide to wipe Israel and all the Jews there off the map.
But the issue is simply that Jewish Israelis think that the Palestinians are violent and impossible to please with anything less than genocide of the Israelis, not really that Israelis think that the Palestinians are necessarily wrong about everything.
Jewish Israelis don’t generally have any fundamental problem with the Palestinians being Arabs, being Muslims or having a different perspective on 1948. They just have a problem with what looks like the Palestinians’ apparent support for genocidal violence against Israel.
The only significant barrier to the Palestinians getting what they want is the impatience, violence and over-the-top hostility.
And, the irony is, if everyone were getting along, Palestinians could probably create a combined Palestine, under Palestinian control, through the political process. They’re snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
