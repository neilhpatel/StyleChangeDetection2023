First of all there is an important distinction to be drawn between merely a dangerous battle, and a kamikaze attack. It is understood that most operations have a risk of injury or death for soldiers but it's rare that any commander sends troops on a mission that they know will be a failure. A dangerous, unlucky or poorly planned engagement is not kamikaze attack because the latter ends with the death of a soldier even if everything goes according to plan. Events like the kamikaze pilots, suicide bombers, or mass suicides by Japanese after battles stand out because they are anomalies, even within the conduct of the Japanese military in the 20th century.
I hope this explains what differentiates a Kamikaze attack from all other cases of practically suicide missions.
In the general concept of a suicide attack, the main difference with the soldiers of the boats on, say D-Day, is that the Kamikaze pilots made a conscious decision to attack and kill themselves to accomplish their purpose, while the soldiers of the Allies during the Normandy Landings (and in so many other cases in the history of the world), were taken there and most/all of them were hoping to survive, even if they knew there was a high probability to die.
While the military officers and generals who orchestrated the attack would have been aware and would have calculated the expected range of the casualties, the soldiers themselves did not make any conscious decision to end their life during the upcoming battle.
Whether the troops themselves were aware of their fate, I think there must have been an element of tactical sacrifice within the Allied planning that ultimately contributed to the success of these invasions. Similarly, if the "kamikaze" units had gained more success in the repulsion of the Allied navy, the wider operation would have been viewed more optimistically than a desperate suicide run?
