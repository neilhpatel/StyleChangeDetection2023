are you legally divorced? what did the divorce agreement/ruling state on the ownership of that property?
The ownership of the property is under my husband's name because the title is In his name, and the divorce decree states that we will split the proceeds 50/50 after all closing costs and reimbursements are paid.
I certainly hope so. It's not his lawyer and the title company I don't trust. If my ex were to get a hold of just one check I'm almost certain he'd find a way to get more money out of me than he should. He also told me in the past that I'd be receiving an itemized list of all the repairs, which aren't receipts. You can easily create an itemized list on word.
It all got taken care of. I called the title company, which scared them, so they reached out to his lawyer and his lawyer had my ex husband turn in all the receipts to them and then they cut me a check and mailed it to me..
The title company did everything, which was what was agree upon. He also agreed to give me receipts as they were happening (per the decree), not wait until he had the check so he could do what he wanted with it.
I never delayed anything. It was agreed upon that the title company would handle it all. He assumed he could just get the check and distribute my half after making all the calculations on his own with a list he came up with on his own. I just contacted them to see how I would receive my check.
