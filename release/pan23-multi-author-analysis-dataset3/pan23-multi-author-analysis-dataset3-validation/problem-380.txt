Your friend is responsible for reading packaging for any potential allergens prior to consuming it. If her food allergy is “deathly” or “severe” enough that it could in fact cause anaphylaxis or death, which this time it did not, she really should know by this point to read packaging first and never trust another person to do it for her. Source; have moderate-severe food allergies. Can you sue? Sure. For approximately the cost of the number of Benadryl she took and possibly pain and suffering for… most of one evening it sounds like.
As far as what she might be able to sue for..it would be limited to damages which are the cost of several Benadryl and potentially some pain and suffering. This claim will be mitigated by the accurate inclusion of blueberries on the package.
Blueberries are an ingredient, of course, but not a "major allergen", and you said they are listed on the label.
How far down into the ingredient list did you have to get before discovering blueberries were on it ?
For food vendors, you are probably familiar with the duty to disclose ingredients they know about, and to publish ingredients that are common allergens on their menu. There is probably overlap between the marijuana laws and the food laws where you live.
