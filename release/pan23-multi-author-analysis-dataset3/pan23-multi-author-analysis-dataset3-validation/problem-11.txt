Don't you love how Republicans can issue a statement that is a blatant lie or downright seditious, and the Right Wing Billionaire owned Corporate Mainstream Media will just repeat it and amplify it without challenging it or fact-checking it?
Not that I disagree with you in general about mass media, but this article in no way amplifies her claim, but equates it to Trumps false claims, offering no evidence whatsoever.
I would generally agree, but she's issuing the same "big lie" as Trump did, in trying to claim voter fraud, deny US election validity. J6 was the result, and she needs to be held accountable not only for her participation in those crimes, but for continuing the crime into this election cycle.
The Speech and Debate clause covers only "official duties," and fraud, libel and slander can never be part of their "official duties.".
. It really just boils down to their poor sportsmanship, poor citizenship, poor leadership, and being willing to cheat to win.
They don't even know the basic rules of the game, much less being worthy opponents, always trying to cheat and whining like babies when they lose anyway.
