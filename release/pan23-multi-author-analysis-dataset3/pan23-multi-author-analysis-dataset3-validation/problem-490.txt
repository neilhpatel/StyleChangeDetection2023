There is no better way for the US to ensure that Russia never advances beyond being a corrupt and weak bandit state than to make sure Putin remains in power for as long as possible.
Putin has even strenhened NATO in a way that no American president could have while turning what used to be a near peer in Russia into a global untouchable mess. Someone should start spreading the rumor that Putin is an agent of the west and intentionally failing in Ukraine in order to weaken Russia. It would even make more sense than most of the fever dream bonkers propaganda they put forth.
Just because it's what you'd do is you were able/mildly competent doesn't mean it's what other people would do. You failed to do that with Zelensky, and now you're projecting again. Not all of us are going full Russian window on our political rivals. If Russia decides to do that with Putin, neat. The guy has got it coming. If Putin decides to keep demiliterizing Russia by way of Ukraine, it's absolutely devastating for Ukraine and Ukrainians while being a net benefit to the rest of the world. Frankly, it's better for Ukraine as well. Settling too early is just an invitation for Russia to attack again in a few years.
