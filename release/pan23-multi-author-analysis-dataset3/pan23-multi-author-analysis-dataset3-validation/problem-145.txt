NAL but if the lawyer never accepted payment and there was no written contract, were they ever technically OP's lawyer?
Also verbal contracts are binding and based on the judge and OP having discussed this lawyer in the past it would stand to reason everyone knew this was OPs lawyer.
If I am reading his post correct, the judge was already made aware of who his lawyer was as he stated judge was on a first name basis and told OP to tell his lawyer to "get to work". if he uses this advise the judge would ask "What do you mean, you previously stated lawyer name was representing you?" It is best to state "I had Council but lawyers name doesn't of appeared to have taken my final payment and I can't get ahold of him, can I have a continuance until I can get ahold of him or find new Council?".
Yes. The model rules of professional ethics which most states have adopted without substantial revision states that attorney client relationships can be formed regardless of payment or any written agreement to take on representation. An oral agreement to represent the client is binding. One of the most common myths I run into on this sub and IRL is that oral contracts are not contracts. They are. Obviously written contracts are easier to prove the existence of and the terms, but oral contracts are contracts (subject to the statute of frauds which provides exceptions to when an oral contract is insufficient).
I disagree with the other comment. You should explain to the judge you had counsel, you made payments to counsel, and that counsel is not present and has dropped you as a client. Your lawyer would have needed permission from the court to drop you at this stage of the litigation. File a bar complaint and make sure you get your money back.
