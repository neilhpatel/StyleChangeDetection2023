Also, this person is not the owner's representative. He might still have a contract with the estate, but any power he had to act on behalf of the landlord died with the landlord.
Is the "owner representative" from the old dead owner or the new owner? If the old, dead owner their interest will end with the transfer of the property. If the new owner is asking for rent, you may be on the hook. If you have a legal release from the lease, you are out, but if not, you still are subject to the lease.
If the estate released him from the lease, I think he is free. The estate has "ownership" of the property and as owners can release him from the lease.
Once the property is transferred to the new owner your lease goes with it. Any agreement you have with the old owner - and by extension the owner representative - is transferred as well.
So until March 31, Owner's Representative is correct that you owe rent through July 2021. Once the property is transferred, tell Owner's Representative to pound sand.
You have a lease in place with the owner of the property. Until March 31, this is the estate of the old owner (or his designated representative). Your agreement with the new owner does not bind the old owner/estate.
