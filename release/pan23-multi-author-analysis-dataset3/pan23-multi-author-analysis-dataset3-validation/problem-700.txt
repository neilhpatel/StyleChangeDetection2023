What role do you see replicas playing in the increased calls for repatriation of looted colonial artefacts from museums? Can meaning and ‘authenticity’ be transferred onto objects using new technologies (such as scanning and 3D printing) in a way that is more available now than when the St John’s cross replica was manufactured?
And a follow up example to this, what about the Lascaux caves, where visiting them damages and erases the cave paintings, so visitors are brought into a replica cave? There are now three other traveling replicas, as well as the ‘original’ replica being displayed back at original site.
(B) Replicas are distinctive as ‘extended objects’ with ‘composite biographies’ that link the lives of the copies and original.
(A) New understandings of authenticity recognize replicas as original objects in their own right with stories worth telling.
To add to what I just said, if the untold stories of replicas, including 'museum replicas' are to enhance an understanding of their value, we need to think about the ways in which their 'back story' comes to the fore.
We've talked about how modern portrayals or reconstructions of the past create a sense of "authenticity" to which future portrayals are compared. Like, fictional versions of the European Middle Ages seem "realistic" if they fit in line with longstanding pop cultural portrayals (what we mean by authenticity)--while an actual accurate recreation would seem unrealistic.
