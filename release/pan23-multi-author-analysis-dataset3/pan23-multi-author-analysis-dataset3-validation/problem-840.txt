Its already available for mail order and has been since Covid. The problem is that major pharmacies wont ship to states where abortion is illegal. This FDA thing doesnt really help that either, but it does make it easier for all Americans to get access simply because more pharmacies will carry it, and it makes it easier for those who are ok with skirting laws to acquire the pills and then ship them to red state women.
Now the FDA has “eased” the regulations so the majority of pharmacies should be able to fill out a bit of paperwork and be able to fill prescriptions for the abortion pills, politics aside.
Before today, the medication was only able to be filled in specific pharmacies. These pharmacies were not like CVS or whatever- they were alt-pharmacies that had filled out tons of paperwork in order to fill these prescriptions, and they filled all of the United States abortion prescriptions.
Now any pharmacy can provide it rather than needing to go to a clinic, so as long as you can get a doctor to prescribe it, you can get an abortion.
And stares can’t regulate drugs, that’s federal, so states can’t stop pharmacies from providing it. That’s not to say a pharmacy is required to provide it, but it means any pharmacy can.
You also need to contact your provider, warn them about this pharmacy, and ask them to help you find a pharmacy that will fill the prescription.
File a complaint with the licensing board. Leave specific bad reviews for that company that you are no longer using their pharmacy because the pharmacist has failed to do their duty. Contact corporate. Keep filing complaints at every level you can. Eventually, if enough people file complaints, something will happen.
