The argument is so fucking weird and it's actually more sexist than you probably first think from the title.
He said that women become alcoholics faster than men. A man becomes an alcoholic after 20 years of drinking but a women becomes one after 2 years.
So a man can drink through their early 20s and be fine, but if a young women does the same they will be an alcoholic. And if they become an alcoholic they won't mature into a women. And if that happens they won't have children. It seems to imply that men will stop drinking because they won't be an alcoholic, but the women will be, so men won't want to have kids with them.
Maybe it turns out that people, once they are in control of their own reproduction, also just want to have fewer children (or no children).
Drinking tends to be a cause of many births, as without it people would be making rational choices, like going to school and waiting on parenthood or not having children you canâ€™t afford.
Ah, boomers; blaming everything they don't like on everything the young like to do, whether it's alcohol causing teen pregnancies or not causing enough of them.
