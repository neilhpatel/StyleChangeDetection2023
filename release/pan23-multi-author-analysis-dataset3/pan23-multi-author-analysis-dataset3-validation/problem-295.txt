This only touches on one small portion of your question but, written by u/lcnielsen touches on possible influences between Judaism and Zoroastrianism and Christianity and may be of interest.
That's certainly not something I have observed in let's say, relatively recent specialty scholarship on Zoroastrianism, which is a pretty small circle. What do you base this on?
So while I tend to believe there was interaction and transmission of cultural and religious notions between early Jews and Christians and Persian Zoroastrians, it probably would not have taken the form of engaging directly with theology produced a religious elite, or anything similar.
Thus, while there is a lot of evidence for interaction between Jews and Persians (such as a number of Persian loanwords in the Hebrew Bible, which are especially significant as Persian was not an administrative language in the Achaemenid Empire), there is no particular reason for why Zoroastrianism, especially at that time when it was still solidifying as a religious tradition, would have stood out from Mesopotamian or Greek religion as particularly "monotheistic". (Indeed, the development towards actual monotheism in Judaism was probably pretty recent or even ongoing at that time, in the post-exilic era).
So, to start, it's really arguable whether Zoroastrianism can be described as monotheistic (it's a little bit perspective-dependent), but I think the more salient point is that it didn't historically _construe_ itself as monotheistic.
Now within various traditions of Christianity, there exists a whole set of frameworks and lines of theological reasoning to explain why Christianity is _still_ monotheistic despite the Trinity, veneration of saints, etc. Of course, those frameworks exists because it's _not_ obvious how Christianity, having these features, remains monotheistic.
Why wouldn’t they even mention the dominant monotheistic religion of their region? Did they and I just don’t know about it?
