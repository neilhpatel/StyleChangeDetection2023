What conversation? It's about Palestinian militants doing unquestionably evil things with no possibility of blaming Israel. It will just be ignored.
Also the UN added Palestine as a non-member observer state in 2012, the same year it was decided that "State of Palestine" shall be used in all official UN documents.
Most of the world recognizes Palestine. Of those who don't, the general consensus is that a two state solution is needed, but they won't recognize a Palestinian state until actual negotiations between Palestine and Israel happen.

What you're missing in your argument is that Palestinians are also entitled to live there for the same exact reasons, yet religion is the filter used by Israelis to claim "we are entitled to a nation state with this territory we have chosen, while they are entitled to a nation state with this other territory that we have also chosen".
It's actually not understandable that they'd kill over the land being divided, given the Jews/Israelis were also Indigenous and the local inhabitants and didn't attack the Arabs despite not having some of the specific areas they wanted.
Not much more "reductionist" than presuming that non jewish people living in Palestine are necessarily later "colonizers".
