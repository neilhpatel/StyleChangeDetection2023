I do not believe my state has an increase set amount. What makes me think itâ€™s discrimination possibly is the fact that the other five tenants are not having their rent increased at the same rate as ours. I have checked the property tax increase from 2020 to this year and it has not been a significant increase. Even with property tax increase, can a landlord Put increased expenses all on one tenant?
They can increase rent and absent a law controlling increases, they can do it however they want. But it doesnt look like you have proof it is discrimination. And the increase is not so much that it would raise alarm bells. If they raised it 50% then that would certainly be something to look at. You can contact your local legal aid for resources to look into it but again, i dont see a $100 rent increase as being obviously trying to force you out.
Unless that is an illegal amount to increase it by local law, then it doesn't really mean anything. You don't have proof it is discrimination. And property taxes everywhere are going up as well as insurance. Last year screwed everyone.
