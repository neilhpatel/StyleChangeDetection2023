Assuming they do not have a note from a qualified medical professional stating need for an ESA, or if the animal is not a service animal AND assuming the lease does not allow pets, you can serve a 3 day notice to cure or quit.
It sounds like they are not on a lease anymore right? If so, you need to give the ma 60 day notice to vacate, in writing, with clear date of notice, and date you want them out. If they do not leave by the 60 days, then you would go through eviction, again.
Let me clarify, eviction is a legal process, so if they keep the pet after 3 days, you can't lock them out. You then have to follow the eviction process to get a legal order to remove them.
To start the eviction process for cause, you need to give at least three days' written notice to vacate _or_ remedy the breach. If they remedy the breach, you cannot evict. If they don't, you still need to go to court unless they leave voluntarily.
If you want to evict without fault, then your options depend on whether the unit is affected by AB 1482 (just cause evictions & rent control) or not. At minimum, though, if AB 1482 does not control, then you'd have to give 60 days' notice to vacate.
