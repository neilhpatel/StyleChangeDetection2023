He took out a whole page in the newspaper for it too, it was pretty gross and racially motivated. The fact he never had the common decency to apologize isn't surprising, but it is disgusting all the same.

Like any flailing sociopath he went into a berserk state and killing people is the one thing he had to get himself off on. It’s the same reason he fought so hard to prevent covid restrictions, knowing people were dying made him feel strong and powerful because it made him feel like he had power over them.

Really when you look into it they’re no different than manson, full of shit losers who cant accept the consequences of their actions and blame everyone else for their own faults.
