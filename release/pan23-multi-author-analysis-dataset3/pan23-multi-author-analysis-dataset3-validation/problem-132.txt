This is not a bad question, though it might be called such. It is a badly phrased question. In my very answer I tried to explain that it is in fact one of the most contentious questions in Western History. We're still debating it.
Formulating good questions can be surprisingly difficult. Even the FAQ offered by the board has its limits (this is not a critique of the FAQ), especially when we all know not everyone will read it before asking something. As hard as critique can be (I know I sometimes feel like an asshole doing it), I think people here are doing the only responsible thing they can.
On the one hand, part of why this question is poor is probably that general education doesn't really cover the Crusades. At least, it doesn't in my country. The Crusades are something you're more likely to hear about in non-educational contexts first. Unless you seek out information on the Crusades, what you know about them probably amounts to a hodgepodge of hearsay and cultural presumptions accumulated over the course of life. Questions can be deceptively complicated, not just in their answers but in addressing the lack of knowledge in the questioner themselves.
The biggest issue I notice is overly broad questions and questions that display misleading assumptions. For example, the question "Why did the renaissance happen?".
Ok. So you're obviously frustrated, and it's understandable. It's not that your critical thinking skills that are lacking, it's that most people are taught to approach the study of history in a fundamentally different way than actual historians have been taught.
(Please note, I'm not saying that any of the questions I linked above were "bad" or based on incorrect premises, just using them to point out the diverse range of sources which contribute to people's understanding of history.).
Thank you for this answer. As a German historian who spends a lot of time in the US cultural bubble, your information come at a surprise to me.
