The board has almost total authority over all zoning, fire responses, utilities, taxing, etc. They've left most of the powers that matter intact, so on an initial practical level not much will change, but on a broader level governors could make Disney's life very, very difficult if they choose to now. e.g., Disney used to be the warden and now it's in a minimally secure prison being watched constantly.
The original plan to abolish it would have transferred it's debt and caused tax payers to have to pay for Disney-exclusive things, so all of the above would have been true and likely very, very bad for taxpayers. This basically kept the district, but gave the governor the power to appoint all the board members instead of Disney having sway.
Disney keeps its tax, bond and construction control and DeSantis gets to appoint some figureheads to a powerless commission.
By everything staying intact (Disney being on the hook for the debt) minus the board "appointed" by the governor, both sides get headlines that benefit their bottom line.
Basically with the debt intact, the state has a massive reason to agree to anything Disney requests as long as they keep paying down the debt that disney put into the district. This is a pointless gesture.
They left the debt structure intact? Wow. So nothing happens. At all. They figured out that Disney wasn't going to pay so they had to leave it intact. This is a major win for disney, so of course they don't care.
