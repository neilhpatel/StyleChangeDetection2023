It seems there is some information being left out or it is buried in all the extraneous personal comment. That is what is causing confusion and why clear answers cannot be provided. For example you stated there is no missed payments yet you missed payments Jan to Mar. But you state there is no missed payment because you negotiated with TD Bank. However if you were not a party to a loan agreement/contract with TD Bank they would of course not negotiate with you. Did you perhaps negotiate with TD Bank while impersonating BP or calling TD Bank saying you were BP?
There is more seemingly left out and confusing but what would clear up a bit is for you to explain exactly what papers your name and signature is on? Is it on contract with TD? Is it on title? Is it on insurance? What exact papers or contracts did you sign? And additionally, did you impersonate BP at any point or can you explain how you negotiated with TD?
Really, it's not possible to discuss this with any real accuracy without seeing the contract you and BP signed together. Which is probably not allowable (was it more than a page?) on the sub. You need to tell US what it says, what it promised you, what you promised BP, etc. We don't know.
Not likely. You got the use of the car. Let's say you did get them back, $13k. Then he counter-sues for the use of the car, for $12k. You end up with $1k.
A ton of this may depend on the exact contract you had with BP, its exact working. And if you were ever a signatory to anything with TD. But to be clear, how many months, and how many miles, did you drive the car?
