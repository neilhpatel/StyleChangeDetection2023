Yes, iirc under newer spanish law, violence against women by former or current romantic partners is considered a sexist crime (if attacker is a man, that is).
Gender-based violence occurs usually when the man believes the woman has done something that a woman, precisely, is not supposed to do, based on his beliefs about how women, precisely, should behave. Hence sexist.
Right it certainly can be sexist crime, but I dont think we should always treat it as such. Wouldn't that be similar to treating all violence between different races as a hate crime?
Could the rate of murders not just be due to physical differences rather than sexism? Generally speaking, it’d be harder for a woman to kill a man, than the other way around.
I don’t understand how a crime could be sexist unless it’s on an individual level. What you’re saying doesn’t make sense to me. That’s the same as saying any white person committing a crime against a black person (in the US, UK, etc.) is committing a racist crime, regardless of whether or not the race was reason for the crime.
