The most striking things to me are the massively lower per capita tax rates of the middle ages, combined with the end of the mass levy of all arms bearing men. However efficiently medieval states mobilized their resources, their relatively low annual revenue put a cap on their manpower, and their preference for 'capital intensive' armies of specialized missile troops and elite cavalry diminished headcount further, even when battles like Courtrai demonstrated that levied infantry could hold their own against expensive men at arms.
1. Why should we think this would be an inefficient way to raise men? In Louis XIV's case, the practice of delaying reimbursement of colonel-proprietors' costs essentially worked as a form of free credit for the state. Is it simply that they relied on volunteers instead of conscripts?
The wars of the Roman Empire aren't nearly as powerful illustrations as the Punic Wars. We know huge multinational empires like the Achaemenids and the Principate can raise large armies (accounting of course for implausible exaggerations), how could they not? What's interesting is trying to work out how ancient city-states mustered larger field forces than the quasi-absolutist monarchies of Early Modern Europe despite having smaller populations and far less access to credit.
I'm very late here, but I wonder if the difference in economy for ancient/early antiquity empires vs medieval/early modern European monarchies has something to do with slaves and cheap labor. Was the economy more dependant on young men staying home to uphold their duties rather than go on a military campaign in early modern Europe than the Greek city states at their prime or the Roman empire? Could it also have something to do with access to armaments and other equipment?
