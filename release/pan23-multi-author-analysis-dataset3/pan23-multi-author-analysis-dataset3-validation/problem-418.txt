That would be a lot worse for the kid than being left with honestly highly trusted members of society in an extremely public and secure and videotaped location... at the very least, could warrant panic. Again, the authorities didn't charge anyone or anything, and plenty of times things like this happen it gets referred to the home nations child services etc... just a fuckup.
Again judging by the fact that the police came, investigated, and said it was handled... it was handled. If they investigated and there was reasonable suspicion they were trying to abandon the child they would have referred it back to the home nations legal systems... this also happens once in a while. Fuck me for trusting the police did their job i guess lmao.
Maybe a tiny sliver of malicious compliance combined with not fully understanding policies. They thought free baby, but the seat held things up, during confusion with no ability to get ticket just run to try to stop the plane?
Yeah last i traveled with toddlers, awhile back, some airlines were leaning towards ticketing them for the near future for safety reasons. That's why I wasn't sure plus was in a hurry and didn't read üòÅThanks.
