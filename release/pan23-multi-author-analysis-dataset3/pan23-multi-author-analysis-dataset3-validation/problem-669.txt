For a long time, the study of the Eastern Front in World War II was significantly hampered by all of the factors that I mentioned above, and more beyond that. Much of the core issue stemmed from the rising antagonism between East and West which meant that Western historians lacked access to Soviet archives and other sources, while at the same time they did not only have extensive access to German sources, they further had access to the Germans themselves. this is perhaps best exemplified by Gen. Franz Halder, who had served as head of OKH during the war, and after became closely involved with the U.S. Army Historical Division, although the memoirs of commanders such as Manstein, Guderian, and Mellenthin too were hugely influential in shaping post-bellum perceptions of the Eastern Front in the West. That isn't to say that there weren't always Western scholars doing their very best to seek out an honest, and balanced understanding, but sheer will-power isn't enough to overcome something such as an archive closed off by the Soviet government.
Beginning in the '80s, and especially taking off after the end of the Cold War and the sudden influx of previously inaccessible Soviet documentation, historians like Glantz, House, or Reese have all played important parts in bringing about a reevaluation, and helping us better understand the Great Patriotic War from a more honest perspective, but it remains a problem still. The sheer weight of historiography is hard to crawl out from under, and the conventional wisdom of the Eastern Front is still chock-full of the kinds of erroneous information that while mostly gone from academia still inhabits the world of popular histories to an uncomfortable degree (The "Clean Wehrmacht Myth" is still disturbingly common in popular discourse, for starters), not to mention remains present in popular media such as Enemy at the Gates or Call of Duty.
What is your opinion on the accusations made by some of the "military military historians" like John Lynn, which claims that the "New Military History" approach focuses too much on the social and cultural aspect of the military that it ignores their fundamental purpose: the actual warfare?
Of course, even from the PoV of "military military history", accepting the apologetic of former German generals without question is simply badhistory and analyzing sources from both sides are absolutely essential. But does the one-sided view of the cold war era historians negate the raison d'Ãªtre of "military military history" itself?
One thing alluded to in the military history answer is just how striking the paucity of sources were that historians had to work with until circa 1990. Whatever a historian's opinion on the Cold War - and opinions mattered a lot - basically if you were writing political or social history of any kind, you pretty much had to work with: 1) official Soviet publications, 2) dissidents' accounts published in the West, 3) the Smolensk Party Archives that were captured by the Germans and then captured by the Americans in World War II, and 4) a sociological study conducted by Harvard on Soviet immigrants in the 1950s.
