Not only because they may or may not have mental or physical degradation, but because they are increasingly out of touch with the world they are being elected to lead.
Biden seems in relatively good health. He has always been a gaffe machine, and most of the criticism of his mental states has been gaffes, but it absolutely is a legitimate concern.
He's getting shit done, he's surrounded by competent people, and we don't wake up every morning wondering whether he's going to start WW3 over a mean tweet. And yes, that's a low bar, but honestly it's nice just to have a bar again.
I think most of us would prefer a younger, more progressive president, but Biden's age doesn't seem to make him ineffective, or more importantly, dangerous, so why should anyone care?
That said, I would like a younger person in the Oval Office, as long as that younger person is not a Republican.
In 2000, my vote helped Mel Carnahan defeat John Ashcroft for MO-SEN. Carnahan was quite dead when I cast my vote.
So, Biden's age, or in fact even his status as a living person, are not deal breakers for me. I'm voting D unless the Democrats somehow nominate Satan Prince of Darkness, in which case I'd probably vote Green. Or maybe write in someone.
