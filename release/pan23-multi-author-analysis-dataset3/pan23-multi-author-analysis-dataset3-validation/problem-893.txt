Thank you! Could you comment on the black powder , the ones that units with? As I understand, these grenades (in their latest, cast iron form) also remain the international ) often used for various branches of frontline infantry.
Could the cartoon version be a folk conflation of large and a hand bomb with its protruding fuse cork and prominent match fuse?
The classic cartoon bomb is a combination of a couple of things; the case, and the fuse. While an artillerist preparing a shot for their cannon wouldn't ever have a long string of quick match sticking out the top of the case, the difficulty of timing things exactly right could lead to unexploded shells lying or rolling on the battlefield or inside forts with their fuses still lit.
im curious how the fuse could be easy/quick/reliable enough to light just from the brief moment of firing when the shell is still in the barrel, but not burn so fast that the shell prematurely detonate before arriving at the right range.
so how does the artillery crew guarantee that the fuse would be lit just from the firing process from the blackpowder charge?
and could the artillery crew depend on this fuse set up? (as in only limited unexploded ordnance) or would it be common to see dud shells in this era?
