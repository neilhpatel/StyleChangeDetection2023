I just find it unfair that she gets what she wants and I have to pay her for it. I wanted to be there for the child but because I don’t have $60,000 I will never be able to take her to court over it and she’s not willing to allow me access to him outside of court.
I know that I have no right to force her to do anything she doesn’t want to do because of her reproductive rights/ human rights. That’s not what I’m talking about, I meant if she has the choice to get an abortion without my consent than why can’t I opt out of being the babies legal father in the same time frame?
Because babies are the expected result of sex, two people have sex, men can't have abortions, and once the child is born, the child's right to support cannot be waived by anyone else. You cannot waive the child's right to be supported by both parents.
You have the same rights the mother does to refuse intercourse, to use birth control, and to abort a child you are carrying. Biology is unfair, in that you cannot carry a child, but the law is not unfair in addition to this.
Court-ordered custody and child support would do a lot to give you peace of mind, even though it would mean paying regularly when you don't pay today, because it nails down the specific amount and often makes the actual process of paying easier. It also means you have clear rules around when you each see your child, which can be enforced. Family courts are geared to allow people to navigate the process without a lawyer - you probably have more access to them than you realize, if you want to be able to see your child.
