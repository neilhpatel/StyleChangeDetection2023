I am a first period history student in Brazil, and have been studying the formation of american colonial societies during the 16th and 17th centuries. We have only now started studying the formation of north american societies and the 13 colonies. Our next class will be on how slavery developed in the USA and how it shaped its society.
But I've noticed that the available texts and materials are somewhat limited: the only available text is Slavery and Freedom: the American Paradox, a publication in the Journal of American History by professor Edmund S. Morgan.
So I got curious: what publications or books are used as references in the US, when studying the subject? As in, what do american history students first read on the subject of slavery and the trans-atlantic slave traffic?
I read a whole lot of Henry a Louis Gates as an African American studies major, especially The Slave Narratives because those primary sources are gold.
Thereâ€™s one book I remember clearly, which you might already have read: Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia by Joao Jose Reis (1993).
