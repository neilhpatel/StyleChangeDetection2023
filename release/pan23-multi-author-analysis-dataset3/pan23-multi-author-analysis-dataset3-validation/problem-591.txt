I just don't understand the meaning of the sentences then. They never state what is allowed to be ticket, only what is NOT, and it states that not stopping is not allowed to be ticketed. I'm open to having my mind changed, and I'm seeking that. I just want to understand better.
I'm sorry, I'm still confused. Does it not say I don't have to stop? It says whether I stop or not, I can't get a citation if it was done in a careful and prudent manner. Also, I didn't say I never stopped. The video cuts out while I am still on the crosswalk.
And you keep saying I didn't stop lol I never stated that. The video cuts out before I make the turn so it can't be determined from the video whether I stopped fully or not.
Ohhh I see where you're coming from. So you're saying that "careful and prudent" means stopping (or rather, could mean stopping), thus making the rest of the wording void?
It hinges on the definition of "Careful and Prudent". Some jurisdictions define it, others don't. That's why the clarification was added.
