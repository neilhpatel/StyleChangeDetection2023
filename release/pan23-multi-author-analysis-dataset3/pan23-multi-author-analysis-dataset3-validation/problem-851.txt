I.e. There’s 435 Representatives. 213 of them are Democrats, and 222 Republicans. If there was a vote where 10 Republicans voted “Present” (meaning they effectively don’t really give a crap who wins, or are just being petulant), and the Democrats are unanimous in their votes, then, at 213 to 212, the Democrats would have picked the new Democratic Speaker of the House.
What would be more likely is that the far right wingnuts keeps eating each others faces, the more moderate GOP members get tired of the shit, and a deal gets cut where the moderate GOP members and the Democrats all vote in a moderate GOP member as speaker.
Yes...either plurality...or enough republicans leave the floor to lower the threshold...or Jefferies /democrats strike deals with 5-8 republicans who are willing to switch parties since they would become pariahs to the Republicans.
Or until enough members leave the floor to lower the threshold....I believe it's less than 20 members...but if they leave from the republican caucus Jefferies gets it bc the democratic caucus is unified.
