How is he "trying to sue"? His lawyer will either sue or they won't. People threaten to sue all the time; ignore them until you're actually sued. Don't talk to him, don't talk to his lawyer, don't answer any questions, don't offer any explanations, don't justify anything, don't explain anything -- full stop. No communication at all. If any third parties try to talk to you about it, just say "he threatened to sue me so I won't be discussing the matter".
In that case, let them handle it. His lawyer is probably digging to see what your coverage is and if there's anything he can use against them in their investigation. They're just making you aware, and they may swat down his attempts to get more money.
Lawsuits in car accidents are typically limited to the amount of the policy because there's a huge difference between collecting a judgement funded by an insurance policy and collecting a judgement funded by an individual's own finances.
If you actually are sued, let your insurance company know immediately. If they tell you they won't represent you, hire your own lawyer who specializes in insurance / auto claims.
If for any reason you get sued and your auto insurance company won't represent you, hire your own attorney immediately. You need someone skilled in insurance claims to protect yourself against fraud. You as the driver have at least some (probably a majority) responsibility for his loss, but you also want to make sure you aren't paying for fake or exaggerated issues.
No, as the driver, your passengers' safety is your responsibility. If you want him to wear a seatbelt, you don't drive till it's on.
You had people in the car, and so you were responsible for their safety. Not sure who the slimy one is here.
