The cartels actually try hard to not antagonize the USA too much (even while they turn parts of Mexico into warzones) because we can always close the border crossings. Most illegal drugs are smuggled in through border crossings, and that's the lifeblood of the cartels.
The only difference is you in the US has many drug addicts and Mexico many deaths but in the both side exists cartels maybe you can't see it but they are there.
Hahaha you are so funny and ignorat, of course every years americans spend thounds or even millions of dollars in hard drugs and you say there no cartels ?
A liberal way to fix this would be to legalize drugs in the United States so that American money will be spent on businesses rather than on criminals.
The current system empowers criminals, weakens Latin America (maybe part of the Monroe Doctrine?) and makes American drug addicts far more harmful than they need to be, by bankrolling cartels.
The reason Mexico has cartels is that in the beginning it was a source of Income for many people without damaging the country. It is basically exports even if it is black market, it helps the economy. The same reason Indian government is reluctant to close the fake call- centers which scam Americans because it does not harm them.
