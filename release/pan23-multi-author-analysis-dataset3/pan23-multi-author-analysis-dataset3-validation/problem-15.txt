There is simply no way that a hospital has that exact wording. Since OP is in Utah, I looked at the state sponsored "stepping up for Utah babies" program and downloaded their toolkit (Step 1) found here. It would be completely unacceptable for a hospital to refuse food to an infant because the mother is unable to or unwilling to breastfeed.
The pendulum has swung too far in the breast milk direction in some hospitals - to the sincere detriment of babies and parents.
I don’t write this simply as a disgruntled Mum. I write this as pediatric professional who (coincidentally) had a horrific breastfeeding experience. My 3 kids spent a combined 175 days in the NICU. I’ve seen things that people would assume must be exaggerated. They aren’t. It truly can be that bad.
“Baby friendly” hospitals can be militantly pro-nursing. Unless a pediatrician prescribes formula for a medical reason, it will not be offered or supplied. They won’t even offer pacifiers to a crying baby as it may cause “nipple confusion.”.
