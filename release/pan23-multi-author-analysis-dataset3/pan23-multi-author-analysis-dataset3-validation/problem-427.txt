Technically they are bad for the environment; all transportation is. All consumption is. Bikes are just far better than the alternative forms of transportation, including walking, and the main goal right now is to drastically reduce consumption; especially of those forms of consumption that do the most environmental damage and/or create the most emissions.
Counter-argument: The increase in health from cycling far more than off-sets the (questionable) claim of a larger carbon-per-calorie footprint in the lessening of pressure on the healthcare system, which itself is a large-scale polluter at the level of manufacturing and logistics.
If you account for the carbon cost of food production and the carbon cost of the production of the bicycle, then the difference in energy efficiency between cycling and walking quickly favors the bicycle. Obviously the more you ride, the quicker the bicycle becomes the favorable option. If you never go anywhere, then it would be better to not buy a bicycle.
If you live a 30 minute bike ride from work. That's a 90 minute walk. You might have time for a 3 hours of walking a day but I doubt most would choose it.
