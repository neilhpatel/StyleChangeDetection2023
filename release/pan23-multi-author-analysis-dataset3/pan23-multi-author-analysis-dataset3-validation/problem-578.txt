I’m a lawyer. I think your answer depends on the jurisdiction. In most jurisdictions you can file a “motion to quash subpoena” which is a request to the court to invalidate the subpoena. In some jurisdictions, there must be some language on the subpoena itself about what to do if you wish to quash the subpoena. You should call an attorney in your jurisdiction and find out whether he or she thinks you must turn it over and also get information about how to quash the subpoena.
OP: My first call would be to the former defendants/new plaintiffs asking, basically, "I got this subpoena. How TF do these people know about this video? We BOTH AGREED to keep the previous settlement and all the information about the previous case confidential. What else have you been telling them in violation of our agreement?
That seems unnecessarily overwrought. OP is a third party. The former defendant/new plaintiff already knows about the existence of the video. Both OP and that former defendant are parties to a settlement agreement that requires them both to do specific things. OP seems like (s)he is willing to provide the video, but doesn't want to get in trouble for violating the settlement agreement.
It's really unlikely that there is an actual court order separate from a settlement agreement requiring OP not to disclose the contents of the video. That wouldn't just be the court sealing the records -- it would be the court imposing a prior restraint on one of the parties. Except in exceptional cases, that only happens in the context of an agreement between the parties, and it's only those parties who would have the ability to complain to the court about the other party not following the agreement.
Here's what I'd be interested in: normally, those obligations are mutual: the defendant in that old case doesn't have any more of a right to disclose information about that case than you do. And, it seems like they want to do that in their current lawsuit.
Id contact the Plaintiff's attorneys and let them know. If they don't file a motion to quash the subpoena its up to you if you want to tell them they are requesting sealed information in your response to their discovery request.
In the Op's shoes, I would file a motion to quash, mention the confidentiality clause, and ask the court what to do. Alternatively, the Plaintiffs may have an interest in doing so.
