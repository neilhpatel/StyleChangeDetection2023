Whitmarsh isn't looking so much to scientific progress in the ancient world for skepticism about the gods, but rather to a philosophical mode of inquiry. In considering the story of Salmoneus -- a man who, so the story goes, declared himself to be Zeus and demanded sacrifices be made to him-- Whitmarsh asks "If gods can be fashioned by mortal imitation, how real can they be?‚Äù.
It's important that the Greeks and Romans didn't necessarily understand their "gods" as we understand gods in revealed religions with scriptures and creeds. When Caesar Augustus was deified-- did people subsequently think of him as a "god" in the way that believers mean today? Some did - and one can think of contemporary traditions like the canonization of deceased Popes that seems roughly analogous-- but many plainly didn't see him as any more than a dead Emperor.
The short answer is yes, though the connection to progress in science isn't the necessary nor sufficient predicate. The ancients did have "progress in science" but more than a thousand years later we can find intensely religious men like Isaac Newton, who made substantial progress in science without becoming atheists-- though one can argue that Newton's science substantially altered his religion.
On that note it's also important that the Greeks and Romans had very little by way of scripture or creed. Religion might be thought of somewhat similar to Shinto, various traditions and stories, shrines of ritual and sometimes political importance, but lacking elements to parallel what we see in, say, the Abrahamic faiths. To have doubts about a religion with a scriptural and enthusiastically taught creed -- that's quite different as an intellectual position than to have doubts about beliefs that are promulgated with much less philosophical vigor in the first place.
I'll also note that one (clear but perhaps not decisive) reason to be against an atheistic interpretation of Epicurus' theology is that making oneself like God is an important part of ancient Greek ethical theories, and it doesn't make sense in an atheistic worldview. The Epicureans believe that what we should aspire to be like in our lives as human beings (i.e., peace of mind, peace of body, etc.) is precisely what the gods are like on their view: not needing anything for their bodies, and not being disturbed by anything mentally. Attributing to Epicurus outright atheism forces us to jettison a natural part of their ethical theory.
To be fair, there are some scholars who support an atheistic interpretation of Epicurus' theology. But I don't find it a convincing position, and my impression is it's generally in the minority among those working on Hellenistic philosophy.
