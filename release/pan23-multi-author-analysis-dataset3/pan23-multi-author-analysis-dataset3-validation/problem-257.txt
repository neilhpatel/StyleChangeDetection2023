It’s kind of you but no matter your efforts I don’t think many parents would let their kid eat it. I wouldn’t and I am pretty chill about things but strangers cooking for trick or treat, again sweet, just sadly I wouldn’t do it.
I'm sorry to say but I would not accept home baked goods from a stranger especially for my children. They would 100% end up in the trash no matter how good they looked. Save the home baking for friends and family and buy candy like everyone else.
Get the bucket of commercial candy like everyone else for the kids, save the macarons for a delightful All Saints Day tea and luncheon with your adult friends.
1) Many parents make kids wait til they come home to eat any goodies, meaning your precious and perfectly sculpted macaron's getting thrown in a pillowcase with a few pounds of halloween candy for the long walk home.
2) Little kids, no matter how posh, won't appreciate your sophisticated pistachio macarons that took you hours to make. They're looking for Reese's and Milky Ways. Give some badass preteen out late-night trick or treating a macaron? You're asking for a TP-ing or egging.
Everyone's already mentioned the obvious: most parents throw out any trick or treat goodies that aren't factory sealed and there's a pandemic on (and kids aren't vaccinated yet!).
