The laws of a divorce are the same for everyone. The way it can be more difficult on you really just depends on the specific facts of your case. Asking us to run down how it could be bad is asking us to basically come up with every single scenario in our heads and list them for you. That's a lot to ask and not necessarily helpful to you. You should consult with a divorce attorney so that you can talk to him/her about your specific life and how it would be affected during a divorce.
My advice is to consult a few divorce attorneys that are NOT affiliated in any way with the church. Talk to a few, the initial consultation should be free and then you pick one. You should tell them about your concerns as well as ask about cost and possible financing.
This is a question best answered by the lawyers you consult which is something you should consider doing now. In general though, keep in mind that the more time you spend fighting over stuff, the more of your money is going to go to the lawyers.
You should probably talk to your lawyer about making sure there is no untoward influence on the judge or proceedings. JW's are notorious, dishonest cheats (as you have found out) so expect a lot of dirty pool from her and her cult. Anticipate your entire church and community treating you like a child rapist. Based on your reports of your wifes responses a false allegation isn't out of the question either.
