In addition to calling the cops to report the new crime, call the DA's office for the prior case; they really don't like criminals screwing with their witnesses.
As most of the posts tell you, call the police and inform them that this is harassment of a former witness.
Harassment is a crime in any situation. So is destroying property. Threatening a witness BEFORE a hearing/trial is an additional crime. I don't know the state of the law as to whether there are specific crimes related to basically punishing a witness for having been a witness.
Well, sure. And if there were no video and a keyed car, there would be circumstantial evidence this guy did it based on his past conduct and the threats. But he'd never be convicted on that evidence. My point being that it often does matter whether you only have circumstantial evidence vs. direct evidence.
Your video evidence is NOT circumstantial evidence (which is evidence in which you infer a fact from the circumstances). All you'd need is a witness saying what he was wearing that day and the video would be pretty conclusive. The cops don't care because this is a really minor crime, but you should think about a civil restraining order, which has a lower burden of proof.
Regardless, keying a car is not a serious crime in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't seem like OP made the police aware of the history.
