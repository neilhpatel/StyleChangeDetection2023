I asked you if you think the strike only affects the oligarchs, not who benefits the most ?Before you ask me a question, try answering what you're asked first.
Letting a massive strike cripple the economy would make the corporations hurt, and would make the rest of us hurt too. We shouldn't let labor take a hammer to the knee of the economy.
The progressive wing of the party has no actual answers. They just promise pie in the sky policy with no real way of enacting them, and then yell at the governing wing of the party for not managing to deliver us unicorns that fart gold. Progressive wing doesn't know how to actually win in the purple and red areas that matter.
Biden's BBB had paid sick leave. But voters didn't elect two more senators in 2020, so Manchin and Sinema were able to dramatically chop BBB down to just a few policies. And voters had a chance to rectify that this year, but chose not to. Don't get mad at Congress, get mad at the voters who constantly refuse to enable Democrats with the majorities they'd need to get things done, and who instead leave Democrats with no choice but to pivot to the center.
Democrats need rural Democrats in order to win elections, the only reason Democrats won in 2020 was because of Republicans failures and the country being sick of Trump...No one voted because they were excited about the Democratic platform. The same was true for 2022, voters came out to the polls to protect their civil rights due to a fear that the Supreme Court would take even more rights from them. Voters did not reach the polls on the strenh of the Democratic leadership, but again due to Republican corruption, failure and influence in the Supreme Court.
No matter how you look at it, the midterms were still a loss for Democrats, New York state lost seats in the House because the state doubled down on its concealed carry law in the courts. Pushing unreasonable gun control lost rural Democrat support where it traditionally was there.
The 24' elections are already lost by focusing on gun control, Democrats needed rural Democrats to win and they lost them by pushing unpopular legislation.
Democrats just relatively speaking smoked Republicans in the midterms and you're like "There is no hope for the Democrats next election." Get out of here with the doom and gloom. It's pretty obvious gun rights is a hot button issue for you, but the Dems are doing the right thing by pushing for this. Guns, specifically the AR-15, are responsible for tragedy after tragedy in this nation and someone needs to take action. You might think this polls terribly for rural areas, and you'd be right, but I really want to know what alternate reality you're living in where Democrats could drop gun control from their platform and that would convince rural voters to suddenly switch sides.
Again I am not referring to republican voters but rural Democrat voters who feel unrepresented. They are a larger demographic than you think.
