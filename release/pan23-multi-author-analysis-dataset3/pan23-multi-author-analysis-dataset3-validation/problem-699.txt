Generally when people threaten to sue you, they are full of it. Blanket advice is if you get something official be sure to go to court and probably contact a lawyer, but don't lose sleep over it meanwhile. It's usually just a trick to control others. If you are losing sleep, you can always consult an attorney for real advice.
Presumably they think they are suing you for defamation. There is more to it, but the short version, is generally if it is true, you are in the clear.
Sealed means that a random person can't look it up. Presumably you and your sister did not agree not to talk about it and were not ordered by the court not to talk about it. (Although hopefully, you checked with your sister before posting that comment, because that sounds like her private info.).
Yes. Sealing a case means that the official record is sealed. But lacking a gag order issued by the court you are under no requirement to remain silent.
If a judge did issue a gag order I would assume it would be lifted once the case was resolved as there really isnâ€™t any merit to an indefinite one.
I would also think the only time an NDA would come into play is if they went to civil courts and entered into a stipulated agreement which exchanged money for damages & an NDA.
