Thatâ€™s actually a bad example. Most newer cars, and VWs of that vintage for sure, have special chips in the keys which can only be programmed by a dealer.
Key codes are recorded by the manufacturer when the car is made, which is why dealers can produce them by doing a VIN lookup. I don't know of any general locksmith that can do this, unless they are somehow authorized by a dealership or manufacturer.
I don't know exactly how it goes with key fobs but your dealership should be able to get you a new key because they know your car. But i don't know about the programing or if you car absolutely needs the fob or not.
The locksmith should be able to do it they will open your car first then get the code off the door or the dealership can tell you the code and a locksmith could make you a new one based off that.
You call an automotive locksmith that offers a mobile service, or the car dealership and ask. They make the keys, not you. May have to provide your VIN. What year/make/model is it? Google "replacement keys 2015 VW GTI" or whatever it is. But pretty much any automotive locksmith can tell you what you need. Or have it towed to a locksmith.
This is really more of a problem to be solved with Google and your cell phone, than with Reddit, at this point.
1. Call an automotive locksmith that offers a mobile service for Dodge Caravan cars. Just call them until someone says they do.
