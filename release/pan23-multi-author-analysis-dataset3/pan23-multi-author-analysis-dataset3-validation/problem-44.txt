The barrier of requirements to prove that this is a malicious and wasteful lawsuit is far too high to take any actions against Trump or his lawyers. In fact, this is no where even close to meeting those requirements and this lawsuit is legit.
The legitimacy or the grounds for the lawsuit, however, are NOT the same thing as actually winning the case. \\What all of us understand is there is no way in hell Trump can win this case because the evidentiary requirements are likely insurmountable.\\ The foundations of his case are there since the 2018 Mueller Report came out. But timing of when those articles where written and the Mueller Report are essential. Trump's team has to prove that those writers were aware of the facts and maliciously defamed Trump on purpose. This is the tall order that has to be proven in court. This is what all of us understand and see why this case is a waste of time. But that's the requirement to have a legitimate civil case tried in court, or not. Hence why this case is moving forward.
Answer: this will force out some facts about that situation during discovery and we might learn more about the Russian Collusion story.
So you're saying the precedence set in those 2 cases is not applicable to the news stories written by those Pulitzer Prize story writers about the Russian Collusion?
"I need someone to blame for my downward spiral" + "Russia's making headlines" = "Sue the Pulitzer board for saying I'm in cahoots with Russia"?
We have all moved on from the "Russia Russia Russia" at this point with bountiful ACTIONABLE scandals, if there is literally ANY method to this madness, that would have to be it.
