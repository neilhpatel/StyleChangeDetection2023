Depends on how fast they put them out of service and how fast they go through regularly changed parts live wheels and brakes. You can also run through disposable parts like filters pretty quick.
You might think that, but it doesn’t work that way unless you’re grounding a large portion of the fleet just for parts. Some parts that are changed very regularly. Think tires and brakes. Then there are the parts that you find broken or worn out of limits the same way on multiple planes when you start looking for parts.
As soon as the planes stopped being officially serviced and installed with legal parts, their service history was broken. If the leasing companies took them back and any incident ever happened, then the leasing companies would be blamed.
Their only recourse now is to sue Russia in various juridictions around the world and claim the full outstanding value of the airframes back in cash, because the actual airframes are now without commercial value.
Not only are they unable to fly in countries where Russian airlines have been banned, but they're also at increased risk- and a risk that's possibly not worth it- if they fly to any country where it's theoretically possible that the Western owners could have the planes seized and repossessed by legal means.
What's interesting is that, for any planes they haven't bought from the leasing companies and where the companies want- and have the right to- demand their planes back under the original agreement, Russia is potentially even more restricted in what they can do with them.
Aeroflot's is, and there are a lot of reasons for that; Russia produces very few long-haul airliners, and the ones it does produce don't have EASA/FAA/CAA certification for passenger flights. Both of those become less of an issue in an isolated Russia.
That's true, and I'm not saying they won't need them to some extent. But without daily flights to the major US cities and EU capitals, they can squeek by with a smaller fleet, gradually cannibalising some of their stock.
