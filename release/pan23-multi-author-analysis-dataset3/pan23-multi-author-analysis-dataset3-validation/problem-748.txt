It's exactly the situation that spawned the Rwandan genocide: after Tutsi rebels killed the Rwandan president, the Hutu systematically massacred the Tutsi population.
Right now, the situation makes no sense legally or morally. We're all waiting for the genocide to end to start mourning a people begging for help while the UN periodically asks : "mind if we come take a look? No? Alright then.".
Bruh. As I said, again and again, I agree 100% they should be in jail. And I also agree with everything you said regarding our shitty coalition.
Too bad Jordan didn't want it back or the Palestinians did not accept peace and sovereignty that was offered then.
There was no Palestinian state before, and Israel didnâ€™t just wake up one day and decide to steal some land.
But until they are you'll get murders, Israel needs to reign in its settlers and Palestinian terrorists can be dealt with as a separate issue then.
Until the occupation ends Palestinians will be RIGHT to fight occupation, if you were occupied by a foreign power you'd have the right to do so to.
If the Palestinians wanted to have a state in the West Bank they should have accepted one when it was offered to them. Instead they chose terror.
They instead chose violence. And 50 years later an army of ignorant redditors justify their terror, making the absolutely ignorant mistake of drawing some delusional line between fanatic Islamic terrorist Palestinian leaders to innocent native Americans. It's insane really.
