"Masterpiece Cakeshop’s lawyers are back before the court, making the same argument with a new client. (303 Creative has actually never made a wedding website for anyone, but it claims that it can’t even get started without a legal ruling that it can turn away gay couples.)".
Yes. The plaintiff is seeking a preliminary injunction preventing the Colorado Civil Rights Commission from enforcing two clauses of the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act against her business.
She has a website business. She just doesn't offer wedding websites because the state would come after her for discrimination if she did. She wants to start making wedding websites only for straight weddings, but is unable to do so under existing law without putting herself in legal jeopardy.
The uncertain possibility of her making wedding websites isn't the only issue that the courts are looking at here. It's true, she may or may not be approached by somebody seeking a wedding website that she'll have to refuse, and that may not be certain enough to justify standing.
It sounds like her refusing to make a wedding website for LGBQT customers that is against her religion is a similar situation.
No, the question is: is it a violation of her 1st amendment rights to be forced by CO law to create wedding websites for LGBTQ customers requesting them.
Not at all, she would literally be compelled by CO to offer that service to LGBTQ customers if she wanted to have a wedding website company at all. The clash here is that she claims the CO state law compelling her to serve LGBTQ customers violates her federal rights in the 1st amendment. So she claims the Constitution overrules the CO law they are trying to make her comply with, questions the legality of that regulation on her business.
Under CO law sure but is that CO law violating the 1st amendment right she claims she has? Which is what the court is being asked to address.
How did this get to the Supreme Court? We have a serious problem in America if people like that are taken seriously.
