It's always baffled me why we don't make a larger effort to call countries what they call themselves. I mean, I get it in this case where pronunciation doesn't really change, but if the language uses the same or largely similar alphabet, why not use their spelling? We're just too dumb to learn an unfamiliar word? So we say "that's not your name, your name is what I choose to call you"?
No one ever suggested it did. Though I challenge your assertion, Finland and Sweden joining NATO absolutely will have an impact on the war, the question is what would that impact be? How would Russia react?
So as soon as they for first time announced Russia to be war belligerent, that was it. They are war belligerent, they shall not pass. Except what black sea fleet ships Russia had out in Mediterranean.
As that was declared it was pretty much done. Since not only can Turkey shut the straits..... they must. As per treaty it is forbidden to belligerent ships to pass, except to return to home port.
However these waiting ships are from the Russian Pacific fleet and thus can not claim return passage back home.
So this isn't situation where say ErdoÄŸan could do a political favor and allow passage. The treaty is clear. No belligerent passage..... by any side of the conflict. To let Varuag and its escort to pass would mean Turkey would have had to violate the treaty. Which is not something to do lightly.
They have overseas naval vase in Tarsus, Syria. Probably been chilling out the lot of the time. Not like they have been waiting and waiting to rush in Turkey near immediately declared they would activate Montreux treaty and shut down the Turkish straits to military traffic of the conflict parties Ukraine and Russia, plus well anyone else really sending ships with intend to take part in the conflict.
Any force large enough to simultaneously taken out all the guns before passing, ignoring anti ship missile launchers, would be very noticeable as an invasion force, and would cause turkey to send their fleet there as well as requesting NATO navy support.
Just because you know the position of a whole range of defensive guns doesn't mean you can just take them out, even if you didn't mind declaring war on turkey and NATO while losing a war against another small independent nation.
The point i guess is that Turkey wasn't afraid of Russia, they knew Russia was operating there, they shot down the russian fighter not because they didn't know it was russian, they shot it down because they don't give a fuck if is russian or syrian or whatever.
