Thanks a lot for your answer. Honestly everything I know about this I learned by reading a lot of wikipedia pages, and the requirements I listed were my best understanding of the situation, which led me to think about Ethiopia.
I knew they had reached out to Napoleon because he was powerful, but I didn't imagine to what extent the power of France was a factor in their decision.
This at this time meant 2 things, being a competent military leader and having French influence/backing. Napoleon was at the height of his power and it was perceived in Sweden that the French and Russian empires were going to clash again in the near future. Betting on the French side would mean an opportunity to regain the lost lands. They were not wrong and barely a year later Napoleon was planning and executing his war of 1812 against Russia.
It should be noted that at this time Sweden had already had a lot of involvement from Russia in it's affairs. And Russia, while for the last century had (arguably) been the main opponent of Sweden, was for once not overtly threatening. The deposed king Gustav IV actually had had fairly good relations with the Russian tsar Paul at the time. Later making war against the successor Alexander due to personal antipathy against him and especially Napoleon. At this point a smaller nation like Sweden had to consider what it's more powerful neighbours thought.
