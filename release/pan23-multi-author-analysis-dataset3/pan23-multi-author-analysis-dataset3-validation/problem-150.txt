Pullman would go on to add about a dozen different types of accommodations over the years. But beneath Pullman cars were coaches. In later years these would be broken up between coaches and chair cars. The difference being being coaches would have the walk over seats and usually higher capacity versus chair cars had more bucket type seats, most famously the Heywood-Wakefield Sleepy Hollow seats in the post war era. Usually the faster trains, the so called crack-varnish, would have the nicer equipment. Which factor in the next item to consider, the train.
To clarify there is a locomotive, and cars. I would have thought the locomotive might dictate which cars it would run as it is the power house.
Locomotives tend to be purpose built. Some locomotives are passenger locomotives, some are freight, some are for switching in yards, a few are dual service passenger and freight.
On busier railroads there could be many passenger trains running between many different places. Unlike flying, trains really aren’t based on end city pairs, but all city pairs the trains stopped in.
Another type of train in the mix similar to these are commuter trains. These train were the direct predecessors to MBTA, MTA, New Jersey Transit, SEPTA, and others. I’m not really going to dwell on these. I think that concept is generally well understood.
