I had no idea Mae West was pushing the boundaries in entertainment so much. I was surprised, until I read it landed her in prison. That sounded like the ending I expected. Thanks for the info!
Thank you! Yes, there are a lot of women considered gay icons. You might be interested in Gay Icons: The (Mostly) Female Entertainers Gay Men Love, a non-academic text by Georges-Claude Guilbert that discusses a few dozen different icons.
The idea of a female entertainer becoming a "gay icon" goes back even earlier than Judy Garland - Mae West actually had this honor in the 1930s, and as she's the originator, understanding why can help to explain this tradition.
In 1926, West wrote, directed, and starred in a play titled Sex, which centered on a sex-worker protagonist; not only did it treat her sympathetically, she ends the show happily, going off to Australia with a respectable former client. Her next, The Drag, centered on a young gay man in an unhappy marriage and featured a drag ball at the opening of the third act. (This one doesn't end happily, although the story's perspective is most sympathetic to the gay male characters.) Both were shut down and landed her in prison, which only helped to cement her reputation. She was also supportive of homosexuality/gay rights on a personal level, actively soliciting gay actors for The Drag and catering to her gay fans later in life, although in this she did bend to appease the mores of the times to some extent before the 1960s.
Many other female performers have reached this status as well, usually for similar reasons, typically including their support of gay rights and their relationships with gay fans. Cher, Madonna, and Lady Gaga, for instance, have numerous looks (and voices, particularly when it comes to Cher) that can be easily dragged into camp. Many other actresses from Garland's period also have an iconic status due to onscreen roles (like Rita Hayworth in Gilda) or to a combination of aesthetic and personal issues (like Marilyn Monroe).
