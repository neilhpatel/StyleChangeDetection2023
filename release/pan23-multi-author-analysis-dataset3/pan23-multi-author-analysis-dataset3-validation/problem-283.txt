Yes Zelenskyy’s government is working towards equality. That was the last sentence of my comment. It’s the Ukrainian public that probably aren’t changing minds as fast. (I don’t have a survey from 2022-23, so can’t tell you for sure).
Yeah I imagine since the start of the war, Ukrainian people would lean more in favour of LGBT, but still doubt it would change drastically. 69% No, 14% Yes, only 4 years ago. Poland is also quite anti-LGBT and Islamophobic, it’s just the Eastern European countries in general.
Ukraine is pretty anti-LGBT, this is just an attempt to garner more support (yes I support Ukraine in this war).
I feel like the Ukrainian government, and the people to a lesser extent at least, have been trying to overcome those views since the invasion to try and show they culturally align with Western Europe vs Russia.
Nope, nothing strictly against Ukrainians, but as someone who lives next to Ukraine I can tell you their country, as well as their people, are generally very conservative. It's sad but true that their treatment of the LGBT community has been pretty poor.
