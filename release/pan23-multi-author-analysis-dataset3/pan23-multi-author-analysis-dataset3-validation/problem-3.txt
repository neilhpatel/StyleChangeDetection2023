I'm sorry that happened to you. I especially hate it when it's someone who isn't from the US and their first experiences are like that. It makes us all look bad.
Holy crap that majorly sucks. What a horrid person. Idk if it's worth doing, but where I live there's a $5 fee to basically put a lien (I think? I could be wrong) on any property they own in the county. That's assuming you already won against him in small claims.
Just wanted to wish you luck with your small claims case! I myself am in that same boat because someone decided to lie to their insurance and I don't have full coverage.
I've called the insurance company but it sounds like they can't do much without their insurance details, and my deductible is going to be more than the cost of the repair so isn't going to make sense to claim.
They can’t really do anything, you’re right but it’s good customer service to their insureds to try to get the other parties insurance company. I have done it multiple times to help my insureds out!
Yep I've got full coverage and made the initial call to the insurance today. They'll call back tomorrow asking for more information but they aren't certain they'll be able to get the other party's insurance details and if that's what I'm dealing with then doesn't make sense for me to claim via that method.
