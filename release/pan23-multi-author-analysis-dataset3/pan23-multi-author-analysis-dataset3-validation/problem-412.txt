Because warfighting and military concerns are intimately connected to the basis of your social and economic power. The aristocracy became the aristocracy in part because they were the ones who could afford modern warfighting gear, like horses, armor, and weapons. The state (or whatever diminished medieval equivalent existed whenever and wherever you choose to specify) didn't furnish it, the aristocracy did. Warfighting was a reflection of ones masculinity, and masculinity was the basis of one's fitness for position in the hierarchy of peers. If your fitness was questioned - perhaps by one's refusal or disinterest in waging war and instead sitting at home eating grapes and getting your feet washed - then your position in the hierarchy was, too.
This is not to say any of this is simple and there weren't examples of men in a military peerage that didn't fight, but there were extremely strong cultural forces that encouraged men of privileged classes to bear what they considered the holy burden of military service to their monarch or state or people or country (or whatever other cultural construction motivated them), at risk of ostracism, and loss of their property and position.
What examples are there of the upper strata of aristocrats experiencing serious disadvantages due to unwillingness to wage offensive, but justified given the standards of the time, war?
In essence, while I can't think of too many examples of a nobleman being totally ostracized from the peerage, a lot of observable behavior was the result of ones boundaries being tested by rivals, or a result of contested loyalties between warring parties. This is a very, very big question though, and a very good one.
Hmm good question. I am sure that some nobles would look at lawyers this way, but those in the legal profession themselves would also have their own conception of honour. From Boys to Men: Formations of Masculinity in Late Medieval Europe by Ruth Mazo Karas does an excellent job of highlighting different forms of masculinity in the Middle Ages. So scholars for example, would contest eachother's masculinity and honour through academic disputations. Their reputation was tied to their display of intellect rather than arms. A similar concept of honour might apply to those in the legal profession. And of course there were just ideas of honour that spanned social classes: honesty, loyalty etc. Sorry I can't answer more specifically; I can't recall reading about any nobles singling out lawyers as particularly dishonourable.
