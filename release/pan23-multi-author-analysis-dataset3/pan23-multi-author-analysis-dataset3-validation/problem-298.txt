What does your checkout report say at the end of the night? Keep track of your credit card tips and cash tips and total those out at the end of the night, the difference between what you have and what you earned is how much they are taking from you. Additionally as another user said, you get a more accurate percentage if you know all of your coworkers tips too. If the tips and wages don't balance out to min wage at the end of the day then you should file a report with your state labor board as well.
So you are getting tips and there most likely not any skimming unless management give themselves 40 hours of tips a week regardless of hours worked (some states management cant make tips for this reason).
So if you work the busiest shifts and busiest days you'll make as much as the person working the slowest shifts and days.
Chances are they are not counting the tips per shift, person, or even day. They collect all the tips made that week to the bank and get it counted out and then the tips go out as shares based off total staff hours work is the hourly tip amount and then staff get that amount per hour they worked.
