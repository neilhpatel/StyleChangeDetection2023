Never understood euthanasia... If someone really... really... really wants to go he can just... yeah... Why would you encourage people to kill themselves, and even fight for it?
The thing is you always have the choice. However, by offering these people euthanasia as "treatment", you actively encourage these people to just kill themselves.
The only the person that has been mentally ill since childhood could possibly make the somewhat justifiable choice of euthanasia for themselves.
At some point, the upper class will become fine or apathetic towards mass death of the poor and then euthanasia might be legal. Or maybe the NRA will decide that everyone should go out in a glorious hail of bullets and do something politically dangerous. Let's see where this timeline goes. After all, for them, death means sales.
This situation will change with increasing automation and worsening climate change (climate refugees being the most disenfranchised humans after, say, North Koreans or the poor in Myanmar).
