There's a theory of battle often called the "pulse theory" that argues that pre-modern battles consisted of many small, short clashes, interrupted by longer intervals of withdrawal, reorganization, and the like. This fits pretty well with what we know about cavalry warfare. If a horseman doesn't move into a gallop until he's 100 yards from the enemy line, and he breaks off his charge and retreats almost immediately after delivering his charge, and then reforms with his fellows once he's 150 yards away, that's not that much actual galloping, and given a few minutes rest, his warhorse will probably not be all that fatigued.
But back to the horses and battlefields: the simple answer then is that cavalry wasn't constantly charging/galloping, and fatigue management was as much a concern for cavalry as it was for infantry units. Both could trade speed for endurance or vice versa, which makes for crucial choices in warfare of any period, as good maneuvering alone could already win you entire battles. An enemy on a hill is a textbook case where the 'wrong' approach would be to charge troops (infantry or cavalry) up the hill and then fight. The added exertion and lack of rest gives a decisive advantage to the defender on the hill. This type of fatigue (e.a. "being winded") for both humans and horses is of shorter duration than one might think, and a unit that is given a short pause may easily find itself back up to near-normal fighting strenh, but nonetheless it stands to reason that both infantry and cavalry didn't sprint without good reason and would rather pace themselves. Cavalry, it should be noted, has a far higher capacity to cover intermediate distances at a high pace than humans, giving them a distinct advantage in maneuver at the scale of minutes to single digit hours ^4; a heavily loaded horse can still cover up to 2-3 times as much distance as a human in one hour.
3. Since you probably didn't come here for math (I'm gonna get cursed at if I include too much math on this sub), and it strongly depends on the individual horse and situation anyway. The paper I referenced analyzes record-holding racing horses in the late 19th century, which is a very far fetch from war horses in ancient/medieval times loaded with armor.
With V the velocity [m/s] and T the time [seconds] that velocity can be sustained. E.a. as you double your speed, the time you can keep that pace is 2^9 = 512 times as low. This was their generalized find from multiple modes of travel for not just horses but also men running, swimming, skating, et cetera. I would expect reality to deviate quite a bit from calculated values, but for just a rule of thumb it does illustrate the hefty price you pay when trying to get somewhere faster quite nicely.
