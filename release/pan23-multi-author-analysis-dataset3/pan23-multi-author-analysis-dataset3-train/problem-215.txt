I contacted the moderation team and they replied that simply being wrong wasn't enough to invoke this rule.
I felt that this violated the soapbox rule, as the majority of the question wasn't asking anything, or even introducing a premise about the subject area, it was just the OP putting out their (potentially false) beliefs.
A few months ago there was a question with an opening post consisting of nearly 200 words, of which 8 were the question and the remaining 190 were the OP introducing their beliefs, some close to the subject area, some quite far from it, but all in my opinion unnecessary.
So the simple issue of a false premise is addressed in which I would direct you for a longer discussion, but the short answer is that we need to balance between what we'd like to see, and what we can expect, and the issue with a false premise is that it often reflects the fact that the OP doesn't know enough about the topic to ask a better question. Removing their question would be penalizing them for their ignorance, which they are making an effort to try and correct.
