The email’s text (him to me) is “as discussed, you will be getting a 20% raise increase to a base salary of $78,000 and you will receive retroactive pay as discussed for the 6 months of 2020 through now (Agree approx. $10k). This has all been submitted and we are waiting to hear when the raises will be posted in the checks. We expect the end of March. I should get confirmation this week and will let you know”.
Another posted pointed out the “I should get confirmation this week” part. Is that the “worst” part? Sure. But as I read it, it applies to getting confirmation of when the raises will be posted in the checks. Not if you’re getting a raise.
Generally speaking, jurisdictions handle employment agreements with a more employee favorable attitude than your standard contract. Precisely because it would be trivially easy for a manager to promise the moon, wait on corporate for approval, string along employees with promises of big bucks and then say screw them. Which people do still do...but not when it’s in writing. Generally.
I mean look at how the email explicitly says 1) You discussed it, offering the possibility of an earlier oral contract. Good. 2) “You will be getting a raise”. That’s a promise. This is also good. 3) “You will receive retroactive pay” another promise. Very good.
