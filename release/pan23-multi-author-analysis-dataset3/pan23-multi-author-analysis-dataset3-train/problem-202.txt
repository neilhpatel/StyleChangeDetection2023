She can attempt to terminate the lease but without all three of your signatures, she won't be able to. You can release her from the lease by signing papers to do that but I HIGHLY recommend you do NOT do that. I made that mistake once. You become responsible for absolutely everything after that, any damage they may have caused. If she's gonna move out... fine, but don't release her from the lease.... Keep her on so you can sue her for what she owes on rent.
She doesn't have the right to just abandon the lease just because she got drunk and upset. No matter what she will be required to pay her portion of rent. That being said you cannot stop her from leaving physically and if she does you need to leave her room open and her possessions intact if they are left there. If she does not pay/stops paying then you will have to pay for the time being and will sue her in small claims for her portion of the rent.
In other words, you still have to find a way to cover her portion of the rent, regardless of whether she leaves or not.
She cannot take herself off the lease just because she feels like it, but there is nothing stopping her from just leaving. Unfortunately, assuming the 3 of you signed the same lease, you are all equally responsible for the rent.
If she does leave, send her a certified letter each month with a copy of the lease and an alert that rent will be due by x.
If she sends the money, great, otherwise pay it and do the same next month. Contact a lawyer once she misses the first payment and you have to pay to see about getting a fire lit under her.
