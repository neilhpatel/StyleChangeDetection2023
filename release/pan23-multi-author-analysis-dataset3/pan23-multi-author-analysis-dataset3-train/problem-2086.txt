And that’s a fair point and even more reason to ban Russian athletes. They will be expected to talk highly of putin and/or the war when being interviewed, so I feel like its a win win.
If you want fairness and to live in an ideal world then cancel the Olympics. I truly don’t care. But that’s not the argument here now is it? The argument is that the Russian government is committing war crimes with those same citizens who want to do tumbles on a mat or jump over shit.
why is it always the russian sympathisers that think they can validate russias atrocities by saying other countries have done bad things? do you actually think the rest of us with common sense will just be like "yeah sure good point, russia is off the hook"?
Yes, there are probably large swathes of the Russian population who oppose the war and would like to do something about it. That doesn't matter, because that's not how politics and international relations work. The country of russia, as an entity, is the one that enacted this war and the country of russia, as an entity, is what is being punished - by being sanctioned, by being cut out of the peaceful competitions the rest of the world enjoys, and by being righfully criticised by anyone with some common sense.
Well, that's assuming Russia doesn't do what it always does and puts Russian nationals competing as "individuals" in all the trappings of their country, rendering the gesture useless.
You really believe that Russian propaganda won't use the successes of "neutral" athletes to its benefit?
The job of Russian national athletes is to promote the supposed glory and superiority of the Russian nation and their fascist government. They are literally paid propagandists, except their field of work is sports and not journalism.
