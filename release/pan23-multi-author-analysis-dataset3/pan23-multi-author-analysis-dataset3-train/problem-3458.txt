1. In Feb 2019 Trump surrendered to the Taliban, released it's imprisoned leadership and thousands of Taliban militants.
2. In Late November, AFTER Trump lost re-election and to spite his loss, handicapped the incoming Biden administration and placed into extreme danger the remaining US Troops, embassy staff, Afghan allies.. he ordered a drawdown of forces to a untenable 2,500.. a number that could only protect embassy, airports only for a withdraw.
3. Regardless of who was the next President, the new Administration had the decision to order troops back into Afghanistan to the levels of 2019 (25-35k troops) OR delay a withdraw from Trump's spring 2021 timeline to a Biden withdraw of Sept 2021.
"The previous administration's agreement said that if we stuck to the May 1st deadline that they had signed on to leave by, the Taliban wouldn't attack any American forces, but if we stayed, all bets were off," Biden said on Aug. 31, 2021, in an address to the nation after the withdrawal.
> President Biden will withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan over the coming months, U.S. officials said, completing the military exit by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that drew the United States into its longest war.
