RTPCR should be taken 5 to 7 days after exposure. Surely some of them have false negative results. The positive results are probably those who already have the virus before the flight.
So in summary; you want to try to make sure no virus ever enters your body? Cool! Let us know if and when you figure that shit out. In the meantime you can live in a plastic bubble like Bubble Boy or make a giant condom to wear every day. Or you can give your body the instructions on how to fight and destroy certain viruses (vaccines). Or just roll the dice and hope you don’t die if you think it’s worth not being vaccinated.
Which is why some vaccinated people still have some symptoms and others don’t. Some have no symptoms and the virus is gone is 48 hours, while others have some symptoms for a week.
"One scenario is that there was somebody who was infected who was immunosuppressed, and it took an estimated 200 days to clear the virus. So, in one person it went through multiple mutations.".
Now, here it is. I mean, yes, they’re mixing with the rest of the world, but we’re all acting like the pandemic is over anyway, and it’s already circulating widely within every other population on the planet. So, why do we care about more of it coming out of China? They can’t spread it more than it’s already spreading, it’s literally already everywhere.
