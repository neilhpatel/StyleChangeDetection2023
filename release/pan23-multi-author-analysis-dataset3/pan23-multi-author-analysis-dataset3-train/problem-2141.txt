Would it? They would have the oil and the water, and the EU said they would effectively be fast tracked in the event of a independence win. It would be more likely catastrophic for the rest of the UK causing a break up of the union.
The common travel area definitely is an issue at the moment - that's what the protocol is there for, as a border post between Britain and Ireland. In reality there would likely need to be a hard border between England and Scotland for full integration.
While EU would be supportive of Scotland joining and there would be very few areas that would require Scotland to change in order to apply, it would not be a fast track.
Scotland would likely become a new alternative hub to the Republic of Ireland, as an English speaking country in the EU.
The eu would happily take an independent Scotland, not only to spite the Not so UK, but because Scotland would be an ideal member. This would make the English look even dumber than they do right now, which is impressive considering how dumb they look after truss.
