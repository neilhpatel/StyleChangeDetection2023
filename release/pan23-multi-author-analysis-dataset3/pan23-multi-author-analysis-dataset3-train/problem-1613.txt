As an additional remedy I would look into making a worker's compensation claim. This should cover any bodily injury sustained by employees out of their employment duties whether the employer carries negligence or not. However, sexual assault works a little differently. For example, if it's manager on employee assault that is more of an EPL claim rather than work comp.
Caselaw suggests that patient assault is sometimes a risk of certain healthcare jobs that employees cannot sue their employers over (outside of a worker's comp claim). So the cops are not completely in left field here -- but the important fact here is that the employer knew the patient had a history of sexually assaulting employers and . . . apparently did nothing to protect employees.
Your employer has just as much responsibility to protect you from customers, clients, and patients as from coworkers.
If they know this patient requires more staff present, and isn't providing adequate protection, that's their failure, regardless of staffing shortages. That's what management is supposed to figure out. They are knowingly putting you in harm's way.
