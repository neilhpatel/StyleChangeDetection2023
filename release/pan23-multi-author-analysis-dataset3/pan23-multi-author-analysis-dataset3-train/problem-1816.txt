Unless you're called in to give a deposition or given some other court summons to appear, then you don't have to talk to anyone related to the case if you don't want to.
A deposition is a court ordered event, you'll be required to answer their questions there (though the prosecution should be there too if it does happen).
Your advice would make sense if it was the PROSECUTING attorney asking for the interview. Then she would want to be a cooperating witness.
With that said, you do not need to cooperate or testify in a court proceeding, but it works both ways. You can't make a statement on behalf of the victim (prosecution) but not answer questions about that statement from the defense.
If you are a witness or victim, the prosecuting attorney will be there to prevent the defense attorney from "browbeating" or abusing you.
There is no reason for the victim to be interviewed by the defense attorney before the court case. His whole reason for doing so will be to pick holes in her story (Which he will use in court)Your advice would also make sense if you were taking about her TESTIMONY in actual court. This defense attorney is asking for an interview before hand from a victim/ witness.
The defense has a right to get all the evidence the prosecution has against their client, before the trial even starts.
This is a victim/ witness and the request is coming from the DEFENSE attorney. Not on OPS side. Also, what's in it for op? The defense attorney wants to interview her to get info to exonerate their client.
