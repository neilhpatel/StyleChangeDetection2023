You could tell your landlord that was never listed in the lease nor was it ever agreed upon. As such, if she wants to have this new rule to the lease she can free you from the lease, pay you fees associated with your costs for finding a new lease.
You have the upper hand here. You agreed to a lease, and as long as it doesn't mention any stipulations, they all are paired within normal wear and tear.
Ignore her on the topic and if brought up remind her of the signed lease you both agreed to. There’s many other apartments in the world but you should resign yourself to not living in this one after the year is up.
So like this is your domicile while you pay rent. If it’s not in the lease it’s not pertinent to you.
If your lease has no stipulation, set it to whatever you want. And stop discussing/arguing about it. The more you try to justify things the longer this unnecessary quibble will go on. Just ignore. (Read the lease, but if it doesn't require anything like that, ignore her.).
True. And you probably shouldn't cave on everything. But you should also understand that she seems to be a very difficult landlord and she will almost certainly kick you out when your lease is up. You should just be planning for it.
