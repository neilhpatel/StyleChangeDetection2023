Thanks for this info. I believe using the word possible carcinogen as suggested is probably the best route. I have still not confirmed the exact substance as the HOA used fiberglass, plaster, epoxy, and sealing interchangeably.
I also need to directly confirm the substance as epoxy, fiberglass, plaster, and sealing have all been used interchangeably at HOA meetings.
Thank you for this information. I need to find a way to get an exact confirmation of which material was sanded. As the word fiber glass, epoxy, plaster, and pool sealing were all used interchangeably at HOA meetings.
I was actually thinking of the glass fibers, not the resin. I was mistaken, though - although the fibers have long been suspected of being carcinogenic in the same way that asbestos strands are, itâ€™s not proven.
Edit: I'm not saying you have to treat fiberglass like you would asbestos. Just saying that if there are regulations for dust particles from asbestos, there is probably something for fiberglass as well.
Just to be clear because it came up in someone else's comments: Asbestos and Fiberglass aren't necessarily the same thing. They are both bad for people, but not necessarily the same way.
