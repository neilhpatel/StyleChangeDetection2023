Also, was there any knowledge by the Japanese about the atomic bomb, or was the questioning about a "powerful new bomb" only based on deductions?
Though they were far from doing much progress, the Japanese had been working on a nuclear weapon themselves[1],[2],[3]. I'd take Cartwright's claim that he was specifically asked about the atomic bomb, which I took from his own book[4], with some caution but I don't find it impossible that the Japanese'd be questioning POWs about one, either. I don't find any reliable mention of Japanese intelligence having penetrated the Manhattan Project.
A report in the Central Intelligence Agencyâ€™s "Studies in Intelligence" claims that Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been included in a leaflet drop on August 1[1]. However and as you correctly point out, the leaflet featured in there did not specifically mention Hiroshima as a target.
The leaflets were not all-inclusive of all targets; I don't think they were understood as that by people in Hiroshima/Nagasaki. Later reports from people in Hiroshima was that they did expect to perhaps be bombed (conventionally) because they were aware that they had not yet been bombed .
The Japanese knew through the "LeMay leaflets" that US bombers dropped over several cities in early August that Hiroshima, among others, was to be bombed. These leaflets did not directly reference the atomic bomb, however.
