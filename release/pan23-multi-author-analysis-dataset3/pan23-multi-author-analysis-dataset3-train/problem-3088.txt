What other option does the Ukrainian government have? Russia is talking openly of genocide, and has been doing a good job getting started where they control territory.
What deal? Continue to kill and starve the people you currently control and consolidate your forces until you feel like you are in a position to invade again?
The invading force is raping, murdering, and torturing civilians, but no, just submit to them. That'll make it all better. How does that even register with you?
If a bully wants your lunch money today, you don't just give it to them to prevent today's beating because they'll come back for more tomorrow. They want one or two things now, but if Ukraine capitulates, then Russia will see how easy it is to get what they want, and just keep gobbling up what they want piece by piece.
But your argument is against use of deadly force. If you're argument is that you can use regular weapons to defend yourself, why do you support use of nukes to defend yourself? That seems wildly inconsistent.
