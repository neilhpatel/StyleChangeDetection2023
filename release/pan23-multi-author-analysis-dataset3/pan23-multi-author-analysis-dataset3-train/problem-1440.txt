If you intend to pursue this in any way then yes- you will need evidence of medical treatment for both you and your dog.
In most jurisdictions when you have your wound treated they will report the incident (it's mandatory) and that initiates contact with animal control who then contact the owners.
I volunteer at a animal shelter and our vet techs and veterinarians are mandatory reporters when a bite happens. They must contact animal control. Also our physicians must report bites to Animal Control so the animals are quarantined. The laws are dependent upon your locality and I am not in your state.
In our situation, the quarantine lasts 10 days. After ten days, if the animal is still alive, the quarantine is removed. If the animal dies (which hardly ever happens), its brain tissue is examined for rabies. If the animal has rabies, you must undergo treatment for rabies or the result would be fatal if you did not.
Rabies vaccine and the Immunoglobulin you would also need in this situation is not a benign medication, it can have serious side effects. It’s also not cheap, probably 8-10k in the ER. It’s not something you just do because why not. It’s a serious decision. Rabies PEP is not the right answer in vast vast majority of dog bites from domestic animals (in the USA).
Medically- yes, all wounds should be thoroughly irrigated and cleaned and you should be in prophylactic antibiotics if there’s a puncture. In terms of rabies, no, that’s incorrect, there’s extremely limited circumstances where this kind of event would lead to needing any kind of rabies intervention assuming this is in the usa.
There is no test for rabies, only quarantining long enough to see symptoms arise, which tends to be legally required (but depends on jurisdiction) any time an animal breaks skin on a human. Brain tissue can be tested for rabies, but the animal can't be alive for that to work.
