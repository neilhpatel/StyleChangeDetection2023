Short term disability is often the mechanism by which employers pay women for maternity leave, but it is obviously plan dependent, and the lenh will depend on what your doctor recommends, not what you want to take. If you had been there long enough to qualify, and your employer is covered, FMLA requires that they hold your job for up to 12 weeks, but you won't have worked there for a year, nor likely for the minimum number of hours. Other than FMLA, this isn't a legal problem but an employer relationship problem. You don't list your state, and US is far too generic to know for sure of any other programs or protections.
No. FMLA protections don't kick in until a calendar year of employment with at least 1250 hours worked. Her only hope is that her employer is reasonable, so I'd be upfront with them ASAP, and get it worked out.
And she's happy to get paid lol we're just trying to figure out how she can take the most possible time off without them giving the job away. Is this just wishful thinking?
I'm sorry, I added it in. Oregon. She hasn't started the new job yet, not signed any papers. Is it still too late?
