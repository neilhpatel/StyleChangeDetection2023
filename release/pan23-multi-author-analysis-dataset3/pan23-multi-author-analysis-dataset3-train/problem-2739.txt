European clubs weren't happy with the Winter WC because it is interfering with their European season. The ECA was flown to Qatar and after returning most clubs stopped their resistance for a winter world cup. Just a coincidence, like Rummenigge, head of the ECA during that time, getting caught with 2 Rolex at customs from returning to Munich from Qatar.
I don't think UEFA were really against the Qatar World Cup and is simply happy that FIFA gets all the flack, while everybody ignores their greed.
It's even further dispicable that they're threatening to do this because if they don't then them doing it hurts FIFA's relations with Qatar, which in turn hurts FIFA's bottom dollar and we all know FIFA can't let that happen.
It has always been a joke and FIFA has been riddled with corruption but only people are realising it now since it is being held in a middle eastern country.
The plurality of the blame for corruption in FIFA falls on officials who were originally from Europe and/or associated with UEFA. I do think UEFA is the only federation that has enough power for this to maybe work on its own, but Europe has been allowing this version of FIFA to exist since the 70s and its not like there weren't tons of previous corrupt acts. FIFA officials don't even care if you get publicly caught doing corrupt things, as long as you pay them they will continue to re-elect you. In most organizations if you get publicly outed then your done.
