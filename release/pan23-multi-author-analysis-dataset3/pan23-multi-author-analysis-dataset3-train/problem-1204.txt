Yes they can. Some Financial institutions have strict expectations for their employees and require regular credit checks. They can write up an employee for getting a collection On their credit. It doesnâ€™t surprise me that they would also do this for an overdraft. Also yes they can offer what ever type of direct deposit they want as long as they also offer paper checks.
Do a search for something like "can direct deposit be mandatory". There is a mix of Federal and State law controlling this. If I understand correctly, there is Federal law mandating that a company can require direct deposit if a) the employee is allowed to select the institution the deposit is sent to, or b) there is an alternative (ex: paper check) available.
NAL, but as others have commented, it appears Federal law only allows making direct deposit mandatory if the employee gets to select where the direct deposit goes, or allows an alternative such as paper check. Also as noted, there does not appear to be anything the prevents the CU from terminating people that decide not to use the Credit Union for direct deposit.
there is no legal/constitutional right to direct deposit however an employee desires, so if your fiancee wants direct deposit he will have to comply with the CU's terms.
however, if your fiancee and yourself want some privacy from the CU, you could always receive the paycheck via direct deposit to the CU account, leave a nominal amount (say, $100) in the CU account, and transfer the rest to a separate private account outside of the CU's purview for your personal banking needs.
