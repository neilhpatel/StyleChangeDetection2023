Many assisted living providers will let debility slide if a resident has someone able to help them. For example, someone deeper in dementia might get a pass if they're there with a spouse who has it together enough to help them through the day. However, assisted independent living places often do not have the resources or personnel to replace that level of attention.
Independent living facilities are the lowest level of care and they lack the resources to provide consistent care and observation to residents. Most residents are of a similar competency and status as you would find living alone in their own apartment or home. However, independent living provides them with the companionship, services, and, sometimes, early intervention that residents wouldn’t get by themselves in the larger community.
If your mom’s dementia prevents her from remembering to bathe or find her way to the dining room to eat, then she is not able to live independently. The facility may lack the resources to provide this to her and relying on the kindness of other facility residents to help your mother is not an appropriate care plan. You should look for placement for her in an assisted living facility because they will have the resources to ensure her safety and well-being.
You need a memory care assisted living facility, they have the proper staffing for assisting Residents like your mom.
