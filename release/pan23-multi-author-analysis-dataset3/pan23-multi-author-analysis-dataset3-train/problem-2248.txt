If you do, read it carefully to make sure that they don't put it any provisions you object to. Adding, or the ability to add, a cotennant might be in there somewhere.
It might also be that you're currently has some terms that the mortgage lender finds objectionable for some particularly financial reason. Like there might be clauses or penalties, there might be a renewal schedule, there might be limits on future renewals, and there could also be some mention of the previous mortgage holder in the existent lease .
I will add the caveat that in some jurisdictions and circumstances, a lease can state that it can be terminated upon sale of property, but in those cases it is almost always necessary the landlord or new landlord pays the tenant liquidated or actual damages if they do.
Another thing to keep in mind, if you did go along with that, I think there are different rules for evicting someone as the landlord if the tenant is living in a separate property they own vs if the landlord also lives in the same house. I wouldnâ€™t risk it just for that in case he tries to evict you after the sale and has an easier time doing it because you live together.
