Offering Joe Biden. A competent politician with (by the time of 2024) half a century of political knowledge. Knows how to broker deals provided the other side doesn't throw temper tantrums like children. Overall I'd give an 7/10. Personally he and the dems need to be more left.
Ideally I would like tk see Biden let an already established, more left leaning politician take the reigns but assuming he doesn't give up that post soon then I would thing he would run in 2024. He kinda has to to put up a decent fight. Thing is, putting Trump in there will drive a larger negative voter turn out. DeSantis running in 2024 would not have as much as a negative impact on the republican party and those who are hard core for Trump will eventually come to the polls for DeSantis for the sake of "making America great again".
Regardless of who ever is chosen, that person / campaign team will need to make Trump and DeSantis one in the same. Don't allow DeSantis to show any difference between him and Trump.
He doesn't have a cult following like Trump. He's still a relatively unknown typical politician in a $3,000 suit and will have less latitude than Trump.
