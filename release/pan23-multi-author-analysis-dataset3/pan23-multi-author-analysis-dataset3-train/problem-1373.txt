Z boy, I’m suggesting that your comment that Russia is doing well at any phase of this war is silliness. Retreating in a panic isn’t consolidating anything. HIMARS is consolidating their ammo out of existence, and recently hundreds of their troops in a single attack. The only ‘strategy’ Russia has had was taking out their defeats on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and that capacity is dropping too.
Then Russia was in a phase of being attacked by artillery with superior range, losing their ammunition depots and supply lines and pushed out of territory they couldn’t defend.
If the Russian army ran out of shells or barrels the war is effectively going to be over pretty soon and the best Russia can hope for is a long stale mate before collapsing.
Russia is preparing a large offensive for late winter/spring, and they're probably saving whatever ammo they have left for this moment. It's going to be a very tough time for both sides and Ukrainians are going to need every bit of help western countries can offer.
The thing with Ukraine is they have the whole western world suppling them. And if they said they really need more ammo or supplies urgently, they would get it.
Ukraine really needs to do more behind the lines activity and plant explosive devices in the big ammo dumps in Russia. Preferably simultaneously so that Russia can't respond after the first by tightening security on the others.
