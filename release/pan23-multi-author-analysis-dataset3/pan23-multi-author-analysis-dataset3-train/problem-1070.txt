The only way a $9 wage would be legal currently is if your were a tipped food service worker outside NYC and Westchester County. Is that the case for your current job?
You will be entitled to back pay either way. They both reduced pay without prior notice and paid less than minimum wage.
Title: My pay was decreased to 9 dollars an hour even though they just promoted me to assistant manager.
Is the wage decrease consistent in time with your job description change to assistant manager ? Were you promised a raise to go along with that job description change, and was that promise in writing ?
If you don't quit and go get a higher-paying job, then you have explicitly shown your supervisor the level of performance they can expect from you at the wage they are paying. Even if it were legal to pay you $9/hour, it's not a competitive wage, and certainly not for someone you've entrusted with additional responsibility.
You probably also don't fall under a "seasonal worker" exception, though I'm not familiar with New York's precise definition. Most seasonal worker exceptions apply to the long hours worked by seasonal hotel workers.
, and your concessionaire job probably falls under the base minimum wage law ($12.50/hr). As you noted a baseball stadium won't be "fast food" because they aren't a franchise with 30+ locations, and won't be a tipped foodservice worker because of the format of concessions.
