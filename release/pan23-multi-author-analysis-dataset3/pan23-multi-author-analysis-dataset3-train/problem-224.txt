A similar question has been asked before and answered by u/troymcclurehere about how the creation and gifting of Buddhist artworks was a way to generate merit, which may help you.

I'm going to have a crack at answering this question. It's late and there's a lot to discuss, so forgive my typos and organization. I've also been working on this for many hours, and it's already 2 in the morning, so I'm afraid I'll have to continue my response some hours after I've posted this initial one. I hope this is okay, it already partially answers and illuminates some of the things brought up in the question.
This, again, is only a partial answer. But I hope that it can at least complement the definitive response that a true expert will (hopefully) provide.
