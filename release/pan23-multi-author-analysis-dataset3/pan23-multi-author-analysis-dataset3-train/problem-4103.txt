I hate to give details but the videos are of me when I was from fifteen to sixteen giving him oral sex. He might have a few of sex in general, I’m not sure if he deleted those.
EDIT: I meant fifteen until eighteen. He also has screen recordings of when he would ask me to take off my clothes for him on FaceTime. And no, I did not know he was recording them. I was sixteen or seventeen at the time. I turned eighteen seven months ago.
Thank you. I am doing better now, a lot of the things he did to me I didn’t mention in the post because I’m not sure if there’s any evidence I could show the police. I will have to try to go through our texts (saved since January 2020?) and IG messages (I think Instagram saves everything) to see if there was a time I could prove he was blackmailing me. We spent a lot of time physically together or over FaceTime.
I don’t have any of the photos/videos saved. Although, it shows in our text messages that he has sent the photos/videos to me. Should I delete our texts? I’m worried that I won’t have any credible evidence. And yes, I will talk to a lawyer before taking any action.
You might want to talk to a lawyer first. You also created are in possession of child pornography. It's unlikely that you will be prosecuted, but it has happened. If you still have any of these images, you should delete them.
