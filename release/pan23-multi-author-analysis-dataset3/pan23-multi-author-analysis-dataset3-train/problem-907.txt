If you've ever refinanced through a private lender, that may be different (but may come with other hurdles, like being ineligible for any forgiveness programs).
You could give up the right to keep the loan responsibility separate by signing a repayment plan that includes you as a joint debtor but that's your choice to do that. You might want to be careful what you sign though.
Still anywhere you live, it's a good idea to give a potential creditor warning of a prenup that could affect their collection rights because they can not come back and say they didn't know and that would have affected their decision.
Even student loans taken during marriage can be assigned in prenuptial agreement if the lender has fair warning that a prenup exists that affects their future collection rights.
Unless your spouse co-signs a payment agreement, or otherwise agrees to take on the debt, then he will not be be legally responsible for it. Unless there has been a change I don't know about, Mississippi is not a community property state. As a general rule of common law, spouses are required to provide basic financial support for each other ... you not supposed to leave your husband in poverty while you live in up, or vice versa. Paying off a student loan is not part of that, but if he does pay it off and it leaves him broke, then the two of you will need a new financial understanding about who contributes what.
I always recommend reading and understanding every sentence, every word. And don't go with the other side's verbal explanations ... if you don't understand something, get a knowledgeable person on your side to go over the legal gobbledygook.
