Not defending how DeWine has handled the situation, and I'm sure it's worse than they are saying, but...
I said something similar, but your point is much better than mine. Sensational videos of oil slick creeks aren't the same as treated municipal water, but yeah the surrounding ecosystem is screwed.
People don't typically drink directly from creek water. The amount of processing that water plants use are very likely to clear any of these chemicals. At least, modern or Major population centers water treatment plants...perhaps this small community doesn't have that solid of a water infrastructure.
And assuming that they are being honest about that, it is an important point to make, so the people who have municipal tap water will drink that so bottled water will be available for those on well water who need it.
Yeah, I didn't want people to misread my comment as trying to say everything is fine, just noting that what they're drinking is not the water that actually is a problem.
Locals please note: they're pretending to drink the water for photo ops but if you look closely they're not actually drinking any and doing everything in their power to limit direct skin contact.
