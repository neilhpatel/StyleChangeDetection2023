Do you have title insurance? Give them a call, this dispute might be the kind of thing covered by them.
Do you have a mortgage? Give them a call too. It’s very unlikely they’ll let you return (give away) any part of the property that secures the mortgage.
Title company != title insurance company, probably. Title company has every motivation to fix this quietly and in a way that might mess up your mortgage. Be very very careful. I’d hire my own attorney if title insurance does not provide one to represent you.
You need a real estate attorney, not your agent and certainly not the title company. And time is on your side here. Based on what you've described, the other parcel is legally yours for the time being. It's someone else's problem as long as it remains that way so long as you participate in discussions with the title company and your lender to correct the issue.
Not so fast. You need to be concerned with what your lender thinks. Your lender approved a mortgage on a property (likely) based on the documents the title company prepared. If you allow the title company to retroactively fix their oopsie without having your lender notified through the process, you might be giving away half the collateral on your loan from the lender's perspective. That will definitely put you in default almost for sure.
You may be viewing this as a dispute between you and the prior owner, wherein somebody made a mistake which advantages you and disadvantages the prior owner, in that you now get a piece of property for "free" that the prior owner expected to retain. If the title company screwed up, that's on them because it's literally what they're paid to avoid. So no sweat, right?
