We live in California, and the warrant is listed as a ‘Search Warrant’ specifically, yet our address or any description of our house/apartment/place of living isn’t stated. As for being detained, we were all told to come out with our hands up and were escorted back inside, yet forbidden to leave the couch which we were all seated on. While we were seated, we were questioned as to who we were, our names and birth dates, and held there as they searched every room in the house. They withheld who/what exactly they were looking for when asked, the reason for their visit, and hesitated when we asked for a search warrant.
Were any of you detained or questioned beyond excluding you from being identified as your brother-in-law ? Once the house was empty of people, did the police do further searching for evidence, or take any evidence away ?
In general, police need either a search warrant or an arrest warrant to enter a home to make an arrest of a person suspected of a crime.
An arrest warrant will have the name of the suspect to be arrested, but does not have to describe the place that he is suspected to be. Police can search for that person specifically "wherever they reasonably believe he may be found". A house where the suspect lives with their extended family is, obviously, a common location for police to attempt to execute an arrest warrant.
Your description of being briefly detained and identified while officers secure the house and perform their search for a suspect is normal and customary.
That sounds closer to a "protective sweep", where police can briefly walk through a house after arresting a suspect found there, to be sure there are no persons inside who present a threat. They could only seize evidence of criminal activity that was in plain view.
