I did not request specific accommodations, rather I made several suggestions after describing the limitations of my disability. (Also, to be clear, I'm not necessarily looking for a reduction in my responsibilities, just clarity on what I am expected to take ownership of and what may be relevant to future performance reviews vs things I can assist with if time allows.).
b) Additional training and/or coaching for duties which fall outside of theProduction Manager essential duties.
This there maybe a better term to use than "Job Description" that could accomplish my need to have well defined responsibilities, goals, and tasks?
In addition, you seem really fixated on the idea of a job description. Unless you're on a true employment contract, not at-will (which the vast majority of US employees are), your job description can be changed at any point without warning. Your employer can even change your rate of pay without warning whenever they want, provided that they don't back-date a pay decrease. This is why elimination of marginal tasks or the ability to work without interruption is a hard ask, because if the role is built around being available to follow direction as-needed then your really looking to change the core of the role itself, whereas a similar role in a different department that's more rigid might be more reasonable.
