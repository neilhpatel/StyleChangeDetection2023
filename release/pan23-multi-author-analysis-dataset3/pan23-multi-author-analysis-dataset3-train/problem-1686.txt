Not a Trump supporter. I genuinely dislike the guy and disagree with him on a lot of things. However, just because I dislike him doesn't mean I think it's okay for people to lie/be wrong about him. There are plenty of things to dislike him for without having to mischaracterize him.
I'm simply clarifying that some people, including yourself, just want to hate Trump and don't care whether or not the reason you hate him is fiction.
You're misunderstanding what he said. He is recognizing Putin's political strategy of calling Ukraine "independent" and how Russia will "protect Ukraine". Politically speaking, Russia denying they're actually in a war is a smart move, but Trump is not saying it's a moral one.
Trump obviously has some sort of ties to Russia- seems like business or personal, but I doubt he’d ever support them militarily. I’d say the worst he’d do is not support Ukraine and downplay the war while staying out of it.
If anything the US would be 100% neutral and Russia would have steam rolled Ukraine who would have zero support.
