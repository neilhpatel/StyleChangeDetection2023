Religious schools have been teaching kids for generations that, according God, based on your body type, one type of person is inherently dominant and the other is submissive. It’s so much more harmful to people than simply accepting the fact that gender is a complicated emotional experience for some people when they are forced into those guidelines.
And if you want to talk facts, back up your assertion on societal effects on gender reassignment patients.
What is your method of verifying and validating that a fact is indeed a fact regardless of source? If someone you disdain tells you the sky is blue, someone you like says is green, are you the kind of person that believes who they like, or are you the person who looks up and determines the color of the sky on your own?
So, what is your preferred source of fact? If a fact is indeed a fact, it shouldn’t matter who is stating it.
The devil is always in the details. Waving your hands and speaking in vague generalities makes it seem like a simple black and white world, when it is anything but.
