It sounds like this is isn't the proper form for you. You say you moved to the US. That makes you a resident of the US. The form is for non-residents (hence the reference to a tax treaty with the country where you do reside in line 9). If you moved to the US, you'll have to file regular taxes in the US. If you are indeed a non-resident, than your country of residence still is your EU home country, which means that all tax regulations of that country still apply, and you'd have to state that country in both lines 3 and 9.
If you know that you're not a resident of the US, then why state the US as your permanent residence in line 3 in the first place? Do you still have to file taxes in your home country? Otherwise you won't need to file taxes anywhere, and I can't imagine that to be the case. Check out this website: Assuming that you pass the substantial presence test ( you have to file regular taxes in the US. Not the W-8BEN form. You may not be a (permanent) resident in the US, but you still qualify as a US person for tax purposes.
Even if you aren't a US person in general you still need to pay US taxes on US income. For example I need to pay US taxes on income from my US rental property, because it's income made in the US, but I do not need to pay US taxes when I do work in Canada for US clients.
I do need a tax consultant that's well versed in this, I just came to the US and the system is really complicated for us nonresident aliens.
The issue stems from the fact that, before leaving the EU, I completed a form in my country where I informed the country I will be living in the US temporarily, so that my residence in my European country is suspended/withdrawn during that time. As far as my country is concerned, I am not living in my country.
