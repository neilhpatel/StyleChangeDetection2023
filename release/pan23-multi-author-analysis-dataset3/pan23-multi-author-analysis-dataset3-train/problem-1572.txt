Thank you very much for the advice, but i think it would be to shameful for me to go with the second options because i need to get my mom involved. It was a mistake and I'll continue on as like it didn't happen. Sadly he can do this again to anyone.
She claims she is 21 (legal in my country of Croatia), with that in mind i had no problem of sending anything. I dont know the laws of child porn but am I really to blame for privately sharing my body with a person I trusted to be what she said.
Well I agree that it isn't the best defence, but the "girl" claims she is 21, which is legal in my country (maximum 4 year difference) so my ignorance to the catfish is my defence to sending the "child pornography".
You understand that you created and distributed child pornography and, “but I thought I was sending it to a woman” isn’t likely to be a great defense to that crime, correct?
If you produced child pornography (and from your post it appears you did) you will want to speak to an attorney before going to the police. Catfishing itself is not inherently illegal most places (where are you?) but producing child pornography is, and distributing child pornography is (both of which you did) and then soliciting and possessing child pornography also is (what he did).
What do you mean "deal with it yourself"? That sounds an awful lot like you are planning on committing a crime. If so, do not do that.
