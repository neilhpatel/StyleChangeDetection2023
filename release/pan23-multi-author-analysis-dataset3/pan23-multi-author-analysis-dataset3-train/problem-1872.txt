This is a big step, showing the US is becoming more supportive of the opposition in Myanmar. I just hope it translates to tangible support eventually. The faster the junta is removed from power, the faster things can start to get better.
It’s more complicated than that. The genocide was carried out by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar’s military, AKA the ones who have now seized total control of the government. Even under the previous government there was no civilian control of the military in Myanmar; the military had written the Constitution to ensure that.
Also, what's your point? I was talking about the civilian opposition to the military, not the local Rakhine population in Northwest Myanmar.
Yeah but Myanmar's government was split into two factions, this civilian faction, and the military faction. The civilian faction had no control over the military as the military essentially allowed them to have power in 2011 with the condition the military retained full veto power. The military is responsible for the genocide and there really isn't much anyone could have done to stop it, not with the power over violence and information the military has.
Y'all are cheering on the very same military that's been committing genocide there for decades and it's because people believe the citizens who are mostly only exposed to propoganda and have no real power are getting justice. How is it justice when a military who's been committing atrocities and genocide just gets to keep power while the west looks on and says "oh well thats what you get" to the victims.
