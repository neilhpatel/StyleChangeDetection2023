If this is the case then you need to figure out where your $800 payment went (maybe it was credited to a different apartment?) and also show the apartment managers the evidence that you made an honest and timely effort to pay the full rent amount. If they refuse to listen and continue pushing for eviction you should promptly get a lawyer.
There's a possibility that the apartment's payment processing system can't split the rent and they never told you. For example, the website for my apartment complex is incapable of splitting payments, so my roommate gives his portion of the rent to me ahead of time and I then pay the full amount from my account in a single transaction.
None of this is your fault by the way -- it sounds like the apartment management isn't good at communicating with you at all. Their knee-jerk reaction to terminate your lease and evict you is also concerning, but maybe it's a big misunderstanding caused by their own ineptness.
If they're trying to evict you for something else, such as performing the charge back, or some lease violation, they might be able to do that prior to Mar 31st.
In the meantime, make sure you have a copy of your lease with you in case they try any illegal evictions. If they try to lock you out, you can show a locksmith your lease and be let in. Also read up on if AZ has any moratorium on eviction right now.
