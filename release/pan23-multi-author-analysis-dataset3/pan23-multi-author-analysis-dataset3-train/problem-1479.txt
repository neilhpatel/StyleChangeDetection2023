Who cares about the Stingers anyway? They're 50 years old and were heading for decommissioning anyway. We're saving money by handing them over to Ukraine.
It’s not just saving money. Who are we going to theoretically use anti air and anti tank weapons on? Russia. Well, that’s less of an issue if Ukraine decimates Russia’s planes and tanks.
Ukraine already has experience with anti-tank TOW missiles and TOW missiles on Bradleys destroyed more Soviet-made Iraqi tanks than did Abrams tanks did.
Exactly. I 100% agree. I very strongly support sending ATACMS to Ukraine, this is literally the perfect war for them. In most wars, the USAF would have bombed all the high-value targets long before the Army gets to them. ATACMS has a "measly" 190 mile range, while the USAF was sending B-52 bombers from the continental US to bomb targets in Iraq and then flying them back home. Even Tomahawk cruise missiles have a 1,000+ mile range. The Ukrainians already know how to use HIMARS and M270 GMLRS too. If we don't send them, then it was a waste of money making them if they never get used and just collect dust in a warehouse somewhere, plus it would be supporting the freedom of an underdog nation. Lastly, ATACMS is going to be retired and replaced by Precision Strike Missile anyway. Better they be used to support a worthy cause than destroyed because the whole system simply got retired.
Obviously it's an infantry carrier so it can carry troops/supplies, plus I'm sure Ukrainian infantry would appreciate armored mobility and protection from artillery. There are also many variants including air defense.
See I understand that when it comes to the more sophisticated weaponry like fighter jets. But they seemed to pick up and learn the artillery and the anti tank weapons like the javelins and TOW missiles.
25mm cannon is effective against everything else. Armor piercing rounds have been reported to have destroyed T-72 tanks.
