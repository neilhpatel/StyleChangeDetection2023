Yeah, that’s what I’m super confused about. And since it’s not from a lawyer and doesn’t ask me to take any action at all, I wanted to know if I could just ignore it.
Again, even if it was from a lawyer you could ignore it, it has no special legal power. It’s just a letter telling you to knock off whatever you are doing. If you don’t knock it off you will not be able to plead ignorance of the issue to a court.
Bottom line is the advice doesn’t change, being from a lawyer doesn’t make it any more enforceable than from a non lawyer. Unless it’s from a court it’s just a letter saying knock it the fuck off or I’ll take legal action.
A cease and desist letter has no special legal power when written by an attorney. You have been told to stop doing something. We don’t know what that something is, but if you continue it is possible you will be sued or perhaps face harassment charges, it will not be a defense that you didn’t know you needed to stop because the letter you got was not from an attorney.
