Manchin's permits bill would've been a massive boon for green energy by allowing for faster building of transmission lines. The issue with "the wind is always blowing somewhere" is that you need to transfer that energy to where the wind is not blowing, and the current US energy infrastructure isn't up to spec. Manchin's permits bill would allow building the necessary backbone to build green energy facilities with confidence.
Ahh ok so you'd rather a completely different political system. Well unfortunately you have to live in this reality where a majority in the senate is meaningful and Manchin gives Dems that majority.
It may not sound like much but a 51/49 Senate is a world away from a 50/50 one in terms of what the controlling party can accomplish.
The agreement was a very painful process as well... it was a while after the inauguration before he was able to take over from McConnell.
Do keep though that the position of majority leader for Schumer is different to when McConnell held it at present.
The current situation is a power sharing agreement with committees split evenly and that makes hearings, subpoenas etc very hard with the outright opposition the Republican senators present... they actively want to avoid unpretentious things being discussed.
