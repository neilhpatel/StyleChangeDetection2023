if im 20 hours into some major travel and get delayed because of people like this id be fucking pissed.
There are tons of good ways to protest climate change, and it sure as hell needs to be done more than it is, but inconveniencing regular people is completely counter productive.
I’ve seen a lot of these actions lately… I do agree we need to think about the climate change but as these actions are never targeting the politicians in charge, what have they actually accomplished?
The point is to pressure people in power, not trying to convince random people to maybe consider climat change as their fifth most important issue coming voting time.
Lol that's even worse, you're giving people in power the perfect reason to persuade people to vote against climate activists. "Look what they done to you, let me introduce regulation banning them from ever fucking your day up again. It gonna include some benefits for me too, btw, but you also benefit from this. Win-win!".
Sure, the most impact, but is it actually the kind of impact they want? Looking back at your own life, has you ever gone "hey since you fuck up my day I decide to support you from now on and please continue doing it!"?
