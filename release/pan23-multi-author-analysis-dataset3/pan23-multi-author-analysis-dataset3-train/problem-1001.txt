Except part of their charta is the ban on war in reference to ancient Greeks where during the Olympics all hostilities were put on pause. Germany was not actively engaging in warfare in that time.
Every country actively engaging in military hostilities during the Olympics should by default be qualified. The Olympics own rules say so.
You were the one who referenced what the Olympics used to mean, not me. I referenced the fact that Nazi Germany held the Olympics. An Olympics that saw a widespread boycott. Nazi Germany made the Olympics Aryan only... and allowed just a hand full of black athletes to show up. The Olympics don't have some glorious history that used to be great.
So the Nazi Olympics is the glory days of the past you were referring to when you were holding the Olympics to a high esteem in the past? I'm really confused what you're even doing here pointing out small things that don't ultimately matter... for your own argument.
You were describing some glorious past with the Olympics. Are you saying the Nazi Olympics are the glorious past? Or are you perhaps willing to give up on the notion that anything was ever glorious about the Olympics?
