But Russia has less and less time. Their real hope now is to annex Belarus and start another northern campaign but such a move would force all of Russia's "allies" to rethink what they're doing; especially China and Kazakhstan. Plus there's a very good chance that Belarus would resist or simply not fight Ukraine.
I don't have to list the hundreds of advantages that Ukraine has that Chechnya didn't but the main one is time. The West will never stop supplying Ukraine because they know that a defeat in Ukraine will be a defeat for them and a strategic victory of a dangerous country.
Russia's strategy is to destroy Ukraine just like how they destroyed Chechnya and then installed crazy puppets to run the show.
Yeah idk Russia might wipe them off the map with nukes if Ukraine does that. With NATO support Ukraine is holding up well, but still needs to play it safe against a bigger enemy like Russia.
You mean the Ukrainian army that isn't allowed to strike targets in Russia with NATO supplied weapons according to NATO?
You do realize that this is the same army, which does not receive long-range weapons or anything which could be explicitly used for miltary offensive so that it doesn't attack Russia?
