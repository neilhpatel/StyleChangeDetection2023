If by solvent you mean ‘will run out of money in about 10 years then only pay 75% of promised benefits’ then I agree with you. You’ve heard that line for decades because the last time we’ve done anything to change the trajectory of SS was the 80s. We can solve it by either increasing taxes or reducing benefits through smaller checks and a higher retirement age.
Bullshit like… checks notes adjusting retirement age to compensate for the fact that people were living 5 years shorter back when these laws were first made?
2) don't raise the retirement age and the pension program runs low on funds, meaning no retirement for the younger generation.
Another option that isn't being mentioned is that a public retirement system doesn't have to be internally balanced. We could very well have a retirement fund in deficit with that deficit being financed by another source.
Even if there's an absolute necessity to balance the retirement fund, the reform currently debated doesn't make any sense in who it targets. It doesn't change how long you need to work for a full pension (43 years), nor the age at which a full pension is automatically granted (67), nor the amount of a full pension (50% of your average salary over your 25 best years, capped at 1833€/month). It only changes the age at which you can retire from 62 to 65.
And another thing is that our retirement system isn't always going to be in deficit. Sure, the next 15 years will be but after the boomer deaths it's on track to be in benefit. So why not eat the loss on those 15 years then let it right itself up?
