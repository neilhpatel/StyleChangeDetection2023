"Cato calls Lucius Murena a dancer....you ought not \[O, Cato\] rashly to call a consul of the Roman people a dancer...For no man, one may almost say, ever dances when sober, unless perhaps he be a madman, nor in solitude, nor in a moderate and sober party; dancing is the last companion of prolonged feasting, of luxurious situation, and of many refinements." (Pro Murena 1.6).
All the pantomime dances I know of were mythological - but the choice of myths was probably to some degree topical (i.e., after the death of a hated emperor, a dancer might perform the death of some mythological tyrant). Although the best pantomimes were in high demand among the Roman elite, they were, like other stage performers, regarded as socially inferior.
Since dancing was seen as improper or something for the lower classes, did the pantomimers and professional dancers have a reduced social status?
Even thought dancing wasn’t seen as very respectable outside of these contexts for the elite didn’t it still occur sometimes? I recall Sempronia (wife if Decimus Junius Brutus) for example being noted for it.
