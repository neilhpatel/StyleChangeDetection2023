Which is SUPER weird because people are very protective of those sorts of offices. My boss retired and while I am performing the duties and functions of the office, they still wont give me the office, it just sits empty because "that would be unfair to the other GS employees that dont get an office". Anyway... weird that nobody stopped him from moving into an office he's not entitled to having.
I'd expect that more than a few of the other 434 members of the House to be like "uh you aren't the speaker yet so maybe slow your roll a lil bit" but I dont know how inter-office politics work.
Given that it’s been so long since this office was in contention, I’m guessing the convention has long been that the Speaker-in-Waiting moves into that office before the formal election. It’d be very interesting to know.
Who is the ‘they’ or ‘them’ that would enforce it? The GOP House doesn’t seem to have any sort of leadership. Even if they elect someone of their own party as speaker, that person is going to end up with much less power than Pelosi was able to exert.
Yeah, he might…but he’ll be the weakest Speaker in the history of the country….and with that 5 vote no confidence threshold he may have the shortest tenure too.
