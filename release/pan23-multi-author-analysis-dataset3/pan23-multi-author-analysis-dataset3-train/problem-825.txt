Disney needs to call him out on it. Make a fake trailer for Disney's newest film, "Mandela Obama: The Black Socialist Transgender Immigrant Unicorn Who Says 'No' to Guns and Teaches Children Critical Race Theory.".
It's not just that. As long as Disney is in Florida they have standing to completely obliterate his campaign and donor infrastructure too, get cease-and-desists, injunctions and stays ordered to stop him from competing in 2024 effectively.
A war between Fox News and Disney is not one Fox News can win either, and that's before Disney straight up starts pumping out anti-Republican propaganda to younger generations.
Disney should just play chicken with DeSantis on this, and I don't mean going on a media blitz with their own fiction to consistently paint MAGA Republicans as evil, although that should happen and younger generations starting with the middle aged millennials will eat it right up in spite of being propaganda.
So for Republicans to come out and pretend that their party -- led by a pussygrabber & populated by terrorists -- is offended by Disney's content just seems so outlandishly absurd that I don't see this resonating with the average voter.
