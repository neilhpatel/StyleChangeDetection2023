The first encounter between a Kaifeng Jew and a Western Christian was actually not in Kaifeng, but in Beijing, in 1605. A Jew (though he called himself instead an "Israelite") named Ai Tian, a shidafu (scholarly official) from Kaifeng who came to Beijing in the hopes of passing exams necessary for a better government position, had read a popular Chinese book called Things I Have Heard, in which the author described the two Western men who had recently taken up residence in Beijing in terms of wonder. They were described as having banished demons from a house and owning a picture of the "Lord of Heaven" (from the description, obviously meant to be the Pope) in which his eyes follow you around the room, among other things. They were also described as monotheists who were insistent that they were not Muslims, and Ai, never having heard of Christians, came to the obvious conclusion- they must be Jews.
(I also don't seem to have been clear enough above, now that I look back- the rabbi offered Ricci the post not immediately but rather after his eventual passing. Since the rabbi wasn't dead yet, even if Ricci had wanted to take the post up he couldn't have done it immediately. In fact, seeing as Ricci only lived another five years after this encounter, it's entirely possible that the rabbi outlived him.).
This is what I was asking about. Why didnâ€™t the Jews like the Muslims? Was it theological differences or was it because of anti-semitism from the Muslims? Why were relations between them sour?
