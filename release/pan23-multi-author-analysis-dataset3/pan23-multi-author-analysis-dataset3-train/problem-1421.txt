The rest of the Muslims world is already too busy discriminating, persecuting, oppressing, imprisoning, torturing, waging war and killing fellow Muslims within their own countries, and continuously have been for the past 1400 years and never ceased. I honestly don’t see why’d they genuinely give a shit about the wellbeing of fellow Muslims half a world away in another nation that’s isn’t theirs.
If it’s not an obvious indicator already, the Human Rights ratings of almost every Muslim majority nation in Earth already ranges between extremely questionable to outright non-existent.
Calling out China or Muslim oppression would be equal to the pot calling the kettle back, which is why most Islamic countries do their best to remain silent and not say shit.
The elephant in the room is the rest of the Muslim world, the Arab World isn't just silent on China’s crackdown on Uighurs. it's complicit.
Saudi Arabia, a key ally of China, has shown support for Beijing’s crackdown on Uighur culture in the past. During a 2019 visit to China, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler, told his hosts: “We respect and support China’s rights to take counter-terrorism and de-extremism measures to safeguard national security.” Saudi Arabia further endorsed China’s Xinjiang policies in two joint letters to the United Nations in 2019 and 2020.
The journey to the Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina for the Muslim faithful has become a snare to catch Uighurs from all over the world. Osman Ahmad Tohti, a Uighur with legal residency in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, was detained in 2018 while conducting the hajj and forcibly repatriated to China. He has not been heard from since.
