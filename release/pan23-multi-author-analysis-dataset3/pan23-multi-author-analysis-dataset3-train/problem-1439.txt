Yes you are doing a pelvic exam. I agree w above. It’s uncomfortable especially the first kid. Why don’t you ask if he stripped the membrane? At 3 cm dilated that’s almost active labor which starts at 4cm Which why the he stated mother may deliver soon. Bleeding can be from a mucus plug. Very common. Maybe your jumping the gun on ur conclusion. Ur medical advice is coming for your mother in law.
I am a practicing OBGYN so let me correct this lawyer/nurse. Stripping of membranes is NOT a billable procedure. We bill with CPT codes, and there is no such CPT for stripping of membranes since it is not a procedure. You will not see a bill for stripping membranes. Also, pregnancy reimbursement is bundled, meaning we get a set rate after the patient delivers, and that amount is the same whether we see you 1 time or 50 times. Whether we strip your membranes or not, we get paid the same and it is after delivery.
In terms of informed consent, stripping of membranes is not a procedure. It is equivalent to a pelvic exam/cervical check. I can't comment on the battery argument... I suppose a lawyer could TRY to make that case.
As somebody who does this everyday, the idea is to help start labor. Your wife is term, and most women are uncomfortable when dilated 3-4cm so he was only trying to help. To be honest, it maybe works 50% of the time. It does NOT increase your risk of a csection. That makes absolutely no sense. There is always a risk of csection, whether your membranes were stripped or not.
It sounds like you just don't have the best patient/physician relationship with this doctor and that may be reason enough to try to find someone else. May be tough this late in the game though. Best of luck!
As I previously mentioned, I can't comment on the battery part. But I can correct the false notion that OBGYNs bill for sweeping membranes as mentioned in the original post I was referencing.
