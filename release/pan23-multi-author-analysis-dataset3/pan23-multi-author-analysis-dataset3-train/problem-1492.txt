But, it is worth mentioning even at the peak of greatest difference (which was about 1920), British and American English were far closer and more mutually intelligible than Ukrainian and Russian have been since they were first differentiated.
Well, the thing is that Russia's first justification for this war was "Russian speaking Ukrainians" who would be inconvenienced, when Ukraine passed legislation to make Ukrainian the official language of Ukraine. It's not like they weren't going to be a bilingual nation, it's that they'd expect schoolkids to learn Ukrainian first, and Russian as a second language.
Maybe round up all the Belarussians fighting for Ukraine, form a unit, and send them back to their own country to liberate it, and purge it of Russian troops.
Any weapon that the West gave Ukraine that could hit the Baltic fleet would also be able to hit Moscow, St. Petersburg, etc., which the West is very reluctant to do for several reasons (good and bad).
Give Ukraine the weapons they need and if they hit military targets in Russia so be it. Absolute Defeat of Russia is needed here. That should be the base minimum here.
Russia chooses not to end their party make them pay and pay and pay until either Putin is dead/removed or the brainwashed masses who support this war are marched to the front lines to become fertilizer themselves. Maybe and maybe then they will understand that Russia will NEVER win in Ukraine.
