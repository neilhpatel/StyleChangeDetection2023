>The House of Representatives on Thursday approved legislation that would require  to conduct a binding referendum on whether residents wish to become the 51st American state, an independent country, or remain sovereign but associated with the United States.
From article: "Congress approved legislation that would Require Puerto Rico to conduct a binding referendum on whether residents wish to become the 51st American state".
The previous referendums have shown that 53% of Puerto Rican’s want statehood out of half of registered voters. It’s not as clear cut as many people think.
It’s not really as clear cut as people want to make it out to seem. This bill also has to get through the Senate, which is not guaranteed.
1967, 1993, 1998, status quo upheld. 2012 54% vote in favor of changing the status of PR, 61.3% in favor of statehood, so 33.1% of PR voters want statehood. In 2017, 22.3% of PR voters want statehood. In 2020, 28.7% of PR voters want statehood. Many of these referendums are tied together with political interests, naturally, and that has led to boycotting the vote. There are also questions as to the way the votes were handled.
Polls, is not the same as a vote. (Used the 2020 one as reference). Polls in PR (and polls in general aren't standardized) that's why they don't give you a full demographic. But what do I know, I just live here.
