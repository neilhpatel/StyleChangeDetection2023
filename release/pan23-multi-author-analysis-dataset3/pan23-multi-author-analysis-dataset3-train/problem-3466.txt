/u/Snapshot52's framing here really helps me understand the subject better by framing these events as many genocides, taking place across hundreds of years, albeit still part of a broader "American Indian Genocide".
When most historians or genocide scholars invoke 'genocide' in regards to that of Indigenous groups, it is in the sense of the latter: something that took place over a long period of time, undergoing many different phases, encompassing many different actions, etc, and in some cases something that is still ongoing.
Also, it tends to have a very narrow view of 'intent' which deniers like to invoke a lot - imagine if you could not infer a murderer's intent from the obvious consequences of their actions or the implications of their plans or rhetoric, but rather only if they made a declaration beforehand saying directly 'I am killing this person because I hate them and want them to die.' Similar arguments to that are often made by genocide deniers and they are pretty self-evidently stupid, despite them being enabled by the common parlance understanding of the term.
Thus the majority of academics tend to define genocide more broadly than the idea that laymen are used to.
Thanks for the link, this is very helpful information and really further explains why this is a genocide.
As you said, there is the wider genocide that took place, and is still occurring. However, it became common practice in history that when talking about native Americans, you usually are more specific than all of them at once type of statements. There is also the fact that genocide is complicated and especially so in the long, drawn-out case of the Indigenous American peoples. What contributes and doesn't, what should be considered, who is a part of the group, how did adjacent groups experience this event, etc.
