The first sentence of your comment makes no sense since a lot of people don’t want to procreate at all so that purpose is out the door for the majority.
If foreigners want to intervene, they should intervene in Palestine, China, and every else where the government is destroying its citizens instead of being hypocrites. I just came back from the Middle East and the situation in Iran getting out of hand would be a catastrophe. Where are the population going to flee? Iraq? Afghanistan? Russia lol? They are pretty much literally surrounded by war torn countries all around from all angles with no where to go.
An all out war, right now, would be hard to imagine, at least without some kind of foreign intervention. A lot of unarmed civilians against 120k Pasdaran? That's a massacre, not a war.
Protesters are always a fraction of the population in every case, especially when the police starts shooting at them, but most Iranians seems quite angry at the government's reactions.
I’m not super familiar with Iranian politics and culture, but if they’re being sentenced to death for protesting, why are they not asking for foreign arms and just straight up revolting?
If you wanted to know my opinion, I think that foreign countries should put economic and political pressure (not an armed intervention, god not again) on the Iranian government to stop them from massacring people in the street- because so far I, and many analysts, see only a few ways the protests might end:
