Just kidding. The Germans did not employ a shotgun during World War II, and neither did most countries at anything beyond a small scale. Shotguns were used during World War I and have come back into fashion recently because of the high firepower they can deliver in close-quarter combat.

Less lethal rounds can also be fired by the 40mm grenade launcher, of course, but the shotgun is a useful adjunct.
One gets plenty enough firepower from an assault rifle, and the latter has the advantage of being even more accurate than a shotgun. There's a reason why SWAT teams tend to use the rifle and not a shotgun for most of their chaps.
Otherwise, the shotgun with standard (non-breaching or non-less-lethal) rounds are used as a secondary weapon in case a primary goes down.
The two main reasons we are given shotguns are for door breaching, and firing less-than-lethal rounds. You will note that when a US infantry squad goes into a building, the guy with the shotgun goes in last, because he's the chap who just blew the door off the hinges. Indeed, we now use special breaching ammunition, and recently shotguns have been modified even more to better suit the breaching role. Indeed, since the shotgun is considered the secondary weapon, the latest shotguns such as the M500 MEK are specifically designed to be used for a door breach (with sawtooth muzzle to provide grip and standoff) and a short stock so that it doesn't get in the way when the breacher follows everyone else in with his rifle.
