No you had it right. I do spend the entire day at this 2nd location. I was just saying that in the cases where I have to go to another branch when I'm already at work that info t have to clock out. I just don't understand why this same logic doesn't apply if I report directly to another location. I'm still driving extra time to help out the other branch/company. What makes these two situations different?
I also don't get paid mileage to drive to work, but they do pay me to drive to this Saturday location, so do they even gave to pay me mileage or are they being nice in doing so?
I've worked at some places where I got mileage any time I had to leave the main office plus the travel time, and others, I got just the mileage. It depended on what was in my contract.
If you've been with your company a while and you're a good worker, you should try to negotiate this into a written agreement. Whether that means getting mileage for Saturday, or mileage + travel time, or heck, maybe you don't want to work Saturdays at all. If this is a place you want to stay at and work at long-term, you can't be afraid to negotiate.
