Pre-existing infrastructure, supply lines and dedicated clerical staff in the area (in the event that a full scale conflict begins, it will be easier for a British unit to work out of a British FOB).
Rapid response to local conflict with a pre-existing FOB(N.Korea/S.Korea- CN/TW, etc.) Or in Britain's case, if Russia were to push through into Europe, Japanese troops would be nearby.
When Russia invaded Ukraine, most of the troops that the UK send to reinforce NATO positions came from Germany as that's where most heavy equipment is stored at.
It initially looked as though Russia threw a spanner in the works of that plan by invading Ukraine, which is why China was so supportive of Russia in the early days of the invasion. It backfired, however, due to how woefully unprepared Russia was for Ukrainian resistance/Western support. The West now has carte blanche to effectively create a fortress in Ukraine, completely and utterly neutering the Russian threat to Europe. If the West keeps throwing weapons at Ukraine, they'll do all the dirty work in Europe allowing the West to focus on Asia. That's why China is now furious with Russia for being so utterly incompetent in warfare.
