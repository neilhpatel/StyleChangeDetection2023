I’m not in the same state, and I can’t be there to collect mail or any service. I do know it’s current because she’s sent a cropped screenshot with dates and payments, but I truly don’t know when she will decide to stop and I don’t have the mortgage company’s information to contact them directly. I’m also very concerned about her destroying the property as there is no legal agreement for her to live there between us.
I’ve called several companies that were part of the buyout from the original company, but so far no luck.
It was just me and dad on there. We got it before I graduated HS and way before they were married. I wasn’t old enough to be on the mortgage, just the deed. This was done to avoid problems with probate in the future in the event this happened.
This is my main concern here too, which is why I tried to make sure I was clear the house isn’t part of probate I own it-she’s paying it, but only because she’s keeping information from me that can’t be found on title or title searches. Even if it means she can claim it from paying taxes via escrow.
It's usually possible to see who has been paying property taxes. Google "[county] property taxes" and see if the county website has their records online.
