Incidentally, while we're on the subject, in A Bridge Too Far (1977) actor Ryan O'Neal (b. 1941) was actually a year younger than Lt. Gen. James Gavin, commanding the 82 Airborne, was during Operation Market-Garden. Gavin was promoted Maj. Gen. immediately after the operation, and was, at the time, the youngest Maj. Gen. in US army history at age 37. O'Neal looks positively baby-faced compared to some of the actors in the cast, but so did Gavin!
2/505 PIR, an 82 Airborne outfit, was assigned Ste-Mère-Eglise and commanded by Vandorvoort, not the 101 Airborne outfit 2/506 PIR.
As a minor aside, the commander of 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment - the guys who dropped on Ste-Mère-Eglise - was 27-year-old Benjamin Vandervoort. He was one of the youngest battalion commanders in the US Army, IIRC.
Incidentally, we probably do know the age of the youngest US Army colonel at the start of the war, who was 34 after he was double promoted from major. Unfortunately, this was the rather odious Karl Bendetsen, who then administered most of the Japanese internment program - and appropriately enough given how the General Staff had largely opposed many of the policies, never received another promotion afterwards.
We do know the age and identity of the oldest participant in the landings, who was a year older at 56. That was Ted Roosevelt, Jr. - the son of Teddy - a brigadier general who really shouldn't have been participating as his health was already suspect (he was walking with a cane, had concealed heart problems from superiors, and was dead of a heart attack a month later) but whose leadership at Omaha Utah itself was nothing short of remarkable. But that should give you an idea of officer age distribution versus rank; there were indeed 50 somethings and even older fighting, but in 1944 they were generally senior officers like Eisenhower (54), Patton (59), and Bradley (61).
They were definitely a significant minority, owing partially to Army personnel policies regarding older enlisted men, although it did happen; men in their 40s and 50s near the front were more likely to be officers such as majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels.
Nonetheless, many men well over the age of 30 (such as my 2x great uncle), and to a lesser extent even into their 40s, found themselves in frontline combat, for better or for worse. , born on 12 May 1900, served during World War I, enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard after the war in 1924, accumulated twenty additional years of military service and by 1944, was the first sergeant of Company I, 134th Infantry Regiment, being seriously wounded in action on 15 July 1944:
, of the Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 134th Infantry, was 44 when he was killed in action on 8 August 1944. , born on 10 August 1896, was a World War I veteran and possibly the oldest enlisted man in the entire 134th Infantry by 1944, enlisting in the Nebraska National Guard in 1940 at age 43 and serving in the Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion and the Service Company.
