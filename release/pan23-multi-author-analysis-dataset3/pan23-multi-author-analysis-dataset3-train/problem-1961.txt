the biggest difference is the 16yr old would vote based on what they think is going on in the world and what is important to them. The 89 yr old votes on based how they think they world should be, how the world used to be, how the world was during their best years which might have been 50 years ago.
A very very large portion of adults who vote have absolutely no idea how their governments work, how economies work, how their vote might affect their situation.
I'd bet in 9 out of 10 cases a country run only be 16-20yr olds voting would work much better than a country with only 65+yr olds voting.
Plus 16 year olds are much more likely to be politically aware if they can vote, otherwise they are just not gonna care.
My two cents is that while most 16-year-olds might not be the most politically aware. I think increasing the number of young voices is essential. They have to live with the decisions that all the oldies vote on.
Looking at how elders vote you could say the same thing about those people. Especially as many of them vote for "everything stays as it is" but don't have to deal with the consequences of global warming etc.
