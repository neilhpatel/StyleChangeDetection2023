Taxes can, without any issue at all, be collected up to three year into the past. You need to talk to a tax professional as if you have not been paying any taxes at all during this time you will likely have a substantial tax burden of both income and payroll taxes.
It’d be smart to talk to a tax professional and make sure you’ve paid what you owe come filing season, but you are correct they will be much more interested in the employer.
