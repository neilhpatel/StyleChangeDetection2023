This question cannot be answered without your location. You should carefully photograph the condition of the apartment. No, there won't really be a way to recover short of suing them or perhaps arbitration. And to sue them successfully you'd need to be able to demonstrate your damages. If you want to show that you could not move in, you'll have to show that it was legitimately uninhabitable. Otherwise, it may have been appropriate to clean or hire a cleaning service and them sue for what it cost you to do so.
Some states have laws that require "broom swept" level of cleaning minimum between tenants. I could not immediately find such a law for Missouri, but I only looked briefly. If such a law exists, it would stipulate what happens.
However, that is different than a habitability or livability issue. Habitability only covers the bare bones essentials such as heating, running water, hot water, electricity, structural integrity, sufficient windows and doors for escape in the case of a fire, etc. It generally does not account for dirt, spills, mold (other than true black mold), uninstalled blinds, missing drawers, etc. As such, clauses in the lease and laws that refer to habitability, are likely not relevant.
Other than maybe the weather stripping on the door, and maybe the window screen, nothing OP described is a habitability issue (and even those ones I have my doubts about).
Also, I will take the opportunity to point out that your landlord has promised to take significant steps to correct the situation, and it has been a mere 1.5 days, on a weekend, since the situation was reported. Even for actual habitability complaints, landlords are afforded the opportunity to perform repairs.
