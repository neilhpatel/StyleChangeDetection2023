IAAL but not yours. I’d look into whether your state has a “bona fide” or “innocent party”purchase law. It would be state specific but basically such laws allow a third party who buys personal property without knowing about the disputed ownership to obtain clear title. It doesn’t work with titled assets like vehicles but tractors it likely would. In that instance the true owner would typically have to go after the seller (ie your neighbor would have to sue the son) for damages.
That all being said, I assume you plan to live next to this guy for foreseeable future so IMO the neighborly thing to do would probably be to try and get money back from son and buy a new tractor.
Personally, If the tractor is the neighbors, and the son counters with anything north of $2000, I'd probably take it for the simplicity.
Failing that, court really isn't the big hurdle here. $3000 means you're talking about small claims court. Him being across the country doesn't hurt you, the sale took place here, that's where he'd be getting sued. Collecting, on the other hand, is always a headache. The distance doesn't exactly present another barrier, but depending on his state that might help or hurt.
Your first step should be to contact the son. I imagine he didn't ransack the house looking for proof of ownership of everything that was in the house. If it does belong to the neighbor, he was likely unaware. If he can back up that the tractor was rightfully his to sell, or repays you what you paid for it, great.
Title: I negotiated sale of tractor with house purchase. Now a neighbor says it's his and he had loaned it to the late homeowner and is reporting it as a theft.
