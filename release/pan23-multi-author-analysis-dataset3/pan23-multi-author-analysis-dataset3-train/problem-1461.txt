They also lost Michigan as a laboratory for GOP fuckery. And Wisconsin will not have fuckery. And PA will not have fuckery. And AZ will not have fuckery. No malarkey in the US Senate. Razorthin, dysfunctional GOP House w their preferred branding stinking up the joint and pissing off voters constantly just in time to remember that we can fire them all.
The ones that mattered, with the exception of the absolutely awful human being JD Vance, got walloped. They got crushed down-ballot in the states and lost a bunch of races for gov and sec of state they desperately wanted, especially in AZ (hence, their ongoing freakout).
They are going to have Republicans all over the country up in arms that Arizona was stolen by Democrats, saying that they were penalized for demanding fairness in elections. Remember, it will be the rules (upheld by the majority) that cause those votes to not be counted.....
The are giving their voters something to be angry about, knowing full well it is their fault and that their voters will still blame Democrats for it.
Their base won't bat an eye when they say it, and will support any ensuing efforts to take the government back by force.
