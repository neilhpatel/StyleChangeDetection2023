Awesome reply, thanks! Follow-up question, if you will: do we know at all if sauces of any kind were served with these pre-1000 pasta ancestors? Obviously tomato wouldn’t arrive until much later, but was the early pasta eaten with, say, some kind of ‘aglio & olio’, or simply consumed as plain noodles?
Sheet-like pasta (lasagne) and earlier laganum (more likely to be flatbread than pasta) were used to make layered dishes, with cheese and/or meat layers alternating with the pasta/bread.
A 14th century recipe for tortellini has the pasta served simply in bowls with plenty of pepper and grated cheese. Grated cheese appears to have been a common Medieval companion to pasta.
Thus, the ancestor of modern pasta appears to be itriyya. The mystery - to which we have no good answer - is whether itriyya developed from the older itrion/itrium which it was named after, and whether those might have been pasta, or whether it was an invention of Western Asia, or whether it came from China.
In the West, a better pasta candidate than the earlier Greco-Roman mystery foods appears in Palestine in late antiquity (3rd to 5th centuries AD), called itrium, but unlike earlier itria, is described as a dough that is cooked by boiling. Is this a descendant of older Mediterranean itria etc.? Is it something new? Transmitted from China? We don't know - we don't know enough about this Palestinian itrium, and even less about earlier itria. We don't even know for sure that we should call it "pasta".
We don't know about the very early pastas and pasta-ancestors. Isidore of Seville's description suggests that oil (with perhaps garlic, pepper, and maybe fish sauce) might have been common. At least some dishes were simple finger food, so either a light dressing was used, or they were eaten plain.
Small grain-like pastas (cous-cous, risoni, etc.) were used like cracked wheat and whole grains, and might, e.g., accompany a stew.
