Is it really? India and China have literally fought each other to the point where soldiers have died in the last five years. South Africa can't keep the power running. Brazil is bipolar electing the psycho Bolsonaro and then Lula. What sort of logical block is BRICS? A less coherent and logical block of countries could not be found. It was a marketing term so Goldman could get investor money for emerging market funds, nothing more. Get over it.
The grouping is artificial. South Africa isn't a rising power, they can't even keep the lights on. China and India have literally had a military confrontation where soldiers were killed.
It's hard to call South Africa unaligned at this point. In fact it's actively supplying a war. South Africa is going the furthest of any country to support Russia outside of North Korea and Iran.
To put it bluntly, many black South Africans support Russia and China as they supported black South Africans during Apartheid.
And what of South Africa supporting the Russian imperialist regime in Ukraine? South Africa was wronged and therefore deserves a chance to do the wronging to other nations? That is absolutely no better than supporting the apartheid South African regime.
They were never anti-West, they were pro- anyone who'd help them end apartheid. Yes, that meant working with the USSR in the 60s and 70s, but it meant working with the West in the 80s and 90s.
Show me proof that any liberal politicians in the US have sold us out to Russia, and I'll call for their resignation.
And I know the vast majority of liberals will. Because unlike Republicans, we don't worship our leaders-- they serve us, not the other way around.
