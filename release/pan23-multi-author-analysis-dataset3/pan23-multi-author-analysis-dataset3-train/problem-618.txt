I believe you are running into some confusion with the ACA marketplace. Per the ACA, you only qualify for a tax subsidy towards a marketplace plan premium if your income qualifies you (which it sounds like your does), AND your employer offered plan is considered not affordable. You stated that it is an affordable plan by ACA guidelines.
If you are eligible, you can get a plan started through the ACA. Once you know your start of coverage date for that plan, tell your employer to cancel your insurance coverage effective on that date. Make sure you send your request for cancellation in writing, and save or forward the emails to your person accounts. The NY dept of labor would assist you if your employer continues to deduct premiums after you've asked them to cancel.
I was mistaken about being able to cancel group coverage at any time. That is true only on individual insurance policies, which is what I was familiar with.
You can cancel your health insurance at any time, for any reason. A qualifying life event is only required to start a new plan or make changes to your enrollment. Changes in income are one of the listed qualifying life events. You can also enroll in new ACA plans for next year during open enrollment starting November 1st.
The good news is that you are close to the end of the year, so even if you don't have a qualifying life event, you can change your plans for the new year.
