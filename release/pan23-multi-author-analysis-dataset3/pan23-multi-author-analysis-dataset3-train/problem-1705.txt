I'm curious about how this works. He can pick his friends to sit on the board and the board approves the zoning, right? For the future park areas Disney is planning to build, can the board just deny it every single time unless Disney pays a bribe under the table?
DeSantis is going to attempt to tax Disney, without representation, to force them to pay to build competing theme parks in the "Central Florida Tourism District.".
I'm writing that this power-grab makes it likely that Disney will curtail future investment in Florida, concentrate on reducing costs in Florida (probably with more automation and fewer employees), and then, if\/when some enormous hurricane or flood does billions of dollars in damage...take the insurance money, and invest it elsewhere, signaling an intent to sunset Disney World.
Even without GOP power grabs, the shift in how people are spending money, who has money to spend, where they want to spend it, and the long-term viability of Florida as a stable building location (environmentally), I'd imagine Disney would be looking for the next iteration of their tourism business.
Basically if Disney only maintains their FL operation the state of FL gets less construction work, likely lessened appeal for tourists (less new attractions), and the counties are footing the bill for municipal operations previously financially supported by Disney.
