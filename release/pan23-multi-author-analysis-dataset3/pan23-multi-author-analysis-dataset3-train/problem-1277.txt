So the shoes had already been shipped? How long was it before you found out? They should’ve canceled that order for those 4K shoes and refund you or at least changed the address to you when they heard it was fraud. Damn, some Bish is wearing some expensive shoes. I don’t know about your bank but I had someone recently 13K of vacuum cleaners from Australia. Luckily I been down your road before and It was flagged and they declined transaction then the bank sent me a text. It said did you make these transactions that were declined. It was all right away so that company couldn’t even process it. See if you can have fraud alerts. This has happened to me as well with them when some girl was in Vegas living it up with a card number of mine but they returned the money bc I was clearly spending money living And working like normal people do in my home state. These Fckers need to get a job like the rest of us. Who buys 13K in vacuums?! Or that on shoes? I live a normal people’s life so that shit blows my mind. I’m sorry that happened. File police report for sure.
You need to make a police report. I think the banks position is that you gave someone the information willingly. It wasn’t stolen from you. See if the police will work on finding out who did this. I would be Contacting every retailer who took your information and dispute the chargers with them. You are going to have to have some patience and keep calling them. Good luck. Sorry this happened.
