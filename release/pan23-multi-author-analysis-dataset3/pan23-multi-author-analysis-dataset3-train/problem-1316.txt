I don't know if this would actually be in favour of the current protestors. Calling it a revolution means the protestors use force and are by definition not peaceful protests. This can be used by Iran to justify using force against them.
Iran killing protestors is a breach of human rights. Iran defending themselves against an armed revolution is not. If the UN and other governments were to call this a revolution it would be very bad for the people living there (unless they do have weapons to defend themselves by then).
They do shot them dead because they claim they aren't peaceful protestors but actually a revolution... so you essentially following the language the Iranian government uses to justify shooting at the peaceful protestors.
I've seen too many videos of peaceful protestors getting shot with live ammunition, and the estimated numbers of protestors being killed is just way too fucking high for me to conclude that they just need to keep getting murdered while completely defenseless for just a little while longer.
Lol unarmed protesters have no chance, they will continue to be slaughtered until their will is broken as has happened every time unarmed protesters have gone up against an autocratic regime. For every Gahndi and MLK you need a Singh and Malcom X.
