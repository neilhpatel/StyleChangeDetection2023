Does grandma fully own the house now? Why would nephew own it? Just living there doesn't grant ownership rights.
Be very very blunt about what'll happen to aunt if she doesn't both make a will and evict nephew. And if she doesn't want to, it's best she move aunt to a facility she (grandma) is at least ok with.
She wants to write a will that states the family to take care of my sick aunt, is she allowed to do that? It would also put a big strain and responsibly on the people that would take care of my aunt.
He has lived their for 10+ yrs. But just doing nothing but drugs. When grandma dies he is the only one left in the house, so it will just belong to him.
Thank you for your comment. Helpful! Will someone have to petition the court to become my aunt's guardian after my grandma dies or before (right now)?
Is your grandma the legal guardian of your aunt? If not someone will need to petition the court to become her guardian in order to continue care for her. If she is guardian she needs to file a petition to appoint a successor guardian that can be executed upon your grandmaâ€™s death. She can also set up a special needs trust outside of her will to provide care for your aunt after her passing.
