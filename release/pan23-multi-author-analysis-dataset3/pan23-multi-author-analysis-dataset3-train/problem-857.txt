Despite what the rhetoric says Israel has never been a full democracy, this is reflected unanimously the relevant indices available. And now the country is shifting even further towards authoritarianism.
What that will allow the government to do is double down on violating and occupying Palestinian territory, it will discriminate against gays, etc., despite Netanyahu saying that's not the case. (Members of his government will continue to push for anti-gay laws and policy.).
Israel is heading into a dark place and this tragically will harm the entire region. I hope these protesters are successful because they're the only hope this country has.
that's a great picture, in the way it shows you what's going on here and what do those protests are for.
Shows pretty well that the protest is on the fringes of the society. This protest did not even got mention on r/Israel, a sub which is overwhelmingly in opposition to the new coalition.
Their point is that the image frames it as a protest by 'fringe elements' rather than 'normal Israelis'.
