Democrats are famously addicted to failure. They’ve shaken it a little recently, but I’d be shocked if they have the ability to be strategic, and I say that as someone who supports democrats.
I know, I’m sorry I was being sarcastic, I’m just frustrated because sometimes it feels like democrats are putting their efforts into mundane elections where they have very little base. In missouri our two largest cities are blue and the democrats barely know what they’re doing here, my city isn’t the largest in missouri and it’s absolutely pitiful. I was just feeling bitter and pessimistic.
People from Mississippi, how likely do think it is that a democrat holds office in your lovely state?
"'Brandon Presley and D.C. Democrats are dreaming if they think they can turn Mississippi blue. The hard-working people of Mississippi know they can’t afford a Joe Biden liberal running the state into the ground,' Sara Craig, executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said in a statement.".
Meh. I like that idea in the long term as we can attack the South from Georgia and NC to take away the home field advantage of Republicans.
But MS has 6 delegates vs OH 17. Also OH broadcast areas are probably more influential in that they reach border areas of Michigan and Pennsylvania. You spend ad money in MS and best case scenario, you're also reaching Alabama and Louisiana.
