Sweetie, just because it's what you were exposed to doesn't mean that's the way its always been. 50s? People were more curious about new advances. It took about ten years for opportunists to roll transphobia into the Lavender Scare. 70s? A lot of progress actually, until Phyllis Schlafly found success using what were then fringe TERF talking points. 90s? Huge legal victories for trans folk.
Gee...I wonder why there's so much cohesiveness. The lions share are either "dolphin" or "a black guy." I wonder where they got that from. Not to mention running that Jenner shit into the ground, their trans sports episode was propaganda...get the fuck over it if you like them or something. They're just as bad.
There's good and bad. The trans hate is by itself terrible and hurtful and further persecutes a vulnerable minority. But also, that has caused good people to step up and give this visibility. The outcome of this in the end is going to be real protections for these people. I believe that the long term result of all of this unwarranted hate is going to be the opposite of what people like Marjorie Taylor Greene want and they will have nobody to blame but themselves.
