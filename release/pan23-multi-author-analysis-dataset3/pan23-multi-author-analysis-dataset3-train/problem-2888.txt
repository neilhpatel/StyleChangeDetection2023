The fact that you have already voiced your concern regarding potential future Police and Fire department interactions would not be considered just financial damages. physical damage from auto accidents may not make themselves known immediately. Making sure that you are covered should injuries become known down the road is just as important as covering the cost of the vehicle damage.
You want to have any damage to your vehicle covered by the other driver's insurance. Their company will almost always low-ball you if your vehicle has to be replaced or has extensive damage, unless you represent an economic threat to their company and have the ability to extract resources from them in court. Insurance companies spend a lot of time and money analyzing accidents, the location, the type and cause of accident, the extent of the injuries, make, model, and year of the car, and they use that data to determine what a proper payout will be. It's almost always lower than that you want.
Having a good attorney means that the insurance company is presented with the possible threat of such an outrageous set of facts and the danger that those facts will make it in front of a jury. If your account of the events is correct, these are terrible facts to have to present before the court or a jury.
This is not a grand jury criminal case - you are not required to submit any evidence to the other side. When you sue the police department for whatever you decide to sue them for, the situation may change, but your lawyer will have those details for you.
