If you want to dominate the world and believe everybody not under your heel is a threat to your country you aren't acting in self defense and we shouldn't muddy that by going with the russian narrative.
You realize the US has been trying to create an anti missile shield around Russia trying to prevent mutual assured destruction?
No, it wasn't. They didn'T even start annexing anything at the beginning. Only when Boris Johnson made Ukraine stop negotiations Russia did start annexing territory. Same thing with the power grid which they didn't bother attacking for the longest time, until Ukraine attacked the bridge in Crimea.
Putin also said NATO expansion of Ukraine is a red line, sth the VAST majority of Russians agree with. That's why he attacked and that's why he has so much support. Zelensky refused to give up the NATO integration (instead he added it to the Ukranian constitution) and this is the result of that. Don't make a mistake. Zelensky is not going to make it out alive of this, but he won't get killed by Russians.
In early March last year, Bennett met with Putin and asked if he was going to kill Zelensky, who at the time was hiding in a secret bunker. The former prime minister of Israel spoke about this in an interview with Channel 12.
According to him, a few hours later, Zelensky returned to his office and shot a video where he stated that he was not afraid of anything.".
eh. it comes down to whether Russia is willing to go as far as wiping out the Ukrainians completely, country and people, to prevent Ukraine's industry from going to the West.
If russia was allowed to take ukraine without fight, people would still die and be forced to be russian, kids kidnapped, life without freedom and when it comes to being under russia, that's worse than death.
