Conservatives will blame the lack of action on cimate change on the left. "The left believed in climate change all this time and their policies did NOTHING. So now give power back to us and we'll fix it by lowering taxes and more deregulation so that corporations have more freedom to do it themselves instead of relying on incompetent government.".
PS. We are working towards the same goal. I think it would be great if we could develop the technology to preserve nature and the environment. Not to mention sustain the planet. I'm just trying to find a realistic solution that doesn't kill lots of people.
Listen you can say what you want but the climate does shift and nobody really knows how much humans are contributing. That's a fact. You want to argue and downvote me but I'm actually saying we do need alternative energy sources and clean energy so I don't know what your issue is? If you really think that society can sustain itself right now without fossil fuels that's insane. I'm trying to find a solution not argue about semantics.
And again by the way... I wish there were more people like you and I truly commend you. I really don't even want to argue I'm just trying to find a realistic solution.
I don't think there's a realistic solution at this point tbh. My whole point is that most people aren't even environmentally conscious themselves, but they want to blame someone else who is similar to them. Everyone is pointing the finger elsewhere. Buying products they know produce greenhouse gasses, but yet don't want to take any of the blame. Like do you see people reducing meat consumption or making real efforts to reduce their carbon footprint? This may be an anecdote, but where I live almost noone bikes on walks yet most of the vehicles on the road are inefficient.
