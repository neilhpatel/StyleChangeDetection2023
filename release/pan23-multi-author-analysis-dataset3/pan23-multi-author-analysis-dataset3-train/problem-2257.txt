oh great, now they use 1000 times as much plastic for those containers the food comes up. They better not have garbage cans because you know people will throw them away.
Yes, especially if they go in the trash. If we update our systems and they can be put in with food waste then they are composted.
As to Methane, that depends on if the restaurant was lying about composting. The bamboo itself when it breaks down does not release methane. The methane in a trash dump comes from the anaerobic bacteria releasing it as a waste product as they break down the bamboo. Compost heaps use aerobic bacteria, which does not release methane. They will release some CO2. but its no where near the 30:1 ratio that methane is as a GHG vs CO2.
As to CO2. you need to take both the full processes into play here. Which takes more, growing and harvesting a plant, then heating the leaf up and squishing and starching it, or drilling for oil, refining that oil, then making it into plastics? Im honestly not sure, but bamboo is rather easy to grow. Oil takes a lot of energy to dig for.
I disagree with what the companies did back a few decades ago to try and make us shoulder all of the blame. Its almost entirely on us.
