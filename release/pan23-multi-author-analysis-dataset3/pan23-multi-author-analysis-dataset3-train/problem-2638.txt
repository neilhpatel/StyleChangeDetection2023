This is basically a propaganda attempt to rally the Russians around the war. Obviously people outside of Russia will see the inherit flaws in that comparison, but some of the domestic audience might buy in.
When Medvedev says "Patriotic War," he's drawing comparisons specifically to the French and later Nazi invasions of Russia:
Is he forgetting that when russia was invaded in WW2 other countries were on their side when they switched sides after Nazi Germany invaded.
Just as Germany was totally crushed and distrusted for decades, so bodes the future for russia and how it behaves when all of this is over will determine how the globe treats it. Maybe it will be left sucking on Iran's and China's cocks to have allies on the world stage.
Worse, if they realise that just as the world had to stop Hitler and his craziness so putin must suffer the same fate.
They literally made deals with Hitler to split Poland for the second time in half a century. The absurdity of Russiaâ€™s claim of moral high ground is astounding.
