Great insights here! I will add that just looking at the actual military and political situation of the Aztec Triple Alliance at the time of contact with the Spanish belies the notion of the Aztecs as some sort of "sick man of Mesoamerica.".
Militarily, Motecuhzoma Xocoyotl had spend his reign substantially expanding Aztec dominion in what is now southwest Mexico, particularly in Oaxaca. The Aztecs, per peri-Conquest histories, were fielding enormous armies that could reach to increasingly further parts of Mesoamerica. The borders with the Purepecha were secure and fortified, and that kingdom was finding itself increasingly surrounded by Aztec territory. Meanwhile, the Tlaxcalans were completely encircled and were finding themselves more impoverished as time went on. Hence the famous complaint to Cortes by the Tlaxcalan elites that they did not even have access to salt.
In short, when Cortes pulled his boats up on the shores of Cemanahuac, the Spanish were entering a world dominated by the Aztecs, and the Mexica in particular. That group was consolidating its political power and the Triple Alliance as a whole was a military power which had rivals, but not equals. It's easy (and more than little fun) to speculate what the next steps of the Aztecs would have been, had the Spanish not thrown a spanner into the works. Would they have continued pushing into Oaxaca, coming up against Tututepec? Would conflict with the Purepecha break out again? Would the increasingly fierce xochiyaoyotl and proxy wars with the Tlaxcalans eventually escalate to a war of conquest? Or would the Aztecs turn their eyes to the southeast, where Nahua groups already lived in what is now Tabasco and Aztec merchants maintained an interest in the entrepot of Xicalanco? Regardless of the potential future conquests of the Aztecs, the fact remains that they were the primary actor in Mesoamerica, so those choices were theirs to make.

The idea that the Aztec (or rather Mexica/Triple Alliance) Empire was on the decline has appeared in several historical texts. However, in all cases it is on pretty shaky ground. Let’s begin with Conrad and Demarest’s ‘Religion and Empire: The Dynamics of Aztec and Inca Expansionism.’ This was one of the earlier texts to investigate ideology in the context of New World Empires. The argument, at least for the Aztecs, was that the need to acquire victims for sacrifice to the sun, Huitzilopochtli. To be clear, this idea had existed before. The first elements of it appeared in Alfonso Caso’s ‘People of the Sun’ and Miguel León-Portilla had also made similar comments. However, Conrad and Demarest were the first to really develop a comprehensive model. One of the consequences of this ideology was that the Mexica Empire was inherently unstable, and was ultimately doomed to collapse, ‘What ever the future of the Mesoamerican cultures might have been, it is clear that the era of the Triple Alliance was coming to a close.’.
