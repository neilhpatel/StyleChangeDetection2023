I'm leaning towards bullshit myself, at least in OP's instance, but a lot of people don't understand how marginal tax rates work. Even so, there are valid reasons for people to believe that a higher income will leave them worse off.
There are some welfare programs that don't taper off, they cut off completely if your income goes over a certain level. So if you're on minimum wage, you're eligible for a certain welfare payment, but if you get another .25c an hour, you don't qualify for it, and lose the lot, leaving you materially worse off.
They're actually , but almost exclusively for low income individuals/families. You're correct that they have nothing to do with the recipient's personal taxes, but it's very common for people to be worried about being worse off overall after receiving a small pay rise.
The only case where higher income actually hurts is if it pushes you over the income limit for social welfare programs like food stamps, disability, etc.
There are extremely few cases where an increase in pay results in a smaller total pay in the end - the only one I am currently aware of anywhere in the US is if you are on food stamps which almost always has a hard cutoff. Nearly every benefit and tax structure has a soft cut-off where it reduces benefits/increases taxes by less than $1 for each additional $1 of income.
Naturally, there are a very large number of such programs and tax structures in the US and I do not know all of them, however: there have been additional cases in the past, but any that tend to affect a large number of people tend to get patched very quickly as it is not in the government's interest to reduce tax revenue by encouraging people to work for less money or work less time.
