A lot of Palestinians were murdered during the Nabka, so you might have a hard time saying "this is 100% how this particular family was murdered", but make no mistake the Nabka was a horrible, deadly thing.
The nabka is a term invented to try to demonize the Jewish population who defended themselves against Palestinian attacks and the Palestinian attempt to actually ethnically cleanse the Jewish population of Israel upon the nations formation.
A portion of the Palestinian population of Israel got mad at the nation being formed, attacked the Jewish population, lost the fight and rather than executing all of them, some of whom had family who'd be neighbors to the people who would be killed, they were exiled to preserve the peace.
That's the thing, most Palestinian villagers who were massacred there were no survivors left to tell the tale, and those refugees who did survive nobody really has documented their story, mostly because they have been living this trauma daily. Many who were expelled were expelled again during 67. And a lot of palestinians who stayed in historic Palestine/Israel Lived under military rule well into the 70s so the trauma is still very much alive and elders rarely speak about it in detail.
