Agreed. When I first read the question I also was thinking along the lines of 'possible, yes; likely, no', but I would like to follow up on your last point:
The reason I make this point is because there has been some work going on in the Amazon that has resulted in a reconsideration of the extent of civilsation there. We can draw on the "anthropic pressure" and "legends" markers that you note for civilisation and it could be a contender for a civilisation that has existed largely without our knowing.
I still have a question: what of a civilization, let's say A, that came before and occupied a place that a later civilization, B, came to live in too. Their presence could be hidden underneath and A could be thought as only an early B and not a real civilization. There is no way for us to be sure, evidence could be attributed to many different layers of civilization.
You should note that there is a difference between a civilisation and a culture. Very, very few cultures reached the level of complexity, stratification and urbanisation, to be called a civilisation. So certainly, there were countless cultures that are, and will be overlooked by archaeologists and pop-culture, simply due to the sheer number of them. But civilisations are rare enough to be mostly catalogued by now, or at least we have good hypotheses of their existence, even if the evidence is gone.
Is it not possible that a civilisation could exist, in a fairly small area and then be wiped out in a catastrophe such as a volcanic eruption or flood which places all of that evidence out of reach, at least for the time being? ("currently" in the question). Or worse, imagine that the flood carries off so much soil that the evidence is dispersed so far as to be useless archaeologically.
