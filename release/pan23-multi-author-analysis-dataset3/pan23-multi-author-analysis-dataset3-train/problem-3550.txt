AKUT Search and Rescue ( is a great volunteer organization in Turkey to donate to. AHBAP is another one ( These civil society groups were the first responders to the earthquake victims even before the government got organized. They deserve all the support in the world.
However, I've also seen a great outpouring of solidarity. From day one, people have been gathering and donating supplies. My apartment building and the university I work at both had donation centers and have been sending multiple truckloads of clothes, blankets, food, diapers, batteries, etc. to the SE region. People are giving whatever they have even in these hard economic times.
People all across this region are working to help each other. So much of the relief effort is organized by regular people trying to help each other. I just spoke to a Turkish friend today who has been working to get supplies to people in the worst-hit region.
Last week two earthquakes—the first a magnitude 7.8 and the second a magnitude 7.5—hit Turkey along its shared border with Syria. The quakes, which rank , rocked an area that is home to millions of Turkish citizens, displaced Syrians and refugees.
Also keep in mind that some of the big cities hit by the earthquakes are emptying out now. In places like Antakya, people are leaving for other cities where food is available.
