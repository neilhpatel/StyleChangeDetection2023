You're forgetting that Trump doesn't have the slightest intention of running a country. A fair chunk of the GOP don't. It's all a grift first and foremost. And the more attention they get, the better the grift works.
No, they don't see or understand the hypocrisy, and wouldn't care if they could, just as long as they themselves aren't inconvenienced. And if they are, no problem, Fox is always on standby to assure them that it's (insert scary name du jour for the left)'s fault, and bolsters their disdain for government in general. Once again, when it comes time to vote, they go for whatever candidate they think will hurt the left and the government most. That was Trump in 2016. It was Trump in 2020. And it will be Trump in 2024, assuming he's still capable of running.
Then MTG will lose in 2028 but remain in office because she will successfully accomplish what Trump tried to do in 2020 but failed at.
Nothing much scarier than a Trump second term with a possible MTG succession in the event of his death.
