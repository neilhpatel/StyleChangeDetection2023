Yep. Still delaying his trial for securities fraud. And presumably still under FBI investigation for retaliation against whistleblowers. And ... sigh ... still gonna be in office for at least one more term.
For a while, America was somewhat better than this (or at least better at covering it up), but now regression to the mean rears its head.
TBH, no stranger than most other countries. The rich and well connected can evade or delay being held responsible for their crimes. And even when they can't evade it, they can convince enough voters that the conviction was illegitimate and manage to get elected again.
The problem is massive voter suppression in every way imaginable by the Republicans. Add in that Republican voters vote down ticket and it doesn't matter if the AG has mulitple criminal court cases on him. Why you ask? Well he has an R next to his name.
There's just too much rural Texas out there. We have consistently voted R's in by around 2-10% difference. That's with the dem's putting up someone like Beto. That said Beto only lost to Cruz by 200k votes in 2018.
The majority of Texas voters want a guy with an R next to his name at the voting booth. Doesn't matter what he does or is guilty of, he had an R next to his name.
