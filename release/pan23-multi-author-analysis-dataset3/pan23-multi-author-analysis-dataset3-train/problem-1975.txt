They exist. I have family who are moderates and conservative (I don’t think there’s any MAGA, but I could be wrong). Some claim they are independents, and not republican, but their views def lean more right, than left.
I imagine the qualifier is to avoid alienating “moderate” Republicans who they hope will vote for them. (I’m not sure if those voters exist, but I understand the logic.).
Uhh. Biden blocked the sick time not the republicans he could implement an executive order tomorrow to fix it. Massive quitting happening right now and they can't keep up with hiring over it. Good luck.
Too far down the rabbit hole. Too far into the hive. I work here. We have a board called the 593 board that shows employees 60 days before pulled from seniority roster. It's filling. Five yard jobs are vacant just this morning that they can't fill in one yard. Biden bent to the will of the trillion dollar companies and sold out workers and their only power in doing so. The companies knew politics were spineless so they got their way and the workers got nothing. So no. He didn't save the economy. He saved billion dollar companies doing tens of billions in buybacks vs signing an executive order for paid sick time as a compromise against a strike.
