As a progressive who lives in Alabama. It’s mostly the the rich and politicians. The idiots who vote for them have been indoctrinated and are ignorant. If the South went back to slavery they’d been in the same position if not worse. They’re idiots.
It must really suck to be stupid in this day and age. Having someone prominent discard rationality and science in favor of being loud and emotional must be impossibly intoxicating.
Uh, yeah, ok. I can see, and I know that she is a demagogue. So thats what I wrote about. You seem better informed in that regard, so by all means write about it. I dont see how I excused her. I didnt write an exhaustive ten page essay. I wrote a couple paragraphs about a specific point. Demagogue is not a compliment.
That is a little harsh. MTG is a demagogue meaning that she plays on people's emotion. Her tactic is to shamelessly and dishonestly ramp up the social temperature. People do not think well when they are angry. Her method is to frame everything in absurdly binary terms, dishonestly, and provide frustrated people that dont grasp nuance very well an enemy and a sense of righteous indignation.
