You might also want to check if he is a real dentist, and currently licensed, and check to see if a complaint has ever been filed with the disciplinary board that oversees dentists in NM.
You can look up county court records for civil malpractice cases filed against him, or any other cases where he was the defendant. Or if he was the plaintiff if he sued someone else.
A great many people threaten to sue but never do. The fact that he said "slander and defamation" means he likely has little understanding of legal terms. (Slander is spoken, libel is written, both are forms of defamation).
Truth is an affirmative defense for defamation. Overcharging you is a demonstrative fact. If it is true, you can shout it out at the top of your lungs all day, and he can do nothing about it. If you lied, then you are in trouble. It is simple enough a fact to prove. Tell your insurance company what he threatened you with, and ask for a copy of their conclusions. If they balk at sharing, get your lawyer to ask for their conclusions.
Your bad experience is an opinion. You did not like it, and you voiced your opinion about not liking it. Your negative opinion is not a basis for a defamation case, full stop. If you made false claims about facts, such as he caused damage, doesn't have a license, or uses unhygienic practices, then you are liable for damages.
