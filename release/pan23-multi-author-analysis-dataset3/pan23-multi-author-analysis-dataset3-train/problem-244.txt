USPS rural carrier here. Honestly the easiest option is like most said, moving the mailboxes. This obviously requires postmaster approval, as they also then have to do the paperwork on our end to adjust your carriers route.
Ahh gotcha. Yeah in many places rural carriers drive their own vehicle. And whether or not they're allowed to back up pretty much lies in their routes line-of-travel. One of my coworkers even got called into the postmasters office for making too many left-turns.
Since he's being an ass, you'll probably just have to wait for the PM to return so you can figure out the mail issue. Idk if having them talk to your neighbor would matter at all.
OK, you've made it clear you don't want to be nice to the neighbor. In that case your options are to sue THEM over this. That means getting a lawyer and filing suit to get it resolved. And that assumes it gets resolved in your favor, and the neighbor is forced to recognize the right-of-way. That means months - if not years - of litigation in the hopes that a court agrees with you, then even more time to actually enforce the decision. That's a lot of money, and a lot of time going to courthouses and lawyer offices. This also doesn't include all of the other nuisance litigation that WILL spring up like weeds around this.
