There's nothing actionable about making a private allegation (which is what this is) of emotional abuse in the context of a negotiation at the end of a relationship.
OP hit the threshold to be considered common law. While Ontario doesn't have a property division regime for common law couples, it does provide for spousal support.
Common-law spouses in Ontario are sometimes entitled to spousal support if the relationship terminates. Whether, and how much, is a fact-based question we cannot answer for you - you need to talk to a family law attorney to get advice tailored to your situation.
"Abuse" is generally not a factor in determining spousal support. Support is based on needs such as continuing the spouse's standard of living, and a stay-at-home spouse's reduced ability to earn an income because of the gap in their career.
If she was able to work and support herself, that generally doesn't result in an order to pay alimony/support.
You shouldn't say anything in response to her demands without speaking with an attorney first. It's not entirely clear that she's entitled to anything based upon what you've written above, but the specifics are going to be important.
