Thank you. I’m just curious, though, if an exemption is granted, they have to provide reasonable accommodation, right? That was my understanding. However, they’re telling staff that even if they get an exemption granted they are not guaranteed a job. Am I wrong that they are required to provide accommodations?
Managers are telling employees that they will most likely not have their exemptions approved. If it’s not intimidation it’s at the very least coercion. That’s what I’m asking about.
That’s kind of an interesting question. “We will basically not be approving religious exemptions” doesn’t seem to be intimidation. Especially at an employer with a religious mission.
If you have a righteous religious exemption to the vaccine, file your request. If they deny it, act on that. But, of course, you don’t have a righteous religious exemption because virtually none exist making “basically not approving” the appropriate disposition of the request.
There could be an issue with the medical exemptions part, but religious exemptions everywhere have been fairly hard to obtain because there are only a few religions that have actual stances against vaccinations.
You likely don't have a lot of recourse, especially working in the medical field (because there may not be an accommodation that would work) but speaking to one in your area is the best place to start.
