Even if he's paying Tesla a fair market rate (which I doubt) that still doesn't necessarily mean it's in Tesla's best interests, they aren't a consulting company so having those employees working for Twitter means that their primary jobs aren't getting done.
He has a fiduciary responsibility to Tesla as the CEO of a publicly traded company, which by "stealing" engineers from TSLA, he is not filling, as they are then NOT working on Tesla projects that are already years behind.
To say we’ve not seen Musk make any business decisions prior to the Twitter takeover, wilfully ignores the fact he’s been CEO at Tesla since 2008!
Here, this is what I've been asking Elon's fanboys for years now: what specific decisions has he made that contributed to Tesla's success? Choosing to invest in electric cars isn't impressive; manipulating stock prices isn't impressive. I'm looking for just one decision he made that, without which, Tesla wouldn't have been successful.
You cannot discredit his achievements at Tesla. He became the largest shareholder with a $6.5m investment back in 2004 - for a time in 2021, its valuation hit $1tn.
