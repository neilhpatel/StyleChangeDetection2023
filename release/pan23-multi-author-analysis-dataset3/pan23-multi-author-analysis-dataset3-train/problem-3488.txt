Do you avoid other medicines tested on fetal cell descendants for religious reasons? Do you avoid other injected medicine for religious reasons? If one of these, or some other standing pattern of applicable observance exists, you may have a valid cause for exemption. For most people seeking religious exemption neither one applies, but it sounds like it may be the case for you.
Ultimately, it's going to be up to the government to decide what religious exemptions will be approved.
Widely known and established religious beliefs, such as refusal of blood transfusions in the case of Jehovah's Witnesses; are documented and understood by the agencies making these decisions.
If you are part of a small sect that consists of you and your immediate family, your beliefs may very well not be considered to be religious in nature.
But besides that I'm not even necessarily part of an unknown sect, my spouse was raised Jehovahs witness and there are similar beliefs there, mixed with some from another.
I dont understand what you mean. The federal discrimination protection doesn't say anything about "established religious groups only", and the exemption questions specifically detailed that and did not even ask the name of the specific religion.
