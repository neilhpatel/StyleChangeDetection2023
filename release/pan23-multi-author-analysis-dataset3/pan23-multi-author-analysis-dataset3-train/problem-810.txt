I’m thinking this might also be an FCRA violation; according to FCRA you have the right to dispute background check findings.
Anyway, if there is nothing like that, since you were not hired because of information contained in a consumer report you can file an FCRA complaint. This is the link for everything you have ever wanted to know concerning the FCRA:
Did you dodge the background company’s calls or something? I do employment verifications and the first thing we do with a “no record” situation is reach out to the subject of the investigation and ask for a W-2 or a pay stub or something to make sure we reached out to the right company.
I worked for a company that used the work number and have had two background checks at new jobs since I left and thats always the one that us verified properly first. I just out to contact them and the background check people figure it out. No digging out old managers numbers or old hr people and hoping they're still there. Just put "the work number" in who to contact and list their phone number and website. Its great.
