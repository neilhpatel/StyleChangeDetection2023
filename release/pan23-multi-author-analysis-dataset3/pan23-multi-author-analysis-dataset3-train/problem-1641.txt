But even if he didn't, signing the birth certificate, accepting responsibility, and acting as the father will more than likely end up with him having the responsibility of child support -- at least until paternity is challenged (among other things), which may or may not be straightforward/easy/unchallenging depending on where this is occurring.
Yes, he would likely be considered the father and be held to the responsibilities of being the father in the event of a divorce.
If he is the biological father, then he’s responsible for the child, that one’s pretty tough to get out of.
I’m not saying that he can’t find a way out of paternity, because lawyers are a tricky bunch, and he’ll have one - but he seems pretty well committed.
As others have said if he’s not the biological father but signed the birth certificate, there is a lot of work for him to do to undo his commitment there. If he was misled that will be easier to do, if he knew going in his biological paternity status, he’ll have a little more of an uphill battle.
But certainly a man who accepts paternity at birth has accepted financial responsibility for that child and runs the risk that acceptance may be permanent in some situations.
If a woman gives birth while she is married, her husband is legally responsible for the child, regardless of whether he is the biological father, and regardless of whether he signs anything.
