No need to include "for money" - "People that do this should be considered as traitors" is fine by me. Not only do these pilots get money, but they are likely provided lots of other comforts in order to get more info out of them. Honey traps are common tools.
Imagine if a Chinese pilot defected or provided these trainings to Australia - the reaction of the Chinese government would a secret massive hunt including repercussions to the pilot's family.
Nearly all officials that are sent to foreign countries by their governments operate as spies at some level, some more than others. While the pilots are after money, don't think that maybe there is more than meets the eye.
Is it on only pilots we worry about here? If an infrantryman went to China to train their soldiers is that also bad? Doctors? Naval officers? Just curious as to where we draw our lines.
Ok so by that logic why not make it illegal for any westerner to work in China in any industry related to the national security of China? A scientist or a lawyer can pass off secrets just as much as a pilot.
