So low confidence typically means something like this is possible but there’s not evidence for it. This also means there’s not evidence countering it. I do similar analysis and low confidence doesn’t typically make it into reports unless requested.
"Low confidence" is a significant phrase and we should take that into account when we decide how accurate the DoE's assessment might be, but some people seem to want to ignore it altogether and I don't think that's a productive way of thinking about this. It's not like the DoE said "no way, it was absolutely not a lab leak." They said they have some reason to believe, with low confidence, that it might have been a lab leak. To me, that suggests that qualified experts within the DoE were coming across some pieces of information that pointed to a lab leak being possible. Again, whatever those pieces of information might have been, they weren't enough to make a statement with high confidence, but they're not nothing either.
A lot of the stuff that was labeled misinformation in the past has either turned out to be true or we're not sure about if it is or not.
I get scientists being hesitant because either they will look bad or this will lead to a halt in funding for a lot of beneficial things. It happened with Chernobyl and also with quantum physics in the 60s.
I totally agree with the last two things you said. Also, Trump definitely pushes a lab leak to shift the blame for his lack of action that is for sure.
A potential lab leak could be true while also highlighting trump's incompetence and lack of care for anyone other than himself.
