This is the same reason you can Hate china and not be racist because you Love Taiwan and Hong Kong. Chinese isnt only in one place, Jewish isnt only in one place. Anti-semitism has literally no meaning in it that is connected to Israel.
Having a weird, seething hatred for Israel almost always ends up with the person being an antisemite. Like, almost always.
Yeah, that "animosity" had entirely to do with being forced as second class citizens in Islamic society.
So, yeah, you can like Jews and hate Israel, but it barely ever happens since a lot of that hating of Israel is just residual Soviet antisemitic propaganda.
The only reason someone can support the attacks is if they hate those people and since the people targeted were Israeli Jews, then it's by no means a stretch to conclude that /u/charming-start-3722 hates Jews.
you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims. the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa. the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%). it IS mostly anti semitism. to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above. furthermore. it is an offensive. stupid. strawman. trope. that i cant tell the difference. as a jew. when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.
