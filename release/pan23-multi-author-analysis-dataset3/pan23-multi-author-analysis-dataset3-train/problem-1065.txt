I would call the police non-emergency line and try to clarify if the car is insured or not. Insurance is attached to the car, not the humans. You could come drive my car right now and it wouldn’t matter if you had insurance because my car does (which I pay for). If the daughter was cited for no insurance I’m guessing the car is not insured but the police will be able to tell you.
If it’s not insured, your next stop is your own insurance policy. If you don’t have coverage, then your last option is a lawsuit, likely small claims.
If kids aren’t listed on the policy; most insurance companies will still pay the claim for the accident. They may go back and charge the parents the avoided premium payments, raise up the rates in response, or refuse to renew the policy, but it’s rare that they will outright deny coverage. However, They can also accuse a policyholder of fraud or misrepresentation and breach of the policy requirements and refuse to pay, which is more likely after bigger accidents.
If you sue them (which you may have to do anyway, if your insurance coverage does not extend to this accident), you will also sue the mother under a theory of negligent entrustment. Part of the normally required elements of a response to such a complaint is the disclosure of relevant insurance policies. If not, you can certainly get it in discovery.
A lot of parents of new teen drivers fail to report that junior picked up a license to their insurance company, because their premiums will more than double.
While the normal rule is that insurance follows the car, and people you lend your car to are covered under your insurance; the exception written into most policies involve household members who regularly use your car. Those typically ARE required to be reported to your insurance company and prices into your premium.
