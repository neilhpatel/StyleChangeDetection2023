Great! So if I'm getting this right, Napoleonic corps allowed combined arms outside the confines of a field army--so you could get an infantry division accompanied by cavalry and guns. Because the corps was smaller than an army, you could supply it, but because it had all the pieces it needed to be effective, it could fight on its own.
Since the Napoleonic era, the concept of a "corps is a mini-army" has become outdated as more diverse groups of weapons filter down to smaller and smaller units. A Napoleonic-era British infantry regiment of 500 people would consist almost entirely of soldiers with muskets. Infantry units might operate alongside or just behind friendly artillery as John Keegan notes in The Face of Battle, but these are not part of the regiment in the way that a modern mortars would be "organic" to the heavy weapons platoon of a modern infantry company.
As Jac Weller wrote in Wellinon At Waterloo, the Napoleonic concept of a corps is that of a force large enough and with diverse-enough composition to function as a mini-army. In other words, a corps features its own infantry, artillery, and cavalry under a single commander, functioning like a mini-army. Corps can either act on their own or be combined for larger engagements. When on the move, corps were to move on parallel routes close enough to come to the aid of another if attacked.
Less strain on the army commander: rather than having all your divisions to worry about, an army commander can focus on their corps commanders. Since multiple divisions go into each corps, this reduces the management load considerably.
