The Christian Watt Papers by Christian Watt. This one deals with the 19th century, but it's AWESOME. It's a blistering first-person account of what life was like for a poor fisherwoman in Victorian Scotland. Watt does NOT hold back in writing about how the upper classes exploit the working class, which is pretty awesome to read from a woman who was born in the 1830s.

Women in Scottish fishing communities in general had quite a different gender dynamic than women in other parts of 19th century Britain. They often say that the men did the fishing, and the women did everything else. In fact, a Scottish fisherman once told me that the only things a fisherman in the old days had to fear were hell and his wife!
