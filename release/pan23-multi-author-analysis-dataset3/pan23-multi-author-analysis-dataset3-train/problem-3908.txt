Once upon a time, I would have defended Ohio - they seemed to be on the right path towards progress but the last 10 years have shown that it's really becoming a shithole.
Toledo is truly he hidden gem of the midwest. Top 10 zoo and art museum in the country, HUGE metroparks with a focus on conservation and ease of access, an interactive science museum downtown, Tony Packos... the list really goes on and on.
Quick question: Do you know if Jenny's ice cream is still in Columbus? Might be able to get back to Ohio in the next year or so, and would like to take family down to try it out as it's a good memory of mine.
Anecdotally as an Ohioan, we have been planning a move to Michigan for about a year now, even prior to the 2022 elections. We encourage any friends who are looking at getting out of Ohio to check it out. Politics aside, the general vibe of the population just seems to be much more positive and chill in general compared to its southern neighbors.
South Haven is gorgeous, we visited when it was October so the weather was already turning but I would love to go back in the summer. I bet the downtown town area is bustling once it gets warmer.
We really like Grand Rapids, and the Douglas/Saugatuck area. Traverse City and Grand Haven were fun to visit but seem like they may be a little upscale for our tastes ha!
Let’s go on offense. I’ll go to any state that restricts people’s freedoms and win business and hardworking people from them. I’m looking at you, Ohio and Indiana.”.
You will get some jokes about being from Ohio. Michiganders hate Ohio with a burning passion, it's due to OSU and having to drive through a state with insane cops. We rarely acknowledge the existence of Indiana.
