How are you being paid? "Consultant" does not mean "independent contractor" and, under CA law, your employer does not control how your work status is characterized - the state does.
If you are in CA (and other places, to varying degrees) everyone who does work is presumed, under the law, to be an employee. To say "no, you're not an employee, you're a contractor" requires passing a very strict test. CA is the strictest, NY and IL are pretty strict, many states have their own standards. Also note that you are paying extra taxes on this income, you're paying the employer's share of payroll taxes.
The key to "independent contractor" is "independent." That means you get to pick when you work, where you work, how much work you do. It means you can subcontract out your work to other people. It means you get to set your own rates, and it generally means you have multiple clients. An independent contractor doesn't have a boss, they have clients. They often invest in tools. They aren't an employee. And in CA, independent contracting work cannot be related to the type of work the business does.
You mean an independent contractor rather than a W2 employee? Unless you already have your own business, this arrangement is probably not legal in CA.
If it were me, I'd ask once about the status and whether that complies with current CA law. If they insist it does, I'd run far, far, away as quickly as possible.
