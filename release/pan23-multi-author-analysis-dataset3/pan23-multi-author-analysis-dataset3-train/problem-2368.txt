That's not a contradiction to what you said, it's an addendum (I didn't even come up with it, it's the ).
My point is that it doesn't matter to contractors if there is war or peace, a profit will still be made by them. Look at the military budget that was passed after we left Afghanistan but before Russia invaded Ukraine, it still noticeably went up, more than Biden asked for in fact. These guys don't care, if there is peace they can sell you on the threat of war, of another power gaining the upper hand (like Russia), and if there is war they can likewise sell governments on the need of weapons. It does matter for Ukraine whether they get the weapons to protect themselves or not, and ultimately the only one responsible for the war in Ukraine is Russia, regardless of who does or doesn't take advantage of Putin's war mongering.
In fact following Putin's logic, not only are Ukrainians using American tanks and rockets to attack Russia, but Russians are using Russian tanks and Russian rockets to attack Russia.
Probably because HARM missiles are somewhat autonomous, so Ukraine is not intentionally firing at targets in Russia: the missiles are just homing in on the origin of the radar source.
The Ukraine is using American rockets and tanks to attack Russia How would we react if either Canada or Mexico had Russian tanks and rockets our troops? Think back to the Cuban Missile Crisis.
It’s an example asking what would America do if the situation was reversed The example of the Cuban Missile Crisis is proof we’d be willing to go to WAR over it Learn from history of be forced to repeat it ☠️.
This won’t cause Russia to start WWII, it’s just to defend the victims in the Ukraine Why isn’t anyone saying Biden is going to start a war with Russia and have it escalate to WORLD WAR III?
