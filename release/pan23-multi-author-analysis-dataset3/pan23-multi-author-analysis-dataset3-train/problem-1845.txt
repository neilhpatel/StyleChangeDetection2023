There is no official lease. It is just a verbal lease. The way it was explained to me is that the first floor pays 700, and the second floor (with 7 people) pay 1100. Very vague stuff.
First floor is one Tennent that pays 700 and he left after the current month so he didn't have to pay the following months rent, and 2nd floor is the 7 people and they pay 1100.
If tenants are short on rent, then on the 5th day the full rent is overdue you can give notice to end the tenancy for non-payment. However, this does not entitle you to just kick them out immediately. You are supposed to give them reasonable time to move out, during which time they can come up with the rent, and if they don't pay their arrears or leave on time then you can apply for an order of possession. See.
Something to keep in mind: since you gave notice for landlord's own use, you are supposed to pay the tenants $500 for moving expenses, on top of giving them 3 months notice. You could agree to apply that $500 towards the rent they owe instead.
Do you intent to take over the whole house for your own personal use (as opposed to just one floor)? If not, you cannot evict tenants from both floors.
I don't know how backed up the residential tenancies branch is in MB, but if its anything like other provinces you are looking at a significant delay to get an order of possession (a few months at least). As a result, this will not be any faster than the notice you already gave. Still, do give the notice because that will be one more reason to move to evict if they don't leave based on your prior notice.
