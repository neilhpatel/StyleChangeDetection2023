Refineries in the 70s were converting units to process cheaper gulf state crude oil. Instead of deregulation, Carter could have pressured domestic production of oil. Its this conversion that still requires the U.S. to rely on foreign crude to process domestic oil, its a more complicated process and requires natural gas and other chemicals. Because of deregulation around a 100 refineries closed, prices shot up and stayed there. Currently its the cause of our high gasoline prices. If Carter was all that concerned with climate change and energy he would have been pushing nuclear energy harder, but he went and banned things like reprocessing of nuclear waste...
I think that Carter was the first (maybe only) President who really understood nuclear weapons, leading him to understand that they couldn't/shouldn't ever be used.
Really never thought about it much, but undeniable that issues from Carter's time led to Reagan (and Reaganomics too).
My point about Nixon is certainly arguable, but the point about Reagan is inescapable: Carter’s legacy is dwarfed by comparison.
Carter’s legacy is contrasted further against the complicated legacy of Richard Nixon. I suspect the American public harbored ambivalence towards Nixon all throughout the Ford and Carter administrations. When character is left out of the equation, Nixon’s legacy is nothing but ambiguous. For Carter, it’s cut-and-dried.
No— President Carter’s term is exactly as people think. He’s got a good heart, and his character is beyond reproach. Terrible president. Tragic, but it’s the truth: good-hearted people don’t necessarily make for good leaders.
