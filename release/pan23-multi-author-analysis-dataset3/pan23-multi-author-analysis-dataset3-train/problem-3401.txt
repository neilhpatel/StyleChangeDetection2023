1. Historical Russian Empire had parts of Poland, and Poland was part of the Eastern Bloc. Putin pretty clearly spent Covid pandemic fantasizing about the Russian empire and USSR.
I agree with you that this wasnt intentional, but I did want to mention there's a number of reasons why Poland is desirable to Russia.
Ok, so maybe Poland does have value to Russia BUT as you said, it would mean a war with NATO and I don't think it's that valuable to Russia, like at all.
Having that in mind it seems that NATO is backpedaling leaving Poland vulnerable - it reminds Poles situation from September 1939, don't you think?
Our armies attacked Poland on 1st of September, Polish Allies - UK and France declared war on us on 3rd of September and... just it.
It is unlikely to be fired by Ukrainians as their AA batteries aim EASTwards not west-wards as anti rocketry system does isn't build for chasing rockets but for colliding with them midair.
If it's a Ukrainian missile it may have been trying to shoot down a Russian missile heading west and has missed meaning the Ukrainian missile could have been chasing it but missed and kept going west /north west to Poland. Or it's a Russian missile that has over shot Ukraine. All guessing of cause. I don't see it being deliberate but who knows these days.
