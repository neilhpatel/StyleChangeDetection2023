Not only did Gingrich pave the way for today's Tantrum Caucus with one of his own when he was Speaker, he actively worked for it as a member/orbiter of the Trump campaign and administration in recent years.
It's funny how Gingrich is bitching at Republicans for not voting for McCarthy, when he was arguably the turning point of the modern GOP into the full blown Qrazies that they are today.
We have Newt Gingrich to thank for the rise of Trump and for the vitriol and chaos that is now the Republican Party.
Newt Gingrich introduced the rhetoric and tactics that have shaped the Republican Party for the last three decades. And then the Tea Party added fuel to the fire.
With the groundwork laid, Trump unleashed the worst elements of the GOP and allowed white supremacists to crawl out from under their rocks. Combine this with representatives who are only serving due to gerrymandering, and a cult of personality that has taken hold of politics with politicians spending more time trying to get clicks than helping the American people, and you have where we’re at right now.
“It is a commentary on how things have deteriorated that we look back upon Gingrich’s GOP as a more positive time.”.
Gingrich didn’t believe his malarkey, he was an enormous cynic and he feels that enough time has passed so that he feels free to act like this is not expected result of hyper partisan politics.
