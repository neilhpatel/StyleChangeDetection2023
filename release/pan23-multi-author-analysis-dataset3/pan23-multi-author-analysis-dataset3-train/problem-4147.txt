It should be easy to regulate firearms, which would help offset the damage from the lack of attention to the other factors in the short run, except that some zealots have declared that we can’t have any sensible licensing or safety requirements at al.
3. Even if 1% is pure accidents, surely you support making life safer for those 500 or so people without affecting your ability to have a gun if you want one except for some minor extra inconvenience to take a test or fill out some paperwork.
Sorry, not assumptions. Evidence from other nations that have guns but also have regulations shows it’s true. It’s possible to have guns, have gun regulation, and also reduce gun violence.
Then why do other countries who have gun controls but also have similar mental health issues not have mass shootings??? Banning all guns is not the answer. Gun control is.
Gun control laws do not work in the US for a myriad of reasons. There are too many guns out there. Substantive gun control is always struck down as unconstitutional. Lately, any new gun control laws don't even address the problem (I don't believe any mass shooting has been perpetrated by a "ghost gun").
People on here seem to get annoyed but I agree, Mass shootings are a mental health issue and won't be solved by most types of gun control other than banning all firearms which isn't practical here and would likely result in people making bombs or something.
For the record I'm fine with gun control but I'm just not naive enough to believe that's the main solution for this problem, and any new gun laws are not going to pass legal scrutiny unless we get a completely new government so we're going to have to find other solutions.
The key here is "diagnosed with", I highly doubt the good doctor would go on record claiming there's no mental health component to MASS MURDER! Our mental health system is both underfunded and underutilized so most people with mental health issues are never even seen let alone diagnosed with anything.
