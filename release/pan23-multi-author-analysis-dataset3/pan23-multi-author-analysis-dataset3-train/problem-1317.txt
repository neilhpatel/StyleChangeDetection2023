That's one of the first things that came to my mind. Medical and dental care for women will be difficult which includes childbirth. Expect a lot of fallout from this. Very sad news indeed. And it's not like any women will want to come to Afghanistan to work as a doctor even temporarily.
Many doctors fled when the Taliban took over, especially women doctors. When they were last in power women were not allowed to work at all, and what we are seeing is the systematic stripping of womenâ€™s rights to get back to how it once was, despite them saying the contrary.
No they just like to sexually abuse as many children and women as possible and women gaining power would slow that down.
The US made a lot of progress for women and human rights in general before we decided we didn't have the patience to stick it out and left. The taliban is changing it back bit by bit.
The patience comment sounds flippant, but it's not meant to be. It may have required a generation or two to make such changes stick, and in that time we'd have been occupying another country, part of which wanted to kill us. So I understand that staying that long was asking a lot.
