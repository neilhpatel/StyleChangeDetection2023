At least FL offers an easy secular method; any notary can marry people there, no religious affiliation (nominal or otherwise) needed.
The note to the list being "informational" is that the county is providing that list as an informal service to the public, and it is neither complete, nor is the clerk's office providing an endorsement. (e.g. You have no action against them for not being listed, or for an officiant not showing up, no longer being qualified, etc.).
P.S. I find the reference to "the gospel" to be repugnant. It seems to include (arguably) only Christians, Jews, and Muslims. Buddhists and Hindu need not apply.
Do you have the marriage certificate from the county clerk? It should say something like "I, Billy Random, Clerk of the Circuit and County Court, Miami-Dale County, do hereby certify that Dick Jones and Jane Smith were married on July 4, 2018, In Miami, by Susan Sister, who is a minister." Signed and with an official raised seal.
It was stamped with what I am assuming is a seal. It was signed 3 times by the person that took it and made a copy for us, and their records.
