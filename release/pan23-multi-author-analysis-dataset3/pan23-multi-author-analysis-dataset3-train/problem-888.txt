Ahh yesâ€¦ Freedom of speech = denying the holocaust, an extremely well documented and tragic event that stripped millions of people from families, lives, and the world altogether. Freedom of speech does not equal hate speech, they are two very VERY different things.
Freedom of speech is very straight forward. You are advocating for censorship. Look at history for how societies that censor vs those that allow free communication fare.
You mean freedom of speech, the essential part of a free society to be able to express your own opinion without government interference? That "freeze peach"? Because you're a complete nincompoop if you think it should up to some government bureaucracy to decide who is or isn't allowed to speak their mind.
Some governments are even using retoric similar to yours and their censorship laws to combat legitimate political movements under the guise of fighting fascism. Look at how China brands the Hong Kong protestors as fascist. Or the way Putin justifies his invasion of Ukraine to "fight the facsists.".
...... But now, you do see how that's kind of missing my point, yeah? I mean, not really the debate I was looking to have?
