Extremely unlikely that Ukraine is making direct assaults against Kreminna. It would go against the trend of offensive Ukrainian operations that avoid assaulting fortified cities.
Also the fact that Russians are making those claims does not in anyway give credibility to them. In fact, i'd be even more skeptical of them because it's coming from the Russians. What is more likely happening is that Ukrainians have managed creep towards the edge of the town in the forest, and may be probing the defenses of Kreminna, but those "attacks" are unlikely to have intention of starting a fight inside the town itself.
In the past 36 hours or so Ukraine has made significant progress in the Kreminna direction, and now the Russians are claiming (unconfirmed, mind you) that Ukraine is directly assaulting the city itself.
Official RU announcement says a drone was shot by anti-aircraft defenses "causing it to change direction and hit a building where pilots were waiting", killing three and wounding several more.
"The enemy continues to suffer losses. For example, in the city of Starobil's'k, Luhansk region, in the military hospital equipped by the occupiers, about 50 seriously wounded enemy servicemen have recently been delivered.".
Yesterday the warriors of the 108th Mountain Assault Brigade of ZSU carried out the assault on the Russian positions. Many invaders killed, 10 were captured.
