The bill doesn't mention "Arabs" anywhere. Those who are CONVICTED of terrorism AND paid a stipend by the Palestinian Authority will lose Israeli citizenship and be deported to PA territories. In theory this includes any terrorists who are Jewish or Christians would be subject to the exact same law, but it's unlikely anyone not Muslim would be getting payments from the PA in the first place, so...
It applies to Arabs, Jews, Christians, Hindus, Atheists, White, Black, Asian, Latin, green, blue, Martian…. Anyone who’s an Israeli citizen and commits a terror attack again Israel AND the Palestinian Authority pays them a stipend in reward….
Great reporting from AP, there is nothing mentioning Arabs in the law, only those convinced of terrorism show received pay from a foreign entity for the murdering their fellow citizens.
If you accept money from an outside terrorist group and commit active violence in support of that terrorism, strip away that citizenship.
Nothing about being accused of terrorism, this law only effects those convinced who received pay from a foreign power to commits acts of terrorism agaist their fellow citizens, in many places in the world this would be considered treason and punished by death.
It only removes citizenship from those who were convinced of terrorism, received a life sentence penalty , and have received money for their acts of terror, only after those three requirements are met, the government can go the courts and ask them to remove the citizenship, then the person can defend themselves in a trail.
On Canadian citizenship: “Your Canadian Citizenship could also be revoked if you were convicted of one of the following offences: terrorism, high treason, or. offences related to espionage (though this depends on the type of sentence handed down)”.
