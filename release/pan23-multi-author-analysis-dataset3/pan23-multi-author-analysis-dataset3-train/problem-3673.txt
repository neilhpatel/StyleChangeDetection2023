Let me get this straight: You initially quoted him for some number of trees, then he wanted a lot more trees? So you decided he was not going to be a good client, and fired him.
Instead of just telling him that, you told him a couple of white lies about why you couldn't take his payment or do work for him.
I presume there was never a signed contract, and there was no money transferred. I (IANAL) would be inclined to believe that there was no oral contact either (no meeting of the minds, the number of trees changed). I don't believe he has any grounds for a lawsuit.
Basically you aren't being sued until you get a summons to appear in court. At that point you should get a lawyer. Otherwise, if they call and tell you they are suing you, you can tell them to go hang. Even if they get a lawyer and send you a demand letter, you can tell them \and\ the lawyer to go hang. If you get a summons, \then\ the court gets involved.
If you have been served show up to court. Explain to the judge what happened truthfully. If what you have told us here is all true, then you shouldnâ€™t have anything to worry about.
However if you have lied to us (like you did to your clients), or lie to the judge then all bets are off.
OP mentioned in another comment that he has already been served his papers, and there is a court date.
