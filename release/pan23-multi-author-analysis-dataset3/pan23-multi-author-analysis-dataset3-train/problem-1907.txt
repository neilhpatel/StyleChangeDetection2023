Yeah he was pretty much sunk when 100% of his pre-coup candidates lost in the midterms… still think he’ll absolutely cruise through the primaries though.
Still so wild to me how part of the MAGA election denial brain was “I don’t even see any Biden flags.”.
yeah, don't expect DeSantis to make it politically to 2024 if he decides to run. wld imagine the fomenting will start soon on untruth social if it didnt already last night in his "speech.".
Oh, wow, yeah. DeSantis could wait it out 4 years, there's a good chance neither Biden nor Trump are around by then.
Imagine the republican heir apparent sitting out and Republicans running a Division III squad + Trump in the primary. I'm trying to imagine who would even run in the primary. Maybe Liz Cheney and Jeb!. Maybe they can run on the same ticket.
On the other hand, I would love to see Paul Ryan get the shit knocked out of him for a whole campaign season by brutes and ratfuckers that get people like Trump and Nixon and W. Bush elected.
Will it? I think the only insurgent candidate on the republican side was Reagan. Otherwise, I thought they usually take their turn, the nominee knowing pretty well in advance who is going to get the nod.
