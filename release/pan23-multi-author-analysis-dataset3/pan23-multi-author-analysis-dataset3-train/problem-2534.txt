Generally speaking that's not how it works. You weren't laid off, or fired. States were rubber stamping approvals and then much later (now) auditing. It's like an IRS audit, you file your taxes and the IRS accepts whatever you say, sends to a refund. Then later they process it and maybe say you owe it back.
One issue may be that you're conflating various types of information and that may make it appear to the state that you are not eligible. Or you may not be. In another post you said you were eligible in another state.
Since Michigan says you were supposed to file in Connecticut, did you contact Connecticut to see if you would be eligible, even retroactively? It sounds like Connecticut was the state you should have filed in, but with this much money at stake, have a consultation with an unemployment attorney.
I got a message from unemployment recently in the last few days saying I had unemployment benefits I could claim in another state. But I didnâ€™t lose my job in Connecticut due to Covid and my belief was that I was receiving benefits due to my Michigan filing in my tax income I provided in 2019.
The wording of that was not the best. I was working and my place of employment at the university was closed due to the quarantine in March. I was working part time about 25 hours a week before my place of unemployment closed due to the quarantine. I was told my weekly benefits given by unemployment would be based off my part time work. Also was part time student when I filed for unemployment and was taking about 7 credits or so to finish my degree.
