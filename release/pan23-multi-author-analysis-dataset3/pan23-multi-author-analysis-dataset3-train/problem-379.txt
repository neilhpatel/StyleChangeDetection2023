If you're willing to be out by October 30th, you're welcome to negotiate with your landlord on what that might look like -- getting your moving costs covered, maybe your first month's rent at a new place, etc. Otherwise, and unless your lease states otherwise, your lease is presumably valid for that property until March.
:Edit the new owners don't know about my lease or that I have a right to live hear till march and the bought the house.
That is what I told my landlord but she advertised the house as a house with no tenants and it was sold so I don't know what to do.
If your lease doesn't say what happens if the property is sold, then generally, the new owners of the house inherit your lease and tenancy.
It sounds like the former owner might have failed to disclose material facts about the property and its inhabitants, and the new owners are in for a surprise.
Then they have a legal claim against the prior owner for materially and knowingly misrepresenting the property being sold. You are still the legal tenant. Keep your lease handy and safe, make sure to have a copy.
Find a copy of your lease. Make copies of that lease. Store it on your car and somewhere else offsite in the event someone tries to change lock or illegally evict you.
Ball is in your court. If they really want you out, cash for keys is always an option. Make it worth your while though; one month rent, return of deposit, month of room and board to hold you over while you find a new apt. Otherwise sit tight until your lease is over.
