But that’s not doing the work of We The People. McCarthy is clearly offering a point gaining pitch to his political base only, the fanatically led right, a fact and logic free group. Stirring controversy and doubt about abstract issues with no tangible basis, is definitely not the same as properly reacting to corrupt and violent acts played out in clear public view. Even with all their downplaying and disinformation, regardless of their efforts facts are still indisputable.
In other words, McCarthy is representing only a specific group factually unmerited, and that’s an unproductive path for We The People as a whole. He doesn’t want to lead the House of Congress, he wants to lead a faction that only plays bullshit political games against the majority.
Call me crazy but after the last few years and how hard it's been for everyone I don't think people want a political party that's only agenda is revenge.
Yeah a super slim majority with Dems vastly outperforming historical trends doesn't seem to me that people want nothing but revenge investigations and culture wars. Republicans can go for it, I just think it's going to blow up in their faces.
