But whatever the cause was, the worsening situation in the empire caused the economy to come crashing down. (And/or the worsening economy helped bring the empire crashing down. Chicken, meet egg.) Ward-Perkins has a nicely consise (and somewhat polemical) outline of just how dramatic this impact was in his 2005 "The Fall of Rome and the end of civilisation.".
It is just inexplicable to me how a state controlling Italy and some islands can more easily field larger armies in battle (and replace them) than an Empire controlling the whole of Southern and Western Europe, North Africa, Turkey and the Middle East.
Thanks for the great response! . Sorry for getting back to you so late. I think these are all great points. I'm particularly interested in the following aspects, though:
Thanks! The reason I didn't frame it as such and that I included the Gothic crisis is that otherwise I fear people would just bring up general/common points such as the claim that the army size was so large etc. I feel the Gothic crisis (and the lack of an adequate response) might be an indication that there was a decline in the 4th century.
Was the Roman economy in a state of decline by the end of the 4th century, and if so did that impact the state's ability to respond to the Gothic crisis after Adrianople?
2] Why was the Roman state seemingly unable to respond effectively to the Gothic crisis after the battle of Adrianople?
