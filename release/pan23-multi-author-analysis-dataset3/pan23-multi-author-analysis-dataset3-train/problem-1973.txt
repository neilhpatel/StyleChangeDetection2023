If you take the insurance settlement, the matter is over. Full stop. You will be required to sign a release of all remaining liability to receive receive money.
In order to get the insurance money, you will have to sign a release. No release, no money. So you can't take the insurance money and then go after the guy for more. If you are not satisfied with the insurance offer, you can decline it and file a lawsuit. Either way, your measure of damages is the same, regardless of the car being special. You get the cost to repair or the FMV if the car is totaled.
You're owed either the cost to repair your car, or, if your car is totaled, you're due the current value of your car.
Lol so why cant they just pay for the car to be fixed? Maybe they spend more than the car is worth, but I didn't do anything. Why am I being financially burdened when I did nothing wrong?
If I drove drunk, yeah. You should have to be punished for being negligent. If I rear ended you trying to dodge a kid or rescue an old lady from a burning building that's one thing, but total irresponsibility from my end? People need to be held responsible.
