was the probably the first question on colonial (not conquest era) Mexico I remember getting some more attention in... forever?

So I'm not so subtly shouting out my answer here, but also /u/Vladith for asking an interesting question.
And don’t forget the /u/Klesk_vs_Xaero wrote a sixteen part answer I had to keep stopping to tell people around me all about it. They uh, sort of thank you for that I guess?
