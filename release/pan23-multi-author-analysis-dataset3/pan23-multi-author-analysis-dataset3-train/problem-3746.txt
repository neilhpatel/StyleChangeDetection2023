You said "expired". That means the patent's term has ended. Later you say "abandoned" which would mean that they applied for a patent and then gave up on it before it was awarded.
Second, abandoned makes it seem like a never issued patent. Check this. Also check to see if there are related patents that are valid.
If the patent is valid, you cannot sell an infringing product. If the patent is no longer valid then anyone can use the innovation described in the patent and nobody may patent that innovation.
Also, the patent holder may have other active patents related to the same product or other intellectual property rights besides patents.
If it's public domain, the patent submitter has no legal ability to enforce the patent. It's possible it's abandoned, but not yet public domain. If that's the case you can buy the patent, but you'd have to buy it from the competitor who presumably wouldn't sell it to you. An IP attorney can advise, but would need more details about the patent.
First, owning a patent does not give the owner the right to practice the claimed invention. Merely the right to practice exclude others. For example, if you own a patent for an improvement to something, if someone for example owns a patent for the original thing and it is valid that the improvement adds something to it might prevent your use.
Fourth, if you purchase an enforceable patent from someone with no license back clause in the agreement, you can sue the original entity/inventor that created it for infringement.
But, in answer to your question, the effect is that if you do what the patent describes, then they cannot successfully sue you for infringing this specific patent. (Unless they take some sort of action to revive the patent -- you would need a patent attorney to tell you if that's possible.).
