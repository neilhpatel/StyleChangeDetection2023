He lays out the reasoning in the report... As long as the US has a memo that says "a sitting president shall not be charged" then saying "the president committed a crime" would deny the president a right to a fair trial. That's grounds for said President to get any trial thrown out and skate on the charges. Hence, "we would say if he wasn't guilt and we're not saying that... ...".
The major fuckups here are a) having some BS memo dictating critical policy instead of laws, and b) handcuffs not waiting for Trump the second he was out of office based on the documented crimes.
And this is where a whole bunch of people forget that that Mueller was investigating the most corrupt administration in history who cock-blocked him at every turn.
Oh, I'm not blaming Mueller for that, but I'm absolutely blaming him for his refusal to say out loud any of the crimes he documented Trump committing because of a 40-year-old non-legally-binding memo.
The fact you wish Mueller had injected his own personal interpretations about obstruction into his report, or should've somehow arrested Trump despite all the above problems, is understandable. But that wasn't realistic at the time, and it certainly doesn't indicate that Mueller supported Trump and fascism. He just spoke the facts. It's Congress and the DOJ that decided to not follow up on the Mueller report.
But let's be real... WHATEVER Mueller reported, Mueller could not prosecute a sitting President. Only Congress could. And while Congress could have easily said "maybe one thinly-veiled attempt to obstruct justice can be excused, but several dozen?? get this guy out!", they didn't. Neither did the DOJ pursue the obstruction concerns after Trump's term ended.
