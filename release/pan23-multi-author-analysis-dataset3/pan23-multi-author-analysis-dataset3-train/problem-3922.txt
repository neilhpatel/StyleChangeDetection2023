Thanks for the information. I'm looking for info on the culture that may have created the lady as well as bronze age civilizations in the Iberian peninsula.
For the Iberian Bronze Age, try searching for the cultural conglomeration called the Atlantic Bronze Age, and specifically the group named after the site at El Argar.
The Dama de Elche is not bronze age -- if it is not a forgery (and I think the jury is still out on that, despite the efforts of the Spaniards), it is 4th century BCE at the earliest and probably trending more towards Hellenistic. If it is real, it is a blend of Punic, Greek, Celt-Iberian, and perhaps even Etruscan influences and was almost certainly part of a larger funerary monument of a seated figure. I would support a tentative identification of iconographic similarities with Tanit, the goddess consort of Ba'al in Punic religion.
The late . I don't have a dog in the hunt, but I also grimace a bit when an entire bloc of scholars blindly insist something is authentic because it is their beloved national treasure. And their rebuttal in Ancient Greece West and East. Lots of science has been done on the Lady, and all the experts swear it is the real deal. There were lots of supportive tests and expert testimony for the Getty kouros too, which is now in the basement vaults in Malibu, a spectacular but uncontested fake.
