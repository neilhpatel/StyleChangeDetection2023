I used to be on the data analytics side for Penny arcade and the penny arcade expo. It's rent seeking behavior.
All the law will do is just make tickets more expensive. Maybe bands will price in having their audience buy less merch because they're mad about tickets being expensive but this is just it.
The price of the ticket (usually) isn't the problem with Ticketmaster, it's the fees. I've bought tickets where the fees almost doubled the total cost. It's ridiculous and we need to regulate them away.
Okay but it’s not something that artists have a choice over. It’s either follow your dreams and link up with shitty services like Ticketmaster or be independently wealthy. Not really much of an option if you’re trying to take music seriously and make it your job.
My last band dropped $15k total on our last EP and we were still very much a local project. We went with a trusted, local producer/recording engineer, but even they were still very cheap compared to the big name studios. Any nationally/internationally touring act is spending \much\ more than that on every release cycle. It's just not feasible.
No, there's another option. Did the government buy all of the telephones when AT&T grew too big? Of course not. When a company has a monopoly, that company needs to be broken up.
