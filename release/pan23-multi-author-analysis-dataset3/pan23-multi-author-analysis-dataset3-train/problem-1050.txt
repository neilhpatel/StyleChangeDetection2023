I can't believe others comments only recommend contacting the landlord through FB or take they keys out. At the end OP needs a lawyer for help. A letter of intent can be sufficient, but keep in mind it will piss them off and OP will probably have to sue to get their deposit back if applicable.
Otherwise, you can take him to court for breaking the lease, or have a lawyer send a letter of intent. When my lawyer sent a letter of intent, it stopped pretty fast. Although, it pissed him off and now we’re having to sue for our security deposit. Some people shouldn’t be landlords.
Also, document everything. Every time and details when this happens. I was told not to withhold rent, but it could be reason to break the lease (if you want that).
Yes a paper trail seems very important so far since I technically broke the lease agreement by changing the locks. But I’ve noted everything in emails. So if anything happens hopefully that will be a good justification!
Okay. Thank you. So it looks like I should have called the police. Would I file against the actual people coming in or the landlord for sending them? I may be overthinking that section.
