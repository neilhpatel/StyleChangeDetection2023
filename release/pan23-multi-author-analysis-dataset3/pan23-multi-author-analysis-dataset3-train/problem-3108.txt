When you say that the members may be able to resurrect the condo association, are you referring to us and the neighbors as the members? Or the original members of the association? I believe that the original people who made these plans went bankrupt and they just have had nothing to do with anything in the past 30 years. It is all so confusing. We did want to just completely dissolve everything after moving in just to make life easier, but we just never moved forward with it in our time here. Our first mistake. But I don't foresee any one single person in the world caring about the association aside from the neighbor, and it is only because he thinks he can control the other side because he has lived there for so long.
I do not recall anything about CC&Rs, or signing anything to join an association. I am pretty sure it was just the condo docs for our 2 units, and the understanding that we must pay the road fee once per year for road maintenance. I will definitely have to do some digging.. Thank you! You have been very helpful.
So under our obligations as a seller, we can let the buyers know of the condo docs, and let them know that there is no true association or governing body to enforce the docs as of this time, and it would be ok?
In general, your obligation during this process is to ensure the buyers are aware of the condo association's status, and to provide documentation such as copies of the CC&Rs and the contact information for the association (if any). The buyers are responsible for abiding by the rules, and for dealing with a resurrected association or any lawsuits from the neighbours.
