Is it tampering with a witness if it’s pre investigation? Nothing has been turned into the police but it’s happening soon and she is trying to prevent it. Legally she has no precedence to share details of the record of a minor right? It’s not anything she can Google and see, she only even knows because of gossip amongst teachers when I was in school a long time back.
I am an adult now, and she moved school a year after I had her. It’s been between 5-7 years since I’ve graduated. Would i be better off reminding her that what she is doing is blackmail and seeing if the threat of bigger legal action will keep her quiet?
So she was told about my record through just gossip I’d imagine. She was near a regular teacher then.
And I’m beginning to think that’s exactly what needs to happen. It seems to fit the bill for blackmail by definition.
Well she is committing blackmail, that's one thing. You can report her to the police. That will probably blow this all up though, but it's your choice. But to be clear, are you an adult or a minor now, and do you still go to the school she teaches at?
