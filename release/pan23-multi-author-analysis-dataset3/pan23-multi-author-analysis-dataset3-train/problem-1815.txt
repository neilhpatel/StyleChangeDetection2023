This is an interesting question. You should include the area you live in for folks to have a better grasp of how laws operate in your locale. In certain States, Termination of rights do not always go hand-in-hand with a No contact Order.
The first thing you all should do is get a copy of the order. Then, figure out if the order is still in effect and if the Court does have Jurisdiction to enforce the order. If the Court has no jurisdiction, the order is not enforceable. If the Order is in effect, Courts typically require a showing that a change of circumstances has occurred when the question before them is whether to modify or rescind a no contact order (though standards may vary).
It looks like the child’s adult guardians can endeavor to lift the no contact order, but assuming they won’t be willing, your relative will need to enlist the aid of an attorney to try and have the order modified. I know a simpler solution is desired, but the situation does not lend itself to one. Your relative may be able to get free or low cost legal aid :
