You can contact your local victims advocate group about what resources are available to you. They may or may not order financial reparations if he is convicted. But victims advocates are there either way to help with expenses.
As others have said, finding victims advocacy is the first step. They can help guide you from there. They should have funds and resources to help you navigate any legal matters you want to pursue, as well as help you find mental help. They should be able to help you find someone to help you navigate the legal process that will come with testifying and being present in court when charges are bright forth on your rapist.
You could sue for costs associated with any mental help you will need, as well as any physical damages that may have occurred was a result of the sexual assault. Unfortunately, this person may not have much for you to go after... If they are convicted they may end up having even less.
I completely understand the rage you are feeling, and what feels like the loss of control over your life. I can assure you though that harming this individual will not bring you peace or control. Only working the healing process will bring you back to some sense of normalcy.
