Keep in mind, part of the reason why its worse in china is because China refuses to use the western made vaccines as boosters after finding out that their sinovac isnt as effective against the newer varients.
What are the odds that Xi and the rest of the top of the CCP are fully vaccinated with the sane western vaccines that they won't let into the country?
China should’ve bought western vaccines but there’s no $$$ to be made with those. That would’ve solved problem 1. But problem 2 still remains unless you forcibly inject people with vaccines which even the CCP doesn’t do.
Vaccines don’t have magical properties of 20-year-later effects. Long term effects would have been found during the trial stage after a few months.
There are no “delayed” effects to the covid vaccines beyond the standard 6 weeks in trials. Only some extremely rare adverse reactions that happen in this time.
Edit: for clarity, since some bumpkin can’t for the life of them understand that people may not be using the right words.
Those presented themselves immediately after getting a jab, though. Do you understand the meaning of long term?
