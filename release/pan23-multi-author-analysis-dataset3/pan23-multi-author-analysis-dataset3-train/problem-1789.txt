First Nations were not consulted before this amendment. This ban includes the SKS, which does not fit the criteria the government laid out. Along with 100’s of other firearms that don’t fit the criteria, but we’re still listed by name.
The sks is probably the most popular rifle used for hunting in remote northern indigenous communities.
And yes, if I’m hunting deer, elk or whatever else in grizzly territory I would much rather have a semi auto hunting rifle than a bolt action. Fractions of a second count when a pissed off grizzly is charging at you.
It’s an old Cold War era military surplus rifle from the Soviet block. It used to be cheap to buy, tho they’re now 3-4x the price tag they used to be. And ammunition is still relatively cheap. So in very poor and remote communities it was the rifle to buy.
I think you missed the real question - how many hunters need a semi automatic rifle? Go Canada - in Australia we instituted a similar ban decades ago and never missed them. And we effectively eliminated mass shootings. This looks like Canada is using our template.
