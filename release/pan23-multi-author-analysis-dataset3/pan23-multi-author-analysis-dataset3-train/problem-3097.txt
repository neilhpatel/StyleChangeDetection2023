Right. There is far more support of Israel than Palestine in the Democratic Party. Itâ€™s just that progressives are a lot more outspoken about their support of Palestine.
I support Israel as a Canadian NDP (Soc dem party) voter. Even though the party I vote for does not support Israel sadly. I do not like Netanyahu and I certainly think Israel has it's issues, but the human rights abuses in Palestine and the actual history of the region and the conflict make me side with Israel and it's frustrating to me that so many fellow liberals/soc dems support Palestine who mostly support Hamas ( ), hate gays, hate Jews, hate women and support endless terrorism.
As an Arab American and also an atheist and a liberal it is insane to me that in American politics the liberals support the Palestinians while the conservatives support Israel.
Meanwhile the Israelis are mostly secular, have huge gay pride parades, have a democratically elected government, freedom of the press etc... you would think liberals would naturally align.
The progressive leadership's acceptance of anti-Israel (far more than pro-palestinian) and antisemitic people makes me hesitant to throw my support behind people whose ideas and ideals I may otherwise back.
But I've been pushed out of some progressive discussions for being pro-Israel (even though I consider myself pro-both as a proponent of a two-state solution). And worse, I've been pushed out of progressive spaces, sometimes physically, for being Jewish. And it was not questionable whether that was the reason, it 100% was.
