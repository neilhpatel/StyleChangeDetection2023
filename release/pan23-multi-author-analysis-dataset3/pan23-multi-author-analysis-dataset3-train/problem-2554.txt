This isn't complex. Both your car and your house are (hopefully!) insured and it's down to the insurance company to make things right. If they believe the dealership to be responsible, then the insurers can go after them for reimbursement of the costs to do that - but that's wholly on them and nothing at all to do with you.
Yea that's what my mom's been thinking this entire time, we've basically elected to just contact the insurance company and let them deal with the dealership.
Thank you for your advice! My parents went ahead and contacted their insurance company it looks like right now their just taking information in. They have someone coming out in the next two days to pick it up and take a look at the engine to see where the fire started. After that investigation is done their gonna let the insurance company reach out to the Honda dealership. At the moment their really hesitant to reach out to the Honda dealership Incase they alter their records on what they personally did to the car. Although we do have receipts for what we paid for to be fixed.
Yea we have full coverage on the van, it sounds like the insurance company is going to contact the dealership, after they have some guy come and pick up the van and take a look at it in two days time.
