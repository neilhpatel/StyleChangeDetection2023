While we're at it, in the years since the creation of communist China, they have seized territory from (and sometimes fought wars with) nearly all of their neighbors.
But I was told by Chinese redditors that American imperialism is the problem, not them, so I’m not sure why all these countries are saying they’re defending themselves against China /s.
Because in this reality right here, after China's antics at Galwan, India's anti China stance has been greater than it has ever been before. China's constant aggression towards India throw any small possibility of Indo-Chinese collaboration right out of the window. Not to mention the fact that China has been happily arming Pakistan with the latest shit they have.
Really shows how skin-deep the knowledge reddit diplomats usually possess and still they act like they have been in the job for 20 years or something.
Honestly I wish redditors would understand geopolitics more. No country is moral, and all countries always look towards their own interests. When their interests align, alliances emerge. Thats it.
That's my point. Despite TSMC moving to Arizona, the US will continue to support Taiwan. The US isn't supporting Taiwan because of any direct benefit to the US.
