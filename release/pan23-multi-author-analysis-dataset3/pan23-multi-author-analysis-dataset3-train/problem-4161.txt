Landlord doesn't have to care about the prostitute walking in if they don't want to, assuming the door wasn't already locked. It's not their problem, and you have no recourse against them for that. If it was locked and she somehow had a key, then they may be liable for changing the locks.
Sadly we don’t remember if the door was locked or unlocked, but the doors do not have keys, they are locked via a digital passcode. It is possible she knew this passcode somehow. This is inside a “secure” complex. We were assured in the lease that the complex was secure, this was not the case.
Yes, there is no physical key to open the front door. We only have physical mail keys. There is a battery powered keypad on every door in the complex, which, when the correct code is inputted, opens the door.
There is no physical key at all to your front door and the only way to open that door is with a digital passcode?
If you think she knew your passcode, then you just go ask to get the code reset to something else, I guess.
If the door was unlocked and you're not in a secured building, then you can let the leasing office know what happened, but they were not at fault or liable for this in any way that I can see.
