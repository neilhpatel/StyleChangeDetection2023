While we're talking about deadzones, it's important to discuss that though rising sea water temperatures and acidity affects all of our oceans, many deadzones exist as a result of human overexploitation, which is to say, these deadzones bespeak a problem much greater than GHG emissions.
More than 400 "dead zones" – where aquatic life can no longer survive – existed in the world’s oceans in 2007, according to a study led by a scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, compared to 150 in 2003.
An ongoing decrease in oxygen levels underwater is an important component of the loss of marine life.
Deprived of essential oxygen, these marine areas span 245,000 square kilometres and threaten vertebrate animals, with more than a third of marine mammals affected.
Although they mostly hug coastlines, we are starting to see some dead zones stretch from the Americas into the middle of the Pacific, far from the shore.
Dead zones are mostly found off the coast of the Americas, from California to Chile. West Africa is also affected, as is the western part of Indonesia in the Indian Ocean.
