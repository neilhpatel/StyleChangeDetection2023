Where I live being a midwife is a 4 year university degree. A doula is a bit more new age and doesn’t require as much education. Most midwife’s I know were nurses first - also a 4 year program.
Just did a quick Google search. In New Zealand jt is a regulated profession and requires a bachelors degree in midwifery. I think the issue is that midwives do attend university and get this degree and need a license to practice but it may attract people who think that home births are the best way and that modern medicine is a sham. I have no issues with midwives (or potentially going to a birth Center to deliver a baby), but modern medicine has saved countless lives and the people making up the medical system have years and years of training under their belt. Also, these parents are scared blood “may” kill their child. You know what wil 1000 percent kill your child? Not having heart surgery.
It’s possible for sure. Regardless that is a fucked up situation. I cannot believe someone would rather have their baby die than receive a life saving procedure.
The issue is more complicated if the thing experts agree is safe is necessary to save your child's life.
Infants can't receive blood from most people. Not only does it have to be the correct type, but the donor also need to not have been exposed to CMV as CMV antibodies are not good for infants and they can get the infection from the blood and it can be deadly.
Political/religious beliefs should not give parents the right to neglect/abuse their kids....especially crackpot conspiracy theories. Anti-vaxxers will see this as an over-reach while conveniently ignoring how the parents were essentially sentencing their new born to death.
I know because I am CMV antibody free and the blood clinic harasses me regularily if I don't donate on a tight schedule.
