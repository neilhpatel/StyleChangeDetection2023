Chicago isn't even in the top 20 cities for violence. Per capita gun violence is much higher in red states than blue cities (which are mostly higher population than entire red states).
It matters because something like 60% of firearms related homicide is found in 2% of counties If I recall that correctly. That's a high concentration of violence in typically economically struggling urban areas with gangs being prevalent. That violence being produced by gang members fighting over drugs, territory, whatever. If you don't belong to a gang , don't deal in drugs, and or don't live in one of those counties then your chance of being caught in their fighting in drops significantly.
That's already illegal to do not just at the state but federal level. If they are crossing state lines to straw purchase or steal they are breaking the law.
You would think but organized crime in Central ,South America, Africa, parts of Eastern Europe etc.. still get arms. What results is you have basically the state and organized crime with them. Then those groups fight and at times take over whole towns and cities where the locals are caught in it or used as hostages.
