For anyone looking at this in the future, the paperwork that finally made the bank refund my money and cancel their loan was the Motor Vehicle Installment Sales Contract.
Thank you. This seemed to me something that would happen all the time. I think that the dealer probably pulled some shady shit, because the loan officer said she hadnt seen this happen in 15 years.
I have a buyer's order from the dealer that has all of their info. I also have a purchase order that the dealer sent the bank, which the bank processed, and which presumably shows the bank as the lender.
The bank has given money to the dealership on your behalf. This loan needs to be satisfied. However, the dealership cannot keep the bank's money if this was not used to fund the purchase. The dealer needs to return the money to the bank. It is possible that you may be liable for interest for the period the dealer had the money.
You could take a loan from your bank now and use it to pay off the loan you got through your dealer. This way you will only have to pay for a few days or maybe a week of the higher interest rate which should come out to a couple bucks. As a plus, the dealer will lose their bonus from whatever bank they financed you through.
