This is more detailed. Numbers are still sketchy, some sites are reporting 300+ and some \600 PLA soldiers tried to uproot an Indian outpost at 17,000 ft but failed. This was expected. I see 2 possible reasons - PLA's tried and tested salami slicing strategy OR the recent protests against Xi regime means that attention needs to be diverted towards something else. I think its the former(just speculation). This will continue to happen as India upgrades its border infrastructure with China - more roads, railway lines, airports, etc. For the next decade, India - China will have constant clashes guaranteed. China has an upper hand as of now due to better infra/supply lines and will try to coerce India from upgrading its own infra to match it.
India will eventually become the 3rd largest power in the next decade or 2, fashioning itself as the swing power that would balance out the dominant power on case-to-case basis. More conflict between India and China would mean India tipping scales towards US to balance China out.
It's a good thing the US will no longer support Chinese aggression against India like it had many times in the past.
I mean yeah India has good relations with the only country capable of defeating china. How is this a surprise to you?
