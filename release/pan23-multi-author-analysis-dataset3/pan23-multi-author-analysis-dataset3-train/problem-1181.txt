If you sign the lease you acknowledge everything in it and can’t claim negligence of the additional fees as they are obviously being disclosed in the rental agreement. I don’t know what wiggle room you may have citing the differences between the website and the lease document, but the court is going to go with what’s on the lease once you sign it.
Did you get any paperwork with your deposit? It likely says things along the lines of holding the apartment until a certain date when the lease can be signed. Unless it guarantees a lease they don’t owe you anything.
They only need to provide a lease if they have offered a commitment to lease to you, which is unusual. An application does not bind the landlord to respond or to offer you a lease, either at your terms or under others.
If you counteroffer or continue negotiating, the landlord can take the existing offer off the table. The only sure way to guarantee this offer is to accept it, and if you do so it will be of your own free will, with the terms as enforceable as they can be.
