Every week I like to identify some of "The Real Questions" of /r/AskHistorians Here, we honor the more atypical questions that get asked here: the bizarre, abnormal, strangely niche or oddly specific, interestingly worded or built on uncommon premises, or otherwise amusing questions that make me say, "Finally, someone is asking the real questions" We look at little-known customs, unexpected historical anecdotes, unusual cultural traits, and other more unique questions that go beyond the regular brand of sociopolitical history that this subreddit so fabulously covers.
Below are my entries for this week! Questions with a ‡ feature a link to an older answer(s) instead of or along with a direct reply. What do you think were the realest questions this week?
Every week we get some fascinating questions that struggle to get answers. Sometimes experts just don’t have time, or perhaps they just don’t come across them in the first place. This is a chance to shout them out, draw some more attention to them, and inspire others. Feel free to post your own!
That wraps us up for the week. Enjoy all the good history and keep asking great questions. Keep it classy out there community folks, and I’ll see you next week!
