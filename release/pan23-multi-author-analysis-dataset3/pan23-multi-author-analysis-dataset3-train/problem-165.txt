Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.

What would you have the west do instead? Think about it? Invade Russia? Putin just lines the people up to die. Send mean letters to him? What? Honestly, what the fuck is the west supposed to do to help the people of Russia? Your leadership is totally fucking insane. Even your comment, while I sympathize with you greatly, I also feel the need to contest it - the west is trying. If the rest of the world does nothing, then eventually in the world lives like you are. If your country changes for the better, then no one needs to live like this. Do you hear the crazy shit they are spouting? Embrace death? Seriously, you're unhappy about western sanctions when your leadership is telling you to embrace DEATH? No one understands this, it's crazy. We watch military leaders beat the piss out of their own men for retreating from the front line, where they were being ground into hamburger meat, with little training, rubber boots and armed only with an idea of what they were doing... Sent to die for something none of them believe in. You see, this is why this is crazy. Its inhumane. You aren't animals. You aren't worthless. You are human beings. No one should be able to treat you like this, no one should be allowed to tell you to die. No one should spare your life for their yacht. You are entitled to free will.
