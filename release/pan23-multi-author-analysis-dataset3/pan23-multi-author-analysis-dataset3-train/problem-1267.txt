Regarding your last question, while you did not specify your location, it is safe to assume your sister is "judgment-proof", meaning she has no assets that are not exempt from being seized through a judgment. She is entitled to keep her car and some minimum amount of cash, furniture, etc.
From the facts you describe, the plaintiff's case sounds challenging, far from solid. But if your sister is in fact sued (you mentioned a "subpoena" but I assume you mean a complaint), you have no choice but to get an attorney to defend the case.
But if they also sue the partner, and allow the court to throw out that claim, then the other defendants can no longer try to shift liability onto her.
Typically lawsuits of this nature cast a wide net and allow the courts to determine the liability of each defendant.
Unfortunately these types of cases tend to drag on for years and years. A counterclaim may be necessary to provide sufficient ammunition to reach an early settlement and be able to move past it quickly. Your sister absolutely needs a lawyer.
If she is actually being sued, then she needs to see a lawyer. They're suing her at all when she doesn't have any current money and doesn't have insurance that could pay a claim. That sort of case is brought based on emotion, not because they have a winning claim. Based on what you've said so far, it should be a fairly easy thing for the lawyer to get the case dismissed.
Who is the plaintiff in the lawsuit -- is it the boyfriend's parents? Do they have a lawyer? Or are they doing themselves? Frankly, it sounds a bit like they're acting out of grief and are not being rational here.
