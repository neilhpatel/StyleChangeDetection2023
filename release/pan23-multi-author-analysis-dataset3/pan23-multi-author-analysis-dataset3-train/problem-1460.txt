You want to compare Japanese and American culture first. Japanese is a homogenous ruthlessly hierarchical and communitarian society. Even if gun ownership was more permisive, there gun homicide rate would be disproportionately low compared to the US.
In the US the gun homicide rate had declined throughout the 90,s 2000,s, 2015 saw a slight uptick, and 2020 saw a huge increase but still below the pre 1990's levels.
That gun-per-capita ratio in the U.S. nonetheless managed to increase significantly since the 1990s, and so did the gun homicide rate.
You can look up incidents per capita of nearly any violent crime (even not necessarily involving guns) and it's higher in the US.
The link you posted only mentions Australia once- and its a statistic about the percentage of homicides that are committed using a gun. Not a particularly useful metric in general, and has absolutely nothing to do with your claim that "Gun Laws Worked for Australia".
You made the claim that gun laws worked for Australia, I posted links to research papers that showed that didn't really have much of effect.
The question you are asking (and its answer) does nothing to support the claim that you made that Australians Gun Laws "worked". To show that they worked you would need to show that there was a significant difference before/after the implementation of the law.
