Why do the Russians need so many foreign fighters? With a population of over 145M citizens, you’d think they could resource their own soldiers. Or, do they simply want others to die so Russians don’t have to?
Putin made sure, that Russians will die out in a few decades. Low birthrate, too many old people, most young men are dead or drunk. Russia has no future.
There's no loyalty to Russia. There's some fanboying going around, yes, but that's about it. Russia and China, however, have showed their support towards Serbia on the question of Kosovo, and now Serbia needs to act neutral if they want to retain those UN vetos.
NATO has been in conflict with Yugoslavia in 1999, and many European countries have recognized the breakaway state of Kosovo after the late 2000s. So why are you surprised that Russia and China are taking the opportunity to extend their friendship to Serbia, whether under false pretenses or not? As an example, Russia is waging war on Ukraine, and is anyone surprised by the drastic shift of Ukraine towards the west and a great push for friendly relations and strong alliances with NATO?
Serbia has also never backed up Russia in this war as as far as I know, they have actually done the opposite thing and condemned the war in several UN resolutions and have joined the EU sanctions on Belarus for their role in supporting Russia in the war. The only “support” they have offered Russia is not placing sanctions on them, however this does not necessarily mean that it is because they support them in the war, rather you also have to take into account the Serbian energy industry which is solely dependent on Russia and Russian gas.
Its not black and white but I certainly can’t see where Serbia is supporting Russia, rather I see that they are more alligned with the West regarding their stance in this war, except in some cases where they have no other choice (e.g no other gas alternatives).
