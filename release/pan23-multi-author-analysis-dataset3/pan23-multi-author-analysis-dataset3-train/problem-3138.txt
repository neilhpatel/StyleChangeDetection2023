I think after this we might actually see a revolution in Turkey. One thing is when government steals money, another thing is when your long life friend or a family member dies, and the government is at fault. Even if they didn't cause the earthquake they are accountable for the amount of improperly constructed buildings for such an environment, let alone suppressing any amount of help effort by blocking social media to its citizens. The Turkish people have to seriously consider getting a new leader, hopefully one not as corrupt as Erdogan.
It sounds like your colleague suffers from the same inflated ego that Erdogan suffers from...he should probably psychologically prepare himself for a change, come May.
I don't know about that, but I do know that he leans on the Anatolian portion of his electorate for his strongest support. Which ironically, is the part that has been affected by the earthquake the most.
I guess if you want to get semantic you can say the second quake was a triggered earthquake. But for all intents and purposes, it's basically an aftershock. The fault line probably overlaps with the aftershock cloud. It's one of the reasons sometimes an aftershock can be larger than the principal quake.
Aftershocks are never larger than the primary seismic event. Any events related to the most energetic release are referred to as either foreshocks or aftershocks. Also, it appears at this time that the 7.5 event is a separate rupture with its own set of aftershocks but that designation may change as the event is studied more thoroughly.
