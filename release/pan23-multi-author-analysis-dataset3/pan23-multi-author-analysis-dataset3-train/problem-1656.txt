Is this essentially a fascist declaration of opposition to democracy or is there some pretext involved?
One thing I am adamant in not letting the GOP get away with is smearing the process of recounting votes - which IMO is a vital part of democratic elections.
So wait, you are saying they are making it impossible to count the votes so they can blame Democrats for not counting the votes?
Let them play there stupid games ultimately it ends up disenfranchising there own voters and possibly nullifying the votes in the district. If they do not back down they will find themselves buried in lawsuits from both the state and voters of the district.
If the votes aren't certified by the Dec 5th deadline the county's votes will be excluded from the official count, per state laws. Someone theorized they are doing it deliberately so they can claim that this is proof the Dems (led by Hobbs) are commiting voter fraud by "ignoring" the votes of a county that is heavily Republican, neglecting (of course) to mention that this action is required by law.
