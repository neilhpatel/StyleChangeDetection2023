You will be presumed to be the father even after divorce until you do paternity in court to prove youâ€™re not the father.
Since your wife is pregnant and she's still married to you, you are considered that child's legal father. However, you can submit a motion to the court to revoke your paternity and consider the child to be born outside of the marriage (as if the mother was single). It's called a ROPA (Revocation of Paternity Act) motion.
This type of motion needs to be filed BEFORE the baby turns three years old, otherwise it can get very difficult to fix. You don't have to rush through the divorce now if you're not ready, however, whether you start it ASAP or a year or two down the line, your attorney will mention this issue as one of the things that must be addressed during the divorce. There will be a hearing on it, and if your wife is still pregnant at the time, the judge may want to delay your final divorce hearing until the baby is born. However, it depends on the judge, I've been able to get some divorces finalized even though the child wasn't born yet.
And many, if not most, jurisdictions will not allow you to complete your divorce while your soon to be ex-spouse is pregnant, whether or not you are the father.
I think the question about rushing a divorce was because he thought there would be no presumed paternity if the divorce was complete prior to the birth. Since that's not true and it is the marital status at time of conception that is relevant, I'd have thought it was actually better to wait until after the birth (unless the mother is willing to do a prenatal paternity test) so that paternity and divorce can be dealt with at the same time? I am not a lawyer though.
