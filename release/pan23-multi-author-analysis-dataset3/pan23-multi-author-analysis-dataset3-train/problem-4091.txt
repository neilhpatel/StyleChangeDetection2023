not surprising to me at all, in Vietnam we don't say what we think, we say what will cause no conflict. I don't know if my government agree or disagree with russia, but i do agree with them that abstaining will avoid any and all problems.
Yeah, I don't think people realize how big a threat a dissolved Russia would be. Russia has the most nuclear weapons in the world, by like a lot. There are THOUSANDS of nuclear weapons at stake.
I've read that it takes a lot of time, science, and money to maintain nuclear weapons. Constant upkeep. They're not just like an AK 47 you put in a crate and take out 30 years later and it still works.
Added to that, the recent poor performance of Russia's "top of the line" equipment (the Moskva? and that new tank thing) that just failed completely on the battlfield, lead me to believe that Russia's nuclear capabilities are far, far less than what we perceive.
The nuclear arsenal was one thing the Russians did value, but they are likely in disrepair. Then again, you don't really need working ICBMs for a warhead to be dangerous. Even losing track of 10% of the warheads they claim they have would be a nightmare.
Before the war they stockpiles were subject to inspections from the US. Mostly to oversee decommissioning and numbers. But as a side effect, Russia would probably still maintain some inventory of well maintained nukes for the inspection.
