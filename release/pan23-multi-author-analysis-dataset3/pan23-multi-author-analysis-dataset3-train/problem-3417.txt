This headline is frankly, nonsense. Democrats didn't win because of Biden; we won in spite of Biden and namely due to the major blunders by opposition handed to Democrats on a silver-platter. Huge difference. On the eve of the midterms, Biden was polling 39% with independents, 85% with Democrats (should never be below 90), and 5% with Republicans with an overall aggregate approval of 40-42%. DO NOT falsely believe that this midterm win was because of Biden, it wasn't. It was because Gen Z showed up and were energized about (1) Abortion, (2) Preserving Democracy from election deniers, and (3) Climate Change. Don't rely on such a court decision to be thrown into the lap of Democrats in 2024. You'll need a better candidate that is authentic, charismatic, visionary, and younger â€” that's what sells in competitive elections for Democrats historically.
100% agree. See my write-up above. Biden should step down, or he should be primaried. (Keep in mind, if it comes down to it I'll vote for Biden but I don't think he's electable against anyone other than Trump, which isn't a high bar to clear).
Personally I think we're better off running Biden, which gives the DNC 4 more years to prepare a 2028 candidate. Right now the only viable candidates I'm aware of are ones who lost pretty strongly to Biden in 2020, or who are not much younger.
If Biden runs in 2024 as an 82-year-old and the GOP nominee is anyone but Trump, then that spells disaster for Democrats.
I just wish and hope Biden isn't the nominee. He will not win against DeSantis if that's who the GOP chooses. I think he'll win against Trump, but DeSantis is another beast. We'll need someone younger on our side to run as well if the GOP dumps Trump.
