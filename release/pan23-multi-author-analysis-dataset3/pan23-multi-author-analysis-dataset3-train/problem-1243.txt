for years i had thought that the Republicans would never overthrow Roe because I saw it as a massively dumb political move to actually follow thru on.
This probably (or didnâ€™t) taught the Rs that taking over in 2024 and making abortion federally illegal will lead to their party never holding a majority or the White House again. Thankfully, the media was wrong that the public would forget about the Dobbs decision. A little hope was restored on Tuesday, but the fight goes on until Roe and access to safe legal abortions are federally protected.
It's more referring to the fact that every ballot measure on abortion went in favor of women's rights to choose, even in deep red states. It's not talking about the Senate votes. People still voted for Republicans while voting against abortion bans and pro-life nonsense.
Agreed, what I object to is the politics like "Abortion rights voters delivered several key elections for Democrats. Now Democrats had better deliver for them" when Republicans also voted that way.
I am not commenting on the abortion issue, just this guy's take on the election results. GOP could declare a "clear mandate" as well.
LOL, a crystal-clear message from a 50-50 split in the midterms. Pushing an agenda from a false pretense is part of the problem.
