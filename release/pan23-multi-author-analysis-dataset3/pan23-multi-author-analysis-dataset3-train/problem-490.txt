Your friend should have been covered under their required Massachusetts auto insurance or alternately was required to purchase insurance from U-Haul prior to being allowed to rent the truck. Your friend needs to file an insurance claim with the appropriate insurer.
Then she just needs to talk to their insurance and wait to be reimbursed for all her stuff. She only needs legal advice if the insurance doesn't pay out fairly and she needs to chase it there.
Eg if your list says "Microwave", you'll get the cheapest, bog-standard microwave they can find. If you had a "2kW blast-o-watt microwave with integrated toaster, pizza oven, and pretzel-twister" then they need to replace it with either that model or one that is equivalent. Similarly if you say "cutlery" you'll get a basic pack of the most standard cutlery they can find.
As an aside, tell her to take her time and report every little detail about the things she owns, and not to just put "cutlery". It's amazing how quickly $5 t-shirts and $2 plates add up to a significant sum, but insurers will do the minimum they can get away with.
