I’m an attorney, but not your attorney and this is not legal advice. If you have a concern you should consult an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction. I am also a licensed real estate broker (currently inactive since I moved out of state).
I’m a realtor, not licensed in your state, not your realtor, and this is not real estate advice. I just did a quick check, and it looks like Texas is what’s called a “non-disclosure” state AKA actual price that the home sold for is not public. When you say one of the comp houses sold for $789,000, was that maybe the listing price and then it ended up selling for $897,500 after negotiations? I’ve heard stories about the texas market and in some areas a $100,000 increase isn’t unheard of.
Unfortunately it sounds like your agent took the seller’s CMA at face value instead of running their own for you. You could maybe try to argue your agent wasn’t acting in your best interest, but if you agreed to the price without a competing CMA or an appraisal that’s likely going to come back to your own due diligence.
But considering you had your own professional representation (Redfin Agent) and the opportunity to do your own due diligence (could've hired a property appraiser), I don't see anything coming from it, but IANAL.
