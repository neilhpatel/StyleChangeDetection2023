That they were antifa rioters who were trying to delay Biden from getting into office because they wanted four more years of Trump?
We all know Trump and his supporters launched a insurrection to overthrow our democracy and keep Trump in power by refusing to certify Biden.
You know it happened we all do. It's just getting pathetic people down playing it or throw conspiracies around.
You know, I think it's because they were incompetent morons they got this far to begin with. Anyone smarter would've failed because they are literally not simple enough to talk to and relate to the MAGA morons. They're on a different spectrum of stupid that's hard to fake, and if they got that far they would've got in their own way by thinking of the consequences overcomplicating it trying to Actually hide it. They fail because theyd overestimate people's intelligence...
But Trump? It happened because they didnt think of the consequences or care about being public about the whole thing, allowing them to all grow more brazenly confident and loud.
