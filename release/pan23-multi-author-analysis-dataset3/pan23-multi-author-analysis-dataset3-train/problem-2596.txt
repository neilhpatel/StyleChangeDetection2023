I feel like no one even read the article that it was or is under Russian control and it was being shelled while Reuters cannot conform who shelled it.
And how dumb everyone was being for assuming either ukraine had control of the plant or that the Russians were bombing themselves.
So do you believe they are shelling themselves as a false flag or do you believe Ukrainian soldiers are in control of the plant?
If you remember at Chernobyl it was Ukrainians stationed in the power plant and Russians had to dislodge them. And ukraine was loudly crying foul about how dangerous it was for Russian rockets be landing near the plant.
Based on the direction shells fell there, IAEA determined in their report that rockets arrived from Russia occupied territories, so here's that.
The IAEA, while inspecting the Russian controlled plant, where shelled by Russian artillery that could only have come from Russian controlled areas (which they also found). So, yes, the Russians are pulling a false flag attack, as they routinely have done since before Putin came to power. In fact it's how Putin came to power.
