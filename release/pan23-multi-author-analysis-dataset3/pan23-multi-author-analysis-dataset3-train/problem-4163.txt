I mean it’s important to work hard if it aligns with your goals. The difference is without the external factors, all the hard work won’t matter.
But for the other 8 billion, success is Luck x Effort. If you’re real unlucky, even borderline infinite effort will leave you fucked. But unless you’re super lucky, lack of effort will also fuck you. Any number times 0 is 0, on either side.
Millennial, grew up rural and started out concerningly right wing (no surprise there), ended up libertarian by the end of college and progressive by the end of grad school.
polling is pretty consistent, the "south park Republicans" the millennials were supposed to be lost their right wing positions shortly after turning 20, same thing happened to gen Z. The ones that stayed right wing are some of the most extreme we've seen in a while, which is what happens when everyone you're age disagrees with you.
The argument I’ve seen is that you don’t become more conservative, you stay about the same while the world becomes more liberal until things go “too far” and now you’re conservative.
