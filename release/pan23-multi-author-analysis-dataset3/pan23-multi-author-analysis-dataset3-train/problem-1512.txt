West/US says to condemn Russia, but doesn’t give any evidence that it will aid India if it comes to its only issues. Rather as recent as last year US has been arming Pakistan with F16s. Pakistan and India have had armed conflicts what 3 times already?
During the Indo-China War in 1962, no foreign countries provided direct military aid to India. However, India did receive diplomatic support and expressions of concern from several countries including the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union in particular provided India with military hardware, including fighter jets and tanks, and offered to mediate the dispute between India and China.
It’s about diplomacy and historical ties. India has had strong ties with both then Soviet Union and now Russia. And India relies a lot of Russian military equipment as its surrounding China and Pakistan.
If you know anything about Indias history and it’s relationship with its Allies - you would know how difficult it would be for New Delhi to do anything about Russia.
Again India is free to align themselves with anyone they want, close relations between India / Russia are well known. Its not an excuse to ignore atrocities though and reflects poorly on India so criticism is valid. In fact since you want the war to stop you should welcome the criticism and use whatever means you have to strenhen the message.
