According to this source, you must opt-in to any autorenewal greater than 1 month with a signature or initials on an autorenewal clause. If your lease doesn't contain such a clause with your signature, then it is unenforceable by state law.
Where a lease provides for automatic renewal of the lease unless prior notice is given by the party seeking to terminate the lease, that renewal provision must be distinctly set apart from the other provisions of the lease, and space must be provided for tenant's written acknowledgment of that provision. Without tenant's signature, initials or witnessed mark, the landlord may not enforce the automatic renewal clause. The validity of the rest of the lease is not affected by the absence of tenant's acknowledgment of the automatic renewal clause.
Are you SURE the lease didn't provide for auto-renewal? This is quite common and you may have missed it and not realized it was in there. But if you have read your copy and you didn't agree to it, then he should return your deposit. If he doesn't though, you'll have to sue him in small claims court.
The good news is though in a lot of states you can sue for more than the actual deposit, in many cases twice the deposit is what he'd owe you. Plus your court costs (which is not much for small claims).
Sounds like you have a great case. If you don't want to actually file, I'd at least send the landlord a copy of your lease and the law saying he'd owe you 2X the deposit (or whatever, but know that treble damages means two times as much not three times as much). Ask him to show you where you agreed to auto renew and if he can't then he can explain to the judge why he doesn't owe you a refund. Seems pretty straightforward to me. Good luck to ya.
