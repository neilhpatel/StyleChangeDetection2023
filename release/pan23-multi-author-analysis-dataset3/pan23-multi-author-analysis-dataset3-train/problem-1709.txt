Landowning in Britain, especially circa 1910, was a big deal. Typically when discussing landowners we're talking about Peers (ie, people with noble titles), and the "landed gentry", who technically speaking are commoners, but effectively just below the aristocrats. British peers also have a system of ranking - the head of the Crawley family is an earl, which is basically mid-pack (not a Duke, but not a Viscount), and there would have been about a hundred or so in the UK at the time.
The second son (third child) of the (eventual) Duke of Marlborough was Winston's dad Randolph, so he had a courtesy title of "Lord" but wasn't a hereditary peer. He did do some journalism and had a political career (as did his son). In both cases they still were definitely among the upper class and would better be thought of as landed gentry (in Winston's case he ended up buying Chartwell and some neighboring farmland which he unprofitably farmed).
But that actually makes it sound a lot more neat and defined than things actually were. Both groups were living off of rents income. A member of the gentry could end up owning far more property than peers. Also given how inheritance of titles worked, plus intermarriage, there was an awful lot of overlap between the two groups even within sets of families, and both together were effectively the upper class.
Seems to indicate that Americans marrying into the British aristocracy around the turn of the century was common and a significant source of income for many of these families. Certainly in the show it is important. How accurate is this though? You mention it wasn't unheard of, but could you go further and say that it was extremely common?
