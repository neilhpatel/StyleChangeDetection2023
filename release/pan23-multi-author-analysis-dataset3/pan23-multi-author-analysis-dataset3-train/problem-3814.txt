Proof of what, exactly? Hunter Biden isn't a government employee. He doesn't serve in any office, or is even a candidate for anything. Not even Dog Catcher. So proof that he has an addiction problem and a big willy? Um... so what?
What the heck? Some people confuse dangerous contrarianism for the sake of contrarianism with noble behavior.
Edit: so I guess I just had the wrong idea about taibbi. Apparently he’s been scuzzy for years and only enjoyed a brief period of journalistic integrity.
Am I crazy or did Matt Taibbi used to be a pretty decent Rolling Stone journalist who spent most of the early 2000s taking it to Bush, Cheney, conservative GOP politicians? Now he’s on Substack doing this bullshit with Elon? Feels like I missed a plot point or two.
I've missed the whole point of this huge scandal. The story was out on lots of other sources. Why is this a story? If Twitter decided not to cover it, so what? The story should always be whatever is on the laptop, though why a drug addict's lost laptop is a big deal is just sad. Also a lawyer, and this has nothing to do with the First Amendment. Twitter is not required to post the contents of someone's stolen or found laptop. The story was published in the New York Post and other places. Go read about it there if you want. The Post is seeing lots of comments about this being "proof" of a rigged election. But the story was out in the world, just not on Twitter. Maybe Elon could explain why Twitter did not cover the story about Trump anal-raping a tied-down 16-year-old girl at an Epstein party? How did the victim's lawsuit just go away? If you were Trump, wouldn't you have fought it (if you were innocent)? Did the Russian mafia settle the case for Trump? Did Trump try to replicate that act in Moscow and that is the real video held by Putin? "Pee-Pee tape" is just a code name.
