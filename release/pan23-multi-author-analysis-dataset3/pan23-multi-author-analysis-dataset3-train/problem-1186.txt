Me seeing everywhere that Modi wants to shut documentary down and trying to forbid people from watching: Oh we're watching this!
They can't openly publicize the documentary, so they try to ban it, causing more Indians to watch and support Modi more, because most Indians genuinely support Modi for his actions in Gujarat Riots.
Modi's government has labelled the documentary, which questioned his leadership during deadly riots in his home state of Gujarat in 2002, as a "propaganda piece", blocked its airing and also barred sharing of any clips via social media in India.
The Caravan has obtained a copy of an inquiry conducted by the government of the United Kingdom into the 2002 Gujarat violence, which was cited in a recent BBC documentary on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, titled India: The Modi Question. The report states that the violence was “planned, possibly in advance” by Vishva Hindu Parishad, a Hindu nationalist organisation. The report notes: “The attack on the train at Godhra on 27 February provided the pretext. If it had not occurred, another one would have been found.”.
The report cites evidence for stating the violence was pre-planned: “Police contacts confirmed that rioters used computerised lists to target Muslim homes and businesses. The accuracy and detail of the lists, including businesses with minority Muslim share-holding, suggest that they were prepared in advance.”.
