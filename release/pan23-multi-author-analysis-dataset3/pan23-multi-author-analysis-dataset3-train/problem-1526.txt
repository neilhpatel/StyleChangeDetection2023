When we sat down I asked him if he knew what time it was. He looked up at the clock and told me. And I said thanks, I appreciate it. Not sure if he got the joke or not.
Vehicle Code 21751 VC mandates that drivers pass to the left of center only when there is sufficient clearance. Vehicle Code 21752 VC prohibits drivers from overtaking and passing on the left in specific circumstances.
Could you personally think of a reason why they would want to dismiss the reason that gave them probable cause?
Is it possible that the citation was dismissed for some other reason, such as being part of a deal that included your guilty plea?
It's also possible it was dismissed if it was included in your criminal charges as part of a plea deal.
Sure: because they had negotiated a plea and part of the negotiation was dropping the traffic charge.
You should remember, though, that they donâ€™t need to find you guilty of the traffic charge to make the stop valid. The stop is valid if the officer merely had probable cause, which is a low bar to reach.
For probable cause and a legal stop the police need "a reasonable basis for believing that a crime has been committed". That means they aren't required to write a ticket for the original infraction, they could ultimately be mistaken about going over the center line occurring and the stop is still legal.
