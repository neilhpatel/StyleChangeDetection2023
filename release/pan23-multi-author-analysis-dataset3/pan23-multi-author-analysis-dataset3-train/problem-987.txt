That's true and all but in Russia most people dont feel this way, so repeating this over and over is meaningless. If you don't understand that Russia sees a Western-aligned Ukraine as an existential threat than you will never realize that this war isn't going to end well for anyone until it's too late.
I’m saying I don’t really believe the Russian leadership’s claims that the Ukraine war is primarily about security (even if most of the Russian populace does think that). It looks like a naked grab for land and glory to me—that and putting the Ukrainians in their place for daring to want to chart a different course from Russia.
For anyone thinking “we better not help ukraine defend themselves because Russia might be annoyed that they can’t invade and steal stuff”.
The time will also give Ukraine an opportunity to join NATO and install the best of defences/deterrents.
If NATO supply Ukraine weapons sooner rather than later, that it uses on Russian Territory (thereby crossing Putin’s red lines), Russia has said it will go nuclear.
At the same time as the ceasefire, Ukraine and its allies states that it will not broach the Ukraine/Russian(Donbas) border until Russia voluntarily hands it back to Ukraine in the future.
Why then does NATO, Ukraine, and it’s allies not just give Russia the Donbas in exchange for a ceasefire and the return of all Ukrainians who want to migrate west of the Donbas into Ukraine?
HOWEVER, Ukraine also informs Russia that it, and it’s allies will continue, and ever increase a stranglehold on all that Russia strives for, and that that no sanction will be lifted until Russia signs over the Donbas and Crimea back into Ukraine’s possession.
I strongly believe Putin is that desperate enough for a win, and that arrogant that Russia can survive ever increasing sanctions, that he would trade an permanent ceasefire for the Donbas and Crimea.
