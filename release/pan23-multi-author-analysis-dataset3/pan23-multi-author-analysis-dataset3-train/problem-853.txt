Videos in the years before the invasion show Russia using western precision rifles to engage Ukrainians. Oddly enough it was funny to see how well put together that small Russian team of soldiers were compared to what we are seeing now.
I remember seeing photos of Russian troops years ago, maybe even before Crimea, of them running AKs with Western optics like Aimpoint and EOTech and thinking "That doesn't seem very kosher? What about all the export laws we have?".
Yeah. They're mostly on a couple of test ranges. We've seen 20-ish at one time in the May Day parade and we've seen a few from other production runs out being tested because Russian recruits have no cellphone camera discipline. At least 30, maybe as many as 50. Not enough to outfit a unit and because they're using a completely different platform than their predecessors they need to be in their own unit for the Russian style "push" logistics to work.
The Soviet Union put a massive share of its economy into military production The Russian Federation? Not so much. They never spent the money to produce large amounts of ammo when there wasn't an immediate need for it. And now? Now there's no time to get the machines to ramp up production, since the old ones rusted away to nothing.
