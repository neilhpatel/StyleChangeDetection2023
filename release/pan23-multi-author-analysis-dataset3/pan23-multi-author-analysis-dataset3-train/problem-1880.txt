Fight back by killing random civilians? Itâ€™s not a tit for tat game dude we are talking about real lives. The IDF is doing a lot of fucked ip things but that in no way justified terrorists attacks against random people.
And yes, Israel kills people, usually in response to terrorist attacks. If the attacks would stop, so would the army raids.
The land generally belongs to the state of Israel (which is how it was under the ottomans, and continued under the British and Israelis) . About 90% of the land is state land, and leased out for Jews, Arabs and anyone else.
It is Palestinian land, not Israeli land. No Israelis have a right to bulldoze down Palestinian homes to make Palestinian land their home and the entire international community opposes these illegal Israeli settlements.
Israel actually offered peace plans that would dismantle almost every one of those settlements and the Palestinians refused them.
Israel offered almost the entire West Bank and the entire Gaza, including the dismantling of all but the largest settlements, with land swaps offered for those settlements.
