IMHO it depends on what you're doing. Living room/den? 2700 absolutely. Work/study room? You want that 5-6000 light to keep you alert and focused. (Has more blue light).
Daylight lighting at night keeps you awake, because it contains a lot of blue. It should be yellowish or orange.
Here in the North, the yellow lights are very common. Some streetlights are downright orange, but that's more a coincidence due to the filament emissions spectrum than something that was desired.
Same goes with computer screens, now that we have software the make the screen go more yellow towards evening and orange at night by removing the blue. Helps to sleep better. Personally, I'm very concious of what temperature lights I buy, and I always go for 2700K-3000K.
Ofc you can switch to heating belts but if the alternative is throwing away perfectly fine bulbs, it's better to keep using them.
Granted, nowhere near all of those will replace incandescent lightbulbs. LED lights aren't exactly new, and CFL ones before them were almost as efficient, but not all households will spend their evenings with the entire family gathered under one light in the living room, either.
