Apart from the rift that has formed on the right (Donnie Moscow announced he’s running much to the chagrin of the GOP establishment, lol), there are several vulnerable seats held by the GOP that will very likely flip blue. Additionally, young voters have finally begun to vote (in a midterm for Pete’s sake!) and Boomers are dying fast, Republican Boomers are dying at double the rate of Democrat boomers. The desperate lunge for the Supreme Court was a result of the looming reality that increasingly Republicans won’t be winning elections any more.
Unless gop can actually overturn democracy, they’re just going to continue losing. Esp if we do ranked choice.
Despite gop gerrymandering and voter suppression they Still lost more than they won, and the greater majority of US is against the gop bullshit fascism.

Just ask the southern democrats about how quickly the south forgot about the federal overturning of Jim Crow.
