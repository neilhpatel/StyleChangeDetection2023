That is, a Democrat willing to flagrantly rule in a manner that is intolerant of intolerance. This is the only solution because Republican's are not going to change on their own, they must be forced.
That means that either the individual's rights (as enforced by the National government) must win over state's rights to self govern, or the reverse. If one assumes that the Supreme Court will favor state's rights, then debasing the Court is the necessary action the National government must take to continue upholding individual rights against the will of some set of states.
The real solution is a much more vigorous Democrat in 2024, who is willing to crush "state's rights" and ignore the Supreme Court in order to secure the liberties of every individual.
And they likely WANT this to be challenged up to the Supreme Court so that the Conservative court can declare that, despite all precedent, the First Amendment only applies to actual speech. (Until a later ruling when they decide that certain kinds of speech that the right doesn't like isn't covered by the First Amendment.).
That's what this will be. They will keep writing new laws. each a little different. Each with the same goal. Until they find one that the SC finally gives up and decides not to hear the case - allowing the law to stand.
I would think a case will eventually make its way to the Supreme Court. Don't see how you can ban someone from wearing a certain type of clothes, makeup or wigs in the United States. Seems like a major overstep by a state government that limits freedoms.
