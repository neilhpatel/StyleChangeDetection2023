The gate will lock from the inside, the contractor is adding a lock to the existing setup so my daughter can't get out of the yard and end up in the street or someone else's driveway. I also want the yard to be safe and comfortable before her.
The backyard does have a 6 foot high fence around it (all the yards here do). I was planning on having cameras up so I'd be able to keep an eye on my daughter when she is mobile but it's a good suggestion and I appreciate it.
It was all self done. Nothing they gave my contractor is from a lawyer. The granding in my yard is staying the same, everything here is flat and there is a proper permit for the removal. Their claim is that the old owner let everyone use the pool and that set a precedent for their enjoyment.
The old owner gave them permission to swim in the pool. That is called a license. A license is revokable at any time by the licensor. Once the previous owner ceased ownership in the property, the license was revoked by operation of law, as the licensor did not have rights in the property to continue to give to the licensee.
