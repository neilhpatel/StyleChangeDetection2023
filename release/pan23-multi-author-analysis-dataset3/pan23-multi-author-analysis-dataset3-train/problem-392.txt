Not that protest bullshit that Replications like to call riots -- but real ones, comprised of people violently targeting shipment trains and stores.
We are in a position where about 20% of Americans physically can't handle 30% sales tax (effectively 40+% when you add in state and local taxes too). They can't pay what they don't have, but they still need essentials.
I think a 30% sales tax -- which would effectively be 40-45% after state and local taxes -- could actually tip the scales and lead to true riots.
They want people to pay 30% on every purchase ($30 for every $100 spent) but are trying to pass it off as a 23% tax because $30 tax divided by $130 is 23%.
"Hey, did you know that Republicans want to put in a 30% sales tax to raise money for the government? That would add $1.20 per gallon to the cost of gasoline. Do you really support Republicans?".
Yea. People forget WV was/is the last bastion of the old southern democrats. Senator Byrd voted against the civil rights act and he was in office until 2010.
