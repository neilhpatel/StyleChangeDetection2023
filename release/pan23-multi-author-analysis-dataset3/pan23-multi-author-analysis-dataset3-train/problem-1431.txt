I just read that article, and his behavior is that of a crooked cop. How do I know that? Because as a lifelong resident of Knox county, I remember when Tim Burchett was investigated by the FBI for misappropriation of funding when he was the Sheriff. He quietly stopped running for Sheriff after that, and then had the internet scrubbed of all the local news articles about it before he took his next job in congress. It used to be all over google and it completely disappeared except for a Jewish publication about it.
Okay my bad, I did read the article completely and here’s a complimentary link of his investigation by the fbi and blaming his ex-wife for working with them against him. Oooops. I would say you’re a bot but clearly you’re a Republican.
Which means there were republicans that were doing it. I can't remember the last time they accused the dems of something that they themselves weren't actually doing.
Also, I wouldn't care if any of them did. If you told me I had to sit in that room for four days while a bunch of toddlers through temper tantrums, I might also need a drink.
