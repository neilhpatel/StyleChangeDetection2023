Believe me I’m making comments like this to someone I know that’s in his circle. Telling him that trump is a winner and winners would run for President regardless of party. Unfortunately unlike trump, this guy is really smart and just laughs and tells me to go fuck my mom (he’s a gentleman). Lmao!
Yeah he’s a brilliant ruthless businessman. So naturally he should take the brightest talents with him to his MAGA party. It just makes natural sense for the man with the worlds largest hands and the best temperament. I mean hes got a son who’s a computer expert!
Yup, I’m all about saying that he won’t because he’s a coward. Only winners run on a third party. If he doesn’t it shows that he needs the Republicans party.
So even if Republicans aren't working against him, they clearly aren't eager to support him anymore.
The alternative, losing the GOP nomination and "giving up" and accepting the country hates him, is worse than running 3rd party.
He knows he can’t win as an independent, so this is a way of saying “make me the GOP candidate or I’ll destroy your chances of winning out of revenge”.
