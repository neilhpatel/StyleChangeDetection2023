IMHO, the collapse of the insects' population has little to nothing to do with climate change. The latter is caused by greenhouse gases, while the former seems to be caused by something, or many things, that is/are toxic to insects. Theoretically, we can get climate change under control, but still lose our insects. As lowering our emissions, recapturing and thus reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere significantly can halt climate change or even reverse it. But will very probably not save the insects.
(Before you NIMBYs complain, wasps in my insect garden are right where they belong. Quit complaining, they were there last year too and you never noticed!).
My backyard beehive is of full of solitary wasps hunting the caterpillars in my butterfly garden (I support three native butterflys in my yard).
I’m going to look into the other pollinators in my area and add some plants to my yard to help them out.
I know this doesn’t mean much in the grand scale of things, but I replaced my front lawn with a native pollinator garden a couple of years ago. I see so many bees, insects, beetles, etc now and actually have less problems with bugs inside my house.
