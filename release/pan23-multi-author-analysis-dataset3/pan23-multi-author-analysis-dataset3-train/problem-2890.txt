No. Traditional and Simplified Chinese refer to scripts, whereas Cantonese and Mandarin are relatively mutually unintelligible spoken languages in the Sinitic family. Most Taiwanese people speak Mandarin (or Hokkien) and read/write in Traditional script, wheras most Mainland Chinese speak Mandarin and read/write in Simplified script. Many people in Guangdong Province speak Cantonese and read/write in Simplified, while most people in Hong Kong speak Cantonese and read/write in Traditional.
Second, Chinese script contains a lot of information about meaning, and less information about pronunciation. So it's easy for various dialects to share a writing system. There are differences in syntax and vocabulary between dialects, but the fact remains that every written character can be given a pronunciation in any dialect.
This is the opposite of a phonetic alphabet, which contains a lot of information about pronunciation and less about meaning. So to move to a unified phonetic alphabet you need a unified pronunciation, and China didn't have one.
I agree that the cultural significance of Chinese characters would be to hard to replace with Latin alphabet for the Chinese people. Whereas in Vietnamese, the Vietnamese probably had less qualms in adopting and replacing Chinese with latin script since for the literacy benefit, as well as to distinguish Vietnam from China by not relying on their writing system.
