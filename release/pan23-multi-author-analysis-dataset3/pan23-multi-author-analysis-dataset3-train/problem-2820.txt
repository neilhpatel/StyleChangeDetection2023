Was your dad renting the apartment? At which point you can get in touch with his landlord to help with this.
Your first stop should be the landlord. Does the landlord say they live there? If not, the landlord should be able to help oust them.
Otherwise, is there a will? Has an executor been appointed? In general, these things take time. Grieve your father, see a lawyer about the estate (and this particular issue), take a breath, and things will come together slowly. This may be a problem that comes after, for instance, a funeral, or even in several weeks.
Having recently settled my parents' estates, I'd advise you most specifically that there may not be short term solution to this problem. The long term solution is through probate or whatever process your jurisdiction makes you jump through to settle your late parent's affairs.
Are there people who are trespasssing in a property that your late father leased? I would reckon that the estate would now be the party to the lease agreement. Are these people who say they live there on a lease? Who is on the lease?
Are you or your sister on the lease? If so, the lease may be terminated within three months of death by giving 60 days written notice.
To legally remove a squatter, the first step is to serve a Five Day Tenancy at Will Notice. The notice must contain legal language required by statute and must be delivered (and potentially mailed) to the squatter. If the squatter does not vacate by the expiration of the notice, the property owner must post a Five Day Unlawful Detainer Notice. If the squatter still does not vacate, the owner must file an Affidavit of Complaint for Summary Eviction. Only then will the court issue an eviction order and direct the Constableâ€™s Office to remove the squatter.
