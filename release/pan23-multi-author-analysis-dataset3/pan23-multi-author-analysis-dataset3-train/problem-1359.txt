He is constantly trying a lame and pathetic version of a blitzkrieg which even if done right, it wouldn't work I modern days..he just doesn't understand, he is literally crazy with power another Mao pretty much.
I have thought about this a lot, that if NATO ends up joining, other Asian countries would join and and once Russia looses (which they would) we would see another "Berlin Wall" but China would keep a lot of territory while Asians and NATO that fought together would divide the rest.
A few countries will join NATO so russia cannot invade them any more and hopefully and future wars are fought in the far east of russia as china and others try to seize land that was once there's..
I mean, I want Russia to lose and lose badly so there is no chance of another aggressive invasion in the near future for its neighbors….
Or russia collapses under civil war as all the oligarchs try to grasp onto the burning embers of a once mighty Nation.
Not entirely sure Putin’s oligarchs are the ones fighting in Ukraine. Not sure the cannon fodder is ready to stage an uprising. Putin has managed to suppress any public dissent so far. Most likely they could go on like this for years, no matter the damage they leave behind (in Ukraine and Russia)….
