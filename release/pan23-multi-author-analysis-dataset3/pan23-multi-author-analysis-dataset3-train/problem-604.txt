As the article mentioned, they're already criminals, and now they're criminals with PTSD. They don't want to be part of a prisoner swap because they'll be executed, but if they could be released back into Russian society more discretely...well, that would be dick move on Ukraine's part, but it wouldn't be helping Russia any.
I don't feel like most Russian prisoners are radiating national pride and love for their government, because they know their government is super corrupt but none of those assholes are in jail with them.
You may not be a psychopath, but having spent however long in prison because of who you kissed or for supporting someone other than Putin in an election isn't likely to make you enthusiastic to go kill other people on Putin's behalf.
Although I agree with your point, it's worth remembering that being a prisoner in Russia doesn't automatically mean you're a dangerous psychopath.
Being gay or criticising the government or a host of other things is enough to make you a criminal over there.
