I mean they kind of do. Aircraft are severely limited in capability right now due to the strenh of air defenses. A small number of aircraft are just going to be shot down. Neither side has pilots capable of SEAD operations and no one is going to spend years training the Ukrainians how to do it.
Unfortunately the US doesn't really have any airframes that would be suitable for the rough conditions Ukraine has to operate in right now.
The professional commentary I've heard and read has been that Sweden's Gripen E is the best fit, since it was designed for exactly the conditions Ukraine is now in: a prolonged defensive war against Russia where air assets are distributed throughout the country to avoid being targeted, and are designed to operate out of rough conditions for brief missions, without the opportunity to get to high altitude.
The Gripen is definitely designed for fighting a defensive war with a much bigger opponent (in fact designed to defend against Russia by a small country), trying to maximize flight hours while minimizing turn around on the ground, with all the supply chain designed for decentralized airfield. Not the fastest, most modern or eye catching plane, but from a design concept point of view that swedish fighter is purely amazing.
The US approach is indeed more based on getting superiority at the very beginning of the war. Another somewhat similar comment I've seen about this is that US aircraft are Cadillac, while Soviet aircraft are built for war. For example an F-16 needs a very clean runway to avoid debris entering the engine air intake, while a Mig 29 has cover that close the air intake at take off and the air is instead sucked from above the wings.
If only the US had airframes designed for a similar mission to the Su-25, that could operate on austere airfields, fly low and slow, and be really survivable to ground fire. BRRRRRRRRT.
