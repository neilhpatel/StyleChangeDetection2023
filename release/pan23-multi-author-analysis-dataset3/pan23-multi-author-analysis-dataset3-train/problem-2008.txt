I've worn glasses most of my life and never even considered contacts. I can't stand the idea of sticking things into my eyeballs.
Termination in their local hospital should certainly have been allowed. But "cheaper" might not be accurate. The defect was not detected until the middle of the second trimester and confirmed later in the 2nd. Abortion at that stage is an expensive inpatient hospital procedure, and is very emotionally wrenching for many people.
When you have a miscarriage, or a medically necessary abortion your grieving really hits when the pregnancy is terminated. Plus there is the hormonal hit of that. Pushing that out by SIX MONTHS of pregnancy is fucked up.
They have no problem going to the doctor to address a medical condition they have. If they believed that God orchestrates everything, they should not get medical care for their own illnesses.
What they can't let go of, though, is their belief in a god that controls the world and orchestrates everything. That's the conflict. They just can't accept that there is no god, so they fight this huge fight to tell themselves that a god exists because otherwise they would have to face the reality; death is real.
