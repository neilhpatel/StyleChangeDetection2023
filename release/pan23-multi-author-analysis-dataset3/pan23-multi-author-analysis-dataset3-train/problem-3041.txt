Yeah, you're right. I got Pfizer from the start, when I wanted Moderna, but I didn't want to mix even though they say it's okay. I've gotten all my subsequent boosters from Pfizer.
I did with the 2nd Pfizer shot, but no issues since then. I understand that was par for the course for many folks. And I was apprehensive about the first booster because of that experience, but I still wanted consistency so I stuck with it.
I honestly don't think anything Bernie would have done if he were president would change the behavior of those people.
