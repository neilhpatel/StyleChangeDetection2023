>Pevkur also suggested Russia would learn from what it has experienced in Ukraine. "We have no reason to believe that the threat from Russia is somehow reduced or that the threat to NATO is reduced.".
Yes. And the war will create a very large group of officers and men who have significant combat experience. Worse, the deficiencies would have been identified and remedied.
One of the absolute worst things you can do is underestimate your enemy. And saying that they have no capacity to correct errors due to some inherent problems in them is the textbooks definition of that.
Yes they bribed their opponents. So did the Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan. So do the Indians in Kashmir. So do the Pakistanis on the Afghan border.
So did Afghanistan and Chechnya. They suffered the exact same troubles with corruption and inefficient logistics. They never fixed those problems then they're probably not going to fix them any time soon because that would require replacing the people in charge who got there through nepotism and establishing a meritocracy which wouldn't make anyone money.
