They didn't charge him with the drugs though. Can police take drugs from someone and then not charge them with it? Would they have to put it in evidence? I honestly think that the police took the drugs for themselves. but even if they did, would that and the fact that they had no reason to pull him over be enough to get it dropped? why is there no other way than hiring an attorney? If everyone has a right to a trial then why do you have to spend thousands to do so.
It was heavily documented but incorrectly. The report does not match up on several instances. oh and yes the drugs were documented, but written over 20x more than what they actually were. and they said they were in plain view which was also a lie.
The police report says that they saw a bag of meth in plain view - 9 grams worth/more than a personal amount. That was a lie, it was less than a half of a gram. and it was not in plain view. The asked him what the clear bag was because he could only see the top of it. My husband said "why" and the officer said "because I THINK it's drugs, now hand it to me." He said "no why would you think it's drugs?" and the officer replied "because I do Now give them to me" (my memory might be fading on the exact words used) The officer was being overly aggressive and demanding that he hand it to him. I heard this as I was on the phone with him at the time. That's not legal.
Itâ€™s likely that most of this is legal. Your husband did not have to hand anything over or allow them to search anything without a warrant. Is he on probation?
