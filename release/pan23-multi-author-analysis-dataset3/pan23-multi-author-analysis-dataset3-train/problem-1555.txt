But honestly, your boss is right, you’re making no money at this. Take a full time job somewhere and pursue this field nights and weekends.
You can leave and file a wage claim to bring yourself to the state minimum for the hours you’ve worked.
You can file a complaint with the US labor department, and probably with your state labor board about your pay.
You are unlikely to ever change the owner's attitude towards you. The more legal trouble you get him in, the worse that attitude is likely to get.
You've repeated this a ton, but the truth is you can leave, it's just hard. But you really, really need to sit down and consider the situation as a whole.
Please note: I am not saying that you do not deserve to be paid a living wage or what this owner is doing is right. I'm not saying that you have no legal options. But you need to get the "i CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN'T leave!" option out of your head. Leaving must be a possible outcome.
Be very realistic. Can your location support two of the same dojo? What is it going to be like having this man as a competitor?
