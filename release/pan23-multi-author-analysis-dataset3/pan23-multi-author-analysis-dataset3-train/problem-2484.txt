Depends on how long and in what jurisdiction, and all the other facts. Usually no. But it's not impossible. It depends on the overall situation. "AirBnB" isn't a legal designation. And what flies in Alabama might not fly in New Jersey, and vice versa. But most of the time a court wouldn't rule that an AirBnB stay creates a tenancy. Just depends.
Ultimately their "title" is whatever a judge decides it is. That is based not on you or me or the police but the facts as assessed by a judge (if it goes to court). We can say "here's what the law says" and "here's how judges rule 98% of the time" but ultimately those are educated guesses.
Squatters break into abandoned property without anyone knowing. They are tenants. But even if they were squatters, the way to get rid of squatters is... to file for eviction in court. Generally the police won't remove them either.
Cops are very reluctant to make the call especially as you were aware they were living there. Kicking someone out of a place they live is a big deal and something the law wants a court to decide.
