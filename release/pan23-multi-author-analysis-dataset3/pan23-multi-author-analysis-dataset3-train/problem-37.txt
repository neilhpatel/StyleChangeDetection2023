Neither of these options is your fault or your responsibility. Do you NEED a car on the weekends? Car insurance, gas, and basic maintenance is not cheap. If 5/7 days are going to be spent carting their kids around, you should not be responsible for the total costs of maintaining this car if it's only for your personal use on the weekends.
1) You, an uninsured driver, are driving their cars (with their kids in them!) without you being listed on the policy.
So let's assume your employer isn't doing something shady, because I really don't think he is. I get the sense that they want you to have your own insured vehicle, because right now they either have one of these situations:
It's not your car, why would they want it to be in your name unless it was to protect them from something, like a liability from being sued because of something you did in the car, or the payments, maintenance, and repairs.
Either way, if the car isn't purchased free and clear when they take possession of it, they will have a fixed payment that will show up on any credit report that's pulled on them. If they want to get a mortgage for a house, the amount they can borrow would be limited by the car obligation.
In fact, a fair compromise here would be to pick out a short term lease with the family. 2 years seems fair.
