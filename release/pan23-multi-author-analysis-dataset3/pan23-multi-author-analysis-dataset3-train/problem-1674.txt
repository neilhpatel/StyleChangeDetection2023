This hit me in the feels. So does that Biden quote, especially "I don't know what to do, I know you don't either, but I'm here for you." I'm very lucky to have had a supportive and understanding family but I dealt with alcoholism too and can relate so much to that particular part of the message.
Two of the greatest moments of my existence were when I heard my conservative Christian dad cry on the phone as he rushed to my apartment to get me help for my alcoholism. That was one moment I knew my dad loved me. He told me pretty much what Biden said to his son Hunter. That was about 10 years ago.
"What's more important to you? Your religion and trying to convert ____ constantly? Or to have a real relationship with his son? Because it's one or the other. He doesn't want to hear God talk. Just a father-son conversation.".
I should say. I was still sort of deconstructing from a rural, conservative upbringing at that time. I wasnt even raised religiously but I was terrified Obama first presidency was the end of times. And I remember struggling even with the first election because he didn't seem evil (spoiler he wasnt). Looking back I think Obama 's first term was the final nail I'm the coffin so to speak, where I understood how hypocritical the gop was.
