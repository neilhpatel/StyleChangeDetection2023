This is insulting on so many levels to Ukraine. Zelendky is just trying to make Xi look him in the eyes and say it.
Stability on their northern border. Russia destabilizing is bad for them, especially as Russia is a major energy supplier.
If they support russia then they keep the war going for longer, but also risk getting hit with a bombardment of sanctions, which would destroy them. So they try to not make it too obvious even though everyone sees through their thinly veiled attempts at playing both sides.
China literally only cares about China. What China wants is to exploit the war in Ukraine to weaken everyone else except themselves.
Yeah, who is china friends with that is attempting to claim Ukraine as its own already? "Old soviet era territory". I hope they meant peace, but china trying to broker peace while simultaneously, really awfully, are trying to hide a weapons deal with Russia, says they don't want peace.
KYIV, Feb 27 (Reuters) - China said on Monday it sought dialogue and a peaceful solution for Ukraine despite U.S. warnings that Beijing might be considering weapons supplies for its ally Russia's invasion.
"The core is to call for peace and promote dialogue and promote a political solution to the crisis," foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a news briefing in Beijing.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday the Chinese plan should be analysed in detail and account for the interests of all sides, but for now Moscow saw no signs suggesting a peaceful resolution was feasible.
