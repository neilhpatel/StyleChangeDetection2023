You don’t need their consent to resign, forced labor is illegal in Portugal. Just send them a resignation letter and keep a copy of it for yourself. If you don’t want their money then don’t accept them. Contact your bank and ask them to block any transfers they make, return their letters if they’re mailing you checks, etc.
It isn’t fraudulent to receive payment for a job you don’t do as long as both parties are fine with it and the relevant taxes are paid. It only becomes a problem if they’re filing taxes for a job/wage you don’t want.
Also, if you suspect they’re filling any kind of tax information on you you should contact the tax authorities and let them know. That would almost certainly make them guilty of tax fraud.
I'm not sure its still fraud. They're not keeping the money, they're paying him money and labeling it a business expense. It would depend if its allowed to pay people for doing no work vs giving them money as a family member (which usually has less taxes).
Parents are most likely doing this as a form of giving money to family paying less taxes to do so (as opposed to using OP to pay less taxes and keep more money for themselves). But I don’t think it’s necessary illegal to hire someone to do nothing….
