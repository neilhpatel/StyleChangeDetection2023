If small claims can't order property, then you'd be stuck with the $ value. You can sue in a court that does, but you'd need a lawyer. Alternatively you can offer the ex the $ a suit like that would cost and see if they're willing to accept that in exchange for the dog.
If this can’t or won’t be handled inside a courtroom, certainly there’s an amount of money or some arrangement in exchange for the dog that your ex cannot say no to.
That means if you want the dog back, that’s something to work out with your ex outside of court, or retain an attorney and go through regular civil court.
Regular civil court can generally order the return of the dog (whether that’s a likely outcome is a different question). Regular civil court tends to be much more expensive than small claims court.
Small claims is a type of civil court. But one where awards are limited to money (in your jurisdiction and most).
That order is possible in a higher level court. But dogs are property, and courts generally are willing to award money, not possession.
It means small claims court likely cannot order the return of the dog, only award you the value of the dog (which, unless purebred or whatever, is likely a low amount of money). But call the court and inquire if small claims can do this for you, and, if so, that’s an angle you can pursue.
You can call the clerk at the court and inquire about a small claims suit of replevin, though, to make sure.
