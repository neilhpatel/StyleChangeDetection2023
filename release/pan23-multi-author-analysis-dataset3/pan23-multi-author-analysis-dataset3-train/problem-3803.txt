Is the implication that if, say, "Wolfram, the Brewmaster's Junior Assistant from Weimar" or whoever went on crusade, his family/friends would basically just assume he was dead if he didn't come back around the same time as everyone else? Was there any system in place to 'check' with whoever was "in charge" of his group of soldiers? Would there have been any prescribed legal processes for dealing with his "estate"?
Thank you. I guess the one piece I'm missing is, how did someone "prove" that they should inherit as next of kin if there was no definitive report of death? Could they just say "surely he'd have come back by now" and then get some sort of legal declaration of death? Are there instances where someone was declared dead on the Crusades and then showed up alive?
I can't think of any examples of someone claiming to be a dead crusader, but that would be interesting! Now I want to know the answer to that too...
And on top of that, years were often given in terms of regnal years of a king or a pope or whoever the local ruler was, so to figure out something like "the third year of the reign" of whoever, you need to know when that guy started ruling. If it's March 2, then the regnal year starts on March 2, not January 1. Oh and of course even if a document gives an AD year, it could start on January 1, or March 25, or Easter (so some years are longer than others), or some other day.
