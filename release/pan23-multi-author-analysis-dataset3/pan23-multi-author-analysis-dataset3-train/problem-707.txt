Puberty blockers have been in use since the 80s, with no issues. While they were initially used to treat precocious puberty, it’s the same drugs used for the same purpose (delay puberty), so there’s no reason to assume there would be any new issues.
If you mean "continue their normal puberty," they're taken off the puberty blockers and the body does the rest.
Though it's important to note that hormone therapy is not a first-line treatment. While you may be able to find the odd example of a quack doctor pushing this kind of treatment, the vast, vast majority of people on hormone therapy have years of social transition under their belts already and have had every opportunity to verify that transitioning is right for them.
And even then, while there are some permanent effects, discontinuing hormone therapy tends to lead to a slow disappearance of the developed secondary sex characteristics. For example, a transman who has been on testosterone will have experienced facial hair growth, clitoral growth, muscular growth, voice deepening, and fat deposit redistribution (among many other changes). The first two of those are permanent; the latter three tend to wear off.
