Also when she dies all of this debt will come back to you since it is your debt. May be decades from now, but look how much she has racked up in debt already, imagine a few more decades of that.
Disclaimer: I had some debt collections knowledge from a job 13y ago but the frameworks of my notes shouldn’t be far from off. Also have worked in the financial sector for 10+y so I know a lil somethin-somethin but please realize I’m not giving legal advice and only speaking from a “here’s what I’ve learned” basis. Hope some helps!
4- STOP discretionary spending, get a second job, and max out your available time to start making some extra money on your journey towards paying off the debt.
If you don’t stop this, you will not be able to fix your credit, which is going to make many things more difficult in your life going forward (car loans, mortgage, rental agreements).
Having bad credit, will eventually lead you to homelessness since you won't be able to rent wontbe able to get a car etc. Our lives revolve around credit, and when it's bad, you can't do ANYTHING.
