If his name is on any of your bank accounts it is critical to move your money to a new account and close out that account. If he is on the account changing the passwords will not stop him from going to the bank and taking money out etc.
1a- lock down any accounts (change passwords, put new lock code on phone & computer, etc) of yours which your partner may have had access to.
1- Take any objects from the home which are irreplaceable - deeds, bonds, heirlooms, photos, etc - and move them off site to somewhere safe. It could be the home of friends or family, a storage unit or even a bank safety deposit box. Make sure a copy of the recording and current, dated photos of the property and valuables within are included.
3- issue him a notice to quit within \[X\] days (the minimum depends on your state, but 30 days is the typical minimum). If he hasn't left the property by then you can start eviction proceedings.
Legally, you can go through the eviction process but it may end up costing you significantly and you risk that he will damage your property. Plus, many States still have eviction bans due to COVID. You may be better off in the long run negotiating a cash for keys exchange, especially of you can negotiate a lower amount.
