So much for the Iliad, where technological differences clearly cannot and do not explain any part of the story. But what about the actual Bronze Age?
There's a couple reasons why scholars assume that knowledge of the Bronze Age was lost. The first is that there is no evidence of writing in the Greek world for nearly 400 years after the fall of the Mycenaean palaces; when it reappears, they're using a different script. It is fair to say that the ability to read and write was lost when it no longer had a purpose in administration, and so any information about times past had to be passed down through oral traditions. Apart from chance finds and local stories, the average Greek would have learned nothing about the Bronze Age and would not have been able to find out more either.
But, as we know of historical stuff Bronze age Greeks had, couldnâ€™t Homeric Greeks have evidence of the stuff their ancestors from a few hundred years ago had? I imagine then, there were even more historical records from Bronze Age as it was closer to that period.
When it comes to the actual Bronze Age, as in the period in the Aegean preceding the Iron Age (before ca. 1000 BC), the typical material used for weapons (and armour) is bronze, but stone arrowheads do remain in use for a long time (e.g. flint, obsidian). In her unpublished PhD thesis, Elements of Mycenaean Warfare (1990), Diane Fortenberry writes that "Stone arrowheads continued in use to the end of the Bronze Age, though their numbers in comparison to bronze points decrease as time goes on" (p. 226). Slingers, of course, were also active in the Bronze Age and they used stones as ammunition. As Fortenberry also makes clear, and as a reading of the Iliad illustrates, stones would also be picked up and thrown by hand, and rocks could be thrown at assailants by defenders at e.g. the Lion Gate in Mycenae.
