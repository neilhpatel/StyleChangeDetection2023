"While minors cannot currently receive vaccines without parental consent in this state, use our suggested materials to discuss why you want to get vaccinated with your parents and see if you can change their minds!" .
We live in Arizona, and we currently don't have any vaccination laws allowing anyone under 18 to get vaccinated without parental consent. says there is no other option to parental consent and I'm just confused on how that's even legal man.
My legal advice is to not take it at all without parental consent. Instead, she should try to convince her parents to let her take it.
What state do you live in? And NO, don't make your parents impersonate her parents, it's a bad idea because her real parents can then sue yours if your friend get any reaction from the vaccine and her parents get to know. Some states allow -18 years old to get the vaccine without parental consent. Otherwise farmaceutics are not allowed to provide a vaccine without parental consent.
Title: Can my friends parents legally obstruct her getting the vaccine? Is there any way around it?
