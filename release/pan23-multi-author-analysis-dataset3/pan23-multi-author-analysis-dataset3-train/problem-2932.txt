Because the Republican party and it’s voters are willing to win by way of gerrymandering and moving voters around if it means they don’t need to change their minds when they are wrong.
With every wrench the Republicans throw into the machine, they'll blame 10 democrats and every god damned republican voter will agree with them. Period, discussion over.
Why is everyone claiming victory? Dems are losing in both races right now. Yes Dems have picked up some traditionally gop held positions but a fat lot of good that’ll do without a majority.
Can we stop pretending that there's anyone out there still under the impression that both sides are separate but equal?
At this point there is no one out there who will suddenly come to realize that the Republicans are the ones responsible for holding the country back and hurting the middle class.
Thank you SCOTUS and lousy Republican candidates for helping unravel at least a little bit of the tremendous damage that SCOTUS and the Republicans have done to our democracy.
