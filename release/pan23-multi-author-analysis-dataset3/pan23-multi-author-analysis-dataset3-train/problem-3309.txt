Your pwerspective is really interesting to me, since mine is mostly informed by a postcolonial studies approach from decades ago, rather than a current military history one.
I'm a trained historian with an MSc in African Studies and currently a PhD History candidate who has been studying the South African Border War and contemporary African history for the past decade. I have interviewed over 20 war veterans regarding their experiences, hosted talks, and written articles on the topic. I have also taught contemporary African history and War and Society courses and presented at several conferences on African military history.
These inclusive practices included recruiting black and coloured South Africans, Namibians, and Angolans. (Not sure if you're from the US, but in South Africa "coloured" is not a racial slur as in the US and is rather a racial demographic.) Though very few made it into CO ranks, many reached NCO ranks and were integrated into squads fairly often when the practice became commonplace. There were several dedicated black squads as well, and many accounts from white soldiers praise their black counterparts (though in some cases it still has the air of somewhat patronising racial tones). Ironically enough, the SADF was more integrated and tolerant, racially-speaking, than South African society.
Were there specific ethnicities of Black South Africans there were more likely to volunteer for the SADF?
To the average SADF recruit, the military was the only thing keeping the heathen, black, communist hordes out of South Africa (SA). And the only way to accomplish this was to keep them out of South West Africa (SWA - today Namibia). The name South African Border War is somewhat misleading as the "border" mentioned wasn't that of the country of South Africa, but was rather that of SWA - though SWA was considered an unofficial fifth province of SA and, as such, the "border" was technically SA's.
