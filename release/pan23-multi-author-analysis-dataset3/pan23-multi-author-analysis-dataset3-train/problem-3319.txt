There literally is. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 established I9 and it requires all private companies to verify work eligibility using valid (temprarily any validly issued list B during covid) forms of ID.
This isn’t really an issue of state vs federal ID’s here. The problem is i9 requires 1 or 2 specific documents to be presented and reviewed within 3 days of employment - and an expired passport is not and has never been valid for such purpose.
edit to answer your direct question No employer, in CA or IL, is required to accept an expired passport as a form of ID (and likely would have issues if they did so).
Either way, this is starting to sound like either a misunderstanding on the company's part, or a case where other states are allowed to make their own ruling on whether or not to accept expired ID?
We might be getting into semantics then, as that sounds like there's a list of government-approved ID, but without necessarily specifying that companies must accept a form of ID on that list. (Unless I am missing something.).
The temp. exemption to expiration dates makes sense as a work around due to Covid, so that makes more sense to me. But I thought a passport would be a federal document? Ie the US as a country issues passports, not IL or CA as a state.
