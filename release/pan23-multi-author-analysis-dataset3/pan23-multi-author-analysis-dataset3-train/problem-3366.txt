Document every issue with the apartment and contact a local real estate attorney. It sounds like you may have a case that the landlord has broken the lease by not providing an apartment meeting local health and safety requirements which, if true, would mean the contract is already null and void.
If the infestation is as bad as you say you can ask your landlord to deal with it and possibly withhold rent into an escrow account until he does.
However, if your landlord has the paperwork in order, as well as a signed agreement with you, the best you can do is ask them to remedy these issues (take pictures, of course) and withhold rent until they do.
For now, however, you need to ask your landlord to remedy the issue. Use the escrow account or try to find another tenant to take over.
I am aware that the landlord cannot raise rent within a 12 month period, but I don't believe there is a limit to how long a lease can be. Even so, I do believe there is an ability for the lease to have exceptions as long as they do not interfere with the tenant's rights. (Once again, I could be wrong, but after scanning several documents I've seen nothing about this).
