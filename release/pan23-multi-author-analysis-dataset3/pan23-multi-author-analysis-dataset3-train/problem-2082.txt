For me, as an old white woman educated in the midwest and college educated it was the omissions that I only recently learned about and I am mad as hell that I didnt learn until the past few years.
I grasped the concept of my white privilege some time ago but only in recent years have learned how powerful and horrible it is.
And even she could tell Ron DeSantis was a racist weirdo and a scumbag for trying to whitewash history and hated the attempts to gloss over how this country fucked over Black people.
Of course the skin color matters, the leftist media labels people a racist white nationalist if they disagree with the mainstream narrative. I represent the coloured immigrant minority who's had enough of the leftist liberal woke ideology that is destroying this great country.
Most kids "can handle it" but they're getting Indoctrinated, which is not a good thing. Everyone should be encouraged to learn both sides of an idea to make an informed decision and not one sided indoctrination.
Exactly, so let's not destroy this great country via radical leftistism or far right movement. Let's use common sense and hold the left and right accountable.
There are no nationalist or authoritarians crying and complaining. Its the Hardworking middle class of all background that are standing up and saying NO to woke liberal ideology and pleading for a more common sense approach.
