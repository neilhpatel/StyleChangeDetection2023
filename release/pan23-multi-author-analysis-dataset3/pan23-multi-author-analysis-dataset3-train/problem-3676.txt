OP certainly has residency and this eviction is definitely illegal, but OP should 100% be looking for a new place to live because they have no legal right to the property... at least not beyond whatever the default month to month lease is. If possible they should get their things and move, not hunker down in the apartment and wait for the complex to evict them.
Usually all courts no matter how quickly they process an eviction will consider anyone that is in the unit over 30 days a tenant. If you break back in and the cops arrive, all you have to say is you are a tenant, and show the little proof you have. They will deem it a civil matter and inform the landlord they will have to take it up with the courts.
If the landlord shows up, and proves you’re not on the lease and has no evidence that you were living there, you’re now responsible for all court costs too.
This is why people need to be on leases. It protects you as much as the landlord, something I try to educate people on.
Best to try to prove to the landlord you have lived there first. Then if they are still refusing, then get an attorney.
People are too quick to recommend others get an attorney when they can’t comprehend or don’t consider the financial implications.
