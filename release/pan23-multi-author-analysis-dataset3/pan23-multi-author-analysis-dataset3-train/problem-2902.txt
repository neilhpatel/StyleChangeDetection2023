Where did the Byzantines fit into this picture, since they sort of straddled the east-west divide? At times they field large numbers of horse archers raised domestically in Anatolia. I'd imagine those horses would have something in common with the fast Arab breeds.
Also, did the Byzantines see their horse breeding efforts decline with the fall of the western Roman Empire, or were they always able to maintain a better program?
Due to the fall of the western roman empire the quality of European horses was very low in the early medieval period and horses were small on average and although some troops were mounted most would dismount to do battle.
Depends a bit on what you mean and which time period. If it's for riding to a battle yes but if it is for fighting a battle during the crusades the answer is no because the "West" and the Arabs had a different approach to horse-breeding and their use.
The Arabian horse on the other hand was one of the best breeds at the time and was widely sought after in Europe but their way of breeding, feeding and training the animals are widely different.
Previous answers have focused more on the difference between breeds, an important part of the answer to your question, but they do not relate to horse training.
The short answer is yes, in all likelihood military horses would have ride-able by anyone with some skill, and being a member of the cavalry would have required skill. Unfortunately, there is a lack of material on horsemanship from this era, and thus it is impossible to answer definitively how horses were trained, what commands were used, and if they were the same across different cultures.
So in short to ride a random middle eastern horse into battle during the high middle ages as a knight would be ill advised because the horse lacks the traits and training the knight needed. Even if the horse was a high quality Arabian.
