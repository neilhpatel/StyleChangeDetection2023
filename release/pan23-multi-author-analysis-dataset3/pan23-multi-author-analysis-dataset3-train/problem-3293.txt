This is pure speculative nonsense. Infants get heart rates into the 200+ range very regularly when they have fevers or dehydration. Almost none of them are dropping dead from heart attacks. Having very prolonged tachycardia like this is not good, and should be intervened on, but saying that they "likely would have dropped dead from a heart attack in a few hours" is nonsense.
2. Some major deviation from standard practices, causing something like a failure to diagnose, or very non-standard treatments.
Teething does not cause fever. This is a myth. A female infant with fever from an unclear source almost always needs a urinalysis to check for UTI. This is the one major misstep that I see in your story. I'm not sure it amounts to malpractice.
Assuming he listened to her heart and lungs, he was effectively checking her heart rate and respiratory rate. The only other major vitals missing would be BP and oxygen saturation (based on what you describe, likely would have been normal, but should still be checked at any sick visit).
It's very hard to establish all of these simultaneously. I'm not sure you have lasting damages to even pursue. I doubt a successful malpractice case could result from this, based on the given information.
You should keep in mind that itâ€™s entirely possible the physician at insta care did nothing wrong. Medicine is complex and patients have abnormal presentations all the time.
