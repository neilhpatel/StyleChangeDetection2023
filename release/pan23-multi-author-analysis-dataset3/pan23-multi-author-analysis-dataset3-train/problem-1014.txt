I skied Ruapehu back in the early 90’s. They’d had like 20 feet of snow. At one point we tried to ski to a cafe on the slopes but couldn’t find it, then we realized we were on its roof. Only a chimney was sticking out through the snow.
The last years, the resort would usually have only ONE snow fall for all winter. Last year, the resort had 60 inches of snow in two days, and that was all. They had to somehow manage to hold a whole season with it.
I remember temperatures as cold as -20F being displayed on the ski lifts, and our breath freezing in our ski masks. A few times during the first years, we weren't able to ski all day and gave up, went in the resort's restaurant and sipped hot chocolate by the fire until the road was okay for us to come back home.
In 10YEARS, the climate has dramatically changed and I fear that this small, lovely ski resort will NEVER know another winter like 2012.
I've been skiing for 10+ years, and have seen the change, can't imagine what a person who's seen 20/30 years plus.
I worked at a ski hill once, it was interesting. Mostly the job was driving around on snowmoblies with a shovel and a hammer, knocking ice off the snowmakers, or digging them out.
