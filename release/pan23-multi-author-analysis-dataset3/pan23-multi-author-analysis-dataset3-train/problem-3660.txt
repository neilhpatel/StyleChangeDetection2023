If only there'd been 6 visible planets instead of 5. Then we'd have 8 day weeks and could split things evenly.
I work 40 hours a week and honestly have enough work that I could go for 60 if they'd give me the OT. And I see people say they do 3 hours of work a day? How the fuck does that even work?
I'm really shocked at how people apparently sit around at work so much and companies just... let them get away with it to the point that losing 20% of the labor hours for the week has minimal effect.
Then again, one of the major points regarding shorter work weeks is that many employees aren't doing the 40 hours' worth anyway, as it's too much to ask.
I do actually kinda get the reason for both shorter workweeks & work from home being faught against.
I dont know why people think 4 day work week will mean shorter business hours. Instead, more people can be hired and employed. And there is more incentive to work if you are not working inhumane hours.
Because in this context, they're fighting for more hours of their life at work. Because it's the only place at least some of the people fighting for the preservation of the 40 hour week feel they get to be social.
