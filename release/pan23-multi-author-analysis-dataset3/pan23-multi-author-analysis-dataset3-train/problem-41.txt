Instead of a silent Boycott, why not put it clearly out there how Russia has terrorized its artists in the past and oppresses them in the present.
Why, why should we forego russian art and music, hate the russian government not the russian people. What does rachmoninoff or tchaikovsky have to do with putin and his war against the Ukraine? This is stupid.
That is really stupid. Russia has produced great literature, music, and film throughout history. The idea that we should pretend everything ever from Russia is bad just to support Ukraine is ridiculous.
This is absolutely fucking crazy… Ukraines government is no less fervent in its hatred for Russians as the Russian’s is to Ukrainians. It’s the most petty shit-brained schism ever. This makes me sick, as Russian artists, dead or alive, and others already face distinction based on their ethnicity already. What would really be the right thing to do would be to highlight the bad things that the sitting, and previous, Russian governments have done to its artists.
