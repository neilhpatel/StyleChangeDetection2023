Also, the photograph you linked looks like an editing station. That would mean that the surrounding shelves probably hold source material and/or working prints. I mean aside from the narrower-format film on the left shelf, ALL of these 35-mm cans could be for just a portion for one movie only!
8mm (which was the popular format through the 1950s and 1960s) did not have theatrical stuff, you're talking about a catalog .
16mm was not common, more something that institutions and schools had (the thing generally bought would be educational films). However, you could technically get a hold of some films, but for your average theater film it would be even more hit and miss than usual because you'd be talking about, ah, slightly unofficial. (I've added a little more about this in my main response.).
2.) Super 8 consumer market for buying films started roughly 1970 and was reasonably affordable. 16mm was not so much, although it was possible. (The good news if you managed to get one it was possible to rent a film just like a regular theater, although they tended to be from an older scattershot collection. . The bad news is it was still expensive. Getting a rental -- remember, not buying -- the 1961 film _Greyfriars Bobby_ in the 1967 catalog is listed as $24.50; after inflation, that's $206 in 2022 money.) There were quite a few regular 8mm projectors through the 50s and 60s but their catalogs involved shorts.
Follow-up question: When I was growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, pre-VHS, one could buy or rent movies on film, which you played on a home movie projector, presumably 8mm or 16mm. This was very common at birthday parties, for example, and I remember watching lots of Disney movies this way. Was this not a big market?
