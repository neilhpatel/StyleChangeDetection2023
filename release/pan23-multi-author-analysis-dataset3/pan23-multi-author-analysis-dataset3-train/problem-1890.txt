Discrimination is wrong, which is based on something out of the person’s control, such as skin color or sexual orientation. Additionally, businesses need to have the right to refuse service.
So in my opinion, she’s either discriminating against gays, or she has to prove that a refusal to serve gays is based on a non-free speech protected first amendment right. So if she proves that hating gay people is who she is fundamentally as a person in all aspects of her life, or religious doctrine, then she has a case.
But I guess conservatives are coming from the view that either their shitty views are a core part of their person or that things like being gay are just made up.
I think its because, for Religious Conservatives, "race" is an intrinsic static attribute of who you are for better or worse, whereas they perceive being gay as a personal "choice" and "lifestyle". They see refusing service to gay couples not as unjust discrimination but simply as shaming "bad behavior".
So, you can refuse a gay couple customizations so long as the same customizations would also be refused for straight or interracial couples.
While you don't have to customize something you don't want to, you also can't make that decision based on a discrimination against whole classes of people.
You can turn people away and not customize things but you can't do so purely based on the sex/sexual orientation/race of the person (granted, sexual orientation is not yet a federally protected class but Colorado made it that way).
