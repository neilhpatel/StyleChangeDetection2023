She was a spoiler propped up by Republican donors, as is per usual with cannabis-focused third parties here in Minnesota and elsewhere. Literally the only reason we don’t have legal marijuana yet is because Republicans control the state legislature. The Democratic caucus supports legalization and Governor Walz is ready to sign it. We only got legal 5mg gummies recently because they’re dumbshits who didn’t read what they were voting on and Walz was like “lol, cool where’s my pen”.
Once we get Ranked Choice Voting then vote for these third parties and rank the Democrats under them, but until RCV grows to more states you’re just wasting your vote and throwing it to the GOP.
As for your second point, I completely agree that when Democrats lose elections their response is always to run to the right but it seems to me that only further proves they aren't worth voting for.
I don't subscribe to the lesser of two evils theory of voting; it just makes things get worse at a slightly slower rate. Also, ideally, if the better(slightly less bad) candidate loses because of a third option siphoning away some of their support that might make them examine their own platform and adopt some of the policies that allowed the third option to win as much support as they did.
Your reply might make sense if our planet and everything on it wasn't being literally cooked alive. Voting for the lesser of two evils will still result in the mass extinction of not only humanity but most other life on earth as well. I personally think that our only hope for survival is a massive systemic change that neither the Republicans or the Democrats are structurally capable of delivering.
