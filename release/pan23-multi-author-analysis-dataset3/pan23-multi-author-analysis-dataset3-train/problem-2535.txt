My first thought as well. My second was that no lawyer put that in writing, so plumber likely stole the letterhead, and $LAWYER may be interested to know that fact.
Secondly, look at the letter head and confirm with the law firm that they actually did send the letter. This is a simple call to the office on the letter head after confirm said firm actually exists and then asking about the letter and legitimacy. Hang up the phone once you get confirmation that this was sent from their office.
Third, after getting confirmation, you can continue on with your life and think about getting a plumber that your housing association will recommend. If you get actual summons for court or receive legal documents for the lawsuit, then you'll need a lawyer.
If you get actually served with court papers for a small claims case, take it seriously and respond by filing a response in court. If it's in a regular court, go to a lawyer (just about any kind of tort/injury defense or civil litigator) and have them do the response.
Oh, and if he did the actual work, pay. Out of all the BS and nonsense that took place, if he did the work a court will ultimately determine that he still needs to be paid. You being willing to pay will make you sound like "the reasonable person in the room", which is always a good look.
