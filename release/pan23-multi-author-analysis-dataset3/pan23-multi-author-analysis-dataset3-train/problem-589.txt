That is one big reason the conflict is trending yes but at least here in Europe, we've been working on strenhening relations and trying to help/get Ukraine into the EU for much longer than the invasion. There certainly were some cultural issues in the past, but to pretend nobody cared about Ukraine until Febuary just gone is false. Even for America that's not true, as seen by the Trump campaigns operations in Ukraine.
Ukraine is only important to people because Russia is viewed as an enemy of the West, so the media tells us to care.
The reason Ukraine is on the front page is because Russia is/was a Global superpower. If India was at war with Pakistan today it would be front page news. Because you both have nukes...
Because they built up a nuclear arsenal. Which Ukraine opposed and then supported sanctions on, while Russia backed them.
No one needs to to justify not supporting Ukraine. If it isn't important to them or their lives. They can say "Oh, that's too bad, Russia shouldn't do that." and move on. Us and our government react that way to a lot of things and it'd be hypocritical to condemn anyone for not showing enough support.
