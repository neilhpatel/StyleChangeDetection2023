How long do you think China would allow a foreign aircraft to overfly its territory without permission?
Other than all that though, yes, countries have full sovereignty over their own airspace and can intercept anything in that region however and whenever they please.
Also if a craft is high enough then that is categorized as space rather than airspace, and anything can be in space doing whatever they want.
(Also, the altitude that this balloon was flying at is very clearly not in space under all definitions).
If I cared about anything enough to want high res undistorted pictures from the sky, the last thing I would think is "lets try launching a balloon from half a world away, that will TOTALLY fly over exactly what I want to see!
I cannot possibly contort my thinking enough to see how a military balloon in any way makes sense for a country with satellites to spy on a country with mostly open borders and no real controls on who does business with whom.
That makes one of us. They are making noise because they were given the opportunity to by us acting like baffoons.
