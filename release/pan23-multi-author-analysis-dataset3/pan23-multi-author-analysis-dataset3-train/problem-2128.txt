How it should work is the federal government should replace student loans with interest free loans and income based repayments that are forgiven after 10 years if not repaid in full.
Right there… the requirement is the payback of the loan… the student financial assistance program is the program that gives out the loans (i.e., requirement to payback). The summary reading of that law that I provided makes it abundantly clear it’s about waiving the requirements to pay back loans from the student financial assistance programs.
You are crudely interpreting it incorrectly… “waive or modify any requirement or regulation applicable to the student financial assistance programs.” Note, it’s not even giving him authority to change the hero’s act, but the regulation that defines how student financial assistance programs work (which is defined under different regulations, not the hero’s act).
Why are you making shit up and acting correct? The law specifically allows waivers to student financial aid. If you don’t believe me, you can read about it on congress’ website .
Right, would be up to Congress to act in that case. Technically they do have US Marshals, but they are part of Executive Branch even if they take orders from court.
