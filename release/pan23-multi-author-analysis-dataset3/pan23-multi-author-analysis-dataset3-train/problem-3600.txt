/u/Tiako has done a good job of ironing out confusion I've caused, but let me see if I can just add in some further detail...
Immaterial. "Hu" was a general classification, like "barbarian," not a specific people. To be Hu or Han was much more a question of culture in the Tang, than of bloodline.
In fact, whether the Tang Dynasty was a Han did not require much argument. The famous Chinese poet Li Bai once wrote poems that insulted the Hu people. Li Bai is also a relative of the royal family.
And then, of course, there's the curious case of Emperor Taizong's eldest son, the crown prince Li Chengqian. Though favored by his birthright, Chengqian had been doing just about everything in his power to make his aged father (himself titled the Khaghan of Heaven) think of choosing another of his sons to become his heir increasingly desirable. Though as a youth heâ€™d proved intelligent and capable, his formative years had revealed a significantly stranger and even scandalous nature in the heir apparent.
