I do also suspect that some masters just freed their slaves as they got too old, after a term of service, so that way they didn't have to care for them, but I didn't read that in my book. This would be different than just freeing a slave when they got too old to do anything, though, since there was still a link between a master and his now-freedman. The freedman could be a useful agent for the master in business dealings, as well as help the master seem impressive through a particular type of Roman conspicuous consumption - being seen to be so rich you weren't just surrounded by a bunch of slaves, but also a bunch of freedmen. You were so rich you could grant freedom to so many.
"When certain men were exposing their sick and worn out slaves on the Island of Aesculapiusâ€‹ because of the trouble of treating them, Claudius decreed that all such slaves were free, and that if they recovered, they should not return to the control of their master; but if anyone preferred to kill such a slave rather than to abandon him, he was liable to the charge of murder." - Suetonius.
First off, I'm not a historian. I am, instead, an amateur who has an absolute obsession for all things Rome.
As a Rome obsessive, could you recommend any books/podcasts for a neophyte who would like to learn more about the history of Rome in general?
