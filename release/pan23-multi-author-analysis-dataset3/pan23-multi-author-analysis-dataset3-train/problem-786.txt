Itâ€™s a political decision not a technical challenge that is the reason they do not have a functional weapon. If they decided today to manufacture one, it would take approximately 5 days for them to accumulate the required mass of HEU needed for a weapon and approximately 3 to 6 months for them to fashion the core into a deliverable weapon. Than probably another 6 months to miniaturize it into a warhead that could be usable on a ballistic missile for delivery.
Iran has missiles capable of carrying a miniaturized nuclear warhead, yet they have only conventional warheads in their arsenal.
You don't believe Iran has missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads? I'll defer to Uzi Rabin, the father of Israel's missile program, who says they do and also says their missiles are quite more advanced that people believe.
If you believe all these things are lies then you believe that Iran isn't capable of building a bomb, and thus any talk of such is propaganda.
However, it's also a warning that if anyone attacks Iran, they will purse a bomb and have one in less than 6 months.
If Iran wanted to build a nuclear weapon they could kick out the IAEA and build one tomorrow, like North Korea did. Or they could do what Israel India and Pakistan did when they wanted nukes, and simply never signed the NPT.
The idea that Iran signed the NPT 20 years ago and has allowed endless sanctions to build the slowest nuclear bomb in the history of nuclear arms is ridiculous. Less technologically advanced countries were building nuclear bombs 50,60, 70 years ago.
Nuclear weapons will proliferate as the plans have existed in publicly accessible locations for well over 50 years.
