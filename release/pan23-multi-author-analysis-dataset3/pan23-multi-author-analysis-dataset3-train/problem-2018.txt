Just reading about the Bradley Fighting Vehicle... Russia has gotten itself into a complete morass. Just everything they bring to the field the rest of the world provides equal and opposite strenh plus a bit more, bleeding them out.
It's a fair argument that the restricted flow of equipment to Ukraine in one sense prolongs the fight but it casts the whole war as a situation that can cease anytime Russia wants it to by GTFO, which hopefully will mean a lasting peace.
Sounds good on a first read, but like others have mentioned would a ceasefire only benefit Russia and "a vision of a fair solution" sounds awfully like Ukraine should cease territory to pacify Russia.
⚡️Ukraine will not conduct any negotiations with Russia about the Christmas truce, – Oleksii Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, says.
Russia rang in the New Year with cringeworthy entertainment and mean-spirited schadenfreude towards Ukrainians and Europeans who are left without food, heating and hot water because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian state TV assured the troops: "Death does not exist.".
This is it. This is him throwing everything he’s got at it. There is no ‘total war’, there is no ‘full mobilization’, that will magically conjure more weapons deliveries, more logistical capability, more firepower. If he could produce more weapons? He would have been doing it already. This is all there is, there ain’t no more.
