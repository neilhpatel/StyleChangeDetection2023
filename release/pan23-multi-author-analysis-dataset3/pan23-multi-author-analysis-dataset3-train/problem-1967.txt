It could be entirely coincidental. But Ukraine absolutely does have a serious corruption issue which needs to be openly acknowledged and transparently dealt with, especially if they want admittance to NATO.
I found it really relevant given how several of the former non-NATO former Soviet block states are looking for warmer relations with EU/NATO, and need to undergo a corruption cleanup process as a step they wonâ€™t be allowed to dodge.
Since 2014, Ukraine has committed itself to cleaning up corruption but it's a slow process and more than once they've discovered the people they point into anti-corruption task forces are themselves corrupt.
Corruption has been one of the defining issues of Zelensky's time in charge, prior to the invasion anyway. Ukraine historically is woefully, stunningly corrupt to the extent westerners would not believe.
Bribing judges, paying cops that stop you on the street, hell, if you need a service from your city council then you have to grease a palm or two. Bribes aren't just normal, they're expected.
