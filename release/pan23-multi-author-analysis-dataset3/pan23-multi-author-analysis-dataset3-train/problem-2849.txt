Unfortunately, I’m not liking the way politics are going in other countries I’ve considered better either. So I’ve resigned myself to voting every election and focusing on things I can actually control and are feasible.
Yup I’ve also had to increase my social media breaks because my mental health cannot handle all of the GOP’s negativity and assholery. It’s every day and it’s so tiring.
It honestly feels harder every day. I used to take a media break every four or five weeks. Now I do it every four or five days. I live in Nebraska and can't even keep up with all the ways the republicans are trying to fuck up the state with their new legislation.
The MAGAs took over the republican party last summer and are now introducing so many batshit ideas in the legislature this year, I've been forced to pick two issues (which are a total of five bills) because I can't do them all.
I feel like I'm going crazy some days and need too much time away from it all just to stay sane. I don't know how much more I can take.
