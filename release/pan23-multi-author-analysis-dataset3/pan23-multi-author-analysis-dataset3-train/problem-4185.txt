This is a tragedy for this family, but those eyewitnesses are Palestinian and have a lot of sympathy and support to gain from the international community by alleging police brutality, even though these actions could be completely justified. In most courts around the world, police reports are more trusted and can be used to prove what happened. I don’t like it either, but that’s the way it is.
I’m also finding it hard to believe the driver was “surprised” that IDF was flagging him down and that an eyewitness would be able to see that.
Palestine doesn’t have a legitimate country, it should never be anything more than an idea. I am not a Zionist by any stretch, but the majority of Palestinians directly support the terrorist-regime, HAMAS, and supporting a group who would treat the Israelis like the Nazis treated those in concentration camps is unconscionable.
“Palestine isn’t a legit country” is incredibly disturbing propaganda that has been used frequently in history to dehumanise and kill a lot of people.
