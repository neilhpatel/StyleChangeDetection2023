Why am I the pot or kettle? I'm not from the US. I'm not arguing the US. I've not brought up the US, you did.
The day you start cooperating with the rest of us, about anything at all China, we might consider cooperation with you. But what we see is how you routinely use any treaties and deals only to shackle other more lawful and honorable countries so that you can ignore the treaties and deals to take what you want for yourselves.
The US violates/pulls out of treaties it signs, the Iran deal and Paris climate change agreement being the latest egregious examples. Why should anyone value any kind of treaty with the US?
Hypocrisy is the practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for which one criticizes another or the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform. In moral psychology, it is the failure to follow one's own expressed moral rules and principles. - from Wikipedia.
The US is the one criticizing China here. So it's fair to examine the US in a similar context. An equivalent of what's happening here would be Russia/China/Iran criticizing human rights violations in a country, someone criticizing R/C/I for the hypocrisy and then someone saying ah the classic 'BUT THE R/C/I' deflection.
