For instance Finland is completely self-sufficient in weed, as in we grow enough for the market and wouldn't need to import. And all that growing is happening illegally "in secret".
If there isn't that option, then people will just start growing tobacco as a cash-crop, just like cannabis is now.
Sure there will be a small subculture of smoking tobacco, but it will barely support a black market.
There's no need to though, as smuggling cigarettes is easy AF since no drug dogs give a shit about smoking, and they couldn't even if they wanted to. People on international airports in NZ would be arriving from countries in which smoking is legal, so most people would smell of cigarettes, making the dog useless (which they already are after 40 min of work.).
Yes it is included. Essentially people stop working at around the same age regardless. Smokers tend to die either during their productive years or just after meaning they only last long enough to contribute but not long enough to be a drain or to go negative.
Smoking makes you statistically more likely to die younger, but there are loads and loads of people who live to a very old age as a smoker.
