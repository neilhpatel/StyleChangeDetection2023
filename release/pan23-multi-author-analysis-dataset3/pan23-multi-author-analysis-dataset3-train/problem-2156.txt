"You're under arrest for child cruelty, child engangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food, and misrepresenting the weight of livestock!".
Yup. That falls into the "extreme" and "commercial" category. A voting machine company lives and dies by their reputation for accuracy and reliability. Publicly lying about that is the kind of thing a company kind of has to take to court. You'd have to be a real idiot to lie about that.
Defamation is usually not a good suit, though. It's expensive, hard to prove, there are tons of exceptions, and usually all you get is a public brand of, "that person who was accused of X", which is nearly as bad as actually having been exposed as having done X. So it's usually self defeating.
Some states have "definition per se" where damages are assumed for certain kinds of allegations. Accusations of sexual impropriety and criminal acts are often in that list. No idea if any of that is relevant here, though.
There are exceptions, of course, especially for extreme and commercial speech, but it's not a great vehicle for handling political lies.
