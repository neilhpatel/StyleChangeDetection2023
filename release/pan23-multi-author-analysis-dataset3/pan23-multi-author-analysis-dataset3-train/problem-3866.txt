Yeah sorry if that was not clear, they already sent it to collections and I have received the small claims documents today. The collections company is the one pursuing small claims.
Also, I'm not really an expert on what water heater we should get to heat enough water for our home. Does not some of the responsibility lie with them for recommending something? They're the professionals/experts, after all.
I could hire someone to look at it at this point I suppose but it's been sitting outside(protected from rain) for 5 months now. I'm concerned with doing that, though, because the tank may be functioning fine and is just wholly inadequate for our water heating needs.
However, I am not blown away by your argument here that because you couldn't fill up a bath with hot water, the tank was broken or insufficient. I would suggest you look into the tank they sold you, how fast it heats, what its capacity is, and also the condition it's in after having been installed for only a day. It would be better to be able to argue that the tank really did break with something like a picture of the part that's broken. And I would drop "insufficient" and instead focus on the plumber's claim that it was the "equivalent" of what you had picked out at Lowe's. If it wasn't you should be able to find the specs and make that case better than just saying you wanted more and hotter water.
You should be able to get model numbers from the water heaters and look up specs. If the water heater they supplied is much smaller, even if they deny claiming it was "equivalent," a plumber should be able to testify that it was too small for your house/needs.
