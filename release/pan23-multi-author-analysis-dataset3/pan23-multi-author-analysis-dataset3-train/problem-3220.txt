The Mayan calendar ended in 2012. That in their culture never meant the end of the world, as pop culture had people believe, but a transformative event would happen near then that would radically alter the status quo. Sure seems like it happened.
Yup. Sounds about right. - But for political purposes, unless there's an immediate threat, I'd like to see some other countries to get some skin in the game.
Probably. It would just be nice to have seen Canada take it out, so it doesn't appear that's it's just the US going all out on the balloon popping game.
I wonder what the US/Canada coordination like like on this. I know we're close allies, but I'm surprised Canada wouldn't have taken the lead on this one.
Our two countries are so close that it feels like Canada is another US state. No country on earth would ever be allowed to shoot down objects in US/Canada airspace with their fighter jets.
It wasn't political to have US shoot it down. NORAD is a joint venture. If it was the other way around and it was in US airspace and a Canadian fighter jet was closer, NORAD would have a Canadian fighter jet shoot it down in US airspace.
Both US/Canadian fighter jets were scrambled from their bases & the order was, whoever got to the object first would take the shot, since the US airbase is closer than the Canadian airbase, the US got to it first and took the shot.
