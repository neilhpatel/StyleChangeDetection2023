Ahh shit yeah I forgot about Weld. I don't remember much about him but I don't remember anything bad. I forgot Romney came from here too lmao. I've only lived here about 2 years so I've only known Baker. Thanks for the refreshers.
I do agree with you. The Massachusetts GOP just cannot fuck around with the radical right. If their group gets tainted too, then they're screwed. We have very little tolerance for those kind of idiots here. I'm glad I live in a good state.
As someone who lives in Massachusetts, I don't even know why the GOP tries here at all. We just lost Baker as governor, one of the very, very few good Republicans, who also happened to be the most popular governor in the US according to opinion polling. Baker was a one in a million guy, we'll likely never see another Republican who could begin to achieve Baker level fame.
In any sane world, Baker would be the Republican nominee for President. Instead he was like "I'd rather deal with the clusterfuck that is the NCAA than try to appeal to the Republican base in red states.".
