OP you really need to bring what you have been sent to a lawyer. This is not really something Reddit can help you with aside from saying that yes you do need to get a lawyer. Depending on what it is and florida laws your result could be everything from a strongly worded letter will solve it all they to you lose the house.
You might get lucky and someone here knows florida law, but I donâ€™t think any advice you get is likely to negate the need for a lawyer.
You know what, if you are a named defendant in a suit that you know about, then I'd go see a Florida real estate lawyer. This probably shouldn't be a complicated matter, but I don't really know any facts.
I don't know what you mean by you purchased it "in foreclosure." I will assume you mean it was posted for a foreclosure, or a lawsuit was filed to foreclose, and you purchased the property from the owner who was in the process of getting foreclosed. When you did this, you normally would have purchased title insurance and they would have ensured that the lien(s) getting foreclosed would be paid off by your purchase price, and they should have procured a partial release of the lien before closing. Did that happen? If it didn't, then you need to consult an attorney to find out what's going on.
I'm not a Florida lawyer, but if it's like Texas, then the foreclosure sale wiped out any liens junior to the lien that was being foreclosed.
When you bought the house at the foreclosure auction, who was the Plaintiff in that action? Did you do a title search to check for any senior liens that would survive the sale?
