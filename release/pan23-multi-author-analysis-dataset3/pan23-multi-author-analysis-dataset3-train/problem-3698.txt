As you were a minor when the account was opened, you likely have a custodial account (UGMA/UTMA) or joint account. If it is a custodial account, your father is supposed to act in your best interest and you might have some recourse from a legal perspective. If it is a joint account, it will either be labeled tenants in common (JTIC) or tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS). I think that a JTIC account would mean that you have more rights to your share than a JTWROS but I could be mistaken. Regardless of account type, the bank did not do anything wrong and your only legal Avenue is to go after your father.
I'm sorry your parent is not trustworthy enough for you to have a joint account with them (it is not an uncommon issue sadly).
To tack onto this, some joint accounts are supposed to remove your parents when you turn 18, so I would clarify with the bank if that is what was supposed to happen.
Moving forward in life AVOID JOINT ACCOUNTS - people don't realize how much trust you put into someone when you have a joint account (until a parent or partner etc screws you over).
IF it is not joint than it was a banking error that he was allowed to move the money and the bank can fix it.
IF NOT than it probably depends on state laws (maybe you can get it all in vourt by proving it was all earned by you but MAYBE the funds are legally split 50-50 and you won't have to prove anything but will only get half. But maybe it's legal for any owner to drain a joint account).
If your father was a joint owner and signator on your account there's legally nothing you can do. It's a vile move on his part, but he's within his rights.
