Well, they put in all that effort of destroying cities and lives.... they've EARNED land that isn't theirs... /s.
I hope the countries supporting Ukraine begin to realize that rationing weapons and supplies is NOT helpful. Give them everything they need now and get started on NATO membership for Ukraine.
There's no way Ukraine gives up the opportunity to join NATO. That's pretty important to national security at this point, since future NATO membership would be the only thing stopping Russia from trying again in a decade or so.
I addressed that in another reply, but suffice it to say, I doubt NATO promises would withstand Russia shutting off Europe's gas tap and/or Putin threatening to lob a few hundred warheads in their direction.
Once they've thrown Russia out of the borders, besides nuclear threats, what can Russia plausibly do to have any grounds on which to negotiate? A broken army, increasing drone attacks into Russian territory, increasingly effective air defense over Ukraine, increasingly powerful Ukranian military... what are they going to do? I'd jokingly say "bleed on them?" but they've already gone past that in droves! Cry perhaps?
At the point that Ukraine has firm grasp over all of its territory (which is the only way Russia would accept any terms not granting them annexation), why would Ukraine seek peace on any terms short of unconditional Russian surrender?
That said, the point here is not to game out an Russo-Alaskan offensive, it is to point out that, had North America not rushed to Ukraine's defense, we would not be having this conversation at all today -- Kyiv would have fallen many months ago and Poland would have a new neighbor.
( I am slightly kidding, to make the point that North America rushed to Ukraine's defense to a much greater degree than the European Union did -- which ought to leave non-Polish Europeans bowing their heads in shame. ).
