Really goes to show how ideology can shift depending on the actual conditions of the people throughout history. Leftists appropriating discriminatory rethoric against colonial people that however become enforcers of Spanish conservative nationalism.
How did the nationalists relations withtheir African colonies in Morocco change after the war due to this fact and in general the role of the army of Africa?
Most general accounts of the civil war touch on Moroccan participation to some extent, but specialist work includes:
Before the start of the Civil War, Spain's presence in Morocco between the 1860s and 1920s was hard-fought and often contested by various segments of the populations of the Moroccan littoral, the Atlas mountains, and Western Sahara. Before the catastrophic loss of its Asian and American colonies in 1898, Spain had held towns on Morocco's Mediterranean coast and through treaties and limited military intervention maintained a presence in the region since the 16th century. With the loss of the colonies in 1898, Morocco became the focus of Spain's efforts to regain its imperial prestige. In several disastrous expeditions - the Second (1909) and Third (1911-12) Melilla Campaigns it had failed to make any military gains and secure the mountainous Rif and its rich mineral resources. The horrifying losses of life, equipment by the Army (mostly made up out of poor, illiterate metropolitan conscripts) to no meaningful gain spurred it to raise units in Melilla and Ceuta from the local population. These indigenuous troops were not conscripts, but professional soldiers, which their name - the Fuerzas Regulares Indigen√°s - attests.
