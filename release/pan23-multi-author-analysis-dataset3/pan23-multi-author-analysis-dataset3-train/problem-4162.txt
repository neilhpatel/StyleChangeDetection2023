Exaclty. They are Pashtun and many Pashtun do not care there is a border separating Afghanistan and Pakistan. They straddle the border and move pretty much freely between the two countries. The two groups are officially different groups, primarily with different missions. However, they are ethnically the same. One group runs the Afghan government now and the other is fighting against the Pakistani government.
If I remember correctly the Pakistan Taliban is different from the Taliban that currently rules Afghanistan, which is friendly with the Pakistani government.
If Afghan and Pak Taliban are so unrelated then why have Pak Taliban activities ramped up since the fall of Kabul?
May be the government is friendly but general view of Afghani about Pakistan is too low. Taliban definitely use this hatred for Pakistan as a tool to get public trust.
They both are same (atleast ethnically) But having different mission. One to rule Afghanistan and another one which is against pakistani establishment.
