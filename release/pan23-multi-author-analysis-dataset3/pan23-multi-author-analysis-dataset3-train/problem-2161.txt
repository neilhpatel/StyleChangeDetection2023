Attempting to lessen the damage from the ticket for yourself isn't somehow escaping liability for what happened, if that's what you're thinking -- it's just generally a smart way to approach a ticket. Pleading guilty and accepting the full consequences of the ticket because you feel guilty or remorseful isn't going to heal the pedestrian any faster, or change the outcome of whatever insurance decision, or anything like that.
The pedestrian could potentially sue you for their medical bills and damages or whatever. Will this pedestrian do that? Nobody here can know, but if they do, then you should inform and defer to your vehicle insurance to handle it.
No, the pedestrian cannot themselves press criminal charges. Only law enforcement/the DA can do that, and it seems at the moment they have chosen to do that by citing you with a ticket.
The ticket is what the cops/dmv/state will charge you with. It’s roughly the same as if you ran a stop sign and got caught. Your mom is wrong in that this is not a criminal case where you plead and they then decide guilt or punishment. If you go before a judge (ie, plead not guilty and ask to) he will simply look at the evidence - you hit a pedestrian in a crosswalk so clearly you “failed to yield” - and tell you to pay your fine.
The exact writing on the ticket is “failed to yield to pedestrian in a crosswalk.” And I understand that owning up to guilt won’t actually help anyone but would it possibly put me on bad footing with the judge? Would the pedestrian find out and possibly press charges? I guess this is all stuff I should be asking a traffic attorney.
