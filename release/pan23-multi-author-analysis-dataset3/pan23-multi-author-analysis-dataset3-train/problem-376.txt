I have contacts working on the war effort, and at the start of the winter, Ukrainian forces were stocked with what as supposed to be 3-4 months of ammunition from Nato partners to out last Russian offensives over the winter, they depleted the ammo in 3 weeks.
it's more likely pressure to divert eastern ukraine forces west, and could be used to start an offensive towards Kyiv which would probably be started by a false flag attack from russian forces, either a missile strike from the east or a bomb from the russian forces already stationed there.
If Russia had to respond by redeploying a proportionate amount of troops to the NATO borders then your idea would be effective, still incredibly risky that an accidental escalation would happen, but it would work.
Can you say the chances of an accidental escalation are worth taking over just giving Ukraine more weapons or sending NATO special forces in as “volunteers” the same way Russia sent their special forces on “vacation” to Crimea?
I don’t think giving Ukraine weapons, money and training is appeasement… I don’t think maintaining current troop numbers on the borders of nato is appeasement.
I don’t think NATO would directly intervene but arming an insurgency is a different matter. Remember Lukashenko lost the last election and the legitimate government now operates in exile. If the Belarusian people take up arms against Lukashenko then some countries in the west may be happy to supply them with stingers and anti tank weapons. A second conflict on Russia’s border and the potential for Russian bases in Belarus to come under attack would be a major liability for the Kremlin.
The situation in Belarus is so precarious that if they entered the war it could throw the entire country into its own civil war and insurgency. That’s not to say that Belarus will certainly not enter the war but the consequences for everyone involved would be catastrophic and most decision makers in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus seem to agree with this.
