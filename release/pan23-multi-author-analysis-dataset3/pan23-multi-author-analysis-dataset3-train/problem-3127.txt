I don't mean to sound alarmist. Rabies in the US is incredibily rare-and most disease is spread by racoons or bats in the US. Most likely, your doctor will contact animal control/the dept of health, who will advise them on what to do. I practice on the opposite side of the nation, but thats how the ED I rotated in handled it.
However, rabies is a truly awful disease. I have watched one man die from it-and it is the worst death I have ever witnessed. Rabies takes around 72 hours to incubate in muscle tissue-during which time vaccination and immunoglobulin is critical. After that, it spreads to the neevous system, after which it has essentially a 100% fatality rate.
And another reason to go to the doctor is to get propper antibiotics. All car and dog bites are treated with antibiotics because aome nasty bugs can live in their mouths. Typically, we prescribe augmentin (amoxicillin clauvaunate), but I'm in a different field of medicine, so the guidelines may have changed.
Don't bother going to the sherriff for now-I doubt most cops know much about this. This is where the dept of health steps in. But please take your kid to see a doctor.
I suggest taking your kid to the doctor asap. Let them know what happened, and that you have been unable to get confirmation of up to date rabies vaccination. They should be able to advise you on the safest course of action for your son. If nothing else, they can preemptively treat him for rabies and then you won't be working against the clock. If you can't get in to the pediatrician in the next 24hours ( tell them WHY you need an emergency appointment) they may direct you to an urgent care or emergency room. Hopefully you can avoid that though..
