As for why states didn't name themselves after their rulers, force of precedent was one thing, but a number of imperial states were ultimately named after the regions they came from or the earlier ducal titles of their founders. Han 漢 is so named because its first ruler had a fief on the Han River; the Khitan state of Liao 遼 originated from the Liao river region. [Sun] Wu 吳 was founded in the territory of the former Warring States state of Wu. [Cao] Wei 魏 was so named because its founder, Cao Pi, had inherited his father's title of King of Wei; Tang 唐 was founded by the Dukes of Tang. Some states, however, particularly the later ones that formally used Da 大 ('Great'), chose names with symbolic significance. The Jurchen state under the Wanyan clan called itself Jin 金, 'golden'; the Mongols of the Toluid branch of the Chinggisid line chose Yuan 元 'primordial, original'; Zhu Yuanzhang, leader of the Red Turbans, chose Ming 明, 'bright'; and the Aisin Gioro leaders of the Manchus chose 清, 'pure'.
In what context, though? Are they referring to the imperial household, or to the state? If the latter then it would be inaccurate to call the Ming state the 'Zhu clan', but it's entirely legitimate for the former.
I’ve seen multiple sources use Zhu or Liu clan, as opposed to Ming and Han Dynasty. It seems to be that some prefer this alternative because it’s clearer than just not capitalizing dynasty, but do you think this terminology is equivalently accurate?
