In other words, when the 40m water bulge is on top of the land, it's been going up meter by meter for the last 20 minutes. water is rushing in at an incredible, destructive rate, and some geographic features like inlets or buildings cause some places to get a surge in seconds, but in general the "wave" peaks some 25 minutes after the wave starts.
it's more like the water is rising and rising at an alarming speed, until it breaks through whatever containment there was and pushes further into the land, reversing river flows and it just keeps rising and rising with no end in sight.
if you look at video footage of the 2011 tsunami you'll realize that the idea of a tsunami hitting land as a giant wave isn't what it really is.
The "submerged" tsunamis can get really fast, while (afaik) the tsunami which you might picture in your head (when the wave is piling itself up) has comparatively much lower speeds.
"The deeper the water; the faster the tsunami. In the deep ocean, tsunamis can move as fast as a jet plane, over 500 mph, and can cross entire oceans in less than a day. As the waves enter shallow water near land, they slow to the speed of a car, approximately 20 or 30 mph.".
