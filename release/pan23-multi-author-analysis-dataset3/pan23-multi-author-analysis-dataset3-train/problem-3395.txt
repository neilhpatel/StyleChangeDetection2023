I think you're a bit off on your dates. The La Chapelle-aux-Saints "Old Man" was found in 1908. At the time it was the most complete set of remains that had been found.
Boule's reconstruction of the La Chapelle-aux-Saints "Old Man" Neanderthal would be published in 1911 and probably played as big a role as anything in shaping scientific and public perceptions of Neandertals.
1) The general belief in the "primitive-ness" or "apeness" of the Neanderthals, due to them being the first pre-modern human fossils ever found. The first Neanderthal skulls were found even before Darwin' published Origin of Species, so you have to remember that a lot these early interpretations were based upon the lack of the fossil record, how humans evolved (or if they evolved at all), and an over emphasis on "primitive" traits seen in the Neanderthal and H. heidelbergensis fossils. Many of these early fossils were found in caves, which drove the "caveman" conception.
Could it be that this image of cavemen is much older? I've found this description of prehistoric man from "The Nature of the Things" by Lucretius():
Check out "Debating humankind's place in nature, 1860-2000 : the nature of paleoanthropology" by Richard Delisle. Its talks about the history of the study of human evolution, including the dark parts. It also includes a whole mess of early human phylogenies, to show how conceptions changed over time, particularly in the 19th-early 20th century.
