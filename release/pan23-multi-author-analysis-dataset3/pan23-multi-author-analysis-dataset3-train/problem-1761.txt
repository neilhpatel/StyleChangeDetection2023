But it took time for the effects to be proven. According to the Congressional Research Service's 2014 report(2), veterans first started making claims to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) in 1977. In 1979, Congress enacted several laws to examine the potential links between Agent Orange and long-term health effects and disabilities. Unfortunately, the Federal government did not appropriately implement these laws, with the CDC abandoning attempts to release a study report in 1987.
Two statutes have been enacted to compensate veterans exposed to Agent Orange: the Veterans’ Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-542); and the Agent Orange Act (P.L. 102-4) enacted in 1991. And a class action filed in 1986, Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans’ Administration(3), alleged that veterans' claims for service-related disabilities connected to Agent Orange had been improperly denied. In 1989, the District Court held that the VA had improperly been using too stringent a standard in looking at the statistical correlation between Agent Orange and long-term health implications, and invalidated the VA regulations. The 1991 Agent Orange Act was a result of this case.
The first hearing on the potential health implications of Agent Orange was held by the Senate in 1970, so concerns about the potential effects of Agent Orange existed even at the time it was in use.
The latter part - halting the use of Agent Orange and using Agent White instead - tracks with your mention of a senate hearing on the health effects of Agent Orange in 1970.
