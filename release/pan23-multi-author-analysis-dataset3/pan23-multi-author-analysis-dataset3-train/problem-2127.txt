Replacing the military leadership has already happened and we've seen quite a bit of improvement in the strategic decisions Russia is making, especially on the eastern front.
The only reason Putin is still fighting it is because withdrawing would be an acknowledgement of his failure, which will most likely mean the end of his leadership.
If Putin dies, his successor has a choice: keep fighting an unwinable war and make Putin's failure your own, or withdraw and blame all those mistakes on Putin.
My point was he started that reasoning at the end by saying they are only not killing Putin with a bullet in the head because Putin is making a mistake. That's a Ludacris statement. No country on earth outside of Russia has the ability to put a bullet in putins head without starting a war that will kill millions in their own country in response.
Final thing of note: killing a head of state, even when you're at war, is seen by the international community as a big no-no. Ukraine might be willing to do it anyway, but there would probably be consequences.
It's the idea that the world is aiding Ukraine in self defense. If the world armed Ukraine to attack INTO Russia, then Russia claims they have the right to use nukes. But Ukraine attacking Russia on their own ground is going to be the only way this war ends.
As for the perspective thing I mentioned: I imagine Ukraine just wants a quick end to the war, so Putin dying would be great for them.
Nothing to be afraid of, my G. Either we have a brief nuclear exchange where only the East Coast dies or we give to Putin's demands and everybody dies.
