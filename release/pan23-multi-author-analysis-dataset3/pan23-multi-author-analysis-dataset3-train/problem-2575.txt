Not every mistake is malpractice. The distinction depends on subtle details, and is more complicated than this sub can really help with. You'd need to consult a malpractice attorney, who can review the whole case in detail and give you advice.
I’m listening and will likely talk to an attorney. I wanted just something potentially more in depth.
My employer knew about my history of ADHD, GAD and was recently also diagnosed with major depressive disorder back in August from my general practitioner. Similar to the women in the article. This is why I went to see that psychiatrist, he felt it wasn’t ADHD but bipolar and why he prescribed the topamax. Yet never asked about or referenced my medical history. None of this ever occurred to me either until the other day when I was talking to my psychiatrist at the VA who now says I suffer from PTSD and borderline personality disorder. However I am doing better now. He also said that the way I was initially treated was wrong. They threw all types of meds at me from the start instead of one medication at a time and seeing how I well I reacted to it. I am only on Zolof now but in the beginning I was immediately put on adderall, lexapro and xanax. Then a year later buspar was added. It was when I say the psychiatrist and he thought it was bipolar, he took me off adderall and replaced it with topamax and increased my dosage of lexapro and buspar.
I experienced later on after I got off topamax and took the new dosage of lexapro and buspar. It caused me to have panic attacks. Specifically I took them one morning, drove to work and by the time I parked my car, I was sweating profusely and felling like my hands and arms were vibrating. This is in the winter and has my doors opened because I was sweating so much and had to call into work. I was off work for two days because of that experience.
