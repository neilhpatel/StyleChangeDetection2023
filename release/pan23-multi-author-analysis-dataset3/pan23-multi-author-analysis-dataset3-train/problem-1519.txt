Because this isn't news. Ted Cruz said it on a national presidential debate, this same bill was filed during the last Republican majority, the last Republican Education Secretary said it just last year, and Trump himself called for the abolishing of the department.

If Republicans actually had a platform I would be shocked if abolishing the department wasn't on it.

What will happen is Republicans will have a meeting, to determine who will vote against the bill with Democrats…you know, as a pathetic attempt to look semi-sane.
It’s possibly to show ‘bipartisanship’ with all democrats and a good amount of repubs voting against it. Then they can parade that they are working with the dems, but the dems won’t work with them on other bills, and they can blame them for not wanting bipartisanship.
Eh we have Lisa Murkowski here in Alaska, I don’t agree with all of her politics but she seems to want to work with Democrats to pass things that benefit her constituents instead of just refusing to negotiate. There aren’t many but there are some.
