On the evening of Feb 2019 my Mother In Law took my truck out to buy some groceries and got my truck stuck in a ditch. (You can explain this with sworn testimony and also evidence - e.g. receipt from grocery store, CCTV etc. all way too late now I imagine).
The odds are stacked against you. They hear the old "I wasn't driving honest guv" All. The. Time. You being there, by your truck, over the limit is going to be very hard to overturn. The nagging doubt at the back of the judges mind will be "either he was driving, or he was intending to drive".
This comes off vague as far as 'highway patrol says there was no evidence that I was driving'. But ultimately the judge can interpret the facts as he sees fit. That's his role.
Your recourse is to hire an attorney to challenge this or continue appealing yourself. I'm sorry if that's unsatisfying.
No, I apologize and appreciate your insight. I’m just utterly frustrated and I feel like I’m going crazy, trying to wrap my mind around all this… thank you again.
