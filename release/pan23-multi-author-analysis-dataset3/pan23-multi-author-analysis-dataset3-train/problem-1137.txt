Also, Biden's savvy and goodwill among his fellow senators while acting as VP and whipping votes for the ACA was a big influence on its eventual passing.
In fact, the more you dislike Democratic policy and Biden the more important your participation in the primaries, as that's where policy is most easily influenced.
There's plenty of things to disagree with Biden on, but theres a huge effort to push people away from the polls.
I don't agree with Joe Biden on everything; but I can say he is absolutely correct about this. Fascism and antisemitism should have no place in our modern world.
Indeed â€” only one side is courting and defending fascists. Democrats aren't perfect by any stretch of the imagination...but at least they know to unquestionably unequivocally denounce Nazism and anyone who espouses it.
Well you do know that the 1/6 Committee is only an investigatory body, right? They don't have any ability to charge/prosecute. And they've announced that they will be filing their full report and giving it to the Justice Dept. before Christmas (before the new Republican House is sworn in in January as they'd have shut down the Committee anyway). I'm pretty sure once the Justice Dept. has the full investigation, we will see an increase in action against those responsible.
I admit, there is absolutely reason to be skeptical about holding powerful people accountable for their blatantly obvious crimes...that being said, while Attorney General Garland has been seemingly obsessed with the visage of not being "partisan"...to his credit, he follows the facts. And the 1/6 Committee has been gathering facts that I think lead to one inescapable conclusion. Thus, I am choosing to remain cautiously optimistic that Garland will follow the investigation he is about to be presented with to what I see as its inevitable outcome.
