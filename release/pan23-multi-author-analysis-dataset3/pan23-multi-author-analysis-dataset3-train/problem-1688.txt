A) Part of the whole problem with the invasion of Ukraine is that countries resolving disputes via war is not great and every single one that happens makes more of them easier. B) Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution would make such an action highly legally questionable.
Calling for war isn't a viable solution, Japan isn't even able to declare wars as per Article 9 of their constitution.
Besides, regardless of how russia is, this isn't a illegal occupation. It was given to them after World War II when they invaded it just before Japan's surrender. Its also worth noting that Japan entirely was occupied by the U.S for a while. Its like saying Russia is occupying Kalinigrad.
So you can argue that Ukraine War also has shown that waging war against a squatter like Russia is A-OK with Russia's landgrab of Crimea.
So these countries can now claim "self defense" to remove "an illegal occupier"... you know: same thing Ukraine is doing right now.
Consider that Russia is currently bombing the shit out of Ukraine and making life a living hell for Ukrainians... They may lose the war but they're going to destroy a lot of property and lives in the process.
