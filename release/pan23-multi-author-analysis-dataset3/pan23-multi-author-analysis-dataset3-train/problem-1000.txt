Absolutely fucking absurd. This is what Elon did with the Twitter files too by the way. Both Elon and McCarthy whined and whined about how all this info should be released to the public. Then, they didn't release it to the public! They released it to a right wing journalist who then only releases parts of it that support a right wing narrative.
also, Tiabbi is not a fucking right wing journalist and the fact that you even suggest that he is shows the limits of the news you are exposing yourself to.
The left has stood by silently for 2 years while the feds put a seal on the Capitol footage, police officer cam footage, etc, only opening up to share that footage with a handpicked documentary crew and a 100% partisan committee, both of which have shared little but editorialized tid bits.
Also, Elon's publicity is way worse now than it was a couple years ago, so I don't think this is about publicity. He knew he would get trashed in the legacy media and publically pointed this out before he started down this path.
What do you think I am falling for? The Twitter Files are not heavy on commentary. It's mostly just sharing internal Twitter communications about past decisions and sharing communications they had with government agencies and politicians, mostly about the topic of censorship. If you know of anything that has been falsified, then I have an open mind to look at that. But to my knowledge, nobody whose communications have been shared have come out to claim they didn't actually say what was revealed. So, it just seems like you don't like the message.
