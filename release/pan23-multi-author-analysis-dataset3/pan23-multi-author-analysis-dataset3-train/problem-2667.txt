I asked a friend of mine about this, she is a zoo-archaeologist researching into the history of animal domestication, mainly focusing on dogs. Here is a short summary of what she had to say on OPs question, bearing in mind it's coming solely from an archaeology perspective:
She also referenced a paper by , Figure 2 shows timings of some of oldest known dog remains across the world, including a rather barren SSA in this respect.
Which means that even if we don't find the dog bones themselves, if we know about how humans are migrating or trading between Africa and the Middle East etc., then we can try to predict when we'd expect dogs to arrive because we know once people have dogs, they almost always move around with them. ".
The important thing to know is that all dogs are domesticated from the Eurasian grey wolf and there are no grey wolves in SSA or really even in Africa at all besides Egypt. So all dogs across all of Africa would have been brought there by people.
The OP is right in thinking that people used and still use hunting dogs in the Congo. The (landrace) breed is the Basenji. It would be interesting to know if extant ancient breeds from the Sahara, Sicily and the Near East (e.g. sloughis, Pharaoh Hounds and others) ever contributed to the genome of the Basenji. Not to mention the now extinct hunting hounds of the ancient Egyptians. I would be surprised if no dog-mummies were ever found from which DNA could be extracted and compared to Basenjis and other African breeds.
