Don't ever consent to a search of your car. Just say no. You owe them no explanation for why you are saying no.
This wasn't the hill to die on and you made a wise decision not getting arrested over this. Police officers have wide latitude to control the movement of persons involved in a traffic stop, for officer safety. He would explain to a judge that he wanted you sitting so that he didn't have to worry as much about you wandering into traffic, or attacking him from behind or running off the moment he found the illegal drugs or weapon in the car.
They could find contraband that someone else left in your car that you didn't even know was there. They could plant evidence. They could break your stuff. They could steal your stuff. And searches delay you and take time. And, as you learned, they can make you sit in wet grass during a search.
If they have probable cause to search, they'll search it regardless of whether you consent. Mere "nervousness" wouldn't give probable cause to search.
According to your description, it doesn’t sound like the police had probable cause to search. In general, it’s a good idea not to give up your rights voluntarily. By stating you refuse to give permission, if the cop goes ahead anyway they’d have to prove probable cause or anything found could be tossed.
