In a resolution on Monday, the Hungarian Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee condemned the removal of the mythical Turul bird statue in Mukachevo (Munkács), Ukraine, and called on the Ukrainian government to distance itself from the action. In its resolution, the body said it was shocked to learn of the “scandalous circumstances” of the removal of the Turul statue in the Transcarpathian city.
In the resolution, the body therefore reiterated its concern about the systematic harassment of legitimate organizations of the Hungarian community in Transcarpathia and the official actions aimed at intimidating their democratically elected leaders.
