Three weeks ago? OK, maybe it was 1+ year, but if three weeks, something seems very odd. Typically it would take that long to get someone appointed representative.
The proceeds would go into the trust. The Trust Agreement would determine how the trust assets are to be distributed after his death. If he died just three weeks ago, it will take a little time to have the successor trustee come in and administer the trust.
If all the estate assets are held in the name of the Trust and if the Trust is private, you may not know the name of the Successor Trustee.
IF your Son is a beneficiary of the Trust, he should eventually be contacted by the Successor Trustee who will / should inform him of the the Trust assets and the names of the Trust Beneficiaries.
I suppose you could call the Grandfather's attorney or you could get the name of the attorney who helped him sell the property before he died (it would be on the Deed). Usually you can get a copy of a recorded deed off the County's Recorder's website.
