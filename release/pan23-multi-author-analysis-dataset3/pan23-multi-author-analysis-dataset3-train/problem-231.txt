I figured it may be hard or impossible, but he does want to try, even just to tell the child later on in life that he had made the effort.
I do understand why the adoptive parents would not want him in the child's life. It's a bad situation all around, and he just wants his kids to know and grow up together.
You're going to start then with an adversarial relationship with the kids' parents. Think about how that's going to be.
Because he's a strange man who's only linked to their child is genetic code. They don't know anything about him other than he was supposedly a deadbeat father who didn't bother to learn that he had a kid for years. They have likely heard horror stories about biological parents breezing into the lives of adopted kids and acting as a source of fun and presents without needing to do things like discipline. Then the adoptive parents are the bad guy and they don't need that challenge.or absentee biological parents who come in, bond with the kid, and vanish again.
When the adoptive parents adopted the child, it had only one legal parent, so only her parental rights were terminated. His parental rights never existed and very probably never will.
He did none of those things, so he was never the child's legal father. The fact that he was not given the opportunity is not relevant; that's what the registry is for under law, and what committed intimate relationships are for in practice.
