Title: Is it still possible for me to my tickets dropped (Expired registration, tint too dark, and no proof of insurance) with warnings for both fake ID possession and speeding?
Tickets for expired registration; missing insurance card,etc., are often dismissed simply by showing that you are now in compliance. Get everything renewed and show up to your court date with proof and ask for a dismissal.
You need to talk to a lawyer if you want anything dismissed. If you received verbal warnings, the only way that would come to light is via the law officer that issued the. Be prepared if you go to court, an that officer testifies, they might have a notebook in which the keep info to testify from. If it was a written warning, it will be in the system until said time that the warning expires.
Depending on your community, you may be able to go to your county/district attorney and show proof of registration and insurance. You might be able to get it dismissed at that time.
