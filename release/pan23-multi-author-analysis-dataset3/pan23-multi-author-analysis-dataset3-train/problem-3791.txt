My first thought (years ago) was this wasn't super fair. They're people too, and they should be allowed to make money in the stock market just like me.
Then I found out bank employees are restricted from buying and selling stock. And as a recent example I'm not allowed to buy or sell stock for my company outside of the stock offering plan. And literally nobody has a problem with that because duh.
That’s the problem. The Center right (which is what most of the “liberal” parties are in the west), don’t actually want to solve the root causes of the support for fascism, because it would result in diminishing power and wealth for themselves, and because by keeping them around, they can get worse and worse, while being the “reasonable alternatives”.
Why was fascism the result of various right-wing elements backing authoritarians rather than people being bribed into become authoritarians?
You can see it with conservatives and how many faces get eaten by leopards. You can see it with liberals and how many are angry about the SALT cap, etc.
Actually, it looks like it started with letting politicians buy corporations. Specifically in Russia. More specifically, in Russia during the 1990s. Even more specifically, in Russia during the 1990s at fire sale prices.
(Though, on this front, the funniest to me was always conservatives who work for government complaining about their tax bill. My guy, your tax bills is -$65,000. They fucking pay you on net!).
Mm yes. I agree. Both sides of the aisle in Ukraine were garbage. It's almost like the political class of that country is corrupt and it's hilarious that we're toting them as bastions of western democracy when really they were just an easy way for US and european elites to launder foreign aid checks into their own personal paydays.
