If you didn't have insurance coverage at the time then pay the fine and stop driving without insurance.
If you had insurance and just didnt have your insurance card on you, just bring it with the ticket and they'll almost always dismiss the ticket.
Read the back of your ticket, if you bring the ticket and proof of insurance before your court date, you will have the charge dropped.
Print out proof of insurance that you had on the car at the date of the ticket. This is usually easiest done by going to your insurance company's website and printing out the card.
Take the proof of insurance and the ticket to the Clerk Of Courts. Explain the reason you got the ticket and why you're there. Give them the insurance information, let them make a copy of it and possibly the ticket. That should be the end of it, but ask if you're still required to come to court since you've now provided proof of insurance.
Also, like someone else pointed out, complain to their department / supervisor ASAP about their procedure. If you're a citizen of their jurisdiction, I would especially emphasize how the K9 cop stated he doesn't trust their trained dog: is this what your tax money is paying for - inadequately trained, incompetent police dogs used as an excuse to harass citizens? Why the hell did you have to take TWO sobriety tests?! It wasn't like you drank alcohol after the first one proved you were fine... Maybe even threaten to call the news about their behavior if the authority you speak with seems dismissive.
