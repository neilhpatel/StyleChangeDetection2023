Ukraine military also inherited the old Soviet doctrine but they've performed much better. Part of that must be the morale boost of fighting for your homeland. But even with that it seems their tactics and strategies are superior to the Russians.
The Russians did use some brilliant counter attacks and out maneuvered the Germans. Ultimately though, it was the constant feeding of new soldiers into the fight that won the battle of Stalingrad.
Numbers is how Russia has always fought their wars. They throw bodies at the problem, an astounding number of them, until they either overwhelm the opposing force or lose too many and are forced to retreat. Look at the battle of Stalingrad, they won that battle, but took horrendous losses.
The Russians denied the Germans what they needed most: space. Germans liked to use artillery and aerial bombardment. Those were, eventually, denied to the Germans as the Russians kept feeding soldiers, like meat into a grinder, toward the German lines. The average Russian solider was on the battle field for 24 hours before he was wounded or killed. When a Russian soldier fell out, another was put in his place. The Russian's actually ran low on rifles and at some points and were only able to equip their soldiers with the rifles of wounded/killed soldiers.
I read reports that Russian artillery was still using "fire in order you receive coordinates" rather than allowing doing things like counter-battery fire.
