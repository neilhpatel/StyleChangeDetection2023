They suspended involvement in November. Terminating their membership now. They're feeling some sense of security from a partner to continue pushing Russia out of their lives.
If this is so predictable, why do the Russians keep cooperating? Because they have no other choice. The Russians need some sort of victory to salvage the reputation of their leader. They canâ€™t simply go on the defensive themselves, it would look like an admission of defeat.
The Ukrainians, on the other hand, have been fighting cleverly - they have no other choice, if they want to win. Their counter-attacks have been limited and effective, they have avoided over-extending themselves. They let Russia grind its army down with blunt offensives against prepared positions, maybe gradually losing minor territory (and admittedly suffering themselves, albeit to a much lesser degree). Then, when the Russian army is weak, the morale of its troops at a low ebb, and Ukrainian forces concentrated - they will strike.
Most people here disagreed with me, arguing that Ukraine ought to keep up the momentum and keep conducting offensives until the last Russian soldier ran for the border.
Early predictions about the war were that Ukraine would be overwhelmed, but would fight a deadly insurgency for however long it took to drive Russia out; that there was no way Russia could occupy and hold a country that was never going to accept their rule.
On this day, I wish Ukraine all the best in defending what is clearly their homeland, and also wish all the Russian soldiers who don't support what's happening but are forced to fight anyway a quick and safe end to the war sometime soon.
