Yeah, and if we were at war or nearing a state of war with China, then setting up bases on those islands to help reinforce a naval blockade is absolutely something we might try to persuade those countries to let us do.
But we're not at war, and we're certainly not trying to start one by doing anything as provocative as trying to impede China's access to the Pacific Ocean or (militarily) laying the groundwork to impede it in the future.
I don't think China is actually ready for a full scale war, neither is NATO, but China was hoping for the surprise and the divided attention to get a quick win in the Pacific.
Which is why I said Island Chain Strategy isn't really something the west is pursuing, or even considering now that the Cold War is over, but the possibility is still quite dominant in Chinese thinking.
Its also reasonable that the USA does whatever it can to prevent (or at the very least delay in some measure) getting steamrolled economically by China over the comings years and decades.
Realistically, in the short term it will hit China but according to most experts it will just slow their progress until they get less reliant on the u.s.
