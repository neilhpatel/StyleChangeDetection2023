And they will continue going unpunished. If the Republicans have power, they will protect them - and if the Democrats have power, they won't prosecute their political opponents (that would look corrupt).
I mean, more than half of GOP legislators did vote to throw out the election results despite knowing they were legitimate, which is tantamount to abolishing our democracy, so most of them are worthy of punishment.
I’m the guy who was agreeing with you, buddy. I was just pointing out that even though “key” is far more often used to specify a small minority than it is to specify a supermajority, it still adds something here. But because a supermajority of the GOP in the House was in fact involved in trying to end our democracy, the general anger at the GOP is pretty reasonable.
Anyhow, just saying “GOP legislators” with no linkage word to what they’re being accused of (the role “key” plays in the headline) would make it sound like the author believes people should be punished solely for being GOP legislators after January 6th happened. Instead of just most of them, for being traitors.
Then why would so many traitors be re-elected? Why did the party that encourages the collapse of democracy have the majority in the house of reps?
