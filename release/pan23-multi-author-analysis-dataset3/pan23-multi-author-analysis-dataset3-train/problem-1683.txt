Considering that it was composed of the most noble and powerful families in Rome, why did it never give itself the legislative power it clearly craved, as exemplified by the killing of the Gracchi and, eventually, Caesar? Why even go into this arrangement in the first place?
That's a fascinating detail to know. So essentially the Senate relied on it having auctoritas, but not potestas?
While a senatus consultum (opinion of the Senate) wasn't law, it could be used as legal precedent. Cicero used a senatus consultum to execute the conspirators aligned with Catiline in 63 BCE. Clodius prosecuted Cicero for that execution based on a lex, which prosecution forced Cicero to flee the city, so you can see the relative strenh of the two, senatus consultum and lex. Cicero was later recalled though.
The Roman Senate was absolutely not a legislative assembly. They were a body of advisors who offered advice to magistrates. They often advised on legislation the magistrate might present to the popular assembly or the centuriate assembly, which both WERE legislative assemblies, but they could not make law.
In practice, magistrates would often not bring a proposed law to the popular assembly if the Senate had not issued an opinion supporting it. The Gracchi and Caesar both violated this custom, with different effect. The Senate lynched both the Gracchi while Caesar.... well, was Caesar.
