This current pandemic is falling on a presidential election year in the United States. How did the 1918-1920 flu pandemic affect the 1920 presidential election?
What were state responses to previous pandemics like? I was specifically thinking of the 1665 outbreak of bubonic plague in England but am curious if any large scale intervention efforts existed in the past, considering people on the whole were less scientifically literate.
Regarding large scale government intervention on a global scale— the first example that comes to my mind is the Third Bubonic Plague Pandemic which ran from 1855-1959, but was at its height in the 1890’s and the first decade of the 1900’s.
So, in sum; early on there was very little, but in the 16th and 17th centuries, central governments became slowly more able to apply some of the same public health measures to control the spread of epidemic that we see today. They had to fight against decentralization, and there was basically no international cooperation in most cases.
Also part of this particular outbreak is travel restrictions. "By September 1623 it had spread south of Jonkoping in Sweden and the king again ordered the governors of Norway and Skane to prevent travellers from entering." (Christensen) This didn't stop the plague from entering Denmark, but it is a fairly impressive public health measure, when it was followed (e.g. smuggling very often crosses quarantine borders and was a vector for disease transmission).
