They claim Schiff is lying because what he's saying is the opposite of what Bill Barr said ("No Trump collusion"), and thus Schiff MUST be lying, because Barr is one of them, and so he's always truthful. The rest of us know it's BARR that's actually lying...
No, all politicians do not lie. That is such a pernicious and lazy thing to write. It may be true that it is increasingly difficult to find a politician who doesn't lie but that simply does not justify the statement. We live in a representative democracy. We Constitutionally rely on politicians to make decisions that impact our lives. The continued acceptance that "all politicians lie" as some obvious truth is a big part of what is destroying this country. It is a huge part of why Trump was elected President.
That's not Trump. He lies impulsively, he lies in a manner that routinely creates far more problems for him than it solves, and he cannot control or stop himself.
All politicians lie, obviously, but usually they do it strategically. They do it towards a goal. They do a risk calculation before telling a lie to figure out if the risk is worth the reward. This is, if not ethical, very normal behavior.
The lack of paying anyone definitely doesn't help him, but Trump cannot be truthful to save his life. Literally. He doesn't lie strategically. He lies impulsively, and he has no memory of what he's already lied about in the past.
This guy is a pathological liar. Santos is a trainee compared to him. Lying is in his DNA. It dont matter if he lies to a sanitation officer, a judge or the American public. It don't mean squat.
