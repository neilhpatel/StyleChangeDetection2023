Quote : "Iseman says he pumped a few grams of sulfur dioxide into weather balloons and added what HE ESTIMATED would be the right amount of helium to carry them into the stratosphere.
He expected they would burst under pressure at that altitude and release the particles. But it’s NOT CLEAR whether that happened, WHERE the balloons ended up, or WHAT impact the particles had, because there was NO MONITORING EQUIPMENT on board the balloons. Iseman also acknowledges that they did NOT SEEK ANY APPROVALS from government authorities or scientific agencies, in Mexico or elsewhere, before the first two launches.
“This was firmly in science project territory,” he says, adding: “Basically, it was to confirm that I COULD DO IT.".
Uh. I do not remember the Dinosaurs being a kids' show. Like, it wasn't r-rated or anything, but it was more of a sitcom than a kids' show.
I didn't say it was a kids' show with adult humor, I'm saying it wasn't a kids' show. No children I knew liked or watched it. It was one of our parents' shows.
