5,000 years ago, Yahweh taught Abraham that his faith could be only proved by a willingness to do reprehensible violence against an innocent child. That lesson has been taken to heart - and often acted upon - by many Abahamic sects over the ensuing millenia.
This is understandable, if not effective as governance. Churchy people have been known to resort to extreme violence when their beliefs or their (self-proclaimed) special status is threatened.
The legal yardstick for tax-exempt status isn't size or volume of revenues. It's whether a church engages in political activities incompatible with its status.
It is an interesting wrinkle of yourself vs people that identify as Christian don't go to church but use the church perceived stance on political issues.
I think all the handwringing on the left about the right establishing a Christian theonomy is overblown. With more independent and even Republican voters becoming more socially liberal, a shift away from that is not going to be good for the Republican Party.
