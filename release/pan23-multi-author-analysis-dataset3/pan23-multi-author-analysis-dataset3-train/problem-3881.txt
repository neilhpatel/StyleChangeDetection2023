And is not not a little bit disrespectful and / or misleading (questions like the one from OP do appear from time to time) to use this exonym? I understand it would also be misleading to call them the Roman Empire, since that is more commonly associated with the predecessor. But surely it would be more accurate.
we can say that for the first part, yes, we have evidence of this. As to what date they considered to be the beginning of their State, it certainly wasn't 395 as the article states, but was thought of more as a direct continuity from the founding of Rome.
and goes on to define East and West as separate States with the end of the reign of Theodosius as being the start date of the 'Empire'. The people at the time didn't view it this way. When Justinian went on to conquer lost territories he did so to recover Roman lands for the Roman State that existed long before Justinian or Theodosius or even Constantine, who some also like to use as a start date. Thus, the use of the year 395 to date the beginning of a new State entity is incorrect.
I agree with you when you say it was strictly used for monarchs on their level. Where I disagree is when you say it is similar to the English word Emperor as it suggests more of a titular head of an Empire vs something like Shahanshah/King of Kings which the Romans themselves acknowledged as more of an equal.
By the Middle Ages the meaning of this word had changed however, and it became much more similar to the English word "Emperor".
First, it helps to understand that both the terms 'Byzantine' and 'Empire' are both modern terms used to describe something that thought of itself differently.
Also, did the way the locals and nobles referred to the Byzantine empire change over the centuries? If yes, how?
