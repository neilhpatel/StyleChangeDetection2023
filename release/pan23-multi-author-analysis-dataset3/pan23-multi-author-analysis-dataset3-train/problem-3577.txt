The owner is paying for the company to handle issues with their units, such as dealing with plumbers.
The landlord pays more for these services, but he does not have to do any work or spend any time managing trades.
And I mean, the tenant is "paying more" than they would pay to DIY or hire someone themselves if they owned their own home, because the rent has to cover all these costs and make the landlord a profit.
If the reason it's not working is because of something beyond regular use (tenant's negligence or damage) then you can charge the tenant the cost of the repair and not more. The tenant could just refuse to pay, the LL would have to take them to the LTB for the cost, and the landlord would have to prove that the damage was the tenant's fault and demonstrate the cost.
If you're talking about rental property that's under the Residential Tenancies Act, the landlord has an obligation to maintain the property. If you're talking about a condo and you work for condo management, you can disregard my comment since I know nothing about condos.
Basically the law allows a landlord to charge for damages. The extra $100 +HST is an illegal charge since extra charges are not permitted unless they are the ones listed in the RTA and its regulations.
