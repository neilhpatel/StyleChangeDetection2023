The main guilty party here is Qatar itself, they are not doing it for the profits and tbh looking at everything, this only has made their image look worse, I know way more about their human rights abuses now than before they got the World Cup.
"Yes Qatar treats people like disposable garbage and let dozens, hundreds, if not thousands die to prepare for the World Cup... But hey Let's forget about that and play some ball".
"But anyway, let's forget this" is an all-time quote. I have no idea if Portugal's president was popular before this but his career is over. Because _something_ terrible is going to happen in Qatar: you know, I know, this damn fool should know it. QATAR DOES NOT RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS Gee, I wonder how that's gonna work out over the next month when a woman takes off her hijab?
Seriously. It's a massive mistake. They _could_ have gotten away with beating women for not wearing hijabs, or for beating gay dudes for kissing, or beating journalists for reporting, or beating fans for bad behavior.
But you know "___ fan chugs beer in defiance of Qatari security" is going to happen. And it's probably gonna end up a tragedy, on live TV. (Can you wager on which fan base is gonna make Qatari security violate the Geneva Convention?).
Yep. I used to be a huge (American) football fan until I realized that we are literally spending more on sports bullshit than human well being.
