Massachusetts is a "two-party consent" state, meaning that both people must agree to record a call. If you did not get consent, do not disclose that you recorded the call. It is a felony under the Wiretapping laws.
Sounds like you're well on your way to a harassment charge to go alongside your illegal wiretapping charge.
It's unclear whether you're owed your money back, given that you were never an employee. Someone with OSHA experience will hopefully reply to you, but from what you linked and other research I have done, everything applies to employers and employees. You were never an employee, and they were not your employer. So the question is whether a potential employer must pay for training for a potential employee. That seems doubtful.
You likely will have better luck suing the recruiter / recruiting company based on promissory estoppel, which is to say you acted based on their promise. However, your illegal recordings will not be admissible as evidence, and it is certainly possible they will lie.
Why would you think this is intentional? Did you pay the money to the recruiter for the course? If not, what possible motive would she have to "arrange" for you to not get a refund on your course?
