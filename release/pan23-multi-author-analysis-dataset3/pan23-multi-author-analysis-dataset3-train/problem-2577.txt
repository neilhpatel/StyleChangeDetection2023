That was truly one of the moments that won't go down to well in the history books, you could probably make a montage of Obama saying exactly the same thing year after year but Europeans laughing at something that was so close to happening.
Oof that's not the best sign of unity, doesn't Europe deserve a bit of the blame for not maintaining their military-industrial complex and letting their weapons stockpiles decline so much? Ukraine probably wouldn't have the ammunition to fight right now if it weren't for the Americans shipping them an absolute shit ton of stuff that they're paying their own complex to renew.
But we've supported Ukraine with almost 60 billion already -- we would have to sell Europe and absolute shit-ton of LNG before we'd even break even.
US: dumps enormous sums into arming Ukraine by supplying US weapons and supplies, paying US businesses to buy them.
China: See? Look at all that money! Why don’t the Americans buy Chinese arms and matériel and stop US businesses from profiting?
We are not making money unless you consider them buying weapons from us with our own money to be 'profit'.
Despite the US being a major seller of arms globally a few tens of billions of extra sales isn't a meaningful boost to a 23 trillion dollar economy.
While that may technically be true I'd say that indirectly injecting stimulus into weapons manufacturers is still more like financial stimulus than profit... And it isn't working particularly well since the US is definitely going into a recession regardless.
