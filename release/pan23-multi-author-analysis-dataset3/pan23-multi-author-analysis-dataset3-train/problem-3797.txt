So the top law enforcement officer in Indiana broke the law because he wanted to attack a doctor providing medical care to a 10 year old rape victim. Good job, Indiana.
Oh yes, Indiana. The state that has a law that requires a memorial service for the fetus after an abortion.
Illinois has more than it's share of government problems with all the embezzlement and stealing and such but I used to live there. We used to always say, "Well, at least we're not in indiana.".
It's more than that. The prosecutor is acting as the government in this instance. He isn't personally liable for conduct, even misconduct, undertaken while he is acting as the State's Attorney.
The only way to get around this would be a finding that he had stepped beyond the protection of his qualified immunity, something exceedingly rare for officers that kill people and almost unheard of for prosecutors or other courtroom officials.
Obviously I want prosecutors to practice their profession without fear of retribution, but there has to be some basic threshold for which lawsuits are allowed to proceed, and which ones are dismissed outright.
