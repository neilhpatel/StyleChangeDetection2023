No. Telling someone to stop a lawful behavior does not suddenly make it harassment if they do not stop said behavior. This goes double when they are contacting someone else, not you.
In general, yes. There's nothing sacred about your workplace, and as I implied, you're not really a party to conversations your landlord and your boss choose to have.
This isn't /r/wishfulThinking or /r/positiveThinking. This forum exists to share legally factual information, to the best of the users' ability. Far too often well-intentioned, but legally ignorant users give OPs here false hope, because they want to believe that their vision of "justice" will be done (never mind that their notion of "justice" is often rather flawed and one-sided).
If you are being contacted, rather than your boss, then at some point it may become harassment if the calls were unreasonably numerous and/or had no legitimate purpose. But simply asking someone not to contact you, when they have a legitimate reason to contact you, does not make every future contact harassment.
If I send her a notice not to contact my work again about this and she does, will that constitute harassment, etc. This individual WILL do something again, and I just want to make sure I document things correctly.
Thank so much! I really appreciate this. I definitley have context of her day before calling us at office and screaming at us for 45 mins nonstop about her issue with us. Next day my rent is late so she texts the office? That seems like it could be presented as calculated. Would the standard of she shouldâ€™ve known better apply?
