On Twitter, I followed a few stand-up comedians (they dont do overtly political material but they do lean left), some talented fan-artists, some bands so I know if they're touring or have new albums coming out, and a few museums that post interesting scientific ot historical facts.
YouTube? Music videos, anime and video game reviews, sci-fi & fantasy movie trailers, cooking and household DIY repair stuff....but then Joe Rogan, Benny Shapiro, and some random-ass Fox News clips constantly show up.
This morning I was looking for a compilation of funny scenes from an anime (a goofy comedy about a woman who has a dragon for a maid) and about every eighth one was some smug right-winger ranting about...whatever. Note, this is even after I've blocked channels and clicked "Not interested in this type of content " constantly.
I'm constantly getting fed stupid Joe Rogan clips on YouTube and I keep blocking or saying I'm not interested.
My favorite thing is YouTube repeatedly ignoring my “don’t show me any more from this channel” with the Joe Rogan Experience. I literally can’t escape them on YouTube.
