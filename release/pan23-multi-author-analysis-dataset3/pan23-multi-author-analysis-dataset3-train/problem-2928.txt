It's highly unlikely that that man in the picture is actually Putin. Leaders have body doubles. Putin has 3 body doubles, all of whom have has surgery to further augment their physical similarity to Putin.
However, this theory had occurred to me a few months before reading it. The reason I thought of it is because Putin looked so weak there for a while and then I saw he was taking a trip to Iran.
He was so vibrant in the picture. I asked myself, how could a man so ill be looking so healthy a few months later.
Don't forget, the issue of body doubles is not made public. This is a highly secretive practice. But many leaders do it now and even in the past they have done it. Hitler did it.
"And lemme tell ya another thing: I'm with Ye, that Hitler wasn't such a bad guy. I mean, what, he just wanted Poland, is that so wrong?? Fuckin' west ruins er'rything.".
So be it. Their aging, possibly non functional bullshit can not be a get out of jail free card any longer. Let the world learn that developing nuclear weapons doesn't mean you can do whatever the fuck you want. There are consequences for terrorism and if you choose to use WMDs the consequences will only be greater.
