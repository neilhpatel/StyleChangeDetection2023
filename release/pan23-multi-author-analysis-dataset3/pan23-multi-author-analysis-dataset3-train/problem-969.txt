They’re allowed to dock for personal days (days where NO work is done by your choice, so sickness or disability complicates this and company closures, holiday or otherwise, are not deductible), but if you do ANY work at all (legally there might be a de minimis understanding here), then they can only deduct from PTO 4 hrs, not your pay.
You’re overtime exempt, so it’s natural some days are slow and maybe you don’t work full days, have some half days off, or you have a dentist appointment during work, etc, and sometimes you work more than 40h a week, but no they don’t just look the other way when you take off banked time. If you request it off the hr system either automatically puts you into negative vacation, or doesn’t pay you.
You can complain about it if you want, but they also don’t have to employ you. I’m also ot exempt, but I have a high salary and a flexible schedule so I’m fine with it.
I assume I'm salary exempt. I assumed so once they didn't give me that 20 extra hours on top of a full work week. I acutally worked Mon though the next Thursday (11 consecutive days) and all of the days were in the same pay period.
The rule for salaried people, if that's really you and you get the exact same salary every week if you work all week, is that you are paid for the full week if you do any work on every day of that week. But if you take whole days off for your own person reasons, you are not paid. (If you take days off because the company is closed, say for July 4th, then you do get paid.).
Can you explain what you mean by that? Generally speaking, no employer has to give anyone PTO (Nevada is a recent exception) and no employer has to let any employee take paid time off.
