It sadly is. There is a catch-all in the Canadian Charter of Rights (effectively the written constitution) that a provincial government can pass a law with a 'Not Withstanding' clause added. If they do, the law is not bound by the constitution.
It would. The headline is very misleading. The federal government is Liberal (left wing) under Trudeau, the Ontario provincial government is conservative (right wing) under Doug Ford. The title suggests it is a left wing government initiative while in actuality it is a right wing one.
It is intentional. It was added to the Charter to try and get all the provinces to sign it with the thought that such a nuclear option would be abhorrent to use. Quebec has used it rather commonly at times. Ontario has started to use it. Neither provincial governments had faced any real pushback until now.
None of the provincial governments care about their constituents. Here in NB is all about lining the pockets of the Irving family. They just introduced a tax cut for people who make more than $43,000/yr when most of the province can't even make that.
