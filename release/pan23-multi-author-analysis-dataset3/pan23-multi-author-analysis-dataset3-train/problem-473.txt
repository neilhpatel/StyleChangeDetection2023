Well China is the new boogeyman. Best way to keep story time going is to keep telling the story. Republicans have no problem looking like idiots or making things worse.
Does the USA lie about it or does it say, “Well, looks like it’s a weather balloon. Just like all the other ones because surveillance balloons haven’t been used for 80 fucking years. USA 1 !”.
They should have given much more detail and evidence though. Just to calm down the Republicans. I think they are having trouble tracking the info down though. I wonder if there is some research team that let a balloon up and now they are afraid of the publicity.
I wonder if they just forgot about consent not realizing that the balloon might just get whisked away.
Its kind of too bad the balloon is white, becuase if it weren't a little "I feared for my life" and a gun and the issue is solved.
It does seem a little sketchy but again I don’t think it is anything nefarious and it should be resolved politely and without damage to their balloon (because potential science!).
Yup. Now you are getting to the meat and potatoes. The balloon is not the problem. China not communicating is the problem. Keep in mind though it’s kinda stupid easy for anyone to just launch a big ass balloon without proper officials being notified. Also keep it mind it's a fucking weather balloon that most mentally mature people fully grasp the not-possibility of a balloon starting WW3.
I mean if the USA needed to find out which people launched a weather balloon in the past month would they also be in a similar situation trying to find out who's it is? I would assume a person would have to file a flight plan.
