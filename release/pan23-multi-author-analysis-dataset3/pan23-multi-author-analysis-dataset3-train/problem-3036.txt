But now the chants of defund the police - it's really extremism. The latinx comments show how out of touch and different the dems are from the Latino community. As an Asian myself, the word bipoc drives me nuts as both asians and Hispanics have been erased from the word for minorities. Hollywood now elevates black people but Hispanics and asians are still underrepresented according to the Hollywood diversity report and quite clear in most tv shows and movies where you now see many blacks but still barely any hispanics/asians.
A lot of Hispanics are social conservatives and the loud chanting by the progressives on everything they believe just shows a large portion of Hispanics how different they are from them.
itâ€™s always so honest and devoid of right wing talking point arguments that ignore the actual prevalence of racism and the fact that the right is so tied to white supremacy that it will absolutely turn on latino and hispanic voters the second it becomes expedient!
self determination- unless you want to be anything or are anything other than a white cis hetero christian male (or dominated white cis hetero christian woman).
fundamentalist theocrats of any race or national origin are not ever going to vote anything but conservatives.
I would Imagine that they are not any more or less susceptible to right wing propaganda/ conspiracy theories than whites.
Minorities can often be racist as well, so that part appeals, in many cases folks think it's directed at others, not realizing the GOP thinks they are the others.
