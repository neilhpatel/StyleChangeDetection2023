Later Democrats accused Trump of using tactics similar to the Big Lie propaganda technique. It's honestly a decent fit for how he constantly accuses anything negative of him of being "fake news." His supporters don't need to fall for the verified thousands of lies that he's told. They only need to fall for the one big lie that the media treats him unfairly rather than the much more simple answer that his words are just factually incorrect. Trump told a big lie and accused the democrats of trying to steal the election in an attempt to steal it himself. Hitler claimed the Jews were telling a big lie that Erich Ludendorff was responsible for Germany's loss in WW1 while Hitler was telling the big lie himself.
Trump literally named his attempt to steal the election after Adolph Hitler so I don't see what your point is.
Trump actually sounds a lot like Hitler. Hitler's Mein Kampf had Lots of rambling run on sentance. Seems like Hitler was trying to sound smart and sophisticated, but really just comes across and rambling incoherent lunacy.
The notion that Hitler was a master orator only holds up if you watch that one video of him yelling into a mic and pounding on a table and you donâ€™t speak German.
