The thing I don’t get is why are their people opposed to legalizing Marijuana? If these people are against it , they don’t have to smoke it. It just amazes me why some are always trying to tell others how to live their lives. This applies to a number of opinions on other shit too!
Racism Exactly, and in my opinion banning abortion too! It’s a certain type of privileged people that try to make all the decisions for everyone else. Shouldn’t be like that.
I agree completely Weed does not hurt anyone. Alcohol is addictive and you can die from overdose, cirrhosis, cancer, drunk drivers /drunk driving. The biggest problem is there are those, ( a lot of), that have been subjected to the Government propaganda the Air Force put out in the 1950’s that Marijuana will make you go Mad. Lol It’s that, uneducated,Non experienced people that have never smoked weed in their lifetime that are against something they don’t understand or have experienced. And there’s the Religious community! They’re against every Fucking thing. 🤷🏼‍♂️. There’s always going to be opposers, whether they are right or wrong.
While I respect that this is your opinion, I fully disagree. What you are describing is “fascist” by definition. Government picking “winners”. Until herb is treated like tomato’s there will be a thriving black market. And Black market weed is and will always be better, the secret ingredient is CRIME. The only way to move forward is equality and equity through abundance and let the cream rise to the top. The banks do not need to get involved until this is sorted. To be honest decriminalizing and stopping there would be the best thing for the plant and everyone that is truly passionate about cannabis but people are stupid lame and greedy.
