You can and should contact the police. The manager committed assault, and possibly battery, to both you and the other fellow.
Self-defense is a defense one may present in court to excuse various crimes, but the possibility of such a defense doesn't stop a person from being charged.
Also, even understood as a defense to the charge of assault, self-defense likely does not apply here (though there are not really sufficient details to be sure). Typically self-defense is a last resort when escape is not an option, and requires the use of a reasonable amount of force.
If you took note of the time stamps, I was one of the first respondents. There was no mention of stinging or burning until after my post.
And no, you cannot sue for stinging and burning. You can sue if you receive medical care for said stinging and burning.
The original post mentions stinging and burning. People can absolutely sue for tort injuries in the absence of medical care. Bill Gates can't walk down the street slapping the face and grabbing the ass and genitals of everyone he encounters and then correctly say "HAHA you can't sue me unless you got medical care!".
