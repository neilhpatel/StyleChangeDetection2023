He was dealing at the request of the corrupt embezzlers in Russian Military, so he will answer "it has been converted to your mansions and yachts, sirs!".
Yeah, that's what I've meant! So there are other prisoners and no one trades for them. Cause they broke real laws, even if those laws might be unreasonable.
A question: I'm not sure how international law works, what would happen if you do a stupid thing in foreign country and break the law? Are they supposed to kick you out? Can they imprison you on their own terms?
So they can imprison you on their own terms. Then... Why did US trade? Is this a common thing? How many US nationals are imprisoned at the moment for breaking shitty, but real laws?
Uhm ok… maybe realize that she was unfairly punished for the law she broke. Typical Russian sentence for the amount she had would be a small fine, not a decade of hard labour. I realize you wish more people like her would be locked up for minor mistakes though, because you don’t make mistakes.
Not worse, but I think it’s going to be much different with a lot more pressure. We all know how Putin wants his “allies” to behave and keep up appearances.
He's been a friend of the Kremlin since Yeltsein. The Russians directly worked with him. Since he moved wrapons for their allies. If Putin did a prisoner exchange program, it means He's going to become a borderline oligarch.
