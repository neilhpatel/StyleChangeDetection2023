First map is a "reprint" of an german ethnic study during end of 19 century, and it follows "self-identification" reporting.
Austria had never recovered after Bismark war, and the cultural Austrian "elite" which was speaking "same" high german started to feel "German" because it was cooler thing to do. (high means hills and mountains, i.e. german spoken in mountain/hill areas). I am not sure the Swiss german speakers had agreed to be pointed blue on this map.
North west Germany and the east Netherlands were very close, i.e. the percentage of people having relatives on both sides of the border was very high, and the people had no issues to move and work in another country. This family relation collapsed during Hitler occupation and the forceful attempt of the germanization which led to the dutch aversion to anything german (which persists even today).
The root of the problem with questions like these is that it implicitly rests on the assumption that Germans (as a people, as an ethnicity) predate the Dutch; whereas the revers is true!
Grouping them all together in general is a bit silly, but I think the point is the linguistic dominance of the German language as well as the contrast of the cultural achievements of the Dutch fairly early in the modern period of European history, leading to a distinct identity.
It should be mentioned that Swiss German is quite distinct from (and not mutually intelligible with) Standard German, although both languages do ultimately descend from the High German branch of West Germanic, unlike Dutch, which descends from the Low Franconian branch of West Germanic.
However, as you essentially stated, Swiss German as a common spoken language - and we are talking about a collection of dialects, i.e, it is in no way “centralized” language - is largely not intelligible with High German. It is strongly influenced by French, though contains various strange and interesting inventions of their own.
