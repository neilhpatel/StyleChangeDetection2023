When did you give them notice? That states that, at the end of your lease, you need to give them 60 days notice that you are not going to roll it into a month to month.
It reads as follows: The initial term of the Lease Contract begins on the 10th day of June 2020, and ends at 11:59 pm on the 4th day of June 2021. This lease contract will automatically renew month to month unless either party gives at least 60 days written notice of termination or intent to move-out as required by paragraph 36 (Move Out Notice). If the number of days isn’t filled in, at least 30 days notice is required.
Nope, I’ve come to the conclusion I have royally fcked myself haha. I just have to grin and bear it, it was my mistake and I must face the consequences. I understand they do this to protect themselves while they look for a new tenant. Thank you for all the help!
I attempted to make contact with them via phone as early as February 2021, but they never answered my calls and I left multiple voice mails. I did not have an active email address to contact them at. I’m assuming the responsibility will still fall on me for not making in-person contact. Seems like I’m stuck.
