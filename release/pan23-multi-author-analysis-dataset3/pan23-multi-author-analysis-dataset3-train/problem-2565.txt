She could tell the Pope and the President that, and it wouldn't matter. That needs it be in her will explicitly.
That's not valid. That's a disaster waiting to happen for you, an expensive disaster. She cannot disinherit her daughter by tell you to use your "reasonable" judgment, the law doesn't allow that. You need to get grandma an estate attorney.
Grandma really needs to talk to an estate planner and keep her plans up to date/appropriately filed.
In addition to the will concerns, she also needs to make sure she's properly covered against future attempts to have her declared incompetent and that the decision making authority if she becomes unable to make her own decisions is set. An estate planner will either know this part of the law too or will be able to recommend someone in most circumstances.
If the will leaves things to your discretion, you should not do anything with your grandmother's assets until you have your own lawyer. You may be able to charge those legal bills to the estate - talk to your lawyer about it when the time comes.
I would simply ask her to speak with a lawyer and make it sure it does what she wants it to. If she already worked with a lawyer to get this written, it should be absolutely clear how the estate should be distributed. A standard will will include specific gifts and a % breakdown of the residual amount by heir/beneficiary. Very straightforward.
