That would include Republicans, then, since they were in support of the 13th Amendment that specifically and in no uncertain language allows for involuntary servitude.
I'm pretty sure Republicans advocated and were in favor of slavery pretty often in the recent years, during efforts to remove slavery from state constitutions (like in Colorado, Utah and Nebraska) or the punishment clause of the 13th amendment.
Could at the very least be argued that Republicans put a platform to uphold the constitution and the constitution has slavery in it therefore they can get banned as well.
The fun part is when the constitution says that slavery is okay as long as its done as a form of punishment, meaning anyone who has or has ever backed the constitution has thus supported slavery. Something the new GOP does not agree with by their attempted coup, meaning you have to be anti USA to be able to run in florida. LITERALLY taking over the US, one state at a time through 'legal intervention'.
That system has also been abused, by refusing to fill out said paperwork after the fact because the service wasnt to the other party's 'satisfaction'. And why its a horrible idea. Even on a capital level, prisons/jails/police/wardens have abused that shit in the past and why we its not that common and usually is a sort of 'work for reward/pay'. Most people get time off their sentence OR money into an account they can use.
Your last sentence sums it up by itself. They dont wanna see it. They dont care. They just want their way and dont care who gives it to them. They think the 'current' party they support being republicans will get them what they want. So far in my state, The republicans have only TAKEN AWAY things from them, yet they scapegoat and point the finger at someone else.
