From a legal standpoint, you'll want to familiarize yourself with your rights as a landlord as well as his rights as a tenant. Find the eviction processes in your state, and make sure to follow all communication procedures (ie serving him a legal eviction notice). If you find yourself unsure, a lawyer would be the best bet as you're also struggling with his mental health, and committing a legal adult to a mental health facility is much more complex than a minor. You'd need a lawyers assistance with that.
If he does not, file in the courts. A court date will be assigned, in the meantime in every jurisdiction I've heard of he can remain.
Once the court rules that the eviction is valid, he will be given a vacate by date. If he still isn't gone by then you can have him removed from the house by the police. He can take the couch.
The legal advice here is to serve him with written notice of eviction, that on x date (depending on location, usually 30 days) he must vacate.
If you've given your brother 30Â days' written notice, you can probably evict him through the county courts once the deadline passes. My concern is that if you had always agreed the house would be his, even verbally, he may be able to stall an eviction while looking to enforce that commitment. Whether that would be successful or not is hard to speculate on - verbal agreements for real estate usually aren't enforceable as such, but arguments like a constructive trust may be valid - but it'll complicate your life.
When you say you bought the house "for him," but also say your name is the only name on the home's title, is there anything in writing that would corroborate his interest in the house? Or is this more of an informal understanding?
