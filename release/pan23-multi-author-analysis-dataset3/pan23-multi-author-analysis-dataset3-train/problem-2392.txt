The neighbor's homeowners insurance should cover this. Providing coverage for acts of God is what your own homeowners insurance is all about.
No homeowners or renter's insurance for OP is likely to cover this. OP very likely has no liability here. So "act of God" in that context is "we're not liable, God is.".
No. Probably not. For either of you to be liable neighbor would need to establish that you were aware of a risk or compromise to the tree and that you failed to act. For you to be liable instead of landlord you'd need to be responsible for yard maintenance and that you didn't do something about a known compromise to the tree.
Does your lease specify that you're responsible for property maintenance, does it specify anything specific to tree maintenance?
I think this will then depend on jurisdiction. Some municipalities have bylaws to cover this. My jurisdiction indicates;.
" fallen tree or tree limb(s) that has fallen onto a neighbouring property is the responsibility of the property owner where the tree/limb has fallen.".
