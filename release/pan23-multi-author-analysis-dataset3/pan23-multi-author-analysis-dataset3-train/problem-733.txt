Lower population growth=aging population=less workers of productive age=more people of retirement age to support=huge economical issues. Add this to other economic issues that china are facing we might be in for a very rough few years ahead.
And now with global trade wars against China, industries leaving and their workers demanding much better lives. They got very rough times ahead of them.
Go look at an updated age pyramid of China, their economy is already going down the toilet. What happens in few decades when their working force is almost half of their retired people?
Retirees do not drive the economy like workers. They also do not pay into the system (anymore). And China doesn't have a social safety net like the US. Retirees in any country are, in a sense, liabilities, not assets.
"The truth is that China’s population in 2020 probably amounted to about 1.28 billion – some 130 million fewer people than reported. That makes India, not China, the world’s most populous country.".
it is iirc. the women are mostly older, while the men are mostly younger. So in practicum it's closer to 57/58 to 43/42 men v women in the below 40 range.
Also add to that the gender imbalance: 55 men to 45 women. The biggest ever measured for a large country.
