How about this, when you are doing your google searches try less biased terms. Instead of "How bad was Lenin?" Or "Why was Lenin so bad?" Try "Who is Lenin?" Or "What is Lenins ideology?".
Well, primarily he led a popular revolution, against Tsarist tyranny, that led to greater levels of economic equality (higher distribution of value) for the working class, and ultimately a higher standard of living.
Edit: These sources tend to distort the issues, rather than convey them in a more dialectical manner.
That doesn't make any sense though, I mean, Stalin disrupted Lenins trajectory and destroyed the Leninist brain trust. Can you explain your idea in more detail?
I have no idea what the solution is. Free speech is just as bad as it is good because it can be used to suppress people just as the Republican/Christian nationalist are showing us right now.
Like, yeah, we are fining(and sometimes jailing) peolle for being anti-war, but look at USA There is no free speech there because of cancel culture, its basically the same.
Understand what I’m saying: regardless to all the good free speech offers, free speech can be weaponized. It can be used to suppress and create absolute chaos, as proven by Trump’s GOP or QOP.
