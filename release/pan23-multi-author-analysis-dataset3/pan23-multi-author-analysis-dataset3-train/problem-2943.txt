You should have had locks to your house and car changed immediately when your keys were stolen. The cost then would have been worth it.
No, the time frame between thefts is what wasn't clear to me. When you said they found your keys and stole your car, so I'm thinking the next day.
Maybe this wasn’t clear — my partners car AND my own car were stolen. Two cars taken. His first, then mine once they found my spares in his car. House keys were not stolen.
Look man, I’m not disagreeing with anything you say, and I do think they are great ideas. But after paying the $400 to get my car towed, I don’t even have money for rent, let alone changing my locks until my insurance reimburses me. Which is looking like it will take a couple weeks at least. I was just wondering if I have any other workarounds with my insurance to get into a better/safer position. If there’s no other way, then I guess I’ll just have to live with the uncertainty.
Honestly, I’m not even sure I can completely afford the tow, let alone an anti theft device. I wonder if the tow is something insurance might cover?
This is something you need to inquire about to your insurance company. They might also cover the rekeying charges in this case but again that is something you need to ask your insurance about.
Your insurance should be handling, if you have proper coverage. If you can expand on what they are telling you, someone can probably give you better advice.
