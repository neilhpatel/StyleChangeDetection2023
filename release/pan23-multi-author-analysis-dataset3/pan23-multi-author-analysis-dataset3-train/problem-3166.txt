In addition it is extremely likely that three way calling is prohibited by the jail as it is in almost any correctional setting. Let him call his attorney himself.
Then he needs to schedule a specific time and date for his legal call(s). The jail almost surely has procedures in place for doing so and I am also fairly certain his attorney has advised him of this. I don't know of any attorney who has the time to sit by their phone waiting for random clients in jail or their relatives to call them.
He says his attorney doesn't answer the jail calls... I don't know why... I'll ask next time he calls... But like I asked earlier shouldn't he be able to call his attorney on a private line for free? He has a court appointed attorney so I wonder if that has anything to do with it...
Finally, consider the fact that he's claiming his attorney isn't talking to him, but you don't know what the relationship is really. If I have an hour long conversation with you on Monday and tell you I will talk to you in two weeks once I have more information, then you can best believe I won't be taking a call on Tuesday because it would be pointless to do so; I won't have anything new to tell you.
As for free calls, there's no place I know of that lets INMATES call for free; that would be abused so fast it would make your head spin. But a lot of jails, particularly since covid, will allow attorneys to call and schedule secure phone or video conversations with inmates; the attorneys just have to be the one initiating it. But not every jail has this capability, so the attorney may have to go visit in person, and that takes time.
Well, I don't answer jail calls BECAUSE they're recorded. I also tell my clients not to call me on recorded lines and that they should just tell a friend or family member to let me know that they need to talk and I'll set something up.
