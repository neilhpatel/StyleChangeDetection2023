The $1000 deductible is not something you can expect to be handled expeditiously; it's just a fact of life that sometimes your shit gets smashed up and you chose a high deductible on your comprehensive insurance. Prosecutors will ask for that as restitution in the assault and vandalism case, but even if that falls through your guest can sue in small claims. Unfortunately it won't be fast.
Because protection orders are civil matters, and also because there was no arrest warrant for your ex-partner.
Does your partner have an attorney advising her on the protection order ? Even if she doesn't, the rules are straightforward: be polite, don't engage with the other party, and tell the truth with a minimum of drama. The King County courts at the Seattle downtown courthouse are national leaders in handling DV protective orders and they do it smoothly and professionally. The bailiffs do a great job keeping the parties separate, including doing things like giving you a 10 minute head start leaving the courthouse before they let the respondent leave.
Again: this is out of the hands of the police now. The only role the police department could have is if they need to send one of the responding officers as a trial witness, and of course a trial is unlikely because most crimes like this are resolved by plea bargain.
The police did everything they could do by investigating and passing the case to the prosecutor for review. Your ex wasn’t arrested because the prosecutor hasn’t issued charges yet.
