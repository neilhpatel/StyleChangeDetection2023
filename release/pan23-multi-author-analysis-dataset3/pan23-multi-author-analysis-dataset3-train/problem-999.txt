The big difference is their support of Trump was all a cynical embrace of the power he brought. Many top republicans never liked him but liked the judges and power within the base.
The reality is the GOP establishment has never liked trump. The idiotic voters do. Trump never went below 90% approval rating with republicans at any point of his presidency. They may try and shun him but if the voters accept him they will be back on board. Republicans may be evil but they’re also always on board with giving their base whatever bullshit they want.
Because a certain orange demagogue and his cult are definitely not going to let the republican party pretend they don't exist anymore!
I think the historic repudiation of the republican party's anti-woke, culture war BS in the midterms was step number one.
If one ignores the whole “one party trying to take away people’s rights and making a blatant march toward fascism” thing, the conditions were right for Republicans to sweep the midterms. They didn’t, and that’s a huge blow to their political agenda.
The most notable was the projection for Florida in the 2000 election for President, in which arguments about which votes should be counted and how they should be counted went all the way to the Supreme Court. Barring the SCOTUS decision, Gore should have been president.
