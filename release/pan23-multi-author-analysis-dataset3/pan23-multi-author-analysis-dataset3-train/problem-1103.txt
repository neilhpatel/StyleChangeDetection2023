You and your siblings can get together and hire an attorney to go to court and try have a new trustee appointed. If course, the current trustee will be able to use trust funds to defend the trust from any lawsuit, so essentially your money would be paying for both sides of the lawsuit. There's also no guarantee that you would be successful.
If I understand correctly, you and your siblings want to "resign" as beneficiaries, so that your older brother gets all the trust money when he turns 30, then presumably he will redistribute it to you.
Edit: I'm assuming you meant that your aunt is trustee, not beneficiary (she might also be a beneficiary). The trustee is the person responsible for managing the trust.
Roughly, the beneficiary is the person who gets the money, the trustee is the person which manages the trust (in whom trust is placed, hence trustee).
I'm not sure what this means, and I think you're confusing the roles of trustee and beneficiary. A trustee is a person who controls the trust and makes decisions about how to invest it and how to distribute the trust money. A beneficiary is a person who receives the trust money. A trustee could also be a beneficiary, but more often these roles are separate.
Not necessarily. OP said the aunt appointed the attorney, which presumably means the attorney is the successor trustee and the aunt is no longer relevant.
Given the situation, your aunt's decision to assign a professional trust attorney as the successor trustee may have been the best decision for both her and for you.
Depending on how your aunt handed the power over, you may well have the authority to switch trust attorneys.
If your aunt did this so she could cut ties and she maintained any decision making power over the estate, have you considered reaching out to her? Tell her what you guys want a new lawyer, local, and just need her consent. Then you won't bother her again.
