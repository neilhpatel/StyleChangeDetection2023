And for added context: Russia was in process of a missile strike campaign targeting most if not all major Ukrainian cities. So, he probably had good reason to believe so.
Yes it does. That's the simple truth. It sucks and I hate it but I'm saying even without that she's kind of a long shot. We need something more of a sure thing if Biden doesn't run.
Won't Biden be 82 by 2024? Even if he's mentally fit by then, does anyone really want to take the chance he'd last four more years being just as sharp between 2024 to 2028? Or to even live that long? "Four years" of health is a big difference between someone in their 40s and someone in their 80s.
I imagine it risks making "Ukraine look bad to the world and NATO" to blame Russia like that with zero proof.
If Europe blamed Ukraine, or just decided they had been exposed to too much risk, support could have ended. They are already facing winter without electricy or water. These are desperate times for Ukraine.
I am aware that Europe is facing hardships, which is why there is reason to worry that support for Ukraine might wane.
