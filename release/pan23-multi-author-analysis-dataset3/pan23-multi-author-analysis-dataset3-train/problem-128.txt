Those are example’s of individuals caught red-handed committing fraud, not necessarily corporations acting immoral (e.g destroying the environment or doing business with “evil” countries). The liability of the corporations that profited from their actions was, in fact, limited. Wake me up when Exxon Mobil executives get prosecuted for oil spills or Nike executives for profiting from child labor.
I guess that’s the difference between how things are and how they should be. Show me the CEOs or board members in prison for crimes committed by the corporations.
The only audit-related anything I've seen Executives give a shit about is the one that comes with criminal penalties for signatories.
People are allowed to make immoral decisions in companies, we need to hold them criminally responsible, not just fine companies. Then they have to be moral.
Amoral is just another way to say immoral. It's immoral/amoral not to care about the consequences of your actions, whether you're a person or corporation. There's moral obligation and then there's everything else.
