If you mean there's no representation of the far left, that's mostly true and that's because people with those beliefs are an extreme minority in the US.
There may not be a far left in either of the major parties but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist entirely. People, in a democracy, will believe in whatever ideology they want, regardless of which party is in power. It’s why we still have Communist and Socialist 3rd parties in this country.
I think the economic benefits are too large to strike it down. Plus, you know conservatives are itching to deal a major blow to America’s college system. This might be the perfe opportunity to do so.
The current iteration of mainstream Conservatism wants to turn the clocks back to an imagined version of the 1950’s before all of those movements started (or, at least, went mainstream). It’s all about what everyone to conform to evangelical Christian values and anti communism. To be clear, it’s a bullshit belief system since it doesn’t allow its adherents to make the most of the current moment like any rational movement would. That said, these people are very predictable in terms of where they stand on every issue so it’s best to focus on the group that can still be rational and try and help said group become the side of common sense with the ability to confront the issues of the 21st Century rather than the previous one (if anyone ever wonders why I always say I hate both sides equally for different reasons, here’s your answer).
