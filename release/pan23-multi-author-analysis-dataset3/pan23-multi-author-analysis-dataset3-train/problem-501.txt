I recently posted a on this topic at /r/academicbiblical, which I'll repeat below with relevant citations.
Russell Gmirkin has some interesting observations on the problem of trying to use stories like Josiah's supposed reform in order to date the Pentateuchal sources in a recent paper:
The most parsimonious answer is that the fortuitous "discovery" by Josiah of the Torah during temple renovations is a literary fiction just like Moses' writing of the Torah and Ezra's introduction of the lost Torah after the exile. All attempt to provide a pedigree for the Torah and explain why it was not previously known to the Israelites. Furthermore, current sentiment by scholars seems to be that the archaeological evidence also does not support the Josianic reforms.
At the very least the (very few) archeological discoveries he mentions seem to point to an ongoing kind of reform that started before Josiah himself.
The author mentions that scholars do accept that some level of religious reform did happen during the time of king Josiah.
