Not a lawyer but an ipatient critical care pharmacist.... You need damages to show for a lawsuit was your dad harmed from the medication? Was he hospitalized due to high potassium? Or was he just on these medications and your concerned....?
Good luck potassium supplements are prescribed all the time in chronic renal and heart failure patients on high diuretics which lower their potassium but you won't know until you hire a lawyer who hires medical experts to review the case.
She should prepare to be told that their is no case, and thatâ€™s it extremely unlikely the potassium supplements cause fulminate renal failure and death.
Well, I'm speaking for my wife, she feels very strong that the prescribed potassium contributed to his passing 3 weeks later, was it the potassium that caused his death, we have no evidence either way at this point. Were in the beginning stages with this and looking for guidance also on best way to get all info,. handle etc. Shes well aware you do not prescribe potassium to patient with CKD also thought at the time it was taken out of his meds. only to find out recently it was not.
Right, at this point for her own personal reasons more than the money, she doesn't want this to happen again.And to doesn't know of any other course to take.
