Not to mention completely shattering the world's perception of their military might. So many works of fiction made their military look to be cutting edge with highly trained soldiers, but actual combat footage has shown that they're anything but. They went into Ukraine with old and poorly maintained gear and ineffective troops that didn't even know why they were there.
You're talking about people who either extensively studied the subject or who were given detailed briefs, complete with potentially classified information, as part of their job. I'm talking about the general public, those who have long believed Russia to be a strong military power due to the countless pieces of media that have portrayed them as such over the past 70+ years.
However, they are supposed to be talking about Ukranian forces, and the world knows it actually applies to Russian forces.
Or are they saying Ukraine has been demilitarized because of all the Russian arms Russian brought in being destroyed by Ukraine? Maybe they are thanking Ukraine for reducing the amount of arms Russia brought in by destroying them.
Russia has killed a lot of Ukranians and destroyed a lot of Ukrainian weapons. If you deliberately look at kill rate & resources used and not the net size of Ukrainian military then I suppose you could argue that they have made progress. It's cherry picking but what can you expect. They need to have something to show for the collossal blunder they made.
I'm not suggesting that Russia is winning, I'm just suggesting that it's possible to pick specific statistics that don't make Putin and gang look like complete morons that sent 100k Russians to their deaths for no appreciable gain to Russia.
