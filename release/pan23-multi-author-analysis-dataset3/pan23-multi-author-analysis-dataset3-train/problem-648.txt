Hi! Thanks for coming. Caesar is very well known for his self-aggrandizement, but how accurate was he as a reporter? Are his accounts of the Gallic Wars trustworthy sources in general? Can they be corroborated by other sources?
Is one of these more likely / more supported by historical record? If the answer is "no" and it remains unconfirmed, which of these do you believe is most likely based on your knowledge of Caesar's character?
Did the fact that Julius Caesar did not put out proscription lists in the manner of Sulla mean that he didn't have the power to do it? Or was it an attempt to heal social divisions? In either case, did the Optimates see this as a sign of weakness?
The Optimates had killed senior leaders before, e.g., the Gracchi brothers. How did Julius Caesar miss the coming push back from the Optimates?
Great point about Caesar intending to take on the Parthians. My question is - did Caesar ever fight against skilled horse archers or cavalry in his battles? If so - whom and when? My understanding is that his campaigns in Iberia, Gaul, Germania and Italy would not have brought him in contact with such forces.
