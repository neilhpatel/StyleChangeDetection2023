If they terminated your tenancy, you would not owe any rent except back rent. Tell the judge that you received the pay or quit, you quit, then you paid (back rent) and now you shouldn't owe anything.
It's a pay or quit. If the tenant doesn't pay, or quit, then it goes to eviction. If the tenant chooses to quit, then the lease is immediately terminated as is all future obligation. MI law under 554.134 is pretty clear on this, and that it's the landlord doing the terminating, not the tenant, by issuing the notice.
How did the landlord terminate the lease? It sounds like they carried out a proper eviction due to the tenant breaking it via non-payment. The 7-day notice is part of the eviction process.
Title: Served eviction notice for non-payment, I moved out. Now landlord is suing for the rest of the rent for the remainder of the lease, even though I had left.
I thought typically they would still owe future rent up until a new tenant was found? And that if one wasn't, you still owe the entirety of the lease.
