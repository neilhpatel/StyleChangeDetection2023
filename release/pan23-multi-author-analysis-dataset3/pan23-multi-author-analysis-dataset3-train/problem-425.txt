It wouldn't take much to deny him the position. McCarthy is promising everything to get the votes from extremist, it's not unreasonable that if the dems have a unified front, they can convince a some republicans to vote for someone else if they are promised something of worth. Basically selling a vote for some politicians agenda.
I think the dems only need to flip 5 people to have a majority vote on the matter, and there are republicans in districts who could still do well if they sided with dems, as it's pretty apparent that republicans just want to do nothing and obstruct as much as possible.
Get someone that all of the Dems can really around, and either try to get a few to jump ship, or just enough to abstain and prevent one of theirs from getting majority.
It's getting a republican candidate to agree, and getting them five votes from their own party which is the hard part.
If all 216 Democrats vote for a Republican that person might be able to get a couple of Republican votes. Denying McCarthy in favor for someone even 10% less terrible is worth the effort.
