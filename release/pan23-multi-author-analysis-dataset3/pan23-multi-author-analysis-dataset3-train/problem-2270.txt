there appears to be a spear flying through the air in the Moko shurai ekotoba emaki. A warrior on the Yuan side seems to be holding a spear in a way that looks like he is about to thrust or throw it. What does this mean? Did the Yuan dynasty have javelin throwers during the invasions of Japan? If so, what nation did they belong to? As far as i know, only the Chinese have historically used javelins.
Javelins were used in China from ancient times through to the Qing, and so were probably used during the Yuan Dynasty. The majority of the soldiers for the invasions of Japan would probably have been Chinese, so the painting might be intended to represent Chinese javelins in use.
2. This mass depends on the mass of the limbs of the bow - a big heavy bow (like a longbow, or a Japanese yumi) needs heavy arrows to be efficient.
The Mongol bow gives much better long range performance, and the Japanese bow gives, for the same draw weight, significantly better anti-armour performance. Compared to a typical longbow, the Japanese bow has a much longer draw lenh, and a better force-draw curve, and similar efficiency - it will deliver better anti-armour performances for the same draw weight, and have similar range.
Which is the superior weapon - the Japanese longbow, or the Mongol-style of composite bow? Alternatively, are there any things that each individually excel at?
