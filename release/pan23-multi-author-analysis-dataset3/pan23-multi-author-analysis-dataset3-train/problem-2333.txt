Genocide is everyone's business. And China is actively making it theirs by doing business with Russia. They are choosing a small economical gain over the lives, freedom and safety of millions of Ukrainians. It's obviously immoral and evil behavior. Where Europe and the US have enacted sanctions are are withdrawing from Russia at great costs to their economies, China and India are increasing their business with Russia. They are war profiteering. There is no discussion here, it's very simply messed up.
China could end the war tomorrow by joining the sanctions on Russia, simple as. As long as it doesn't become a conflict between NATO and Russia directly, they couldn't care less and they will continue propping up the Russian economy for their own gain.
I dont think China want to KO Russia, Russia is their convenient tank against "western economy aggression". If Russia can keep western nation busy, China is happy with what it is now. China can suck Russia dry later.
Tbf, pretty sure China is NOT willing to make a similar mistake to Putins Russia. China will probably not move on Taiwan until they are confident they can come out of it with SOMETHING. Chinaâ€™s actions are always way more practical than Russias. Smarter scumbags, if you will.
