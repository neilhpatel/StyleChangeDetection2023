Not sure if I'm allowed to comment here but I'll give it a try. Short answer; the 20th century was an incredibly volatile time in Russian history. There were several major regime changes and each regime renamed some of the cities in order to symbolize that they were breaking from the past and "restarting" for lack of better word. I'm addressing each example below.
St. Petersburg was founded by Peter the Great in the 1700s. Peter the Great was trying to break with the previous Tsars (Russian rulers) and one of the ways he did so was by building a brand new capital city in order to get away from the established political families of Moscow. Peter the Great's lifelong goal was to transform Russia into a Western European style empire. As a result, St. Petersburg was given a German name and the city has Baroque inspired architecture and canals modeled after Amsterdam. In Russian, Saint Petersburg would be Sankt Petrograd.
Long story short, WWI was a disaster for the Russian Empire and it was one of the causes of the Russian Revolution. After the Revolution, the Bolsheviks (Communist Party) took control of the Russian Empire and formed the USSR. In order to symbolize their victory, Petrograd was renamed to Leningrad, after Vladimir Lenin, the head of the Bolsheviks, in 1924.
The first name change in the Soviet Union after a person was Leningrad, and it was done in 1924, after Lenin died. The Communist Party decided to change the name of the city that gave birth to the revolution to their recently deceased leader, as part of a country-wide glorification of the cult of Lenin, which included embalming his body and put it in a mausoleum in Red Square. His native city of Simbirsk was also renamed Ulianovsk in his name.
