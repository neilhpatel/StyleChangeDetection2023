Leaving aside what other commentors have said (and I agree with them both largely) this lawyer sounds like he may be acting unethically with respect to his representation about the book and it's value.
I would save all messages from him and block. If he actually files suit, he needs to prove up the value of the book.
As an alternative, have you considered reaching out to the author of the book and requesting he or she provide a new autograph to replace the damaged book?
Contact some dealers in collectible books and ask them what a signed copy of the book in excellent condition would be worth and what it would be worth it was a first addition. Also ask if there is anything else that would make the book be worth more. Some times things like a misprint or who owned the book could make it worth more. Get as much information as you can from an actual expert who deals in these things.
You should absolutely do your own research into how much a signed copy of said book cost. Was it a first addition? That could affect the cost too. Don't take his word for how much it's worth. He's your adversary in this situation. Nothing he says should be taken at face value.
