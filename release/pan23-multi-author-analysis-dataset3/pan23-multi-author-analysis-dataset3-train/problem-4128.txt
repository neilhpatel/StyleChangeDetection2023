That's not to say there isn't a small segment of loonies in Finland too, with a few figurehead Putinists (Johan BÃ¤ckman is a well known one), but they get almost no traction.
That means literally nothing when talking about the differences between the languages and how hard it would be for a Russian to write Finnish propaganda.
You could have a relatively large amount of very depressed people and still have the vast majority of people rate their happiness as high. Which could lead to a higher happiness score than a country where everyone is depressed but not enough to kill themselves.
Happiness can be polarized in a way that leads to high suicide rates but a high average happiness ranking still.
Like country A could have 5% of the population rate their happiness as 1/10 and kill themselves while like 90% of the population rate their happiness 8-10/10. That country is going to be higher on the list compared to country B where 90% of people rate their happiness as 3-4/10, (where people still don't kill themselves as much). Or is it? I'm not going to calculate that, but you get the point.
Media literacy is still on the curriculum. You're making some weird statements in this thread, like claiming that teaching is now very polarized to the extreme left or right. Which I doubt is true compared to other countries on this list.
there are 6 non- European countries on the list. Canada (7) does well in media literacy, the US is at 18 (but tied with SK, Austria, and Portugal so potentially 15) a little above the half way point. It's under annex III, the expanded list.
