Yeah I’d say you paid her deductible, which is fair. She assumed some risk in teaching someone to drive, and she’s not out of a car, so no, you don’t NEED to pay her the extra so she can have a nicer to play with car.
The way I’m looking at it that’s perfectly fine if she wants to ride around in an equivalent car but that should be on HER expense because I paid for what I caused which is her damages. Anything else has nothing to do with me, she was getting a car that neither one of us would have had to come out of pocket for but SHE chose not to take that one so she needs to pay for her luxury I’m not here to pay for that I’m here to pay for the damages that I caused. Yes I’m an adult.
Are you an adult? But nobody can force you to drive. If you didn't feel safe to drive, then don't drive. That's an incredibly important lesson to learn for your whole lifetime of driving. Don't drive if you don't feel safe driving. Period. Ever. Unless dinosaurs are chasing you.
It's fair to ask. Is the $55 rental an equivalent? For example, if you drive a Chevrolet Tahoe and I crash it, and your insurance only gives you a Honda Civic, you can certainly be justified in asking me to another $25/day to at least get you into an Armada or something. But you can refuse. Her only recourse would be to sue you in small claims court if you are an adult. Are you an adult?
Wait a minute. If you were LITERALLY high, then that's 100% on you and you could have been criminally charged. I interpreted "I was feeling kind of high and was a bit nervous" as just feeling a normal sort of high/nervous, not drug induced. You broke the law if you were on drugs. It's very fortunate that nothing worse happened. Both of you need to reevaluate a lot here. (And yes, if I were you I'd probably refuse the extra $25 as well.).
