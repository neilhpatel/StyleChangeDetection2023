You mention Himmler's disdain for the Catholic and Lutheran churches. I've heard of Hitler's claim that he would have preferred Islam to Christianity for the German people, did Himmler (or Hitler) have a preferred German church? Were the Reich churches an 'earnest' attempt at creating a sustainable religious movement that the Nazis could rally behind or was it just a way to marginalize people like Barth/the other Barmen declaration signers?
It's also worth noting that the full relationship between Nazism and Catholicism is an incredibly complicated and has roots in the conflict between Prussian Protestantism and Catholicism that begin long before the first Nazi rally, but that's beyond the scope of this question.
Hitler had a contentious relationship with Catholics not for any real religious reason, but because the Catholic Church was an international organization and therefore in some ways directly at odds with his intensely nationalistic ideology. Internationalist/globalist was also nearly synonymous with Jewish in volkisch rhetoric, so Catholicism often got swept up into a ambiguous and often contradictory "globalist" entity along with international bankers, Communists, the remnants of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Freemasons, and anyone else who might appear to have a cosmopolitan or globalist allegiance.
He wished to integrate religious impulses and hierarchies into Nazism (as he wished to assimilate almost all aspects of public life into Nazism), and denounced almost anything that opposed being assimilated into Nazism as pro-Jewish.
I am Jewish and a lot of Christians tell me that Hitler at least viewed Christianity as a Jewish conspiracy and wanted to eradicate it was there a difference in nazi govermental policy?
Was there ever a real possibility, or even under consideration, by the Nazi elite (maybe even Hitler himself), of a peaceful "solution"? I always thought that international war has been the goal from the start.
