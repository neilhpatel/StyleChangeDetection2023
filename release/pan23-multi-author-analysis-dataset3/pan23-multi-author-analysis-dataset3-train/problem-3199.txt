I know If this is even a little bit true, most landing crafts wouldn’t have the time or ability to wait out 10-20 seconds but maybe some could have. Also if this is true how long do you think a barrel change window would have given Allies, 20 seconds ? 2 minutes ? Thanks.
The main thing I was interested in was if Axis gunner actually had to change barrels if so how long. Yeah it may not of really been a used tactic or effective at all due to no overhead cover and other gunners but as you say people in combat do stuff that gives the illusion of safety to cope. Even if not a confirmed story, it is definitely plausible then I’d say .
Anyways, it's a perfectly plausible story of a thing that may have happened, even if it is somewhat doubtful tactically.
The most common German Machine Gun, the MG 42, had a high rate of fire which necessitated a quick change barrel to avoid overheating. The barrel change feature is common to many air-cooled machine guns, but the high rate of fire of the MG 42 made it more common. The barrel change is fairly quick, 20 seconds doesn't seem crazy for combat conditions. Certainly minutes would be too slow.
Landing Craft, both Higgins boats (LCVPs) and larger craft could wait on the beach with the ramp either up or down. Indeed, they would have to wait while beached for a short period for the troops or vehicles to disembark anyways. So it's plausible they could wait for a lull in enemy fire before dropping the steel ramp. Whether that would actually help in a boat with no overhead protection and plywood sides is unclear. People do stuff in combat that gives the illusion of safety and control of risk all the time as a way of coping with the stressful randomness of being under fire.
