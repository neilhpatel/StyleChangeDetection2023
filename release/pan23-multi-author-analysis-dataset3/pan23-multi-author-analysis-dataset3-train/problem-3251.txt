The first post from frnchslwyr is spot on. If there's a problem with timing you need to motion the court to vacate judgment for good cause- that the deadline hadn't elapsed. You also need to show a likelihood of success in your case should the court grant the motion for good cause shown. Did you already file the answer? If not, this weighs against you as you needed to file within the timeframe despite the judgment which was entered prematurely. Good luck.
Relax. I can understand now why you think your attorney hasn't been performing. But you didn't post that before, and most attorneys see red flags when potential clients complain about their former attorney. (It doesn't mean your issue doesn't have merit.).
Oh. Except the fact that we paid him $400/ month for the past 4 years as a retainer and we have been trying to get in touch with him for the last 3 weeks to respond to these time sensitive papers by email, phone, and text and kept it 100% professional each and every time. His phone number to the law firm now says "this number is not set up to receive calls". We've also contacted his paralegal CC'd in our emails with the attached court documents received by mail.
We had forwarded the information to our attorney for him to respond and the following day the judgement arrived by mail.
So the argument would be statute of limitations which is 5 years in our state and that expired right after the case was brought about.
