Here's a describing the findings of the incident, along with some absolutely brutal photos of the aftermath. Long story short is that a welder placed the radioactive material in his back pocket for several hours, forgot it was there, and returned home after a bus ride with more than a dozen other people. After returning home and removing his clothes, his wife breastfed a small child while sitting/squatting over the pants, while his other children were playing in the immediate proximity. After complaining of pain in his right thigh, his doctor diagnosed the incident as an insect bite. He ended up having his leg amputated, with most of his ass becoming infected.
It wasn't melted off, but they removed half his ass and his entire leg, and then infection took his anus and Gooch.
While not actually melted, it's gone. I don't think OP meant that it lasered his ass off or anything, just "burned" it. (Radiation burns.).
Yeah. But if it was that radioactive, it would be noticeable before killing the rest of the family.
His radiation sickness would at worst be centered on that area. But that's another thing. If it was that radioactive it would be hot and any base handling it would have checkpoints checking for radioactivity when people leave.
