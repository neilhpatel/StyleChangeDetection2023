“Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), formerly the Free Market American Educational Foundation, Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust and Working for Rights to Express & Communication,[1] is a Washinon,DC-based conservative nonprofit organization specializing in advocacy regarding legal and ethical issues related to politics. Until 2017, it was run by the former Acting United States Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.”.
“Last year, an ethics watchdog called for a review of Ocasio-Cortez's attendance at the Met Gala, in which she famously caused a stir by donning a dress bearing the slogan, "Tax the Rich." The watchdog, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust underscored that House Rule 25 imposed restrictions on the types of gifts members of Congress could receive.”.
The Senate's rules on accepting gifts indicates that it only applies to members, officers, and employees. It doesn't mention candidates. Candidates do have to file financial disclosures and are bound by FEC rules that would probably require disclosure of gifts as contributions, but it's not quite the same thing.
I'm pretty sure candidates aren't bound by all of the same ethics rules that active members of Congress are.
Is there any evidence Romney or anybody else were gifted their tickets? If they bought the tickets themselves, then there's no ethics concern.
