The Iron Cross is not per se a Nazi insignium, as it origins from the Napoleonic Wars, where it was gifted in the German Campaign of 1813 to the prussian soldiers. The same with other insignia used by the Nazis, those that were already present and just saw continued use stayed until today, while insignia introduced by the Nazis were banned.
The main banned symbols are mostly runes, like the Odal rune, the Sig rune, the Wolfsangel and the Black Sun. But the Odal rune got banned in 1994, as it got banned alongside the so called 'Wiking-Youth', a successor to the Hitler-Youth, and the Odal rune was their main symbol. So many banned symbols were either banned after WW2 or later, as they gained prominence in neo-nazi groups which got banned.
Is it due to the swastika not having been used by Germany at all prior to the Nazi regime, thus it is filed amongst the other symbols "brought to the table" by said regime?
I had never even realised the "SS" insignia were runes, nor ever heard of the Wolfsangel. This is fascinating.
Thank you for the response. I am curious as to what you would say about the origin being the reasoning, if I were to mention the oft-introduced statements regarding how the swastika is actually a very ancient symbol that actually predates Germany entirely.
