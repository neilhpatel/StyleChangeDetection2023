Doesn’t this light it up like the 4th of July for, well, literally anything that can track IR…. And also makes missile itself sensor blind… which is something you don’t want if you want your missile to A: dodge incoming fire and B: Uh, ya know, hit your target?
hypersonic weapons move so fast that no existing anti-missile-defense can even SEE/TRACK them. if it flies at you, it needs to miss you won't even see it coming.
Both contractors, Northrop Grumman and L3Harris, are moving into engineering, manufacturing and development of prototypes on schedule, company officials said. MDA down-selected the two firms in January to complete Phase 2B of the HBTSS program which runs through the launch of the two prototype medium field-of-view sensors. L3Harris was awarded $121 million; Northrop Grumman, $153 million.
The Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) is a medium-range surface-to-surface boost-glide hypersonic missile planned for use by the United States Army.
What stuff like hypersonic glide vehicles are a way to extend payload range or to miniaturize booster rockets for the same range/payload over ballistic missiles.
Hypersonic cruise missiles are a bit more unique but have terminal velocities comparable to ancient weapons like the AS-4 Kitchen. They simply decrease delivery time.
The terminal speeds of the weapons are also often not hypersonic. Aegis air-defense has also come a long way and even IRBM RVs like the DF-21 can be countered with the SM-6 in the terminal phase with reasonable capability.
