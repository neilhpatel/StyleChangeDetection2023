Do liberals suddenly not shop at Walmart anymore? Drive gas-powered automobiles or fly in airplanes? Use cellphones with rare metals in them? Eat foods harvested and ranched on lands laid waste for the sake of agriculture? Heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summers? Use electricity?
You don't have to convince rural conservatives that climate change is real, you just have to convince them that solutions to climate change are in their best financial interest.
Instead of pointing fingers let's focus on practical solutions. We don't NEED Republicans to believe in climate change, we need them to invest in alternative fuels. That can be done by incentivizing it.
This needs to be promoted as much as possible. And we need to start providing more and more relief/support to rural areas in our farm bills. And Democrats need to make it known they understand the climate change issues affecting rural areas.
I am concerned about the historical parallels here. I don't think rural voters are unjustified to feel they may be left out as new industries take form -- as solutions may benefit larger population centers more than rural areas.
