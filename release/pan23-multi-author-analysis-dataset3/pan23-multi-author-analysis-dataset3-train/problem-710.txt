all communications should be done through airbnb. then an arbitrator can help if there are any disagreements. if it wasnâ€™t listed on their airbnb page then its not a valid charge.
Was this $900 specified in the AirBNB listing? If not, then I'd contact AirBNB and tell them a property owner is claiming you owe her a fee that's not specified in the listing and that you never heard about until after the rental was over. Let them get in touch with her.
You don't know what you're talking about. First of all, $900 is WAAY too low to get into federal court. Secondly, attorneys fees are not generally awarded in federal court, although there are some specific cases where they can be awarded (copyright litigation, for example.).
If she does sue, it would almost certainly be in small claims court -- it would cost more than $900 to hire the attorney. And, despite what most people think, losers in litigation in the US don't pay winners' attorneys. (Except in some very specific cases.) And, without any evidence other than her recollection, that's not going to go very far.
