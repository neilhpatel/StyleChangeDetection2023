Yes... they would serve you with a notice to vacate first. This allows you to leave the property of your own volition and prevents eviction proceedings from being brought against you.
The new landlord may, given proper notice, serve you with a notice to vacate. That would give you 60 days to vacate the property if you have lived there for more than 6 months but less than 3 years, and 120 days if you have lived there more than 3 years.
Theoretically, if I never paid them rent and they served me after Nov 1st, and I vacated within 120 days, would they legally be able to seek rent from me for that time period?
I’m considering renting a new apartment that would begin on Nov 1st. Which means I would not be signing this new 6 month lease with the new owner of my current building. If I vacate the apartment before the new owner issues any notice, would they still have any right to pursue collecting October rent? Remember I was just informed of the sale of the building a week ago, and was given the 6 month lease papers and info about the new owner 5 days later- exactly one week before the October 1st start date of the lease would begin.

Got it. When you say “serve you” you are referring to a notice to vacate, correct? Not a notice of eviction (my understanding is that would take longer to initiate.).
Yes. You don’t get to live there without paying rent. They would probably issue you a notice to quit/vacate for non-payment of rent and if you didn’t satisfy it by paying or vacating they’d like move to court to evict you. This would damage your ability to rent in the future.
