All the satellites will be knocked out in the early stages of the war and Kessler syndrome may make it impossible to launch new ones for awhile, potentially a very long while.
So balloons are a cheap, potentially effective surveillance platform, but you'd want a good set of baseline data from before the war to compare against.
We’re talking about how a high-altitude balloon can be reliably used as a vehicle for ground penetrating radar, SIGINT bulk collection, radar jamming etc… by using airstreams.
Yes, clearly… but they did manage to get a significant number of bombs to the US mainland with balloons, using the airstream.
After the initial stages of the war you would fly your balloons over the USA to gauge how effective your attacks/defense were. Then compare to the data you got from your initial early overflights.
You may wish to educate yourself about the Mueller report and how closely the Trump campaign was in contact with and in cahoots with Russian intelligence operatives. You may be surprised how unbunk these stories were.
