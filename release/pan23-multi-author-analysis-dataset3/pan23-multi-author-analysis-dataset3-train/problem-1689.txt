Yeah, but wouldn't the phrase "I detected the odor of alcohol coming from the subject" negate the need for a moving violation, and create PC to begin the "roadside" tests to determine impairment?
In my state, you can still get a DWI if you are "way under the legal limit". Basically, you can still be impaired if you are under the legal limit. DUI is the charge if you're over the legal limit, and DWI is the charge if you're under, but there is evidence to support you being too impaired to drive safely. TX may be similar, but you definitely need an attorney at this point.
Does Texas not have a 'refusal' charge? Or is it a tactical thing where a 'refusal' leads to a better outcome than a DUI?
Maybe this is per-state? In my state, OH, refusing the post-arrest blood/urine/breath will result in a administrative license suspension of at least one year.
In the event you get to the refuse breath/blood part, you can still request an Administrative License Revocation (ALR) hearing. When you have this hearing you can challenge if the officer had the right to even ask for breath/blood and potentially not have a license suspension. Often the officers don't show up, so you also don't have a suspension then.
