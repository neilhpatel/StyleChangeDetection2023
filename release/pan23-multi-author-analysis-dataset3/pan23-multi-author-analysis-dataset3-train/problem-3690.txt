So i see no real reason to shoot yourself in the foot, so to say, again, by making people even less happy with current state of affairs. It brings no benefits at all. So those examples of civilian buildings bombings in eighties don't apply here. You don't count current overall social state of mind situation, which is different from 90s.
And last is the source itself. I would agree without a question if it was coming from USA's intelligence as they already proven to have somewhat reliable info about what's going on right now while Ukraine's and Russia's is by the large margain is just pure propaganda.
I'd say, Ukraine has been pretty good with putting out credible and accurate information about things that have already happened (at least when it comes to official sources).
In short, Putin is trying to make the Holy War happen, and it ain't happening, because the postmodernist apathy of his regime's ideology makes people not care about that, just like they don't care about how much Putin steals.
At the start I thought if Russia would struggle Putin would be replaced but by now it seems as if the whole country really is ok with being completely wrecked just so they don't have to accept a loss.
...unless they make people rise up for a Holy War, which is the futile bet Putin is currently making (based on the rhetoric in Russian media). Yes, it won't work. But Putin is still making this bet because that's the only one he can still make.
That, however, includes Putin himself. He didn't get the memo that the times have changed. And now he's not getting the memo that the war is already lost. We'll see a lot of tragic things happen because of that.
