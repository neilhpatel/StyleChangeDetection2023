China can't take Taiwan. It is an impossible task. Half the force wouldn't make it across the straits. They would also need to be willing to fire on US flagged ships that would no doubt expect unimpeded access to Taiwanese ports.
Honestly I think the solution here is going to be to decouple from China as quickly as possible and then recognize Taiwan and open a US naval base there. Literally just sail a Carrier battle group into a Taiwanese harbor and declare Taiwan sovereign and independent. Oh and by the way the US now has a naval base here, invading Taiwan means war with the US.
Which foreign militaries have the capabilities to support an naval landing on Taiwan. Of what i know, the only nation capable of this, is the US.
Artillery... just sounds like a bad plan, if Ukraine has shown anything, it is that military extortion aint well received from both those sympathetic to their side and those opposing them. If they try it, it might forever destroy political influence they have inside Taiwan.
