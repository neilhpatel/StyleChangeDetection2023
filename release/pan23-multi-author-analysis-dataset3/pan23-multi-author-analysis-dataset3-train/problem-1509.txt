So, here i leave my comment strongly expressing disaproval of their actions today and warning that further actions against cristhianity's temple will not be acceptable, and shall receive an even more strongly worded comment, being capable of escalating into maybe a letter.
Okay, they just raided a church, because it was "subversive and pro-russian" , oh boy, thats an old excuse, i wanted to Go on a rant here, but i am too angry to form a chohesive argument.
Yes but if that temple during it's masses glorifies Russia and prays for it, as well as turning people against the government this is a valid argument to raid that church with a fucking SWAT team, because it's a direct threat to Ukraine's integrity.
I mean, the temples are an extension of the FSB and these churches have been stated to provide artillery targets for Russia, help Russian military resettle Ukranian Refugees, and provide camouflaged militant groups behind enemy lines.
>Behind each of the dioceses, there are militant groups camouflaged as public organisations which consist of Cossack organisations and retired security forces and provide force support to the Russian Church.
