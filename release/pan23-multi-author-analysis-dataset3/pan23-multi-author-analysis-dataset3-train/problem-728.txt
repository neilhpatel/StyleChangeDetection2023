You don’t generally get to choose someone else if you don’t want to be executor. You could hire an attorney or get help elsewhere to do the job. Maybe that’s what Mom is doing? Having sister help while she keeps the job?
You have no obligation to accept being executor if named in will. It would fall to next person named in will, or who court appointments if no one in will steps up.
Then what happens is that your sister would petition the probate court to be appointed as executor. Your mother would have to sign a waiver. Depending on how your local court works, you would either be required to also sign a waiver or would have the right to object to the appointment.
Second, depending on where your parents live and exactly what property is in the estate, your mother may be able to use a small estate process to take title to the car. That’s sometimes as simple as filling out an affidavit and presenting it to DMV.
Third, your Mom can’t just hand over the executor duties. The probate court must approve it. If your sibling petitions to be appointed executor of the estate, you have the right to object. And fourth, if the sibling is appointed, there are legal protections that give you the right to sue if the siblings messes up the estate or steals from it.
Correct, my father named my mother as executor, and my mom wants to transfer over those rights to my sibling. He did not designate anything in the will to anyone besides to my mother, and vice versa.
