It wasn't a straight line from the Rebellions of 1837-38 to responsible government. In any case, the first colony in British North America (now Canada) to receive responsible government was Nova Scotia in January 1848 due to the efforts of the journalist Joseph Howe. After Nova Scotia was New Brunswick and the Province of Canada that same year.
The union doesn't imply Scotland is currently a sovereign state. It's very explicitly not under current law. That's never been seriously under debate. England is not a sovereign state either. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the sovereign state.
Because legally Scotland is the country? I'm not talking about cultural/linguistic/etc. definitions of a country, Scotland already is one.
Are Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland nation states? No, they have not been since 1707. They are now regions inside the UK. For sentimental reasons we've decided to call those regions "countries" due to their history.
We can call them countries if we want, but it's misleading as the general public use the term country when they mean nation state. Country has no legal basis. We can call them flippity floppity flutes if we wanted to and it mean the same.
