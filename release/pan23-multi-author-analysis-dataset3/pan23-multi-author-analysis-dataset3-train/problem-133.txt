As many commenters have said, Florida DOT is not very forgiving. But no one mention, it is free to consult with a personal injury lawyer. This is a tough case, but if a lawyer accepts it, generally the lawyer pays the upfront court filing costs, medical records, and other expert fees--not you. These fees only get reimbursed if the lawyer makes a recovery for you. In addition, you do not owe the lawyer any money for attorney's fees until the lawyer makes a recovery by settlement, verdict, or arbitration award. If there is no win, there is no fee. This means there is no out-of-pocket or financial risk to you. If cannot hurt to explain what happened to a local professional.
I am not licensed in Florida but have done work in Florida, so I do know some of the important aspects of wrongful death and municipal liability. You should definitely just ask a lawyer to check. In order states, I personally do know 4-5 examples of where pedestrians or motorist deaths on dangerous roads resulted in change or even liability against the City/County/State.
You may want to read this article that came out today about how states (especially Florida) are emphasizing speed and traffic flow but this is leading to skyrocketing pedestrian deaths.
