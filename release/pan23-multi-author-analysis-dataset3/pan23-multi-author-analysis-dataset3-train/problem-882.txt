Ukraine has been hitting ammo dumps with HIMARS for a long time now but I think this is the first time we've heard of the Russians actually turning one of those ammo dump targets into a barracks too.
They are mad their local military leaders got hundreds of mobiks killed by having them use a vocational school building loaded with tons of ammo as a barracks. So the anger is directed towards the Russian leadership and not Ukraine.
They're actually not blaming Ukraine (as much) this time around - the anger seems to be more directed at their own commanders, and their incompetence.
Well, not quite - they're not questioning what they were doing in Ukraine, moreso what they were doing in that specific building, which was a terrible tactical move.
We are pissed that, after our relentlessly bombing their infrastructure and their civilian centers, the Ukranians are killing our soldiers How inhumane of them.
It's not like Ukraine hopped the Russian border and raped women and mutilated civilian men. Bozhe miy... In the south here we'd say Christ on a cracker. What a load of propagandisy bullsh!t. Sorry for my cursing, just so mad about this...
