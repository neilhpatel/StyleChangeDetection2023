Probably depends on the area. Our fence company wouldn’t build shit without knowing the property line and even ensure that the “outer wall” of our fence was within our property line.
Having just had a new fence installed by a reputable large local company, in my experience they will build the fence wherever you tell them without verifying anything.
Get proof of your property lines and see if you can contact the fence company that installed the fence. If you can prove they illegally installed a fence on your property, they may be liable to remove it and fix your lawn. They should have verified this before installing the fence. They should have insurance that will cover the damages they did.
I worked with a guy, client, that thought his family invented the can. So he thought he was allowed to take anything that came in a can. It didn't work out for him very well. You can't argue with crazy, and I suggest you don't. Just record his bizarre behavior and go to the police/lawyer for future advice.
Sorry about your crazy neighbor. I'd stall some cameras might be a good idea. If you have proof of the crazy, filing reports with police will be easier.
