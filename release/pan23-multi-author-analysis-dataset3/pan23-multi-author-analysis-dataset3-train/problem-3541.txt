I do not by the narrative that they should leave Trump alone because a referral will just politicize the process. The hardcore MAGA crowd is already making it political and they've shown that they will never stop making it political. The only time compromise should be pursued is if both sides are willing to come to the table and give a bit. Otherwise, it's not compromise... It's caving to unreasonable demands.
The important thing is to demonstrate to the rationale middle that Congress is actually doing their jobs. Ultimately that's why the voters put them there. If they can't get anything done, then the voters will replace them. That's the fundamental theory behind the Republicans always gumming up the works. Don't let the opposition get anything done and the voters will eventually put you in charge.
However, the GOP also doesn’t want to set the precedent that GOP politicians can actually be held accountable. Quite the conundrum!
I would think it’s in the GOPs best interest to get him convicted, jailed, and out of the way ASAP so they can focus on someone new.
I would say jail, I would like to believe where he goes the people who helped him would go as well leaving the GOP to reinvent themselves and gain some sanity.
I’m not quite sure anymore, as much as I despise a certain conservative sub here because of the practice of perma banning people for asking a legitimate question, I still lurk there to see what they are saying.
Some have now openly wondered how trump has fallen so far so fast, a few have expressed how they never trusted him all along (which is bs but what ever) and even fewer are angry because they look like fools because of him.
