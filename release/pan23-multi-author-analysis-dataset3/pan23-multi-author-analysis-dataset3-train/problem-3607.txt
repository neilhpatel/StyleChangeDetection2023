I would think most people would be ok with any land concessions Ukraine freely agrees to. We should not try to force concessions onto them to help and embolden Russia. That will only backfire against everyone.
3 is the most risky since it shows dictators that they can gain territory through conquest still in the modern world, and if you make it painful enough you can win. Option 1 is the best and least risky.
Nope, appeasement didn’t work at Munich in 1938, and appeasement will not secure peace for our time today. The Ukrainians want to defend their homeland let’s give them what they need if that doesn’t prevent a larger war with Russia then that war was inevitable and at least Ukraine will have badly wounded Russia before the West is forced to commit troops to defend ourselves.
I'm against war... which is why I support Ukraine defending itself against Russian aggression, to ensure that aggressor nations don't profit off their wars and thereby discouraging further aggression.
I'm anti-war, which is why I support giving weapons to Ukraine to defend itself. The Russian invasion was an unprovoked act of aggression and appeasing it will only encourage more Russian aggression.
Ideally arrange for Putin to have a fall from a high building like so many other Russian leaders and use the "chaos" as an excuse to negotiate a full withdraw from Ukraine. But since you're just baiting the nuclear question, the oligarchs have far more to lose than gain from nuking Ukraine. That would change Ukraine from a proxy war into an open one and given the state of the Russian army, that would be very bad for the oligarchs.
Question, what if the decision to start this war, Putin decision to start this war was likewise influence by Russia's arms industry?
Do you think that stopping this war wouldn't then mean that Putin wouldn't directly start another to keep that industry going?
