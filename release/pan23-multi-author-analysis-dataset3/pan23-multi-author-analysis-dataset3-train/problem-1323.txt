They say that politics should not be involved in sports. This is just ludicrous when athletes or teams are representing their countries and governments. Of course it's political. Russia, Belarus (Iran, NK and Myanmar for that matter) . do not get to join in the "fun" of sports and having their flag and anthems represented when they are killing their own people and starting wars. They do not get to participate in these events as if everything is normal. Russia has killed 10s of thousands of Ukrainians and devastated the, cities, towns and villages. Russia has destroyed sporting facilities and killed Ukrainian athletes. Russia needs to be banned in full.
If Russia is allowed to compete, I'm banning Olympics for life. The IOC is one of the most corrupt organizations in the world anyways, up with there with FIFA. They decide on the host nation by seeing who will pay the best bribes and gives them the best prostitues. Besides, the Olympics are super lame anyways, and have caused nations to into massive debts to get their silly events in, like who can throw a frisbee far, who can jump high on a stick, and who can prance around underwater the greatest.
Some guy can hit a fabric ball around, if you find that exciting, great. But it shouldn't lead to actual deaths (like in Qatar). It's big a corporate wank masquerading as some sort of faux-tribal nationalism.
Agreed. Sports are fine and all, but when we get to the point were hosting them requires 100,000s of slaves to build the stadium, for billionaires who don't even watch the events, it's gone too far.
