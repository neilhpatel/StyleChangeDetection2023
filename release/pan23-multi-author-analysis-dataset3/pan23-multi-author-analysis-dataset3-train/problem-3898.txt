1) Put rent into a separate bank account. This, with a paper trail showing attempt to pay, works favorably to your position if anything should happen to end in court. Assume rent remains the same until otherwise notified.
2) Many leases require official contact addresses. (Quick Google search says yours does too) Send a certified letter with signature to that address mentioning your conversation to change rent and requesting to confirm current rent price. Receipt of letter carries legal weight and landlord has the responsibility to respond. (Edit: Send a rent check too... If it is cashed, you found a way to pay).
Finally, you can complain to the city, who can fine the landlord if the rental doesn't meet habitability standards.
OP, chances are the landlord has already been taking money from the rent assistance program, but they have to be able to “prove” they haven’t received any rent. I wouldn’t want any part of this whether landlord, building manager, or tenant. Cover yourselves and out the money aside. If the government comes knocking and asking questions, you’ll be able to say the money is in an escrow account but the landlord just never took it. Account for every penny.
This is most likely the case. We have 9 properties and 3 of our tenants asked to not pay rent even though they were all working or receiving the same SSI benefits as usual. What they were asking us to do constitutes fraud against the Federal government. Uh, no thanks!
