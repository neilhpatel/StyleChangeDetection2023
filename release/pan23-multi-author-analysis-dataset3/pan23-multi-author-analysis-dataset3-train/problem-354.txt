How seriously was US credibility undermined by the assassination of Ngo Din Diem? I've seen this marked as a turning point in the war and would love your thoughts on Diem's popularity (or lack thereof in some circles) and how seriously we should take the claim that he was the only nationalist leader that could unite the south. Were there on the ground ramifications to his death? Thank you!
Thank you for this fascinating ama! Pretty much all media focuses on Americas role in the Vietnam War (for obvious reasons of course), but were many other nations involved Phú Yên in any capacity?
3: How were US pacification operations were perceived by Vietnamese civilians? Did they help in the image of the US and its troops and minimalizing potential VC recruitment?
2: What were the right and wrong things in terms of military effectiveness the US did in its pacification and clear, hold and destroy operations?
A key part of my research is liking conventional warfare with pacification. In my book I argue that conventional warfare was pacification, at least in 1966 and 1967. For me, in the Vietnam War, pacification is the umbrella under which one finds conventional warfare. More to the point, though, I see conventional warfare a fulfilling the security component of pacification. As for political warfare, that would certain fit nicely into pacification in that it helps illicit the loyalty of those being pacified.
Using conventional forces to advance pacification creates the image of success. By that I mean a U.S. Army unit uses superior firepower and mobility to clear an area of enemy forces. For observers it seems that all is going well, and then that Army leaves. Then the enemy returns and the truth sets in that pacification has not progressed much, if at all.
