There are often different rules for inherently dangerous animals (such and bulls and stallions), which _may_ apply in your jurisdiction (you'd need a lawyer versed in local law to answer that for sure).
You may also want to call animal control, depending on your county there may be stock laws that would cover this sort of thing, which means the county could fine him for at-large livestock. This varies widely by location.
the vet costs, etc, should be on him as you did not want your mare bred and he's responsible for the foal (side note: if this happens again, ask your vet for lutalyse immediately, within 10-12 days of the mating). Legally this may be a grey area depending on your county in Texas, but if you have documentation of contacting him about the fence, and can prove it's a repeated problem and he is aware of it, I think you at least have a civil case to recoup the vet costs, and costs of care for a foal you didn't want.
Given early, you’re preventing a pregnancy, not “aborting “ a foal. It’s like “plan B” but for horses. If that’s not for you, that’s fine, no need to be upset about the suggestion. I’ve had all kinds of experiences with horses including saving many from slaughter, this isn’t a suggestion made out of coldness but because it’s standard of care in cases like this.
