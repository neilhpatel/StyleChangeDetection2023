Just concerned. The end game seems redundant. I like the theory these old white men are angry that society is standing up to their outdated ways that serve the insanely rich(not you, small biz owner. The People are on your side.) CEO types making millions a year for doing not much else besides being born into the right family. At who's expense? The majority of us. All of us carry these greedy, mentally ill rich people on our backs. Trickle down has been debunked, over and over. And they're mad. Big mad about it.
Just my theory. I hate seeing what the world is coming to these days. It's sad and comes at a cost of incredible loss of advancement for our greater collective society. For what? So less than half of one percent can own multiple yachts? Nonsensical. So sick of this virus.
