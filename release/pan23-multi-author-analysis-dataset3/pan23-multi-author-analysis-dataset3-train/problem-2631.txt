Because pro-EU Hungarians succeeded, and then the anti-EU Hungarians are both shitheads and are in power.
Just so you guys know, we have had really strong anti-EU propaganda for at least decade now in hungary despite the money pouring in. Currently there are giant fliers all around tge country with bombs on them that have "EU sanctions" written on them, saying "Brussels bombed europe's economy".
This is a huge point of internal conflict in hugary it is common for political parties in election time to use catchphrases like "EU labor, EU wages.".
You literally can't open youtube wihout hearing a propaganda message on how the sanctions don't work because the war is still going on and that the EU is killing us with them.".
Yes, that's the point. Orb√°n is trying to put the EU under pressure with the constant veto in order to get more money, as the Hungarian economy is on the verge of collapse. Basically, this has nothing to do with Ukraine. Recently, Hungary vetoed the just to hinder the EU's way of functioning. The same is true for delaying the current NATO expansion.
they idolize him because he is a role model for every right-wing populist party: how to expand total power and steal a gigantic wealth with rampant corruption, and at the same time present oneself as the only savior of the nation for masses of fanatical supporters.
