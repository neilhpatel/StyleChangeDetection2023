police reportedly found a "steering wheel weight" in the vehicle's footwell. Such a device is used to trick Tesla's safety systems into thinking a driver's hands remain on a wheel so that the autopilot remains active, according to the police's release.
Cars like Tesla have a very long way to go before their automatic systems can be similarly trusted as nearly as infallible. That’s not surprising given the orders of magnitude more challenging terrestrial environment and proximity to all sorts of other things, both stationary and moving, and sometimes moving directly at you.
However, aircraft autopilots work in 3 dimensions with 6 degrees of freedom and control the aircraft through multiple modes of motion that land-based vehicles never experience, like Dutch roll, phugoid, and turbulence. They are also equipped with automatic terrain avoidance systems to steer the aircraft up and away from ground obstacles.
Companies that build and sell these systems to consumers, and the government agencies that regulate them, need to follow the same system maturity approach as is used in aircraft systems.
With respect to computer vision, some aircraft are equipped with synthetic vision systems that use IR and visual cameras to “see” in the dark and through clouds and fog. These are primarily pilot aids, though some systems have started to integrate the data they generate with the autopilot for precision landings.
Yes there are autopilots nowadays that can land the aircraft automatically and such, but those are very fancy and rare outside of large airliners.
Most GA aircrafts that you're referring to do have basic autopilots, but vast majority of the autopilots are operated by airliners. Writing airliners off when they are the largest users of autopilot functions just because it doesn't support your argument is disingenuous.
