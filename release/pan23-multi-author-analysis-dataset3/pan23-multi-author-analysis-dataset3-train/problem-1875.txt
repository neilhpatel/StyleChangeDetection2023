I've seen from 11.20pm last night (assuming Eastern time), putting Frisch up 5,000 votes with only 11,000 votes left to count. The remaining votes would have had to break.
But updated 6.30am, put Frisch up only 3,475 votes with nearly 30,000 left to count - with the total estimate of votes going up from around 295,000 (at 11pm) to 330,000. For Boebert to pull this back she only needs the remaining votes to break 55/45 in her favour, which is manageable.
I‚Äôm not sure why the New York Times analysis has the remaining votes in Pueblo County breaking for Boebert when 55% of the vote total Went to Frisch. Maybe they are using last election cycle‚Äôs percentages in their estimates? Or maybe they know something I don‚Äôt. Military vote? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Same! This race which shouldn‚Äôt have been close is a bit of an outlier due due Qbert‚Äôs toxic personality, but CNN has a list of key districts broken down by Toss up, likely dem and likely R here:
There‚Äôs a lot of blue leading right now. But, I also worry about a ‚Äúblue mirage‚Äù as early voting might skew D.
The table titled 'How Votes Compare with 2020' is a real eye opener. Frisch is well outperforming vs the 2020 Presidential election, while Boebert is woefully under-performing. It looks like if Frisch can get 50% of the remaining votes in Pueblo Co, which he currently leads by 11 points, he'd be sitting pretty.
They must think the margins will swing even wider for B in these counties - although 55% of the remaining 36K votes left to count come from Pueblo county where Frisch is currently ahead by a 11% margin.
Based on that data and the current margins in each of those counties - I am calculating out of a total 36,450 approx votes to count that Frisch wins 19,246 of them to Boebert's 17,204.
