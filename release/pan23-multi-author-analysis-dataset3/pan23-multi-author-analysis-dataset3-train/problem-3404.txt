What? You mean the timeline of: Russia annexes Crimea in 2014, Trump runs in 2015 and wins, starts fucking with Ukraine's gov. by threatening to withhold aid and getting impeached over it, the whole trump tower moscow thing, and praising Putin, Xi, and Un, threatening to pull out of NATO, and generally being a twat trying to stay in power illegally until finally getting the boot in 2021, prompting the Russians to have to rethink their angle of attack raises your suspicions?
The point I was making is that the warmongering mentality isn't unique to Putin but that there are many people in positions of power who would try to continue or even try to escalate the war further.
I don't doubt that Putin would like to attack America, but he can want to do something all he wants, if he isn't able to it doesn't matter what he wants.
When did I say proactive action would have helped? I never claimed that it would help the U.S. to get involved in these conflicts earlier, it only stands to hurt us. Getting involved in foreign conflicts in the name of "protecting Democracy" is what got us Vietnam and Afghanistan.
