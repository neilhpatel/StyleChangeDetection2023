For example, California currently has 48 GW of green energy deployed throughout the state. Do you know how much energy the state has tied up in permitting? 246 GW! California has more green energy tied up in permitting than it has deployed throughout the state.
These regulations were useful at a time when fossil fuels were cheaper than renewables. Now that renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels they are hindering the energy transition and ironically helping fossil fuels.
You guys are wrong about this. The biggest thing holding back green energy right now is permitting. Green energy is currently more competitive than either coal or oil in terms of cost at this point!
Manchin is right on permitting reform. At this point one of the biggest barriers to utility scale green energy deployment is permitting.
The biggest thing holding back green energy today is permit reform. Fossil fuels are getting permits at a faster rate than green energy projects. This will put them on even footing where Green energy is already cost competitive vs everything save LNG right now.
