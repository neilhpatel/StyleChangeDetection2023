It depends on the reported suspicious behavior, how the person reacts if the officer tries to engage in a consensual conversation. An investigation is more than just a Terry Stop.
If it's, "there's somebody I don't know walking on the sidewalk," then no, that would not qualify as reasonable suspicion for an investigative detention.
Yes however after a cop has had reports of suspicious activity or persons then them following up on that with the said people/person is technically an investigatory questioning, right?
Title: Are reports from citizens to a police officer of a suspicious person cause enough for the officer to conduct investigatory questioning? Even if there is no specific possible crime to report.
It does require, if not "a specific crime," some list of specific crimes. "You might be up to no good," or "You might be doing something criminal," without being able to express what, is insufficient. But for example, an officer observed two men walk alternately back and forth along an identical route, pausing to stare in the same store window, which they did for a total of about 24 times, with each completion of the route followed by a conference between the two on a corner. There is nothing criminal about walking along a sidewalk, looking in a store window, and conversing on a corner. But in the aggregate, those facts justify a brief detention and investigation to allow the officer to confirm, or dispel, his suspicions that the pair were casing the store prior to robbing it.
But if you are seized, then police must be able to justify that detention by facts they know at the time, and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts, that in aggregate would justify a suspicion that the person is engaging in, or is about to engage in, criminal activity. This is a standard less than probable cause, but requiring more than a hunch or guess. Note that police are not required to reveal the basis of their suspicion to the person they have detained.
