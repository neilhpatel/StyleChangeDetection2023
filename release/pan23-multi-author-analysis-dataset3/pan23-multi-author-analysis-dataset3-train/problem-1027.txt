Didnâ€™t they just arrest the fbi agent/director who cleared the trump campaign of Russian involvement because he has been involved with Russia for years?
I mean one of the findings is that the Trump campaign wanted Clinton's emails so they got a guy to contact Russian hackers to get them! The Trump campaign knew about information hacked by Russians and sent to Wikileaks before that information was posted to Wikileaks.
This entire op-ed reads much less like a statement of facts and more like what you get from right-wingers on social media who didn't read the Mueller report but rather just watched Tucker Carlson summarize it for them before reading some Facebook memes from pages with names like "Real Patriots 4 Trump and Jesus.".
That's your reply? You basically just stuck your fingers in your ears while yelling "fake news." I linked to actual, easy-to-read summaries of the Mueller report with descriptions of its actual findings. How is any of that "vapor?" How is any of this simply someone "talking to a Russian?".
The only serious articles repeating the "no findings of collusion" are ones written immediately after the Barr DoJ released its entirely dishonest summary of the report (without actually releasing the full report) and people took the summary at its word. This op-ed was written over a year later, however, and well after the full report was released detailing a lot of apparent collusion.
