Just 1% of republicans can block anything crazy. It’s like the dems in the senate but for people that need to get re-elected in two years in very local (not statewide) races.
I also think Roe had way more to do with the outcome of the midterms than the actual candidates that were up for election.
I'm not "bOtH sIdEs"ing here, but from an electoral perspective they fill the same niche. The parties they support would rather they stay quiet and out of the way of more centrist traditional candidates. Boebert and Bernie are nothing alike but they're both a threat to their respective "big tent".
For those against this tactic, consider that the equivalent from the other side would be if the GOP ran a bunch of Bernie Sanders ads in the 2020 primary that were completely truthful about his stances and policies and told people they shouldn't vote for him because he's way more extreme than Joe Biden.
No, they funded primary campaigns for the whack jobs so they would beat out more moderate candidates in the primaries, and then ran ads for those far-right candidates in the election saying that they don’t deserve a platform. Read carefully.
