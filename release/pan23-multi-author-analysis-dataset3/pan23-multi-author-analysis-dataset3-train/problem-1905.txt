Would you really want to keep living in his house? If I was you, I'd move back with my parents while I figure things out. Then I would collect all the information regarding the bank account and make sure I'm actually entitled to more money andnmake a desicion to pursue (or not) if the amount is significant.
You need to have hard numbers as the burden of proof in this case is yours. Also, do NOT ever again open joint accounts with someone you're not married to.
It gets messy with joint bank accounts and people who aren’t married. You’d need to prove what money was yours after any was used for expenses and you’d have a civil case against him.
Of course, if you sue him, he could countersue you for unpaid utilities, fair market value of rent, etc.
You can sue him for that $13,000 and if you get a judgment you can put a lien on his house, garnish his wages, etc.
Their first step would be to write a letter to your ex demanding your cut of the funds, or you'd sue. He might hand it over without wanting to fight it.
