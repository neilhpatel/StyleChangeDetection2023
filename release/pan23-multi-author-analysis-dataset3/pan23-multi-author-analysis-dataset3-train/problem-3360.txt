Just stick to the facts of what you know happened. Don’t inject your opinion on whether it was malpractice or abuse, both of which are legal conclusions. Truth is a defense to slander, and the burden of proof would be on your former employer — they’d have to show that what you reported is false.
Even if they wanted to sue for slander, telling the truth is an impenetrable defense against slander suits. Slander only sticks if you are lying about the facts, not if you are telling the truth.
It’s not slander if it’s true. Slander cases are NOTORIOUSLY hard to prove bc of the 1st Amendment and they have to prove intent to cause harm with your words. Plus you’re reporting to an entity- I’m not sure if you would be considered a whistleblower- but they can’t retaliate against you. Think of it this way- if it was a doctor who did these things to a human and you reported them to the hospital/medical board/law enforcement nothing could happen to you. These people have malpractice insurance they are protected and nothing your dad says is true. And if you didn’t report this you know other animals would suffer, could you live with that? Don’t be vague tell them absolutely every single thing that you’ve seen. You can even ask whoever you’re reporting to if they keep it secret but they can not retaliate against you if they did it would be illegal.
