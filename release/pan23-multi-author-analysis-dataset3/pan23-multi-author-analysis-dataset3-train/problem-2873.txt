I did not sublet to him. I’m in ocean city working this summer. He contacted me about housing and I gave him the landlords number and the address of the apartment. I asked him to contact the landlord. He comes in and tells me he has contacted the landlord so the whole time I’m believing him until one day he texts me saying he got kicked out by the landlord. He finally discussed with the landlord about paying rent but apparently the rent was too much so he couldn’t pay it. The landlord told him not to stay at the house otherwise I would be charged for it but he still did. I work 13 hours everyday so not able to monitor him. He is found again and kicked out & the Landlord charges me $1000 for his presence so I held his luggage hostage because I have paid that money to the Landlord out of my pocket.
He stupidly got the police involved and they are calling me, I don’t like talking to the police because they will always find a way to get you in trouble.
Are they any laws that protect me for having his property. He was trespassing and his name is not on the lease so I understand that since my name is on the lease, I am responsible for everything in the house. I know the police will try to say I stole it but I did not. All I’m asking for is a reimbursement of the money I have paid the landlord.
Like I mentioned, he asked about housing and I gave him the landlords number and apartment available. He came and lied that he had talked to the landlord, that’s why his things were in his apartment. If he is not on the lease, he is trespassing and since my name is on the lease, I am responsible for everything in the apartment.
If he was supposed to do this with the LL to get his own apartment why are you involved in letting him in?
Did he tell you he had an agreement with the landlord to sleep on your couch in the apartment you rented or something?
