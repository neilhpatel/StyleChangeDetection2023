"This form of state terror, widespread across the Roman Empire which included Europe, North Africa and Western Asia, originated several centuries before the Common Era continuing into the fourth century CE when the practice was discontinued by Constantine, the emperor of Rome. Hengel, in his monumental work on the subject, Crucifixion (1989:22-23) writes that while authors generally regard it’s origin as in Persia due to the writings of Herodotus it’s practice was found among the Indians, Assyrians, Scythians, Taurians, Celts, Greeks, Seleucids, Romans, Britanni, Numidians, Carthagians the latter who may have transferred it’s knowledge to the Romans." - Crucifixion in Antiquity: The Archaeological Evidence, by Joe Zias.
The reasoning was probably the same. It caused immense pain, it took time for the victim to die, and they could be clearly shown in public as a deterrant.
Herodotus describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 B.C.E: "They nailed him to a plank and hung him up ... this Artayctes who suffered death by crucifixion".
surprised that Herodotus already used the word “crucifixion” in 479 B.C.E . Is that such an old word?
