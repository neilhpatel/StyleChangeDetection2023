Do you want titles in German, Polish, French or another language other than English? Ask that as its own thread. The following are from the :
See especially The 1857 Rebellion, edited by Biswamoy Pati (2007), but drylaw may have more suggestions.
On my bibliography: it's partly on earlier resistance and partly on 1857, but can recommend all of them. For a historical overview on 1857 the Bayly chapter is good; for more background Pati's book. For current perspectives on marginalized groups the Bates edited volume. Some of those articles were on jstor a while ago so worth searching them there - the one by Wagner is great and on researchgate, and is esp. on historiography so should be interesting for you.
I'm interested to know if there are any ongoing attempts are renaming/defining historical eras at the present. I think everyone has pet peeves about what classifies as "antiquity" or noting that the 100 Years War is in fact neither one real war nor lasted to any precision of 100 years. Just curious if there are current serious conversations about things like uprooting the Egyptian Dynasties classifications or renaming the Mycenean Greeks.
