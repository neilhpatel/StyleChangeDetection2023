From anecdotes I've read on /r/army and various other military subs over the years, apparently the Soviet and then Russian military did not train at all the same way that NATO and other Western militaries did. Instead of combined arms training where various elements like infantry, armor, artillery, and aviation train together, the Russians chose to train each element separately and without integrating each other into training/planning. Like each branch behaved in a way where they thought each was the key to winning a fight or was the most important.
So armor trained without infantry support, infantry trained to fight alone and without explicitly supporting armor and vice-versa. Air defense trained alone without coordinating with aviation like air craft and helicopters, meaning they were trigger happy to shoot stuff down since they didn't train with friendly aircraft in the same skies as their notional targets.
It's likely a big reason why their VDV and air assaults failed. There was little to no combined arms training with regular infantry, armor support, or CAS and aerial resupply.
The issue with them is that either their tanks are by and large low quality.or they use them by themselves without proper infantry support.
Oddly enough the country using human wave tactics isn't using enough troops when it comes to using their tanks.
the gap has narrowed considerably but something people forget, because they think about WW2, is in the modern day most tanks arent killed by other tanks.
The funny thing is, Russia likely doesnâ€™t actually have many tanks left, at least not ones that can make a difference in a battle.
I wouldn't place any bets on Russia actually "running out of tanks" within the next year or two, even if they have to roll them out unmodernized.
