It’s not uncommon on the battlefield and I could see Iran or someone sending “shipments” of sabotaged weapons in hopes they get captured and used.
I didn’t realize these were primarily Iranian weapons that were captured, that makes me think they’re probably in better shape than I first thought.
They were and if Kyiv was still under threat of encirclement I’d agree, but I don’t want Ukraine to spend 3 months training a soldier to have him get injured because the head spacing was off and his rifle blew up in his face.
The Ukrainians are busy fighting for their lives, it's unlikely in the extreme that anybody is smuggling weapons out of Ukraine, getting caught would swiftly get you executed.
Yeah but Ukraine is arming even their citizens and plus they're not picky I think given that they need any and all help that they can get. As long as the weapons are maintained or can be refurbished that's enough.
I see no good reason not to send them. They're weapons the US likely has little use for and Ukraine desperately needs. Plus I don't think they be costing the US much or at all.
