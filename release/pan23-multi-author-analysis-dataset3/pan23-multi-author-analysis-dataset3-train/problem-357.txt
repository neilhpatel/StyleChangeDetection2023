Also if they submit paperwork I believe you are allowed to call and confirm that the doctor/therapist wrote the note.
Have the provided documentation from a doctor or therapist they regularally see? They are required to in order to have an ESA. If they do not or if the present some paperwork from the internet then it is NOT and ESA and you can proceed with a notice to remove the dog or face eviction.
Edit: also request the documentation ASAP. If they say they need time to get it, then that dog is NOT and ESA and you can request they remove it from the premises or face eviction.
As others have suggested, you should talk to a lawyer about the proper eviction procedures. Those will take some time.
Check your local ordinance for a leash law, and follow the procedure to report the dog. In my area, there's a special number for animal control to investigate a non-emergency incident, and we use 911 for emergency incidents. Your tenants are not being responsible dog owners, and reporting the dog to animal control will help protect everyone, including the dog.
It's dangerous for the dog to be allowed to roam free outside. The dog could get hurt, or hurt someone. What if this puppy dog gets hit by a car? He's already gotten in a fight with another dog in the middle of the street. He could bite a person, especially the person who tries to break up the next dog fight. The dog isn't safe.
