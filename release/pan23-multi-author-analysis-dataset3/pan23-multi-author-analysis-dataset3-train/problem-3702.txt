But I want to point out it was simply extremely fucked up when Trump allowed Turkey to massacre the Kurdish cities in Syria.
Its just that after an unfortunate thing like the terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turks just switch on their all Kurds= terrorists vision and go on a rampage. The Turks have a history of genocides and mass killings, I just wished they’d actually target PKK instead of Kurds in general. But hey, what am I going to do about when America and Israel don’t even bother trying to help Kurds establish a state, when they called them their allies so many times. If those 2 nations can’t help the Kurds create a state, I believe no one can.
Kurds want borders that are split between 4 nation states AND are currently living in a NATO members borders.
Invite them in, it isn’t quite the Kurdistan they imagined, but it would give them control of the Bosporus and a foothold in Europe. In return Turkey would be returned to pre-Ottoman borders and rightfully forgotten.
Kurds aren’t going to attack the US, they aren’t Jihadis or terrorists, they’re just people fighting against regional genocide on several fronts, fighting for a home.
Turkey’s military would go down in a heartbeat if they weren’t terrorizing stateless groups, never mind if they faced an adversary with US support like Ukraine.
