I literally spent 3 hours putting together a well sourced repsonse to someone I was talking to about why "kids these days are lazy" is wrong and that we have been getting fucked for decades. The person I was talking to said "I dont use sources but I hope you can see how I feel about this" and proceeded to blame too much "free college" for why all our stuff is messed up. I blocked him on the two apps I use after explaining I wasn't interested in talking with someone who when presented with evidence responds with "nah but this is how I feel about it" instead of reevaluating their stance.
It's all procedural nonsense and there is no actual reason not to filibuster everything. It costs you nothing to do when the population doesn't care/pay attention about/to the inner workings of politics but it can gain you amendments or the ability to make the other side look incompetent.
Also most things die on the speakers desk or in committee and never even get to a point where it would be necessary to filibuster.
But I'm just picturing if Walker ever had to get up and speak for a filibuster. What abominations and nonsense would come out of his mouth if he got speak for 5 hours??
