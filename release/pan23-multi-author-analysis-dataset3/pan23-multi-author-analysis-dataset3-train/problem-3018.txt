A million Spotify streams usually still make a couple thousand USD so it is certainly worth pursuing, although hiring a lawyer will probably not be worth the cost.
Spotify (and most other stores) also have their own forms for reporting copyright infringements, however those generally operate under the DMCA so you are making a legal claim and should make sure the content is actually infringing. Also, all these will get you is removal of the content.
The rapper is using a distributor called UnitedMasters. You can report the infringement to them, but the most that will likely happen is that they remove the release from Spotify and other stores. The song has less than 1,000 streams on Spotify so there wouldn't be more than a few USD total revenue anyways.
Whether sampling without a license is copyright infringement or not really depends on the situation and how much the sample was altered. If you have a YouTube network, they might be able to help you with this.
Regardless using my Youtube video without permission or credit seems wrong enough that I want to know my options.
