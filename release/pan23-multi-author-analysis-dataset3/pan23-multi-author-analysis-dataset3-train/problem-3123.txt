To label the Holocaust as "winning against the Jews" is quite frankly something that I imagine most Jewish people would at the least not agree with, if not be outright offended by.
No, it didn't. Hitler's entire concept of race and blood purity had him convinced that literally all Jewish people on earth needed to die if the Germans were to survive. A single Jewish person left alive would be a failure in Hitler's eyes. Let alone in an area that Hitler considered part of Germany. (There were thousands of Jews still alive in Berlin by the end of WWII as well, tho obviously under the radar).
The Nazis cleared out the largest Jewish center in Europe on purpose, to make it harder to reestablish a European Jewish identity... something that more or less no longer exists in the same way it did pre-war.
90% of Polish Jews were murdered. A lot of people don't realize Poland had the largest Jewish population and was the center of the Jewish Europe...
We cannon let even the first steps of fascism or flirtations with Nazism seep into our society. By the time we realize we need to stand up, it is too late.
A little too late. The Catholic Churchâ€™s inaction, refusal to publicly speak out against Nazi Germany and officially being neutral while cutting deals with Hitler all the while knowing of the concentration camps is totally shameful.
At the end of the day there were Individual Catholics who agreed with Hitler and supported the nazis, even going as far as to help them escape punishment after the war, but by and large the church as an organization was more help then hinderance as far as I know and according to what I remember from secondhand sources such as goelbals(sorry for Terrible spelling, am American) Hitler absolutely hated them.
