Russia already successfully committed genocide against Ukraine just in the past century alone; The was a deliberate man-made famine caused by the Soviets under direction from Stalin, and it killed 3.5 - 5 million Ukrainians by starvation.
It was Stalin’s intent to kill off the Ukrainians entirely as a people, so that Soviet Russia could seize the territory permanently and resettle it with loyal Russian occupants. The classic genocide + invasive colonization combo.
• B) Ukraine would be the perfect multi-lane junction between Russia and the rest of Europe, as Ukraine shares borders with six other countries (seven including Russia), many of which Russia would _love_ to invade or “reclaim”. Those countries (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, Belarus) with the exception of Belarus, would sooner die than be invaded by the Russians… _again._.
My position is mostly based on precedent: I remember just a few weeks ago, Russia definitely hit Poland, I remember the "Ghost of Kyiv", the ship on Snake Island where Russia supposedly ki\\ed all on board. I remember Putin claiming that Ukraine was run by N\\\s or that Ukraine was ready to invade them. Historically, I remember the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq claim, or that the KGB had designed mines to look like toys to attract kids, but was actually just copying an American design, the false Nayirah testimony about babies removed from incubators by Iraqi soldiers and left to die (which was confirmed by Amnesty International, IMAGINE THAT!), or Saddam Hussein put people in shredders.
Well, necessarily nothing about the geopolitics of a decade long conflict with an even more complex century long history is simple. So maybe I am part of that movement.
