Without considering the context of the conversation, a dentist deciding they can't fulfill the agreement, refunding the money, and setting everyone back to zero (money back, no dentures) is a reasonable outcome.
Likely your husband's options from here are to see if something can be worked out with the dentist, or to take his refund and find a new provider.
If you already got a refund, and you also have the dentures, there really isn’t any cause of action against the dentist if they were improperly made. You have already been made whole. Your best bet would be to see if a different dentist can adjust them properly, or if a new set needs to be made.
There is no standard that would require them to have to provide the patient with teeth. It is a prosthesis made by the practitioner and if you cannot make the patient happy it is perfectly reasonable to refund partial or total fees and keep the dentures.
No legal issue. Dentist’s are not obligated to finish treatment such as this and, depending on a lot of factors, it would be reasonable to offer you a partial or full refund. Remember that there are lab bills (probably $400-$1000) that have to be paid regardless of whether you are happy. If they are offering you a full refund then yes, you should take it. But you definitely won’t be able to keep the teeth as well.
Not every patient can tolerate a denture. They are not teeth. They work maybe 1/6th as well if that.
Dentists are not your servants you get to order around. If she thought that the denture was making the patient’s oral situation worse, it would be unethical to continue treatment.
Dentists should not be forced to further modify a prosthesis that is clearly failing. This could be occurring due to a poor design, poor fabrication, unreasonable patient expectations, poor hygiene, tissue remodeling, or any number of things.
