I know when I sold my house I opted to pay the fee to not fill out the form. Not for any malicious reason just that it's an option and it avoids things like not disclosing something you didn't even know about. I've been involved in a few house sales and always picked this option (as advised by both realtor and lawyer).
I'm not bothered that the seller and selling realtor were husband and wife per se, the selling realtor already has a fiduciary duty to the seller only... But being the spouse, the selling realtor must also have known that this problem existed and that the disclosure was incorrect.
OP's brother's customer's realtor could offer direct testimony like "I purchased an inspection that found this problem, I communicated this to the seller, they said no and I backed out.".
Also OP or his lawyer being able to say "So we heard Joe Dingleburry the Realtor backed out of the property after you refused to fix this issue" could help get them to settle quicker.
ETA: The brother might not be able to testify about what the non-buying realtor told him, but if the realtor is willing to talk that shouldnâ€™t be an issue.
Also, you should try to get written evidence from the brother's customer showing that the seller knew about the issue before you bought the house. Maybe they have an email asking for the seller to fix it that they could forward to you. Having this evidence would be crucial to winning anything. The fact that it has been over a year would otherwise make it difficult to prove that this problem didn't happen after you bought the house.
