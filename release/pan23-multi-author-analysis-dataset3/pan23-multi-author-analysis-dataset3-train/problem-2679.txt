They could care less… they all take corporate bribes and are worth millions.. if they aren’t worth it when they come into power, they somehow magically become filthy rich after.
Look at Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds… got her college degree in 2008? Or so.. has been governor , and is what I would call a “career politician. She is worth 300 million dollars?! How does that happen being governor???
Yeeeep. I work in property management. A few owners here or there would be understanding. But a good percentage were like 'okay, when do those protections end, I want them gone'. Mind you, most of these were tenants who NEVER had issues paying rent before. We had a few stragglers that were struggling before and it just got worse - but people who had never come up as a late rent for years before suddenly crushed by the roni.
The real kicker is people struggle with high rent every month but pay it, while banks tell them they would be unable to afford a mortgage that is cheaper per month.
I think what gets missed a lot is that bringing the housing price down doesn’t make a house more affordable. If a bank won’t lend you the lower amount, it’s still not affordable.
Say that they pass a law tomorrow that effectively taxes residential property income at 80% and disallows depreciation. Houses fall 80%, great.
That 2 million dollar house in California is now worth 400k, it must be affordable. But you still can’t get a loan for the 400k, because the bank has little upside to giving you money. So the investors that are flush with cash snap up property left and right and the people who bought in the last five years are about to lose everything. Saw way too much of this in 2008….
