You would likely have rights as a next of kin. If you feel it's reasonable (and a judge agrees) that your grandmother's wishes were to split her estate equally 3 ways to her children, and one or more of those children predeceased her, then generally speaking, without a will or trust to stipulate otherwise, the normal flow of inheritance is to the then living heirs, meaning children, or living grandchildren, and so on.. you'd get 1/n of 1/3 of your grandmothers estate. Where n is the number of children your father had, assuming he did not have a will, or a will that stipulated an equal share of his estate.
Most probable worst case, if you do nothing and do not sign the waiver, your interests will not be considered and you'd get nothing. Basically the same as if you do sign the waiver - the only difference being it would complicate probate slightly for those who do get involved in the process.
What if I don't sign the waiver but also don't consult an attorney or do anything about it going forward basically just remove myself entirely. What would happen in probate court? For both scenarios, if there is no will and if a will is found stipulating the division into 3 shares.
