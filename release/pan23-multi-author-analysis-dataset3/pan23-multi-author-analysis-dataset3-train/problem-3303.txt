I’m not gonna go into the weeds of why you’re wrong on this one, there’s plenty of place all over here where you can see why the 16k, 24%, and a handful of sick days aren’t enough. And this goes beyond workers, class 1 railroads have been the ones holding our country hostage QUIET LITERALLY through their right of way and forcing “precision” scheduled railroading. He missed so much here. But go ahead, blame this on workers instead of some of the most powerful companies in the country if not the world and their lapdogs in Washinon.
I’m not blaming the workers, I just understand that presidents have to make tough decisions that y’all just see as black and white. This was a lose-lose situation for him.
Stop having these expectations that you’re goin g to agree with 100% of the decisions a president makes. He had the difficult choice of letting the economy crash or caving into worker demands.
He lets that strike happen and people just cry about the economy. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Its really not his place to give them sick days, those people need to put pressure on their employers by finding another job or striking anyway.
I'm saying the president has to worry about whats best for everyone, not just the raiload workers. Besides the economic implications, you're talking about food shortages, gas shortages, etc. The dems tried to pass seperate legislation to get them paid sick leave and all but one voted in favor of it. Only 6 republican senators voted in favor of it, the rest voted no.
You mean the filibuster that democrats could have voted to nullify for this specific bill? The filibuster that democrats could've gotten rid of entirely months ago to guarantee abortion rights?
Ahhh so it's just the poor helpless democrats doing everything they can that didnt include the sick time in the original legislation? They were just doing everything they could when they knew it would die in the Senate?
