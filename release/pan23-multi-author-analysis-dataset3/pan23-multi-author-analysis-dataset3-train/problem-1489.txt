That defendant could get the claim against him dismissed if no evidence is offered that he's responsible for the damages. ETA- if there's a pre-existing agreement that specifies joint and several liability, or there's precedent supporting it in the circumstances, then he's still on the hook, but could be reimbursed by his codefendants in a subsequent suit to apportion the blame.
Joint and several means all the defendants are individually liable for the full amount, and recovery for that amount could proceed against any one of them. The defendant who paid out would then have to sue his co-defendants to recover their proportionate responsibility.
Joint and several liability does not relieve you of your obligation to prove negligence. If you want to provide more details about what happened you might get a more helpful response.
I donâ€™t think joint several liability applies in that circumstance. Somebody is wrong and somebody is right. One of them had light. The other did not. What the passenger should do is sue both drivers and let the jury decide who had the light, or more likely, let the insurance companies for each driver come to a compromise and each pay part of the claim.
