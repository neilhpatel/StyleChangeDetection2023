Your grandmother is evidently not capable of handling things like producing her own will. Is there someone legally in charge of her day-to-day affairs? A durable power of attorney, if she made one while she was able, could designate an 'attorney-in-fact' for such things, but unless there is one, then wouldn't a court regard her next of kin as the logical person/people to handle such things? As I understand it, just a 'regular' power of attorney only gives someone the ability to act while the person is still competent, the 'durable' part designates that they keep that ability after a person is not competent.
The reason I mention this is that, unless you have designation as that person, then looking for and obtaining her will seems to me to be on shaky ground. For instance, if you were to go into her residence, look for and find the will, and remove it from the premises, I'd worry about what the (nasty-sounding) aunt/daughter would say about it to the authorities. Even going in and looking at it sounds questionable. There are questions for lawyers here.
A lawyer. Immediately. Find out if your grandmother had any sort of advanced directives or powers of attorney in effect. Also if you can compile a list of all the property sold off that will help. May fall under any elder abuse statutes your location may have. Probably wouldn't hurt to contact the police as well since it may fall under theft by conversion statutes as well.
