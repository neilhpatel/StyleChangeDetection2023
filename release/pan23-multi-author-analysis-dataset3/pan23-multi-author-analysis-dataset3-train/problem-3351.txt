Your talking a few really dumb extremists, you would find in extremely difficult to find somebody who doesn’t support Ukraine, no matter which politics they support.
I am not wrong about how the average person votes, because I am the average person, the average person does not scream that the dems or republicans are destroying this country. And I don’t know what you mean by applying the net to far, I am doing the exact opposite, I am saying that the Reddit is not an accurate example of politics.
Most people don’t even listen to those guys, when I listen to Fox News it’s about the weather, and I have never heard of patriot radio or OAN, and I don’t most people have either. The average person during a voting season will vote for whoever makes good promises and who hasn’t shown to be a fuck up, no matter if that candidate is Republican or democrat. You are creating Straw-men that are being upheld by the mass media blowing things out of proportion.
The conservative subreddit is a grouping of a few thousand people who are conservative enough to believe in it. Wait, wait wait wait, are you actually basing your perception of REAL WORLD politics… on Reddit?!
And? The situation in Afghanistan was completely different politically. In fact, the money the US spent in Afghanistan then via CIA covert operations went almost directly to warlords in contact with various Taliban. In contrast, Ukraine is a modern European country and the Baltics would be next in line if it falls - the Russian invasion is a direct threat to neighboring NATO countries.
Well, since no Western troops are on offer what Ukraine needs is weapons, weapons, and more weapons so they can do unto Russia a little harder than Russia is doing unto them.
Most importantly, of the countries we care about that Russia could invade, all the rest are essentially NATO allies. Which means if they are emboldened and invade, we are at war.
