First he says both Biden and Trump are just "scaring people" unnecessarily regarding cutting SS and Medicare, then goes on to say we should consider cutting it.
I seem to remember just a few days ago Republicans were in a outrage calling Biden a liar and denying that they want to go after Social security and Medicare.
Biden gave a master class at his State of the Union speech getting Republicans to agree they would not cut Social Security and Medicare.
Social Security is a lifeline for seniors, keeping them out of poverty, and providing dignity in their older years. Of course, we know that many Republicans want to make cuts to Medicare and Social Security. Many will deny this but Republicans are on video and there are printed materials asking to sunset these programs. This is no joke.
The GOP is adamantly opposed to anything that prevents the ultra rich from buying another mega yacht. But if we are ever to protect these safety nets for seniors, we need to keep the Social Security payroll tax on all income, including capital gains and dividends, for people making more than $250,000 a year. Most Americans, over 90%, would not see their taxes go up.
