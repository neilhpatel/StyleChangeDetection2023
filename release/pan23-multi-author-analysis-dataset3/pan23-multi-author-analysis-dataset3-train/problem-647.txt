Of course itâ€™s a rhetorical question because the obvious narrative mindless idiots are trying to push without reading the article is that Israelis attacked a Ukrainian man because heâ€™s Ukrainian.
It seems like many here didn't read the article: the most wild thing about this case was that said immigrant was a Ukrainian Jew named Abraham, who was talking too these bastards in Hebrew - so they perfectly well knew his ethnicity.
And to make myself clear that it's not okay I referred to the attackers as "bastards", hoping to make it clear that I think it's "not okay". Turned out it wasn't enough ðŸ¤·.
You totally missed my point: I was referring to the comments like "yeah Israelis are nazis", while I argue that this particular case is about typical youth violence that has nothing to do with ideology.
All the upvoted comments here trashing on the entire Jewish nation because of the actions of one random teenager out of millions seem to be a prime example of the "anti Zionism which isn't antisemitism" that everyone seem to talk about.
