The landlord, assuming they're subject to the FHA, would be required to reasonably accommodate a bona fide ESA. They might require you to fill out some paperwork or disclose some information in order to determine if they can reasonably accommodate the animal (for example, a great dane in an efficiency might be a no-go).
Single-family homes rented without brokers are generally not bound by the FHA and therefore the landlords can usually say, "No pets, no ESAs, no animals at all," without running afoul of the law.
You are correct that some small landlords are exempt from some FHA anti-discrimination provisions, including laws that require them to accommodate assistance animals. This is universally called the "".
Declining to disclose your need for an assistance animal accommodation is legal. It's just another practical reason for a landlord to be skeptical of your genuine need.
Those include landlords who live on the premises, and those who rent out just one single-family home without using a broker. As you described, using a broker tends to avoid that factor.
