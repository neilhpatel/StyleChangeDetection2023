Thanks for the kind words, and great follow-up question! This follow-up response deals with the period following self-rule for most of the dominions (post-1850 in general).
Of course, as a result of the Westminster Statute of 1931, the Dominions gained this freedom to conduct their own foreign affairs, set up embassies, and formally establish relations with various nations. Remember further that prior to this Imperial Conference, the Acts of Parliament in London could apply to the dominions, owing to the fact that the constitutional law of the dominions was (in theory) at the mercy of Whitehall. Autonomy from both points (foreign policy control and ultimate legislative control) were granted in the Statue:
Frederick Sherwood Dunn, writing in 1927 (fittingly before the 1931 Statute) notes this legal condition of the dominions:
You mentioned that prior to 1931, the Acts of Parliament in London could apply to the Dominions. My understanding is that prior to 1931, mother Britain held the power to do so over the dominions, but rarely exercised her powers in order to prevent dissatisfaction and future breakaway of the Dominions within the British Empire. That's just my understanding. But exactly how much and how often did mother Britain pass laws that would directly affect her Dominions? Was this common or uncommon?
