Maybe with Roe and post-Trump we're finally at the point where the "base" they're targeting is too small a voting minority.
They produced what, less than half of the gains expected in a midterm when the incumbent party's president has a less-than-50% approval rating? And the worst inflation since the 80s?
Then there is an economy and inflation, even if his policies help will there be a turnaround in time for 2024?
They did. But i honestly think it's a referendum on how awful Republicans are, not on how great Biden is.
Yeah, one of the more important statistics about this election - a majority of people who disapproved of the job Biden is doing voted for him anyway. Biden and moderate Democratic lawmakers are refusing to move on popular policies and leaving votes on the table but they still come out looking ok because Republicans are just that bad.
There are still enough inconclusive races that this could end up being a very weak showing for Dems, but in any case I'm not inclined to give Biden a ton of credit while his approval rating hovers at 40% and his own party doesn't want him to run for re-election. This is not rallying behind Biden--it's rallying against a GOP that just keeps doubling down on being cartoon villains.
