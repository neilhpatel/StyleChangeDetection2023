The tickets give you the opportunity to plea by mail. I pled not guilty and got the 4 point offer as a response.
I may not be explaining myself thourghly enough. They did not litigate the 4 points, or run it by my attorney before submitting them. In between the time I received the offer and his appearance, they submitted the points without the approval or consent of my attorney or myself.
My attorney did attend court for me and got the fine reduced to $250, and followed up by telling me there was a 'slight problem' and they'd already submitted the points.
If you authorized your attorney to negotiate the deal, then it sounds like their offer was "reduce the fine, accept the points", and that's what he took. I mean, I get that you feel that the City was corrupt, but this isn't actually on the City here; they came at you with "pay $450 and take 4 points," your attorney said "$250 and no points," and they said "$250 and we submitted the points." At that point, if you're my client and you're telling me you don't want any deal that involves points, my response is "Ok. Well, unsubmit them, because we're not accepting a deal, so let's go to trial." Instead, he went "Well, ok. Then that's that." That is arguably the definition of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel under Strickland v. Washinon and whatever the New York progeny of Strickland are.
