Do not destroy mail. Mark them "return to sender, not at this address" and promptly toss them back in the post.
Mark her mail "return to sender - not at this address" or similar and return it to USPS or put it back in a mailbox. Keep up with USPS about any changes to your address, as well. Don't slap people - you're better than that.
In the event that she does set up shop in your home, expect that you'll need to go through the eviction process to get her out again. You would not be the first person to claim that the occupant in their home is a trespasser, and while your claim is in good faith, the police are likely to err on the side of due process, rather than risking assisting you with an illegal self-help eviction.
With that in mind, it would be a good idea to get a friend (or, if need be, a professional for-hire property manager) to keep an eye on the place while you're gone, if you suspect she intends to try to move in illegally. That way you can have someone call the police immediately, when it's much harder for her to convincingly claim to be a legitimate tenant, and have someone start the eviction process.
