Well you see, if you put a someone from Rotterdam and Amsterdam in a room you will probably get some arguments at worst. But if you put hooligans in the same room regardless of where they are from or ethnicity they will beat the shit out of each other for fun. If they are from rivaling teams they will beat the shit out of eachother because why not.
I don't have a double standard. Hooligans are hooligans regardless of where they are from they will fight amongst themselves or against other hooligans from different teams or the police. And without regard of what their team did.
It's different because Ajax - Feyenoord is rivalry between two groups of hooligans. What happened now in the Netherlands an Belgium is Morrocans becoming violent because the country they or their parents left won a soccer match. I consider both parties idiots let that be clear. But there is a difference...
If Marocco wins a match the Dutch/Belgium Moroccans will attempt to burn their own neighbourhood down because they are happy?
Riots broke out in several Belgian and Dutch cities after Morocco's 2-0 upset win over Belgium at the World Cup on Sunday.
The article is pretty unclear whether it was Moroccans or Belgians rioting. All they say was 'Moroccans are there to celebrate'. Could easily be either or both.
Imagine not being able to see the difference. Also I’m not defending ones and attacking others. All shit people. However that “don’t you find it odd” is exactly the problem in Europe.
