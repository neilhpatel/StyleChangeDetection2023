With all due respect, I didn’t tell OP to call CPS. There is a lot of information not known. The fact that they work as a behavioral therapist for children with Autism and have this new case that brings them to Reddit suggests concerns. OP should have reported this information to their supervisor(s) if there is doubt. Certainly, “urine over everything” and “trash everywhere” is concerning. Would you not agree?
I’m not sure of the reason for your question? As a behavioral therapist, you are probably subject to reporting laws in the state/being a mandated reporter.
Edit: If you're concerned enough that you're asking Reddit what to do, even when you're already a mandated reporter then you should have already reported.
In your edit you confirmed you're a mandated reporter. Unless there's a different definition where you are, it is pretty clear what that means. It means you REPORT a situation if you even suspect something is up.
It also doesn't matter if the family suspects that it is you, those reports for the most part can/are done anonymously. You never have an obligation to confirm with anyone if you did/didn't report.
