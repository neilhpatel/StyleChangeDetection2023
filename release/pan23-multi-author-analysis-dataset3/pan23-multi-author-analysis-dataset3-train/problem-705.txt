If you don't trust their advice/the options they've laid out, consult a different attorney in that area.
I will note that this isn't like a civil case. The prosecutor doesn't have a budget per case, and they won't arbitrarily take it easier on you at any point because of time spent/costs/etc.
Understand about the current bills and how they don't impact my particular case, but I assume it would look ridiculous and be a waste of taxpayer money to take this charge to trial for Felony if it eventually becomes misdemeanor.. however, I absolutely do NOT want to go to trial, I just don't want a Felony and will do pretty much whatever to not get one.
I guess last thing I would say is, I would be fine with accepting this Felony, so long as I could get it reduced to Misdemeanor some time in the future. My current job is good and won't run anything now, but I'm worried for my future when I may want to move, or get a new job, etc.
Thank you. I didn't mean to come off like that. I understand the differences between states now, and I feel extremely remorseful and stupid for bringing that here.
The only card I can consider playing is to request I receive TWO misdemeanors and pay a lot more fine, more community service hours, and even longer probation. Other than that, it would be a trial I suppose...
