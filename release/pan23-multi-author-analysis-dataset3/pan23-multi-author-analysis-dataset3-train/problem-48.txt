“We have no intentions of solving any real problems. Progressives need to gEt ReAl and drop all their morals at the slightest opposition the way we do or else we’re going to vote for Nazis.”.
Centrists have a well known record of half-assing solutions to problems that do nothing but complicate things in the first place and very often make things 10 x worse.
But several folks have told you that the SOLUTIONS Centrists bring to those problems never work out.
Centrists are bringing the same problems progressives have, yet offer no solutions that anyone other than a republican would want.
Framing progressive goals as centrist proposals is a very effective way to do that. That's what I feel this article is doing. Hell, Bernie made a whole fucking campaign based on that tactic. But now it's a problem because the article used the word centrist.
The proposals are progressive. Its being framed as centrist to appeal to those it needs to appeal to. Some people saw the headline, made their opinion, and that's that.
I read the article. Your assessment is precisely the problem. Centrist has meaning. And framing it that way will ensure that little to no actual progress will be made.
