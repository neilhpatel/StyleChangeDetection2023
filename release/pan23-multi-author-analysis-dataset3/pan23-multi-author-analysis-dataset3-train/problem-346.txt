Then, he retells whatever story they've told about their time dating this public figure. For example, the ex with the blog named A (just to simplify this post), he posted a link back to A's post and even stated his re-telling of the story as to why she's a 'thot' goes back to her source. All of the material he's provided is not from him; it's from these women's social media accounts or things they've posted on the internet. He's basically providing their information and for the audience to discuss or leave comments on the blog.
He's mentioned the fair use should be applied since it is using their material/photos as criticism, commenting or reviewing. Since he's treating this blog as a criticism/commenting blog, he feels it falls under that category but he could be wrong about this too.
But again, you've not described really anything substantive about the blog itself or the posts, so we have zero idea of what he's doing and posting on that blog. I'm just guessing at what some of the content might be.
