In its purest form, conservatism is literally monarchy - the word "conservative" was originally used as a euphemism for "monarchist" until monarchy gave way to aristocracy - and once faced with a critical mass of opposition from common folk, aristocracy yields to fascism in the hopes of protecting itself from the disenfranchised and desperate masses. The word "conservative" is the sheepskin here, not conservatism itself.
No, as time goes on, "conservative" fits them more and more - because conservatism consists of one proposition:
There is a reason there are very few conservative comedians. The funniest people are not necessarily liberal, but they’re almost never a conservative.
NY and California have both had Republican governors, and KY has a democratic one. All while being solid lock-in states for their respective congress and presidential votes.
Unfortunately the majority of state residents (ore risk gerrymandering aside, at least) didn’t actually choose to protect reproductive rights, or they wouldn’t have a Republican legislature.
Republican lawmakers in Kansas have introduced a bill that would allow individual cities and counties to ban abortion, directly overriding a 2022 vote where the majority of state residents chose to protect reproductive rights.
Here, although there are no longer federal abortion protections, Kansas has state constitutional protections for abortion. So once the bill is signed into law, it'll be halted by the lower courts because it is unconstitutional.
