Trump also literally was impeached for trying to blackmail Ukraine (by threatening to withdrawing funding and aid) into giving "dirt" on the son of Joe Biden to hurt is election campaign.
BTW, the aid that started under obama to give ukraine a functional military was threatened to be cancelled by trump because he wanted ukraine to lie about hunter bident to influence the election. So give it a rest, trump was a disaster and if obama did not start this, it never would have been started under trump.
You have no credibility by claiming nothing happened under obama. This was the start of the process that gave ukraine a functional military.
The Ukrainian Army has been at war with Russia since 2014. They use their own invasion in 2014 and justification for their future invasion because Ukraine fought back.
This is their justification for the 2022 full invasion, that Ukraine tried to defend itself from the covert invasion of 2014.
Russia uses the "murder" of Russian speaking Ukrainians in the Donbas as justification for the war when the fact is that the Russians were engaged in a a covert annexation operation.
This is part of Russia's Big Lie, about the "poor Ukrainian separatists" when it was really the Russian army all along, organizing, funding arming, training and even in later portions fighting for them.
The "little green men" were Russian soldiers, and the separatist movement itself heavily backed and organized by Russia, trained and armed them.
Russians made a very a serious effort to arm and support the separatists, with thousands of russian army personnel rotated into combat throughout the 2014 conflict. To the point separatist combat units were outnumbered by "russian civilians". They also made a point to never have military personnel in Ukraine. If you looked at the papers of captured russians, they were all EX-military, fired/retired a week or so before arriving in Ukraine.
