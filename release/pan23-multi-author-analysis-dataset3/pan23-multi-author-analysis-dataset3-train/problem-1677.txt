Edit: And how can I forget how LAPD’s finest experts caused their own recently by mishandling fireworks.
I’m in LA, where fireworks are illegal and people are still obsessed with them. is what 4th of July looks like between 8:30 and 11pm. Unsurprisingly, a lot of palm trees catch fire from fireworks.
Sideshows scare wildlife and people more than fireworks. Airports scare wildlife. Freeways scare wildlife. Thunder scare wildlife. I'm not into scaring wildlife or torturing animals. I spend time observing wildlife because I enjoy wildlife. I participate in subreddits like r/whatisthisbug because I like to give people information about the creatures around us that can look intimidating, but are harmless, like a Jerusalem cricket. My crew has rescued injured animals we find, which includes a pair of domestic ducks that were abandoned by humans who didn't know how to take care of themselves and were going to die.
The next morning the streets were clean. No debris, no red paper, it’s like it never happened. I’m not sure what is happening with these attacks, but it’s not typical NYE behavior. It’s not fireworks, it’s people trying to hurt emergency responders and that needs to stop.
There was a lot of gunfire in the Midwest US city where I live, and absolutely none of people throwing fireworks at strangers. Probably related to there being a lot of strangers with guns.
