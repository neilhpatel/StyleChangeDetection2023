Your last comment is legally irresponsible, of course you can stop now. You may not want to, and you may not have to. However you most certainly CAN stop.
Without knowing more, it sounds like you are in a grey area legally, just because you arenâ€™t earning from youtube ads does not give you free reign.
Youtube doesn't know whether you are or are not violating anyone's copyrights unless ContentID flags it or the rightsholder notifies them. You can't rely on Youtube to steer you away from the perilous perils.
The exception for fair use isn't that the work be used "comedically". It's either as parody or as commentary. That means "of the work itself". There are a lot of people who think that just calling their derivative works "parody" somehow immunizes them against copyright lawsuits.
Note regardless of parody or not weird al gets permission/ licenses his source material because copyright is so hard to prosecute. A lawyer can give his opinion if it qualifies. The rights holder can still bring a costly suit.
