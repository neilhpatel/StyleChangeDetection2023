As well as the methods u/mimicofmodes mentioned for ensuring you see answered threads, I know some members use the r/HistoriansAnswered subreddit.
Our SundayDigest each week by u/Gankom shows hundreds of proper answers given each week and we have other things like Friday Free For All. We do get more threads than can be answered sadly but the "what reddit says vs the actual answers" also shows how busy our poor mods are in removing the off-topic, the vile, the inaccurate and the bad answers that fail the simple rules that u/makinghomemadejam highlighted.
Basically, we have higher standards than many other subreddits when it comes to providing answers, and so we end up removing a lot of subpar, incorrect, and low effort content that fails to meet these standards.
Furthermore, if content is what you're looking for, there is actually plenty of content that passes muster, but that many fail to see for a variety of reasons (for example: they only visit popular threads, they don't give enough time for an answer to be provided, they only look at threads they're interested in, etc.). To help with this, we compile the week's material into a post called the We also repost much of our content on our and and run a weekly mailer which highlights the absolute best content of the week, which you can We suggest you check out those features to get the content you're looking for.
