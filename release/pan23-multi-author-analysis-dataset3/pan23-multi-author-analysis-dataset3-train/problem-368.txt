Were you tailgating? If he was going 20 and you were going 30 it sounds like you were. Your ticket isnt for speeding it's for being an unsafe distance away from the car in front.
Looked at your video in your other post. Definitely tailgating as you were within 1 second of the car infront of you.
I’m obsessed with the speed because I wasn’t speeding but I got both a speeding and tailgating ticket. I was keeping my distance around 15-17 ft from the guy. At one point I was close because he just slammed his breaks for no reason that’s the only time I was around maybe 8ft from him but still. I’m just taking this shit to court I just wanted advice to see what I could do but I’ll just call lawyers.
I don’t even know what’s too close anymore on my dash I had a good distance from the guy. I have both front and rear dash. The other car behind me was closer than I was the other guy. On the video the officer was 4 cars behind me and you can clearly see he was less than 8ft from the car in front. I’ll just take the advice and show everything I have. I hope for the best.
The thing was though that I was no where close to him at all. At one point yes because he just braked for no reason but I maintained a fair distance from him. I was given a ticket for both speeding and tailgating. The speed limit in the area is 35 I was doing 30 no where was I speeding at all.
