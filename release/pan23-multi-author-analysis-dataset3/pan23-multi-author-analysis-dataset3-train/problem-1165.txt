When a child does this, it generally means that they have been abused themselves. Not reporting puts other kids at risk since they may continue to act out. Also, both children should get counseling; moving and not talking about what happened won't resolve the trauma.
Taking the appropriate legal steps will help to resolve the safety and liability concerns at the house, since the perpetrator child will then be under some kind of supervision and may have to be removed from the home if a household member is abusing them.
I'm a social worker, not a lawyer, but the right thing to do is to report this to DCFS. "How to Report Child Abuse Division of Family & Children Services Georgia Department of Human Services".
I would report this to whatever child protective services you have in your area, ASAP. If the 10 year old is doing this he has likely been or is currently being molested by an adult. 10 year olds don't just think to do something like this on their own. Someone needs to intervene and stop the cycle of abuse and get this child help or else he will continue to do this and many more children will be harmed.
