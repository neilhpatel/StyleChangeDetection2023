Was it done by a screening company or the HOA? Different laws apply depending who did the ‘background check’. You should have signed authorization forms if a reporting agency was doing this. You would contact them and dispute the result. You would be entitled to a copy under federal law - look up the ‘summary of rights under fcra’ and keep yourself from applying the wording only to credit reports (it covers any type of consumer report).
Under the fair credit reporting act, you have a right to a copy of the background check and a right to dispute items on the background check. The HOA has to tell you who provided the background check, and that company has to give you a copy of the report. You can dispute items on it, and the agency has to investigate and correct mistakes.
Key is to make a demand, cite the FCRA .and have proof of delivery (registered mail, for example). You can also do via email, but then you need a response from them to prove they got it.
Attorneys will frequently take these cases on contingency since the other side has to pay their fees (assuming you win).
First step.os with the HOA: ask them who provided the information, and their contact information. Do it in writing and reference the fair credit reporting act in your request.
I believe you are entitled to a free copy of the credit report that was used to turn you down for your tenant application. You can get the credit report from the credit company, not from the landlord, from my understanding. There are 3 credit agencies, not all of them have the same info. Your prospective landlord is required to tell you the company that they got your credit report from, name, address, and phone number.
