I apologize if I seem insensitive. I edited out the more colorful language I used. I didn't mean to lose my temper but you've had multiple people now tell you that your though process of a POA is wrong. I thought that may push you more to understanding what is the actual legal concept and then decided against it. My point being is that none of this works the way you think it does. Your solution to the big complicated problem you think you have is to simply probate Lynn's will.
Then out of all the people you listed, someone needs to file a probate case here with her will so that Mark can't keep pretending Lynn is still alive to be able to use the POA.
The only person that would have control of Lynn's estate would be the person appointed by the probate court which should have been done as soon as Lynn died.
Lynn’s will states that in the event Mark is deceased or incapable of serving as the Personal Rep of Lynn’s estate, the estate be transferred to Carol in trust for the benefit of the grandchildren.
This is all great information, thanks! Lynn did have a will. She leaves everything to Mark. If something happens to Mark, it goes to Carol, as trustee, for Lynn’s grandchildren.
Carol is power of attorney for both Lynn AND Mark. So when I talk about her revoking power of attorney, I mean her power of attorney over Mark, not Lynn.
If Lynn is dead her power of attorney is invalid. You cannot be the power of attorney for a dead person, nor can carol revoke or grant a POA for anyone else.
