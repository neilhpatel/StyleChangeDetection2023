I wouldn't consider it to be a reliable source no, but it is still incredibly difficult to answer the claim presented by Elst in his article in a satisfactory manner. For one, the sort of question he asks is not one that historians can answer all that easily. Really the question of "Was there an Islamic Genocide of Hindus?" is two questions; the first is stated explicitly, the second is an implicit question about the death toll of Hindus under Islamic rule. Even then, both of these questions are both more semantic and political than historical, in the sense that they rely less on interpreting historical evidence in their own context than they do in interpreting certain chronicles and documents in a modern light, and projecting modern discourses backwards onto historical documents.
There are a bunch of other factual mistakes that the author makes as well, but you get the point, its not really a good historical article but rather a political polemic.
You can argue that the chronicles, don't matter, as much or in the way, as they would have, if read literally, but you can't just ignore them completely, just for the sake of 'political correctness' or your own preformed biases or opinions.
