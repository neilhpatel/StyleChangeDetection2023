Along with these more practical issues of realpolitik, what extent did the European perception of Ethiopia as a noble and old Christian kingdom against either Islamic or more ‘pagan’ areas of the Continent - from Herodotus to mentions in the Bible and the old medieval notion of ‘Prester John’ - influence their decision to let it retain its independent status?
However, Adom Getachew in Worldmaking After Empire points out that even after Ethiopia joined the League of Nations in 1923, European colonial powers like France and Great Britain expressed great concern over persistence of the slave trade in Ethiopia, and doubting the Ethiopian government's ability to exert control within its borders. Britain, France, and Italy were also concerned that Ethiopia continued to purchase and distribute small arms, contravening a treaty that those European powers had made to limit the importation of firearms into East Africa. Into the late 1920s, Britain and France were proposing that the League should impose European government advisers to help guide the Ethiopian government (which Getachew states is effectively advocating for colonization).
When Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Benito Mussolini and his government were justifying their actions to Britain, France, and the US by pointing to the persistence of slavery in Ethiopia, and arguing Ethiopian government was incapable of putting an end to the slave trade.
