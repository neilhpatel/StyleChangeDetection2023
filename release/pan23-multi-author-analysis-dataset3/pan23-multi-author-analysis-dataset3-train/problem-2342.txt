That's not really true. When I worked for a German company, it was very hard for the Germans to get fired, but they were contractually required to give 3 months notice before leaving the company. That's basically unheard of in the US.
Yeah, it is a price to pay for job security. It's just a different way of doing things. They also have far more paid time off, but their pay is lower for similar white collar jobs. In the US, we get paid more, can quit whenever we want, but can also get fired whenever the company wants, and get less paid time off.
At will employment basically means you can be fired at any time and for any reason provided the reason isn't illegal. Yes, it's obviously complete shit.
and that's pretty shitty. I feel for the russian people who are ALSO VICTIMS of the russian government.
when people say shit like this, "THEY", they're conflating the people of russia with the conceptual entity of the state, and its leadership.
It's crazy to theorize on what Russia could be if their leadership had been reasonable and not antagonistic lol. Real reform of gov and an abolishment of the oligarchs and a crackdown on the mafia. They could be flourishing with great trade agreements and eventual admission into eu.
