Check your lease to see what their responsibilities are if they can't deliver the residency for you.
Many, many tenants would refuse to sign a lease committing to pay rent for a unit where the landlord retains the right to back out without penalty if it can't deliver the premises.
If the lease is decently well written, they wouldn't be liable for anything, since a tenant refusing to leave on time isn't something they have control over. If they had failed to give the existing tenant appropriate notice that their tenancy was ending, that's a different story.
Does the lease give landlord a right to terminate if there is a holdover tenant or if landlord can't deliver the unit? If not, the landlord is contractually obligated to deliver the unit to you.
Unless the lease says otherwise, the landlord is obligated to give you the unit on June 1st, regardless of whether you have paid rent. Are they claiming that you also had the right to walk away at any time before paying rent? That's not how leases work. What's the point of signing a lease before June 1 if no one is bound by the lease until rent is paid?
Also see if the lease has a clause for if the first month of rent is not paid. If not, the the contract is still valid.
