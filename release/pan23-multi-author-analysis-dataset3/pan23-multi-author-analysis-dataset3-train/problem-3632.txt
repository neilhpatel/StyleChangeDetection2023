casualties would be massive on the russian side. russia wouldn’t be able to inflict casualties on the nato side, simply because it wouldn’t have the means to do so. russian air force is no match for nato air force, russian anti air would be destroyed either by stealthy planes or nato artillery which is more precise and out ranges the russian artillery. russian tanks would be destroyed from air. there wouldn’t even be much troop on troop engagement as russian equipment would just keep blowing up and they wouldn’t even know how or where the rounds or missiles are coming from. this won’t happen because nukes, but don’t kid yourself that there would be any kind of even matchup between nato/russia military.
Calm down, let’s not forget about the nukes and the idiots who will do everything to protect themselves and if everything is lost would not think twice about bringing down the rest of the world with them.
This isn't a game of civ... You can't just start a war against one of the largest countries in the world with enough nukes to blow half the world to hell on the idea that they haven't maintained their nuclear capabilities...
The reality is that no western country would ever risk a direct military conflict against a country with nuclear weapons capabilities. Furthermore , historically , there is a repeated underestimation of the effects /challenges of an invasion into Russia . The loss of life on natos end would be catastrophic. Redditors have to stop masturbating to the notion that Russia has to be taken down by a unified western presence... It would be utterly catastrophic.
