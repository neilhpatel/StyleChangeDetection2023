The Spanish were one of the more brutal colonial powers. By the time the Dutch were revolting, Spain had already engaged in the horrific atrocities outlined the De Las Casas accounts. In fact, one of the most famous and prestigious scholars of Spain, Francisco di Vittoria, had already made arguments against the justifications for treating indigenous peoples with brutality and subjugation.
This second part has been shown, in La Legenda, to be non-existent. Simply put, there is no over-arching "Black Legend" to which all of the negative connections that have been foisted upon brown people and latino people can be attached. There is no "Black Legend" mass of propaganda initiative aimed at perpetuating racist historical narratives or historiographies.
You're touching on a point I couldn't exactly put into words: the justification/softening of other colonization processes through the Black Legend Narrative.
The Black Legend tends to be more of a nebulous formation of historiographical shortcomings by historians. Whether those be intentional, personal biases towards the content, or widespread, negative conceptions of groups of people and cultures, is not so clear. What is clear is that these shortcomings aren't coordinated, and they aren't some tradition that is passed down.
