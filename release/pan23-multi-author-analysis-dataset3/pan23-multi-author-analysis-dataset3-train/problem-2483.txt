Paying the $10,000 is going to be a lot cheaper than any lawsuit to try and resolve this. The cheapest option is to start a new domain name for $10.
If he needs that domain name, he can try negotiating on the price. Here is some helpful information:
This is definitely cybersquatting and it is technically illegal, but it is problematic to enforce and is usually done through the courts.
That is certainly one example of cybersquatting, and the first type of activity to garner governmental attention, but it is not the only type. The case described by the OP is another example. Both types of activity are considered cybersquatting.
Cybersquatting on an EXISTING trademark, is cybersquatting. But you can't file a trademark today and try to sue the current registrant to get the domain. You would be opening yourself up to "Reverse Domain Hijacking" and the process would cost you more than the domain is worth, on top of the litigation, you'll be paying more for attorneys than for the domain.
If he let the domain lapse, that's a failure in his bookkeeping, and attempting to file a retroactive trademark will also cost a decent amount of money, as will attempting to recover the domain through official channels.
