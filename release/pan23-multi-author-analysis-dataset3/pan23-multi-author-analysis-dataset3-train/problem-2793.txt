Yes, I paid a per deposit and everything. The manager just never added a pet rent in the system. or told me about it. So the lease shows a pet rent but I was told it was already included in the rent.
What does it actually say in the lease about pet rent? If the lease says your rent is $1000, pet rent is $200, and the previous manager told you verbally that was $800 for you and $200 for the pet, that's probably unlikely to overrule the more obvious reading which is $1000 for you plus $200 for the pet. Otherwise, what would be the point of itemizing the pet rent?
If your lease does not allow pets then you need to amend it so it does. And will need to pay whatever charges make landlord agree to that amendment.
If the lease says the rental payment is $1,000, including pet rent of $50, then your lease is your lease and you should reject changes.
Then further down it says “rent is $1500 pet rent (if any) is $200” and it doesn’t say per pet or anything like that either. And before the manager told me the pet rent is included in the $1500 she laid it out to me as rent is usually $1000 but with my parking space and the pets and the stupid cable and everything it would come out to $1500.

The first part of the lease says my “rent is $1500 including all special provisions” which is what I have been paying, what was setup in the system and is pulled out of my account automatically by the leasing office.
