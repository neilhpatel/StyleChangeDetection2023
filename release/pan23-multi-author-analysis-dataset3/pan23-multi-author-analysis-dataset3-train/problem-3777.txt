Ask ANY member of LGBT if they would rather be in Texas or the fucking Taliban. This is a purely insane take I can only find on twitter and reddit.
Edit: EDIT: They LITERALLY tried to hang on the plane in the hopes to avoid a Taliban Afghanistan in favor of the US.
And before anyone spreads the next lie, the US supported the Mujahideen who were the enemies of the Taliban against and of the USSR. The Taliban are a product of Pakistan which was created by the UK giving Islamists their own country.
How do the Taliban benefit from turning Afghanistan into a failed state? They aren't doing well right now and their solution seems to be to make things much worse.
Yeah all these people protesting the idea that it's not as bad actually mean it's just not as bad for them. Whether or not they realize that is irrelevant.
Anyways, you seem to think that those people wouldn't execute gays if they could - I'm quite sure that they would of they thought they could get away with it. They're jailing people for decades for miscarriages in places like Indiana, forcing 10 year olds to carry rapist's babies, etc. There's no shades of grey here - only black and evil.
These fuckers aren't any better just because they're the home team. They're all whackjob assholes that need to stay away from me and my family. In fact, the home team whack job assholes are far more dangerous to my family than the away team whackjob assholes are.
