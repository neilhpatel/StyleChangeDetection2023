I hope this basic explanation is enough for you to understand why a Latino with light skin aligns with neo-Nazism and white supremacy, as well as potentially prompt you to learn more.
For example, Benjamin Franklin didn’t consider Germans white, the US as a whole didn’t accept Italians as white until well into the 20th, the “one-drop rule” only impacts whiteness not blackness in the eyes of those in power (Barack Obama), etc. It’s also why white supremacists and Nazis target Jewish people, even though their skin is the same color — because whiteness is not defined strictly by color of skin.
ELI5 round 2: Nick Fuentes is a white supremacist because of his actions, words, and beliefs. His ethnicity does not change that.
Unfortunately, these issues require quite a bit more nuance and understanding than you’re likely prepared for. White supremacists, however, see that as a benefit and hope you’ll maintain that complacency.
Acting like he’s less of a white supremacist because you think something is ironic is just the exact complacency white supremacists crave.
Nick Fuentes has obvious influence and his messaging is obviously Neo-Nazism/white supremacy, whether or not you think it’s ridiculous.
If someone asked me who the absolute most politically radical person in America was, it’d be Fuentes. More radical than trump, more radical than kanye. Kanye and trump have more influence but Fuentes literally has a lower spot in hell than basically anyone who isn’t a genocide committer or rapist imo.
