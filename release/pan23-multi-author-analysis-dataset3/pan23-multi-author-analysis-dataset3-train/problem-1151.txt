OP - I am not your lawyer. What u/fredzout is telling you to do is the following: on the IRS Form 1040 (your personal income tax return), there is a line for the standard deduction with some checkboxes. He is telling you not to check the box that says someone else can claim you as a dependent. Whether this is correct is dependent on the amount of support your parents give you during the relevant taxable year. Read the rules carefully, but if you can avoid checking this box, you will save some taxes. However, you should inform your parents at the appropriate time that you are filling out the form this way. If you donâ€™t, and they claim you as a dependent, the IRS is going to notice and challenge one or both tax returns.
Also, next year file your taxes as soon as you get your W2, claiming yourself as dependent. That way, if they try to claim you as dependent, the IRS will be calling them in for an audit.
When you file your taxes, you take one deduction for yourself and an additional deduction for each person who is a dependent of yours. If someone else provides a substantial amount to your support, they can claim you as a deduction, and you do not take a deduction for yourself on your own return. The term "claiming yourself as a dependent" is a bit of a misstatement.
Can you elaborate more on the whole claiming yourself as a dependent thing? I haven't heard about that before, so it seems like a typo to me since it seems too outlandish.
