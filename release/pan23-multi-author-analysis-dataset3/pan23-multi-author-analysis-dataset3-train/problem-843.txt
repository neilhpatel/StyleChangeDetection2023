Pictures were taken and I got a video of me trying to close the door latch and it doesn't stick properly unless you push in the door.
When we toured the house in April nobody locked the deadbolt after we went in, and when we were finished and came back downstairs the door was wide open because the door latch doesn't work. He was aware of that fact because he was there when it happened. There was nothing in writing about it being broken but he did know.
The force was added to get the door to be able to lock. I feel like the door to a property I rent should work properly and if it was given to me in a state where it doesn't work properly I shouldn't be responsible for damages? The only reason I'm worried is the last time this happened he said the previous tenants had to pay $1,500 to get the glass fixed.
So hopefully since this happened previously and he didn't fix the door handle latch and argued semantics that the door lock (deadbolt) works, he'll pay for the damage.
If not then it's hard to lay blame on the landlord when the last time he was told about the door he sent a locksmith that "fixed" it.
