That is only one example. In one case there is a 40 acre manmade pond that I’ve determined via historic satellite images was installed in 2006 very close to the factory. There are no permits for anything there. The entire suit was all about dumping of liquid. I have numerous other examples as well. That’s just the most alarming.
I am grasping at straws trying to get anyone to pay attention. The state is 100% implicated in these crimes and I can easily prove it if anyone would give me the time of day.
I tried that. I don’t even give a crap about the white collar crime. It is what it is. It’s the pollution that is driving me insane. There is a failing wastewater facility right by my home and no one cares. Absolutely no one. Not even the people who live here! It’s like they don’t want to believe it’s happening to them.
I can absolutely prove injury with the wastewater facility. My well readings have steadily increased for nitrogen and decreased for pH and I didn’t know it so I was drinking the water and got sick. Ours is no longer potable. Our whole street is in the same shoes. I don’t even want to sue them for money. I just want them to clean up their act and stop poisoning everyone.
