Mitt Romney is the absolute best benchmark for watching how the GOP is shifting. Back in 2008 he was considered a radical conservative, and now he's considered one of the most moderate Republicans in the party, and he hasn't changed his positions.
As someone who was active in the GOP primary and a Romney supporter in 2008, I can assure you he was not at all percieved as a "radical conservative". He was constantly mocked on the stage by folks like McCain and Giuliani, who weren't super conservative themselves, for being a RINO and not a real conservative. He was a moderate as governor and pretty transparently flip-flopped on several issues leading into 2008 to be more of a standard conservative (not some radical one though).
More like Trump supported 99.9% of the GOP agenda, which Romney also happened to support already. Not sure why you act like Romney only voted for those things just because Trump wanted them.
One more thing Romney could/should be is the anti-Trump. He should accept his nerdiness and not have a need to be in the headlines constantly as Trump did.
If Mitt did things like revitalize Reaganism, denounce (Fox's getting in bed with Signey Powell and the fake election BS), he might have a chance.
After the insane sht show republicans have put America thru with and post trump it’s absurdly ridiculous for Mitt to think he would win anything. He is one out the entire party of crazies and frankly he’s not a model of sanity either.
