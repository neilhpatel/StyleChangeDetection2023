Pretty much all companies would love to increase their prices but cant because if they did it would drive people away from their product or service completely or drive them to other competitors.
Companies can just blame it all on inflation/economy and since there is less competition dont have to a competitor.
But as opposed to the past many industries now have less competition than they did in the past. So once the fear of inflation hit and the actual inflation kicked in companies can now increase the prices to adjust for inflation and then make extra increases to pad their profits.
Like, if increasing profits was as simple as raising prices drastically, why didnâ€™t companies just always do this?
Genuine question, not trying to be a corporate shill. How does corporate greed being behind inflation make sense? Did corporations only discover they can make more money by raising prices in the past two years? When inflation was low in the past, was that because corporations were being altruistic and generous to us simple commoners?
