He's also repping west virginia of all states, he's a coal baron but he's about the best to be expected right now from WVA until their own Fetterman-type breaks through.
eh, don't assume they'd go for her over a republican. She votes with the dems like 90% of the time and as frustrating a narcissist as she is to deal with, I don't think there's much love on the right for her either - she's gonna have a primary to her left and a republican to her right, and she's basically committing political suicide imo.
She’ll drop out of a general election if it’s clear she won’t win, and she wouldn’t win because she’s reviled by Democrats and Republicans alike.
Not really, they’re letting her keep two subcommittee chairmanships right now, if she caucused with Republicans, she’d lose those plum assignments instantly.
This was the only move she had and it was basically a desperation move. Her only hope is convincing Democrats not to run someone in 2024, and I highly doubt that happens.
That might be too optimistic — Sinema wouldn’t need to get that many swing voters to thwart a Democrat.
Absurd. She wouldn't have to peel away many republicans to screw them over either, and that's much more likely given how badly she's pissed off the democrats.
She did that because she knew she wouldn't survive a primary, and she may cause enough damage to give republicans a win. Fuck her.
