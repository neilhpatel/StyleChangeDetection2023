Sure, cavalry had a very important role in many armies even after, but what i was trying to get to was that the "decline in relevance" came far before the late 19th century.
Well, yes, cavalry still has a place in many armies, but my point was that by the late 19th century, they were mainly an afterthought. Not like France in 1290, as a comparison. I would argue that the time of a "decline in relevance" started a lot earlier then the late 18th century.
By the 19th century, very few dragoons dismounted to fight. The French dragoons were a cross between light and heavy cav, and fought from horseback.
Horses had a range of battlefield uses in the Napoleonic era. Most armies included an auxiliary force of traditional cavalry (sabres or lances) who were used to inflict injury on a routed foe. They also provided mounts for forces like the French dragoons, mobile infantry that would redeploy and dismount to fight on foot. As /u/Anacoenosis correctly points out, smaller artillery could be towed by horsepower. They could also carry messages and, if needed, officers to and fro.
