It doesn’t take more than two brain cells to know that, but I guess the “Russian troll” narrative is pretty comfortable, since people need enemies and Russia fits into that narrative too nicely. Anyways, hope this war ends soon.
It’s not up to dispute Russia was wrong to invade a sovereign country and kill innocent civilians in the process. On the other hand, it’s pretty yikesies that Ukraine keeps glorifying its past Nazi collaborators, and when even their staunchest allies find issue, people will jump on and complain they’re not being supportive enough (all from the comfort of their keyboards).
It’s because 1) many of Ukrainians loves the Nazis, and 2) they don’t need to muzzle themselves for PR when you have the world’s only superpower at your back.
Poles love reminding us of war crimes, but forget about their own ethnic cleansings and massacres against ethnic Ukrainians. They were occupiers to us. No better than Russians, Soviets or other scum back then. Bandera, Melnyk, Konovalets and Shuhevych are heroes of our nation who fought against all of the invaders and occupiers - would that be Poland, Soviet Union or Third Reich.
