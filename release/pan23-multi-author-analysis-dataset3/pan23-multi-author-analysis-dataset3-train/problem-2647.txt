I am a supervisor in CPS, though not your state. The governing law is the ICPC - Interstate Compact on the Protection of Children. The Agency can place out of state without a homestudy, but the court are not covered by ICPC.
Hire an attorney in your child’s state - a judge can grant a parent custody without a homestudy if they choose to.
If you want to do something beyond a complaint to a supervisor, seek out an family law lawyer. They might have more legal ideas beyond embarrassing the social worker in front of the judge.
The judge knows she screwed up. They won’t be forgiving of it multiple times. Welcome to the wheels of justice. They turn slowly.
I can think of a great reason why she must mail out the letter via US mail. Because she needs to know there’s an actual person at a physical location. Someone could give her 10 emails for 10 references and that one person controls every email address. I’m not saying you’re acting in a nefarious manner, but I’d hate to be the social worker responsible for handing over a child and they disappeared. Your argument as to why she cant email out but can receive a form via email is invalid.
