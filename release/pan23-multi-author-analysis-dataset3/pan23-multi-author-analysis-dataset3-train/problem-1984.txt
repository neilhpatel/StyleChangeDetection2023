I mean, Russia is literally crying foul over this while they use Iranian drones to bomb Civilian Infrastructure and openly talk about using nukesâ€¦.
If Ukraine keeps up these unprovoked attacks of terrorism against Russia's innocent warships, Russia might have to declare war on Ukraine or something.
All of the Russian fleet anywhere in the world are legitimate targets for Ukraine, they shouldn't restrict themselves to the Black sea fleet.
It's one area where Ukraine has the advantage.... it has no fleet of its own after Putin seized it when he captured Crimea. And they have a large, weakly defended fleet, all of which are military targets.
Arguably the idea has been around since at least the 2nd world war when fast attack boats were used.
I've no idea, I didn't think anyone had taken responsibility for it yet. I'd guess the driver knew he had a trailer full of explosive though. I guess he could have jumped out and got in another car and just left it to blow.
That wasn't a drone though just a bloke on a rib who wouldn't have got close had the deck sentry been paying attention.
