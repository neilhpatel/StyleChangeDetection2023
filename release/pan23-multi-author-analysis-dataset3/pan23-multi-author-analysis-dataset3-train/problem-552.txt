The only part of the rifle that would need to have a serial is the lower receiver. This is a <$100 part from most online stores and he could have it shipped to an FFL to have a by the book rifle. Everything else on the rifle is not tracked and doesnâ€™t need to be replaced.
I'm 100% sure I can still legally transfer my pre-'68 firearms that don't have serial numbers. States (like California, in this case) may require them, but ATF doesn't.
All of the relevant case law regards pre-'68 guns, so I'm assuming that courts would use those as a model. That's because in both cases, serial numbers are not required at time of manufacture, and ATF doesn't actually require them for transfers. ATF suggests that you add a serial number before transfer, but there is no relevant legislation unless one is engaged in the business of making firearms (or is otherwise an FFL of some sort).
The ATF has guidelines to add a serial for the legal transfer of a home manufactured firearms though.
One thing to add to this is that CA requires home manufactured firearms to have a serial number. - PDF.
