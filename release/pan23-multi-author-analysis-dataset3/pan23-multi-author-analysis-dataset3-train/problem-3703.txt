In Europe, the war in Ukraine means they need to use coal or they freeze. Hopefully Germany realizes they need their nuclear reactors and reverses course.
In both of these cases, protests wouldn't do anything. The Europe burning coal to survive and China does what it wants.
In China, drought reduced the output of their hydroelectric power. The coal increase makes up the difference.
What is the increase of coal in comparison to the the increase in world population? As were reducing the percentage of our power generated by coal, is coal still on the increase due to population growth?
Coal is actually expected to stabilize over then next few years, and almost all growth is expected to come from renewable sources. . There's been a lot of great news for renewables recently, primarily due to pure economics but also energy security concerns. Here are some positive notes:
5. Pure economics as well as energy security concerns due to the recent geopolitical state of affairs is absolutely accelerating the shift to renewables.
Quote from the German Institute for Economic Research "Nuclear power is economically unviable, dangerous and should not be labelled as a clean form of energy. None of the world's 600+ nuclear power stations have ever been economically viable and can only operate due to government subsidies".
