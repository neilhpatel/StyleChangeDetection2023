Edit: also simply hanging around other drug users can’t be cause for revocation because parole agents would then have to prove that the others are using as well and can’t just make assumptions.
Edit: Hanging around criminals isn’t advised by the parole board and its officers but unless there has been proven criminal activity (and a likelihood of conviction) there isn’t likely any action to take place. Furthermore with the changes that are happening statewide regarding marijuana usage (if this does involve marijuana) that could change how a parole agent and the board would act upon the violation.
That is a false assumption. Failure of a UA or drug test doesn’t constitute immediate revocation. Parole agents report their findings back to the parole board after receiving a violation and recommend a course of action. Typically the board follows whatever the agent recommends. With the overcrowding in the state penitentiaries over the past decade, drug offenses are less likely to see a revocation of parole and more likely to see a new requirement of rehabilitative classes in an effort to keep the offender out of prison.
my understanding is that simply failing a drug test or association with any individual either convicted or facing criminal charges is grounds for immediate revocation of probation or parole.
there are pretty clearly defined rules that one must follow in order to be granted parole and if these are not being followed then it’s a violation. if someone is being allowed to openly engage in criminal activities (pretty much the entire town knows) and afforded above the law status due to a relationship they maintain with certain elements of law enforcement then this is a problem that urgently needs to be addressed.
