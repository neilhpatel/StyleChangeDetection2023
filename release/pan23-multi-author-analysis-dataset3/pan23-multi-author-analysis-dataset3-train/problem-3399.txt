It’s not due to her disability but rather her behavior that is causing the police to be called multiple times. If her behavior continues, she can be evicted. Her mental disability can confer some protection if she can show the issues are now under control and she will no longer be a disturbance and/or present a safety issue. It does. To mean she can continue to create disturbances that necessitate police involvement.
My suggestion would be to acknowledge she has created a disturbance, inform management that the incidents were due to a disability as defined under the ADA/FHA, and that she is now receiving treatment that will address these issues.
Offering to stay somewhere else for the last month and receiving new treatment for the issue would indicate that the problems are being addressed. You would have a strong defense for an eviction suit based on behavior.
What is the reason that the landlord wants to evict? Non-payment of rent? Some other violation of lease terms?
The landlord is not obligated to talk to everyone on the lease. They can choose to speak to one party privately. It’s very common for a landlord to try to talk a problematic tenant out of the apartment, as it’s cheaper to negotiate the tenant out and can resolve the issue more quickly for affected neighbors.
The landlord choosing to talk to the tenant that has these mental disorders seems like a safe tactic to me, especially since the property management company has been in conversation with her father previously.
