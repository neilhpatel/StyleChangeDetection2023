I’ll add that I’m a lifelong Massachusetts resident and we’ve elected Republican governors more often than Democrat ones in my lifetime. Your standard MA Republican is fairly moderate-to-liberal; the MAGA kooks exist but they’re wildly outnumbered and openly scorned.
But even strongly left-of-center states like Maryland or California can have lunatics representing a particular congressional district. The one and only congressional Republican from Maryland is the seditionist Andy Harris. His district is mostly made up of rural and exurban whites, so he managed to get re-elected even after taking part in the attempted coup.
That’s one reason I prefer Katie Porter. I’d like to see my staunch defender of the working class get a Senate seat, and possibly use it as a pathway to the presidency in a decade or two.
A couple terms in the Senate would arguably make her a better Presidential candidate. I don't believe anybody has ever made the leap from the House to the White House.
Having said that, I really think we need Katie Porter in either one house of Congress or the other for as long as possible, because she couldn't do the things we all love her for, as President. She would definitely be a great addition to the Senate because there are so few actual Progressives in that body, and Bernie may not run again himself when his term is over.
If Feinstein is running again and winning reelection again, I really hope she's doing as well as my 85 years old grandmother who's still beating us at card games and who we can have great political discussions with. And hopefully better than my other, 87 years old grandmother who is suffering from dementia and living in a nursing home.
