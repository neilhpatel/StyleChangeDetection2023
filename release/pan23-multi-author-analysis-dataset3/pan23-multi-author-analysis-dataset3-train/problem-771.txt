States do respect other state's laws. This is why with a valid driver's license from any state you can generally drive in any other state.
So when your home state suspends your driver's license you can no longer drive in any state. But only your home state can suspend your driver's license, other states can only suspend your driving privileges within their own borders.
Also if your home state suspends your license and you move to another state, if the new state allows it you can get a driver's license in your new state while your license is still suspended in your original state. This is getting less common since most states make their records available electronically to other states and most states won't give you a license if they know you have a suspended license in another state. But it can happen.
I don't think PO ever had a NY license. I think they live near the state line and got tickets when in NY with an out of state license.
Do you know what the NY license number was? Will let let you proceed with inputting the expired/suspended license number?
