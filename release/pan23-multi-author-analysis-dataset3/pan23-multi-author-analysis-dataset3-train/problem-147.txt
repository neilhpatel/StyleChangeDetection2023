That's going to be the main consideration. If it doesn't, it's definitely not OK (assuming you're not exempt from overtime laws).
They're subject to higher withholding taxes if issued as a separate check, so more will be withheld from the individual paycheck. If issued on the same check as regular wages, they're subject to the same withholding as your regular wages.
If they're also sometimes withholding it on the grounds that it's a "bonus", delaying its payment, etc. that is a bigger deal.
You can complain if they're calling it a "bonus" specifically, but as long as you're being paid appropriately, they probably won't face any penalties beyond the Fair Labor Division telling them to change it.
Also, if the overtime "bonus" is being paid out on the same check as your regular wages, withholding is probably being calculated the same way as if it was listed as overtime, which would mean there isn't even a different in your take home pay. When people talk about bonuses being taxed differently, all it means is that the withholding amount might be calculated differently. The amount you actually owe the government come April 15th is the same.
As an example, if I usually make $2000 every paycheck, my tax withholding will be calculated under the assumption that I make $2000 26 = $52,000 per year. If I suddenly get a bonus of $10,000 added to a paycheck, the assumption will be that I make $12,000 26 = $312,000 per year. A higher percentage of taxes will be taken out accordingly, though I'll get it back in my tax refund. That's why some places will pay out bonuses on a second check and treat it as "supplemental income", withholding at a flat amount. But no matter how they do it, assuming it is being paid on a paycheck and recorded legally, the eventual tax burden will be the same.
However, come tax time at the end of the year they'll be treated the same as all other income, so you won't actually end up paying more.
