You don't. You can go and explain to the judge that you don't want to participate because you think the justice system is "fucked up" and see how far that gets you if you like, though.
"I don't want to and I think the justice system is broken" is not a good reason formally to avoid jury duty, but it's pretty likely to trigger either a peremptory by one side or the other, excusing you from the case at hand, or a remark from the judge and your dismissal from the jury pool until a later date. However, you would be risking contempt charges if you refuse to participate if selected.
If jury duty would place an undue burden on your life - if you'd be unable to meet rent due to time off, for example, or if you have a dependent child and can't afford child care - then the judge is likely to excuse you.
Honestly, if that's your perspective on jury duty, maybe the jury you're selected for could benefit from having you on it.
If you're the type of person who would be swayed by wanting to get out of the jury room, rather than by the facts of the case, you can tell the lawyers that. You'll be asked if you can be counted on to render a fair and unbiased verdict - you can tell the judge that you can't. You're duty bound (and you swear) to render your verdict based on the facts and not to make compromises with the other jurors just to end the case. If your standing by your belief means the case has to be tried again, then that's just the way it has to be.
