Oh shit. Ok well that makes sense. I guess my other question is, legally, does the new landlord have to give us 30 days before he can expect us to pay him this money? Or is he within his right to expect us to pay all of this by Dec. 1st?
None of these apply to the landlord, so he wouldn’t be exempt. But, since he is the new property owner, is he allowed to rent it out for however much he wants even though we’ve been the tenant here for over a year?
The landlord has to issue you a "notice of exemption from AB 1482" (if he is exempt) before he can raise the rent that much.
I would be willing to guess that your maybe-soon-to-be landlord either doesn't know or doesn't care about giving a "notice of exemption from AB 1482.".
> Owner occupied rental properties where tenant shares bathroom or kitchen facilities with the owner. (just cause exemption only).
He has to give you the exemption. Once he does that, he has to give you 30-day notice. Without the exemption in your hands (and valid) then AB 1482 applies.
If the property is exempt, he can raise the rent to whatever he wants. If it's not exempt, he cannot.
