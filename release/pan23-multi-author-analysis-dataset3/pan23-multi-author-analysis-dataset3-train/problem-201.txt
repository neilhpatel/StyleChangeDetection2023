Iit's not just that he threw in the word "peacefully" once, after spending two solid months whipping his supporters into a frenzy and telling them they need to "fight like hell." It's that a good lawyer (assuming Trump could find one willing to work for him) could easily establish reasonable doubt. "I'll march down to the Capitol with you" could be (the lawyer would argue) about peaceful protest. "Fight like hell" could be a metaphor for a political battle. And of course the clip with the word "peacefully" would be played repeatedly for the jury.
That (plus the two months of inflammatory rhetoric leading up to it) makes it clear to you and me and any honest viewers that he was inciting a riot, but none of that amounts to a winnable court case by itself.
I also disagree that it would all be moot. Indicting a former President is huge. If they get a conviction, even if it's tied up in appeals and a pardon makes sure he never sees actual consequences, convicting a former President is monumental.
There is another major factor of the two year period from indictment through to the potential of a pardon: Trump's own behavior.
