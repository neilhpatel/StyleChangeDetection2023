"we inhabit a city supported for the most part by slender props, for that is how the landlord holds up the tottering house, patches up gaping cracks in the old wall, bidding the inmates sleep at ease under a roof ready to tumble about their ears..." (193-6).
The best resource is still the famous model in Rome's Museum of Roman Civilization. Their website has a nice page with details of the model:
Building codes existed, though they seem to have been honored largely in the breach. We hear most about regulations limiting the height of new buildings. Augustus, for example, restricted new buildings on public streets (but not, of course, his own projects) to 70 Roman feet (Strabo 5.3.7), and even bored his dinner guests by reading them treatises on the dangers of excessively tall buildings (Suet., Aug. 89). Trajan apparently lowered the maximum to 60 feet. It was fairly easy, however, for buildings to circumvent these limits, since the parts of an insula (apartment block) that were not directly on a public street were apparently not subject to height restrictions. In the imperial era, one towering Roman insula was so tall that it became a tourist attraction.
Could please recommend any good visual resources (reconstructions, models, or perhaps even Roman-era depictions) that would help me visualise how the cityscape of imperial Rome might have looked like? I've seen drawings of individual insulae (and wealthy courtyard-houses) but I don't know how I should imagine the whole urban structure to have appeared.
