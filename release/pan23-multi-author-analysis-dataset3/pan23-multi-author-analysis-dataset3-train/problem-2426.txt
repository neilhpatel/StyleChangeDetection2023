they did but that was after they were attacked, they held those as forward positions for a while to prevent further possible attacks, today they are in good relations with Egypt. In this day you really think Israel is interested in taking said lands just to get more trouble?
You seriously believe Israel wants to invade it's neighbors? lol they already won a war against them via total victory and didn't take land from them.
Iran will become an eternal dictatorship if they get nukes, a civil war might also mean said nukes end up in the hands of an extremist factions.
No country of the likes of Iran should ever have nukes and yes I also agree that Pakistan should have never been allowed to have nukes.
I don’t want Iran to have nuclear weapons, but be fair, the only reason why you don’t have a problem with Israel having nuclear weapons is because Israel is friendly with the west. Israel treats Palestinians terribly, and is a massive threat to its neighbors.
First, Israel is not a massive threat to it's neighbors. It factually gave back more land mass than it's entire size in exchange for peace with it's neighbors. So your comment is very wrong.
