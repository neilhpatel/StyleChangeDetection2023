Yea the article literally says “If passed as a resolution in a vote on Wednesday, the designation would be a largely symbolic condemnation of Russia's actions in Ukraine and beyond.” And “In essence, there would be no hard and fast legal consequences.” It seems EU is leaving specifics to the individual countries and this won’t have much actual impact.
“If passed as a resolution in a vote on Wednesday, the designation would be a largely symbolic condemnation of Russia's actions in Ukraine and beyond.” And “In essence, there would be no hard and fast legal consequences.” It seems EU is leaving specifics to the individual countries and this won’t have much actual impact after all.
Parliaments in several of Ukraine's most ardent EU backers - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland - have declared that they consider Russia under President Vladimir Putin to be a state sponsor of terrorism.
While i strongly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and it's actions there are indeed terrorism the reality is that this label done by the EU was done purely out of political motivation because of Russia and EU having an antagonistic relationship, thus making it much easier to call them a terrorist state. The same thing would NOT be possible for Uncle Sam no matter how justified it would be if the same standards that calls Russia a terrorist state was applied to America.
Really? Well they don't seem to do a good job of it with all of their military adventures in the ME along with not doing a damn about Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
The U.S might be a savior for Europe and some parts of the rest of the world but is a terrorist to those who had to suffer for it's actions like Latin America during the Cold War and the Middle East.
