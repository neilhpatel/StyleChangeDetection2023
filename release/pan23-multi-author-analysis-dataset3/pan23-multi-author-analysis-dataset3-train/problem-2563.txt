If there is truly an estate, meaning an ongoing probate matter, misconduct of the executor is reported to the court. If there is a trust, misconduct of the trustee is reported to the court. But the person making the report has to have an interest.
IDK much about patents, but my impression is that an issued patent is a public record but the licensing of rights is a private matter, with no public reporting.
So, being public record, means I can find a database which , at least , acknowledge the patents? And, if so, would I be able to at least get an understanding of said patents? For my own curiosity. Im fine with the memories I have of them both, so this would be an added bonus.
Lets put it this way, the uncle who has control of the finances, reported to an aunt, who is currently taking it to court, that there was a mere $20K in my grandparents account. As I mentioned in a previous post, my grandfather was a hydraulics engineer for Raytheon, he came out of the US Navy and worked until he was 85. I have seen myself, the list of patents he had. I know they had much more than the reported amount. Not that it matters, because I already signed-off on receiving anything, it's not going to bring them back and I'd rather it go to others. But the idea of someone taking advantage does not sit well with me.
I wish to go a bit further, and it may be too soon to get such information, but, is it possible to find out about pending court cases? I'm not expecting to find anything now, but it would be helpful to find out whether or not cases such as this are put out there for the public.
