Edit: curious why people are downvoting and not answering the question. Not mean to dismiss anything happebing in Iran, I'm asking how we are expected to influence what is happening there.
I'm not sure less covert or non-violent Western involvement is better for the Iranian people when either way, their government will likely get nukes. The inevitable Saudi-Iranian arms race would be the most tense nuclear rivalry the world has seen since India and Pakistan in the 1990s, maybe since the 60s even.
You're right that the West has a limited impact on internal affairs in Iran but to say there is zero sway is definitely false. For instance, the government has increasingly worked to create a Great Persian Firewall; the West can't stop that altogether but can help Iranians access the Internet. It can work to provide Farsi-language news to young people who don't agree with the government. It can encourage brain drain by allowing visas for more Iranian professionals who want out (for instance, the US has already loosened its illogical ban on men who served their mandatory IRGC service; it could do more to reunite families). The West can make it more difficult for Iranian government officials to send their children or other family members to live comfortable lives in Europe. Western countries absolutely should reconsider the concessions they're willing to make to Iran on the nuclear issue, because while Trump should not have left the JCPOA and Iran was unpleasantly surprised and disappointed when Obama immediately imposed more sanctions after the JCPOA was signed, it's also true that the JCPOA empowered Iran regionally by freeing up a large amount of frozen Iranian funds.
