Yes, Im the executor. The lease agreement was with the business, which is a corporation. Probate was only required for the personal estate (which is completed), not the business. The corporation was instantly transferred to me with my fathers passing. Thanks for the quick response!
Yes, Im facing that reality. My father put the business in bad financial shape over the last year, so I inherited (to put it bluntly) a pile of shit for a business. Im happy to negotiate with the landlord, but needed to make sure that they couldnâ€™t withhold the inventory since I need to start progressing with the secured creditors.
Yeah unless the lease is somehow secured against the inventory, but in order to make sure there will be not a chance of outstanding claims against you personally, you will need to work with a bankruptcy trustee to determine who is entitled to what.
It's down the owner to assess those obligations and it sounds like nothing has officially been entered in to yet, like for bankruptcy protection or insolvency proceedings.
The obligations begin when a business is in a state of insolvency, which is a precursor to a process of bankruptcy but not the same thing.
You are probably going to need to have the business go through a bankruptcy process. If there is not enough money to cover all of the obligations, you don't get to choose which obligations are paid and which are not. You should engage the services of an insolvency trustee.
