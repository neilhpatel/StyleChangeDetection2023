Not being a company has nothing to do with anything. If there isn’t a company then the individuals can be charged with a crime. If your friend indeed heard the cop correctly, then the cop was just lazy or didn’t want to deal with a police report, abrogating his/her duty. Like, what? All a criminal has to do is start a fake company that doesn’t exist to avoid criminal liability?
the cops told her the only option is a small claims/civil lawsuit, but if this isn’t a real company why wouldn’t it be a criminal one? should she just be firm and say she wants to file a criminal complaint if they keep trying to distract her?
yeah the cops told her they can’t do anything for her and she can’t file a report and then ended up leaving because they got called away for another issue. when she got to talk to our leasing office this morning they basically told her “it’s not our towing service sorry” ?? also, when you look up the name of the company there’s reviews online going back to 2011/12 talking f about how they’re going into peoples cars, peeling off parking permits to tow them and say they were illegally parked, etc.
