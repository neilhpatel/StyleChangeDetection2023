I was under the impression one of the important trade goods the Romans imported from Britain were dogs. Was this a trade good that only came into being after the Roman occupation of Britain or did it exist before?
There was substanial trade between Britain and northern Gaul, which had of course just been incorporated into the Empire. The only British goods that made their way into the metropolitan markets of Rome itself, however, were the pearls fished from the Channel. Caesar himself was said to be an enthusiastic costumer. Suetonius went so far as to (quite incorrectly) claim that "[Caesar] was led to invade Britain by the hope of getting pearls, and that in comparing their size he sometimes weighed them with his own hand..." (47).
There was something more than a little cinematic about Caesar's first sight of Britain: a substantial native force, amply supplied with photogenic war chariots, arrayed along the Cliffs of Dover, waiting. That they were ready for Caesar, however, is less surprising than you might think.
So Caesar sends one of his lieutenants to survey the coast while Caesar himself prepares for the actual invasion:
Is it simply Caesar's account that calls them invaders? As that's all I can find on the topic in the context of war.
