You might not have had a deadly reaction, but that sort of gross negligence could kill someone. She heard you were allergic and proceded without patient consent or even the bare minimum of further investigation. You, personally, may have no damages, but you can contact the pharmacy and let them know the name of the person who injected you and your story. If you want to go further and don’t trust the pharmacy at face value, check the state board of pharmacy. Googling “report a pharmacy technician” immediately took me to my state’s www.pharmacy.ca.gov site for California, with a detailed list of steps to take.
Without knowing your state, Idk, but you should be able to find your state board of pharmacists easily.
Make a complaint to the state's board of pharmacy, as well as the store's DM. While pharmacy is being overworked across the board, they still need to ensure the right drug goes into the right person. Legally, I'm not sure what you can do. Ethically, they messed up. That tech messed up. Complain, make your voice heard.
