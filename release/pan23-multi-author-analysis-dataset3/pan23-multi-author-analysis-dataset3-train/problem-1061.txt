Mostly because we realized it's kinda pointless. It takes a lot of fuel and a long time to get to that speed, and in actual war, it's rarely useful. Nearly every fighter and interceptor in Vietnam was capable of Mach 2, and almost none of them ever spent much time even just over Mach 1.5.
(The 22 apparently has no trouble at all getting to mach 2 though, and the 15 is the fastest of the current US fighters, at least officially, at mach 2.5).
I’m aware, but to say Mach 2 is kinda pathetic as if there are planes going faster just simply isn’t accurate.
I agree that bragging about the mig 31 isn’t that bug of a flex but there is people in here who clearly arnt aware that planes arnt just flying around at Mach 2.5 easily.
We already had a Mach 3.3 capable plane in the 60s, so we've had the tech forever, it just turns out that speed alone isn't that helpful in combat any more.
You're right in that those speeds are historically possible, like the SR-71 Blackbird was around Mach 3 or 4 when it came out in the 60s, but engineers have deemed it unnecessary for modern fighter jets.
