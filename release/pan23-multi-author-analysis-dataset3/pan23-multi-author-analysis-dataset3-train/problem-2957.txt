Rejected refugee status means they stay in the country as irregulars in Italy's case since it can't just deport them (France sure can, throwing migrants back across the Franco-Italian border is a daily occurrence for the French police).
Nah they're in Southern France so they will just dump them over the French-Italian border then beat the shit out of any migrant trying to go to France blocking the passage despite Schengen, they've been doing it since 2015, why stop now?
I appreciate that, but when France is being paid to not allow migrants to cross, they appear to be breaking that deal, however, none of us truly know as we probably don't work for either government.
? Not sure what it has to do with Brexit, it was literally on BBC news a few days ago advising Britian is in talks with France regarding the amount of illegal migrants coming over which France is being paid to stop/reduce.
This was a problem before Brexit anyway, France has always dumped migrants on the coast and turned a blind eye to them crossing, hence what encouraged people to vote leave in the Brexit vote. Ah well it's done now, maybe Britain just needs to hardline it and start sinking a few boats, it might change people's minds then. I don't know.
