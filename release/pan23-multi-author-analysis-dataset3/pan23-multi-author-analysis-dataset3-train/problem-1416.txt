A huge, amazing congratz to our brilliant winners You folks are what makes this community the incredible place that it is.
Wow This is an unexpected honor, as always It’s always wonderful to be able to contribute to such a wonderful community.
The moderation in this community, and the member-base enabled me to write my winning answer. In many other communities, a second, dissenting answer might have been shunned, removed, or abused. But the community on AskHistorians is such that I was comfortable enough to do so. So thanks to the community and mods for keeping this sub civil and for always leaving questions open for further discussion.
Thank you to everyone who contributes to this sub—the question askers, the knowledgeable repliers, & especially the mods who keep the integrity of the whole thing. Unlike many other subs, I find this one really makes me concentrate & leads me to want to learn more. The outcome is I realize that the more I know, the more I realize I don’t know. I guess that’s part of the fun though.
