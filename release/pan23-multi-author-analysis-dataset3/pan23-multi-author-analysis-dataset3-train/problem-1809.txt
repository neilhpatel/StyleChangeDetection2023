I worked in the fraud department at a major bank once. Since she’s joint on the account, there isn’t much the bank will do. Go to the actual branch with your ID and withdraw the funds. If you don’t know your account information that’s easy to get with providing your ss to the teller.
Now-she will most likely know immediately if she has banking alerts or check her accounts often so, I suggest going to grandma’s if you don’t think it’ll be safe for you at home.
Make sure to transfer all of your deposits over to the new account that your grandmother created (since it sounds like you trust her) and take the remaining money out of your mother's account.
Unfortunately, I am not sure there is much you can do about the money because your mother is a joint 'owner' of the account. She is legally able to take funds out of the account. Take all your remaining funds and go immediately to a totally different bank and open a new account with the remaining money. You can do this before you are 18. Go to the Post Office and open a PO Box. Close the current account and report the debit card stolen. This will not give you your money back, but will definitely stop her access to it. You could talk to an attorney about regaining your money but not sure how it would work. Unfortunately, it is too large of an amount to take her to small claims court.
If you're looking at legal action, this is probably a small claims case without enough damages to mske it worth a lawyers time. Track your expences that's an important part of making a budget is knowing how much is coming in and what's going out.
Now here's the thing, you are spending money on uber and i presume other expenses too. My bet is that all these add up to higher than $1000 over two years. These could add up. Maybe not the 10 k discrepancy you're noticing, but perhaps a portion of it. Go to the bank and ask for all your bank statements and find out what charges are yours and which ones are from your grandma/ mother.
