For instance, grills were originally allowed on balconies. But then management finds that it's a better deal on insurance if they disallow going forward. Or it's a new fire code violation that the building must comply with.
Lease states tenant agrees to Community Rules. Are there any changes to such rules that would not be grandfathered in, that an existing tenant would be compelled to follow?
If the lease said that rent could be changed at any time at the landlord's discretion, that clearly wouldn't be an enforceable clause.
"You agree to abide by the terms of a contract that I can change unilaterally and without notice" is a very one sided deal that would likely be struck down regardless.
Can you really enforce a contract where one party has the ability of unilaterally alter the rules though?
So you agree with me that one party is not allowed to unilaterally modify a signed contract, even if there is a clause in the contact saying they can?
If there's mutual agreement or some sort of voting process to change the community rules so that OP has a say, that would be different.
