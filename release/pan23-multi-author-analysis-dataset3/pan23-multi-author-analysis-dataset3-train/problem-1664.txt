All of these people in LCOL red states are big mad that Californians and New Yorkers are moving to their states, outbidding them on houses and services, but none of them ever stop and consider why all these people from blue states are so much better off than them in the first place.
I mean as a very blue voter in a depressingly red state, I will not be happy to see Californians and NYers move here if they start to.
My general thinking on this is that if red states want to vote themselves into a situation where they're dying frequently due to sickness, violence, and poverty......well they made their bed, and we should just let them lie in it.
They're angry because their life sucks and the assholes that they have been brainwashed into thinking are the only ones who will solve their problems (the GOP) are trying to help them, so they keep voting for them.
In fact, the people they think are going to help them only enact policies that make their lives worse. Unfortunately, they are stuck in an endless loop of corporate propaganda that convinces them that, rather than the policies of the assholes they vote for causing them harm, it is still the "evil woke democrats" causing their problems, so they vote even harder for the GOP, who repay them by making their lives even worse still.
This endless loop of voting for people who make their lives worse, then blame it on the other side so that they can continue to enact these policies, makes people angrier and angrier.
