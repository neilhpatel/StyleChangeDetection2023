This is is the kind of thing I try to explain when someone tells me theyâ€™re totally against GMO food. Yes, it can be used to make plants more resistant to herbicides so more can be used, but it can also be used like this to reduce or eliminate pesticides.
Natural/organic lawn care is still lawn care, and the organic pesticides used are often less safe, less environmentally friendly, and less effective.
Friendly reminder that pesticides don't just help farmers grow food more easily - they also help reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture by reducing spoilage. It's wasteful to grow crops and let them be needlessly destroyed by pests.
The issue are not the pests, it is the production system. Massive monocrops are working against nature and even if pests are beaten back temporarily, the continuous loss of biodiversity and soil fertility is steadily continuing to erode our agricultural systems. The current production model only works to the benefit of a few multinationals while farmers are poorer than ever, only to be kept afloat by a government that is heavily lobbied by said multinationals. We ll end up with the agricultural future of Interstellar.
