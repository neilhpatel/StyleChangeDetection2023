I went to confront the editor in chief as to why he did this and he claimed "I'm just trying to tell both sides of the story." As if there was a legitimate other side to "the Holocaust happened." There isn't. It happened - end of story.
They're trying to rewrite history to absolve the Nazis of any criminal activity and blame the Jews for "inventing the Holocaust" in order to get sympathy.
Also most of them can't help themselves even when doing holocaust denial to eventually pivot into why the jews deserved it, hypothetically, if it happened.
If you can convince someone that the Holocaust didn't happen or was overblown, suddenly it's the people calling the rhetoric dangerous who are overreacting and can be dismissed.
Denying the Holocaust, in my opinion, is probably one of the most hypocritical and cowardly things you can do.
You think that the Holocaust never happened due to a gross and willful ignorance of the facts? Got to give that EXACTLY the same amount of time as someone who knows their actual history facts!
