If you do not wish to renounce your citizenship, you can apply for a U.S. passport. You should probably take care of your tax filings ASAP if you want to take advantage of your U.S. citizenship.
You are a U.S. citizen and you are required to file and pay taxes on your worldwide income. You can renounce your U.S. citizenship but it will take some time. If you do renounce your citizenship you may be inadmissible to the U.S. under Section 212(a)(10)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act if it is determined that you were motivated by tax avoidance purposes.
According to what I saw online a US citizen can only renounce citizenship after paying all IRS obligations, so I think it is better to keep an attorney informed while I contact the embassy. Looks like an expensive process, bummer.
I do plan to fulfill my tax obligations as soon as possible, but I am confused whether to contact the embassy first or an accountant + lawyer first, as according to another commenter there may be a chance that I would be inadmissible to the US ever again if they think that I am doing this to dodge taxes.
I have no intention of tax avoidance and I plan to pay what I owe to the IRS. I have an obligation to do so.
Yes, I plan to do so. In fact I've asked for recommendations from a few people I know. I should be careful with that as i don't want to be deemed inadmissible to the USA as a tax evader.
