Eh, well I don't remember when, but there was a time (in the US) where you didn't have to register handguns, they were just a thing you might have, like a hammer or an umbrella. I believe it's fine to have an "unregistered handgun" in many states. They are registered automatically when you buy them.
In any case, it doesn't seem like it's a forced confiscation or anything, just reminding and asking people to hand over old guns.
Edit: Now, I'm not saying they should treat firearms like the U.S. does, but I am implying that they should probably let the heirloom weapons confiscation slide a bit.
Well, it's a voluntary weapon disposal program, with apparently the possibility to get a permit for the weapon. Though yes ... why should you have to go pay and ask for a permit for something that is already yours?
Maybe they were fire crackers, maybe they were something else, I dunno. Back in the day they didn't care.
I recall my grandma once telling me about how some people broke into their house (in the 20s or 30's in China) and she chased them away by ... THROWING BOMBS at them.
