Right now Russia does not have a shortage of men. It has a shortage of weapons ammunition and artillery. China's applying Russia would be catastrophically bad for Ukraine.
But you agree they don't have a shortage of men then. And the only thing it takes for them is to actually supply the necessary training over months. Which guess what goes back to one of my original thesis time is on russia's side not Ukraine's. And Russia is now figured that out and is shifted to a wartime economy. The reorganizing of the army. Most people aren't really paying attention to what the fuck is going on with Russia now and they are completely changing tactics. Even on the ground, the way they are performing combat missions is shifting. And guess what? They have to be defeated. That requires Ukraine to be given the weapons and combat power to do it. Protracting this only helps Russia only hurts Ukraine.
I was shocked this past year by just how much damage Russia was able to do. As a result, I'm far more wary in regards to a fight with China because I know they're far more important.
Much like The USA aims for deterrence so does China. The USA is building 2 Nuclear subs a year reports say China is building 3. Will they be worse submarines? Absolutely.
People like to point out China is a large portion of western countries trade is with China let's say 20% each but the West combined is like 85% of China's trade.
You mean all the money being funneled into China will instead be funneled into all the western countries that will fill in each other's trade gaps ? Sign me up. The West can replace it's trade with the West. China however has no replacement for Western trade.
My point is the western world can not live without China with this over indulgent of materialistic things and trade will stop. iPhone 15 $15,000.
