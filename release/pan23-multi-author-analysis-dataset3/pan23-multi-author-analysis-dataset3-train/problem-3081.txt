- but hostile work environment has a specific application involving ongoing harassment of a certain nature, and that isn’t what is occurring here. It’s just a jerk of a boss.
I get that a lot of it is “asshole boss” instances. But I have repeatedly stated I was uncomfortable, he violated several policies, and it’s clear that they talked to him about my statement before HR was even able to get involved even though it was sent directly to them.
However, I don’t understand how it’s legal to violate several policies such as talking bad about me to our staff that we supervise, threatening to fire me over policies that don’t exist, targeting me and singling me out very clearly to where everyone else sees it, and letting private disciplinary action be open knowledge to other managers and for it to be supposedly addressed and not stop.
For instance he threatened to make me pay him out of pocket for a $35 reimbursement paid for buying supplies for the company because I lost the receipt (first time I’ve ever done so in 5 years). He also threatened the staff that if there was customer theft for a retail item that is out in the open within guest reach, they would be responsible to pay for it or be fired. Both examples are illegal to enforce and make anyone pay in my state.
Inappropriate in other ways. I get the discrimination piece, and the indication is there but that I don’t have proof of.
