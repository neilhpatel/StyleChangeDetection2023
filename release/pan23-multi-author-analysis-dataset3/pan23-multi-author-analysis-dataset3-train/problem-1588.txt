Also, adding that you could report this to OCFS (NY child care regulatory agency) as they are most likely a licensed program or an illegal program. I used to run a licensed program in NY as well.
That being said, them deducting the money is straight up wage theft. It can be reported to the department of labor.
I am not a lawyer but a HR Director in NY. I want to confirm what this post is saying. There is an exemption for the one-employee-shift that allows business that have one employee that can’t be easily replaced to waive their lunch break, but they must be paid. Daycare generally comes with ratios and licensing requirements, so your fiancé can have her lunch waived due to her job.
The employer isn't legally required to deduct the money for lunch breaks; they're required to give her lunch breaks. Can't do the former without doing the latter.
I found for New York. Looks like your fiance can voluntarily accept a PAID lunch break under the one-employee-shift exception.
No, legally they have to give you a lunch break, which prevents them from paying you for those 30 minutes without having serious consequences. This is an easy lawsuit.
