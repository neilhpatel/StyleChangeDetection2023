Is there a reason you don't want to pay rent to the owner as she has requested? It's consistent with your lease and, realistically, owners fire and replace property managers as a normal fact of the business. Paying their _former_ property manager, on purpose, seems like a needless and risky decision. You're fine for this month - you acted in good faith, and your landlord has said as much as that they'll deal with the rent if you provide records - but going forwards, I don't completely understand why this seems like an unreasonable request or a legal issue.
I suppose I'm fine to also complete and provide her the new rental application, but I will ask her to confirm that the intent is informational only and not that a new lease is expected to be signed, that my existing lease will be honored (which she'll get a copy of as well). We'll just have to cross that bridge when we get there.
Thank you very much I've been continuing talking about this with my partner to work through and process everything (logically and emotionally), and that plus your input has been very helpful I don't feel as scared of what originally felt like a serious crisis, which now feels a lot less scary and monumentous.
I do feel the Owner is acting in good-faith as well. I'm fine with providing her a copy of my existing lease and receipts, but I don't feel I should be signing any other lease agreements when I have an existing lease. I wanted an attorney to look it all over because I felt it was the prudent thing to do to ensure my own protection.
