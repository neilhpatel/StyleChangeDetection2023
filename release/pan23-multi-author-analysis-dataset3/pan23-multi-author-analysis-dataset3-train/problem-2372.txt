>Rampey, a Republican, faced no general election opposition in his November victory in House District 119, which includes most of Barrow County. Rep. Terry England, the current officeholder, is retiring. Rampey easily won an earlier GOP primary.
The Republican mindset is that winners always cheat and cheaters always win. They're the grift that keeps on grifting. They'd rather lie than tell the truth - trump is not an outlier - he's the embodiment of the Republican party, just saying out loud what they really think.
>...Rampey, according to his political site, has formerly served as chairman of the Barrow County Chamber of Commerce. He and his family own a chain of personal care homes in northeast Georgia.
They love politicians that resemble themselves. Anyone who votes republican is eroding integrity in our political system, and that's a feature not a bug, to them.
Over the last ten years every piece of shit has looked in the mirror and told himself “I could win a Republican primary” like some sort of asshole self-affirmation.
