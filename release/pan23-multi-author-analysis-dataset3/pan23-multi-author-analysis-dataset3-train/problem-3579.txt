It is well written and puts forward interesting points that deserve more exposure, but it is highly controvertial and very decidedly anti-Islam, and any romanticizations in there (and there are a lot) are very anti-Muslim.
So I got it and read it, and I must say I enjoyed it. It's pretty clear, was very unbiased (at least is seemed that way to me), and offers a very good set of explanations of why Islam was ultimately successful as a religion and civilization.
For an unbiased source that’s still skeptical of the traditional accounts of Islam’s rise, I highly recommend “In God’s Path: The Arabic Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire” by Robert G. Hoyland. It covers the period from the last phases of the Great Byzantine-Sasanian War in the 620s to the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate in 750.
Of millennia of events and wars in the Middle East, there's nothing that I can read so passionately about as the final struggle between the Sassanids and the Byzantines.
It has betrayal, moments when all hope seems lost, sieges, fervent religiosity, and best of all, the climax of the war happens near the ruins of the city of Nineveh that was ancient even for Roman and Sassanid standards.
And then, once it's all over and after 20 years the Romans have finally won, the Arabs show up, unified under their new religion, and invade the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires, and just totally destroys the second and almost destroys the first.
