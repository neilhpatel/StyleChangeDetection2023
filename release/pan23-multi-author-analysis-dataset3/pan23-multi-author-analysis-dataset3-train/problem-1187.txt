My understanding is that the term soliciting means offering goods or services in exchange for something material, for delivery either now or in the future.
Do you care to share what part of AL you're in? (fellow Alabamian here, though I haven't been here that long yet).
You are not offering a good or a service. You are not accepting money or other goods. You are not soliciting. Each individual landowner can trespass you from their property one at a time if they so choose. I guess if the HOA had a power of attorney from each landowner they could do that on their behalf.

If you're doing private things like voting on HOA members, for example, those things are not controlled by public election laws and therefore not anywhere under the umbrella of canvassing.
Some states, some counties, some cities do absolutely have laws that apply to how HOA's conduct themselves especially with regards to recording their meetings and making meeting notes available, but public election laws do not dictate action to an HOA in any jurisdiction I am aware of in the USA.
