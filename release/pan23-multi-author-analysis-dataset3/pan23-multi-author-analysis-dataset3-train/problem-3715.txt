Winter is going to be tough for the Ukrainian soldiers, but even tougher for the Russian invaders. Kyiv has received far better winter clothing and equipment from NATO militaries. But it's not just the cold, it's also the dark. Night vision goggles and thermal imagers have been at the top of the list of equipment requested by Ukraine from the West. Fighting won't stop, and the Ukrainians are advancing.
Putin's strategy seems to be to inflict as much pain as possible on Ukrainian civilians by attacking infrastructure. This not only harms civilians but also factories and businesses. Kiev might have to be evacuated, and Ukraine will have to be continually supplied with air defense systems. But these attacks on non-military targets don't actually lead to Russian military gains.
Like Hitler, Putin is trapped by needing to punish civilians for morale purposes at the cost of real military objectives that aren't as flashy.
It's as ineffective as the strategy Hitler pushed for in WW2: if you aren't going to destroy a countries' ability to defend itself, destroying houses, shops, and infrastructure just makes the population more angry and the armed forces more willing to fight on.
Putin nuking Kherson would tip the scales strongly in favour of a NATO intervention, simply because no one would want to allow the precedent of a country with hundreds of nukes using one to destroy a city in a war it started. For this reason , Russia using any nukes in Ukraine is very unlikely.
