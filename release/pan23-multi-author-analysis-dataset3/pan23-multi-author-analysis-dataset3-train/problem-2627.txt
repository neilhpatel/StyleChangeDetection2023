It's also possible that he was not susceptible to what you describe as conservative hate rhetoric. Very possible he just a mentally unwell person that committed violence for no political reason at all. Idk and neither do you.

Yeah I stated the samething. I'm currently being downvoted because it is so unbelievable that dude can be nonbinary. I am also being told that just because he is nonbinary doesn't mean he not conservative. Because we all know conservatives are generally the ones going around saying they are nonbinary.
Not saying there isn't, but if we are going to be honest not many conservatives are nonbinary and go by they/them. Is it possible that he is a nonbinary conservative, sure. Is it likely not really.
Assuming that it's true, no. People in a target group can still be made to commit crimes against "their own group".
That was likely made up to make this not seem like a hate crime. Even if the shooter is NB, that changes nothing, this is still a hate crime and a terroristic act.
