When she died, everything she owned became the property of something called Estate of Grandmother's Name. Since she did not have a will, state law determines wi=ho her heirs are. Anything she verbally expressed has no legal meaning.
In most states, assumin she was not married, her heirs would be her children. If a child died before her, that child's own children get the share. So, if Grandma had two children--your aunt & your mother--they would each get half of the estate. Since your mother has passed away, you (and any siblings your have) get your Mom's share.
Generally speaking, if somebody dies without a will their spouse and children would inherit. Usually only goes to the deceased's brothers and sisters if there aren't descendants or parents and no spouse. Under TN intestate law, I think if a deceased's child is also deceased, the grandchildren inherit that share.
This means that any assets in her estate are going to be distributed according to intestate succession law of Tennessee, which means that any assets will first go to her surviving brothers and sisters.
