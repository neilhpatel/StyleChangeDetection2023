If the VA relative bought it and said that the gun was for them and it wasn't, then they broke federal law and lied on the paperwork.
The only way that's legal is if the person buying the gun buys it for you with their money (not paid back nor expecting to be paid back) as a gift. Otherwise they've lied (committed perjury) on the 4473 where it asks if they're the actual buyer of the firearm, which is the true crime committed when people refer to a "straw purchase".
Except, it's perfectly legal to buy a firearm as a gift. It says so right on the Form 4473 that you fill out. You answer yes, as you "are" the "actual purchaser" of the firearm, and are not acting as an agent for someone else (straw purchase). It is legal for OP's relative, or even someone they don't know, to buy the gun as a bona fide gift, with no expectation of payment in return.
There is no truly private transfer across state borders. Because you and your relative are residents of different states the transfer will have to go through an FFL for a background check. Unfortunately, that means that you'll have to wait until you're 21 to buy this handgun, because a handgun can only be transferred from an FFL to a customer who is 21 or over.
So what you're saying is, I need a 21+ relative or friend to "buy" the handgun from my relative in Virginia, in which case I could obtain a PPP and buy the firearm from the 21+ person?
I have more to add to this problem of mine. The firearm was owned by my late great uncle. He passed about two months ago, and the firearm in question was owned by him. What additional legal hurdles does that create?
If I'm not mistaken, and I very well may be, it would only be a straw purchase if I am not allowed to possess a handgun at all, or if I was a convicted criminal attempting to purchase a firearm. Neither of these apply to me.
