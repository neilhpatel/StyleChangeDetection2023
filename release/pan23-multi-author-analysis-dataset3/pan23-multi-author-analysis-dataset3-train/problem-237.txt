Defense companies employ a lot of people, and take a ridiculously long time to develop defense products. If a thousand people get paid $65K/year for eight years developing and maintaining a missile, that's half a billion dollars right there.
When products can be sold in large numbers, the unit price comes down because the costs get amortized across all of them, and more closely approximates the cost of manufacturing. But defense products don't get sold in large numbers in times of peace, so each missile has to be priced to support a larger fraction of those costs.
Well missiles can be more than a million per physical unit, then there's the cost of transportation, security, training, and the overhead cost of actually firing a missile, among other things.
When you consider that those hundred missiles should destroy 30-100 enemy aircraft when used, and each enemy aircraft is $5-50 million doesnâ€™t seem like such a bad deal.
I remember hearing that Russia has mainly invested in aircraft and missile defense systems since those are the strongest attacking force the west has had at jts disposal. If that is the case then I think it might still be rather tough for us to quickly occupy their land.
