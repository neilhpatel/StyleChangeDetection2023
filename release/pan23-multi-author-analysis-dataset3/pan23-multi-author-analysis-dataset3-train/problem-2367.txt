I think it just elicits a wow factor. Just like the vague "5th gen fighters" from Top Gun. Given thst was literally for entertainment purposes and it's just some unnamed enemy for movie sake.
I know I get it, but that's what i meant. For just the entertainment purposes it used a catch phrase. We def want to call it a real plane but the "5th gen fighter" line works better than any actual description.
4th gen fighters are still viable however but only because they are less expensive and there are many situations where a less advanced plane is still enough.
Hollywood made you believe this and it is absolutely not true at all. It’s a romanticized fantasy. Most fighter pilots never even see what they are shooting at. Modern air combat is all about speed stealth and standoff range. It doesn’t matter how good of a pilot you are if you literally cannot detect your enemy and he has double your range. When you detect the missile heading towards you the 5th gen fighter has already turned around and is heading back to base.
The top choice would be a stealthy standoff missile, but stealth aircraft are also viable. Neutralizing a modern SAM would require a rather sophisticated effort with stealth aircraft, electronic warfare, decoys, etc.
The Su-57 is the first aircraft in Russian military service designed with stealth technology and is intended to be the basis for a family of stealth combat aircraft.
The aircraft is expected to succeed the MiG-29 and Su-27 in the Russian military service and has also been marketed for export. The first prototype aircraft flew in 2010, but the program would experience a protracted development due to various structural and technical issues that emerged during trials, including the destruction of the first production aircraft in a crash before its delivery. After repeated delays, the first Su-57 entered service with the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS)[N 2] in December 2020.The fighter is expected to have a service life of up to 35 years.
