"The truth doesn't care about our needs or wants, it doesn't care about our governments, our ideologies, our religions. It will lie in wait for all time. And this, at last, is the gift of Chernobyl. Where I once would fear the cost of truth, now I only ask: What is the cost of lies?".
always has ben this way... always will be. The problem is they have been given the opportunity to get some power by being used by the other republican power base and it is not out of control.
It’s obviously different here, but it’s interesting to see how 10% of the republicans have that same exponential power and can even control their whole party behind the scenes.
This is actually pretty interesting...support for Trump's "politics" is high among republican voters, but 50% want candidates who "conduct themselves differently." So, they've admitted he's an asshole but still like what he stood for. At Thanksgiving, my FIL said "it's too bad he's such an asshole, I thought he had some really good policy ideas...like, immigration.".
Good. It's increasingly looking line Republicans will give us at least 1 more shot at electing a Dem on easy mode while they field the literal worst pieces of shit imaginable.
