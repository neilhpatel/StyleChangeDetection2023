I’m fairly certain the trespass requires notice. This is why people post a notice on property. Without it being posted it isn’t trespassing unless she asked them to leave her yard and they refused. Even with that, you have the right to get the tree trimmed so I don’t think the courts would even back her if they were just accessing the property to do their job.
Either way, sounds like a crazy old lady. With a threat to sue you can’t really talk to her so just wait and see what she does.
But her reaction and threats to sue me were way out of line with the action. All for me trimming a tree on my property. I’m not even sure the tree trimmers trespassed on her side. They climbed up into the canopy and trimmed away. Maybe they picked up debris and branches that fell on her side. Nothing was damaged on her side so it’s hard to say.
It was expensive to trim too. I trimmed it as the city public works department requested I do so as it was creating a ‘traffic safety street view obstruction’ meaning the branches were hanging down onto the street and affecting sight lines.
It’s about 2’ away from the property line. It’s in a front lawn area so no boundary fence or any thing else that would show the property line. I did a survey 2 years ago and it’s clearly my tree. I think she has lived in the house forever and maintained it as her own. I did tell her it’s my tree but I think she choose to ignore me about that.
I apologized to her and said it should of been handled better. She didn’t accept the apology. So now I’m left with a nicely trimmed tree and a pissed off neighbor.
