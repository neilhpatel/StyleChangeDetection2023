If your lease does not specify what appliances are included, then I don't see how the LL can charge for any appliances.
Where I live if it is in your unit when you move in and the lease doesn't specify charges then you aren't required to pay anything and they can't remove them either.
Not a lawyer, but If the lease doesn’t say the unit comes with a washer/dryer and you refuse to pay I imagine it’s legal for them to just remove the washer and dryer from your unit.
So now the question stands: can the landlord remove your in-unit laundry if you refuse to enter a new agreement and pay this new fee?
So assuming my thoughts are true, it would mean the new landlord can't just simply come and remove them from your apartment if you refuse to pay.
Since you are mid-lease, the landlord can't change the rent amount, and the landlord also can't evict you for refusing to allow them to modify the terms of the lease while the agreement is still in place (that would negate its entire purpose). So no, they can't just charge you more rent going forward. It follows that their application of back-charges is also not valid.
