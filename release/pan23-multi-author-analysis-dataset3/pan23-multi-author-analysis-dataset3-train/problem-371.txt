You also won't have any support or connections, which makes getting internships (if you have time) and eventually a job that much more difficult. And finding someone willing to hire you without a JD will be nearly impossible.
So you just gave me some key insight, that being "finding someone willing to hire you without a JD will be nearly impossible". That's really a piece I was missing.
I did ask "a bunch of randos", but my hope is one of those randos has a valuable way to success. If not, I have nothing to lose but internet points and back to square 1 - changing my circumstances to attend law school...
bluntly, you will not become licensed without going to law school. it is nearly impossible on purpose because it's a terrible idea. there are only where one can "read the law" without any law school credits, all of which require finding an attorney who is willing to essentially teach you law school individually for three years instead of working a job that actually pays them money. if you manage to do that and satisfy all the study necessary to take the bar in one of those four states, you'll fine that they have atrociously bar low pass rates (, and ). some states even expressly discourage you from taking this route, "reading law under the supervision of an attorney is not an equivalent alternative to law school for most people who want to practice law.".
