Well, the Constitution is the supreme law, and the Republicans are stuck abiding by the system as a consequence if its structure and functioning. It specifies the basic rules by which, among other things, the Congress functions. Article One is the longest and most detailed part, and it requires the House of Representatives to elect a Speaker in order to even begin functioning as a body or conducting any other business.
I’m not embarrassed in the slightest. This is a critical portion of a political realignment. It’s good to see the system acting in this way. It means that the Constitutional order is stronger than those who sought to destroy it.
It will never be eradicated, but the truth of the matter is that the right-wing radicals are incapable of gaining and wielding power at this point. They blew their best shot six years ago, their coup attempt two years ago failed, their attempt to set up the next coup failed. The system held and strenhened itself and now they are forced to actually compete under it for popular support, which will remain elusive because large majorities are against them.
Just because conservatives and their radical wing is a minority and is trending even more so does not negate the fact that that they wield disproportionate power and are not afraid to use this power to hold on to that power.
