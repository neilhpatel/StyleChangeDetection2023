What's happening is likely the same thing. So instead of giving citizenship right away to people under invasion they're being asked to follow the same process as if they were immigrant or else?!
When applying for Russian citizenship, it's required to renounce your prior citizenship. The process is usually as such:
The catch is that a lot of country will simply not resign your citizenship right away and it's a long process. So what happen is that foreigner obtaining citizenship either do not follow up with the process once their demand for Russian citizenship is sent and they get to keep both citizenship... Russia can't really verify that you have or not citizenship of an other country.
Make the demand to resign your citizenship of your country, then show the demand to resign your citizenship while applying for citizenship of Russia.
Quote: "In Melitopol, the occupiers force the employees of governmental institutions who received Russian citizenship to renounce their Ukrainian citizenship in written form. They threaten to dismiss them otherwise.".
