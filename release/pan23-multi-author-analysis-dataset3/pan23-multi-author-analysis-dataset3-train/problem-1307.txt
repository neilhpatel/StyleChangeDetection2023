Thank you for this fantastic response! I've been studying more on the peoples that populated West Africa and were enslaved and sold. When I read of the large tribes of people that were Muslim I was sure there had to be some evidence of Islam in the colonies from these peoples.
I've read estimates that up to a quarter or even a third of enslaved Africans in what is now the United States were originally from Muslim societies. But their faith was actively, and successfully suppressed, replaced completely by the mid-19th century by forms of Protestantism.
The main secondary source to refer to on the Muslim slave revolts in Bahia is Joao Jose Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia. You might find answers you're seeking there.
There are also several fragments of Qur'ans penned by slaves in the southern United States. Naturally, there were probably many more, but the text was suppressed by slave owners so only a few survive. See Austin, Allan D. (1984). African Muslims in Antebellum America: A Sourcebook .
