When a lawyer is serving as a legislator, there is no general ethical canon that may be imposed merely for voting for an ordinance that is later held to be unconstitutional.
I make room for the possibility that in some egregious case some penalty might be imposed, but I’m talking about something so blatant and offensive to political norms that would be front page news…. city of Whispering Falls reinstated chattel slavery, maybe. No ordinary legislative act would qualify.
The point is: even if you disagree, that's an argument that can be made. It means the law isn't the kind of blatant, shocks the conscience, absurd variance that might possibly trigger some action from the bar against a lawyer that supported it. It's a challenge, and it can be litigated, and that's it. If you dislike the legislator, run against him.
I don't like this guys platform as much as you, however I like even less bold attempts to silence votes of elected officials. If you don't like the way he is voting, vote him out. That's our system.
You can report anything. How they will act on this is another matter. The ordinance isn't illegal until a court says it is, so at this point no breach of ethics exists so I'd highly doubt anything will come of this.
SCOTUS doesn't make laws, it rules on specific laws on whether they comply with state, federal law. So no; it has not already been ruled on by SCOTUS as this is a new law. Sure this law might be ripe for being ruled unconstitutional, but the nuance that exists in this law vs precedent would surely shield an ethics complaint.
