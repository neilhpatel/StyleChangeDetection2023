Borrow the money from someone. If you haven't done drugs in a year, the follicle test will definitively prove that. If you can't afford $300 for a test, you can't afford the kind of litigation it would take to get a new GAL or prove the GAL's recommendation isn't in the best interest of the child.
You can also try to go to court _pro se_ (without a lawyer) to argue your case, but the explanation "I can't afford a follicle test" isn't likely to help you very much. If your kids were removed from your care over issues related to addiction - whether because of your drug use specifically or because of follow-on issues - then the courts are going to want to see evidence you've addressed the problem. Not being able to afford a follicle test also casts your ability to afford supporting and feeding your children into question, although if you have benefits lined up already, that can help.
Ask if they'd be willing to agree to daytime visitation or supervised visitation while you save for the follicle test, so that you can see your kids between now and then.
It's likely they're asking for a follicle test specifically because it'll support that you have actually gotten clean, and is hard to fool by taking a break for a week or so or by using someone else's urine. I expect you are sincere, and that those are not problems _for you_, but your child's lawyer deals daily with parents who would absolutely do those exact things rather than sort out their addiction issues. They have to tread carefully in their client's interest.
