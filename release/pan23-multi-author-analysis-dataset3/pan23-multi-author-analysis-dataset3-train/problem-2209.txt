Ukraine shot the missile, because of Russia's attack. Russia is to ultimately responsible 100% but there was carelessness on Ukraine's part.
EDIT: To clarify since people are DM'ing me that im a bot, I am against Russia's invasion of Ukraine...
The region now-known as Ukraine, was a frontline logistic center in the war against the west, after all.
This is nato & Poland saving face to keep from getting dragged in to war with Russia. Which I’m fine with, but….
I doubt there is any ADA in existence that doesn’t have an automated self destruct mechanism to prevent the missile from coming back down.
It's enough to destroy or fell another flying missile, and prob at \some distance too (I doubt these are basically guided gyro jets and just slam into the intercepted missile).
Anyways, one of the things I saw mentioned about this on reddit is that the particular air defense rocket that hit Poland lacks a self destruction mechanism, I'm assuming that's common nowadays, and allows to remotely destroy a AD rocket if it misses something or goes rogue.
