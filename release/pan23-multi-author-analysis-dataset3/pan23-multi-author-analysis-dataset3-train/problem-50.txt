That is wierd. Usually you can just call and tell them you need to open a new account for your residence, maybe provide proof but that is all. Especially since you are the only one on the lease I feel like you talked to an idiot or maybe they misunderstood.
Like they couldn’t have told me that the last 2 times I called and explained that he was off the lease and I was the only one on?
I’ve tried contacting the power company and explaining to them that he’s been gone for over two months. He’s ignored many of my texts and calls to switch the bill over to my name because he didn’t have me on his account. Each time I bug him enough to message me back about it, he still just never gets it done. But I don’t want to sue the man, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to let him hold out on this bill for whatever god forsaken reason he is. Man will be 30 in 2 months and he’s acting like a fucking baby.
Well I called back up there a bit ago and they told me the same thing so I got a little assholey with them. Like I need my fucking electricity bill, cause I don’t know wtf is going on with his dumb ass. Once I started cussing at them they were like “oh yeah, if you’re the only one on the lease then bring the lease up here during regular business hours and we’ll get that sorted out for you”.
