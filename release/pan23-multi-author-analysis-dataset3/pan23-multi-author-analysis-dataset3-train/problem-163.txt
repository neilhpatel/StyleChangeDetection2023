I thought that if a car is financed you must have full coverage insurance. Once it's paid off you can drop to liability only, but I am confused that a bank financed this loan without requiring full coverage.
That salesman should 100% have known that lenders require full coverage, especially if part of his job involves signing people up for insurance after they've secured financing.
Most lenders do require full coverage, but you're only in breach of the loan if you carry some other policy. You aren't actually insured because of that requirement alone.
That is a very important point to make, and could actually support the proposition that the dealership misrepresented your policy. What did the policy documents say, and were you forcibly prevented from reviewing them in some way beyond the risk the sale would fall through?
If your car was totalled in a collision where another driver was at fault, then you can sue the driver for the remaining value of the vehicle or the cost of the repairs, whichever is less. Given the amount outstanding, you probably want to talk to a lawyer about your options. If you sue the at-fault driver, their (liability) insurance will generally pay out.
Well whatever kind of coverage it's called where the insurance pays for all or most of the damage if the vehicle is totaled in an accident. What label would you use for that?
The salesman very clearly and explicitly told me that if the car was totaled in an accident, that the insurance would pay for it in full, my credit history would show as having a fully paid off car loan, and that I could come back to the dealership and get a new car as a replacement. I was not told that I was being signed up for liability only. I was given the impression that I was being sold full coverage. I think that counts as misrepresentation. Don't you agree?
