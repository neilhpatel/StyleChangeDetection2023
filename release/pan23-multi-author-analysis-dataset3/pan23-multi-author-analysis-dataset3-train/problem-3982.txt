The reasons you've listed are mostly irrelevant to the legal process of evicting a tenant (although no doubt they are distressing).
Yeah, sorry, I wasn't trying to suggest you go down a crazy rabbit hole of more and more ways to serve him with evictions notices to cover every possible circumstance of him playing dumb. More just trying to give a general sense of what some possible excuses he may try to cover himself with if you only went with "just" a text message, or "just" a letter taped to his door.
I'd probably do multiple methods personally. The text could work, but he could also magically "lose" his phone right "before" receiving the text and claim he never saw it. Or the paper taped to his door must have "fallen off" before he got home and he never saw that either.
I figured on taping it to his door and texting him a picture of that, so there’s a record. He claimed not to know about the memorial service either but there are texts from multiple people proving he’s either lying or delusional.
I don’t know what other methods there are, besides putting another copy under his windshield wiper (which would absolutely get his attention, he loves his car more than people and has a camera pointed at it that gives him notifications whenever somebody comes nearby).
