So does leaking fluids on the road have any bearing for responsibility even though that action was as accidental as rear ending someone?
In addition to the police report, the guy who had to come out to clean it up (and didn’t have enough stuff to clean it with him), and a picture I took of the road, there was definitely enough evidence of fluids being on the road. The vehicle was a USPS mail truck that had to be towed away and the officer did go speak to them as well I believe. The only thing lacking is definitive proof/witnesses to say I wasn’t at a safe distance, though the minimal damage to both cars compared to what it could’ve been should speak to that I’d think.
If you have expert witnesses that can attest to that, and also claim that you left enough safe distance that it could be avoided maybe. And you'd need to identify that car and track them down.
You're responsible for maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of you. I'm not sure how you can prove those fluids somehow changes that general duty.
