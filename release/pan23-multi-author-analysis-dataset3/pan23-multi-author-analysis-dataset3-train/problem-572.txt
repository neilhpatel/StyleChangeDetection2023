NAL, but work in a dental office. You need to speak to a lawyer right away. Do you have the paperwork you signed giving consent for work to be done? Or any paperwork stating what work was supposed to be done. Have you called your insurance to talk to them about these claims? It’s a HUGE thing in terms of insurance fraud so your insurance will want to know and maybe help you with where to begin. You should also contact your states dental board and they may be able to help you as well.
Your state likely has a regulatory board that you can file a formal complaint with against the dentist who did the work, as well as the office. there was an anesthesiologist involved, get their info as well. Start making those phone calls next.
I would be surprised if, based on the amount of money charged and billed to insurance, that your insurance doesn't investigate this as a fraud case against the dental office.
Has another dentist confirmed that this work was actually done and that it isn’t an administrative error to be billed for 46 teeth? Do you see 46 caps in your sons mouth?
