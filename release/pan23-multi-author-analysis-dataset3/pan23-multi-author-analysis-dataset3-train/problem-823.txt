as you say about Julius Caesar, his capture, subsequent release and revenge is rather famous. i couldn't find the direct quotes apparently attributed to Julius Caesar, but is it true that it went something like this:
However, I think the most important aspect of this story is what it tells us about the character of Julius Caesar. He laughs at their ransom demands, offering them 50 talents instead of 20 to highlight his importance. He composes speeches and poetry for their betterment and when they failed to understand them he scolds them as illiterate thugs. He usually beats them at their games and jokes with them that he would have them all crucified upon his release. Surprisingly the pirates think this is all in good fun and don't take it seriously. Now when Caesar was released and the local praetor wouldn't act (even after Caesar had already captured them), he has all the outlaws put to death on his own authority. This story indicates something of Caesar's character: arrogant, even from young age, always having an inflated sense of self-importance, and playing loose with laws and regulations; something that would be on full display with his consulship of 59 BCE and his governorship and wars in Gaul, Germany, and Britain.
Let me leave you with this virtual eye-witness account by Diodorus Ciculus, where he describes the lives of slaves trapped working in Roman mines:
As for the quote you provide from Ciculus, I had read that slavery in the mines was particularly brutal, perhaps even exceeding the brutality of plantation slavery. So much so that mining slavery was used as a punishment for crime? Or am I confusing a subset of mines where criminals were punished for the Roman mining industry as a whole?
