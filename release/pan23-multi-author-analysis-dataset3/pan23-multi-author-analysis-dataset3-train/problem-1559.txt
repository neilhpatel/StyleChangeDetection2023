"We've fucked 4 generations of working class families in their stupid fucking faces and the well seems to have slowed up. We're considering maybe slowing down. On paper, anyways.".
Which no one is following. Hence the renewed interest and public Congressional hearings from early 2022 in the wake of pandemic plundering and obvious insider trading.
It's amazing that's it's 2023 and we are just now discussing a potential ban on insider (Congress knows all bills affecting every business) trading. This group of bandits just keeps raping and pillaging the American people.
I would rather have that old man Biden, than to wake up to one more tweet from a Fraudster who tried to overturn the election. He's a fascist. Look up the word is you don't know what it means.
Well I wonder what happened to it because they are all doing it and making millions especially during the pandemic when the rest of the economy was crashing.
Trump was always a Fraudster. If you look back to 2016 and 2015, he was already lying out of his teeth and calling handicapped people and gold star families names. He really hasn't changed. The public just finally woke up after Jan6. But 80 million idiots in this country just voted for him in 2020. How in the hell did so many people not see his shit. I certainly did and never voted for him either time.
