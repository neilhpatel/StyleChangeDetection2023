You can contact the doctor with your concerns and push to modify custody in court. But simply cutting a prescribed medication is not a good choice.
Consent and parenting rights aside, it's not a good idea to just cold-turkey stop a prescribed course of medication. You don't say what this medication is for, but just refusing to continue it could actually be dangerous for the child. Even if it turns out that the medication isn't needed - he shouldn't just stop giving to the kid without confirming with a doctor that it is safe to do so.
However, if you refuse to give the child medication prescribed by a doctor that the doctor feels it is imperative for them to finish, you could risk consequences, yes. This is a spat with the mother. Refusing to give the child prescribed medication is risking harm to the child. If you are seen to be risking harm to the child, especially if your refusal actually DOES result in harm to the child, over a spat with the mother, you could very realistically have your decision making seriously called into question. Refusing to follow the orders of a doctor and risking harm to your child is not going to look great if you then go back to court and argue that you should have MORE of a say over the child's medical decisions.
You can talk to an attorney about bringing your concerns about the mother's actions before the court.
Will that strenhen the mother’s case for being given legal custody on medical issues or at least tie breaker on medical issues in the future? Very possible.
The default on medical care, when coparents can’t agree on a medical decision, is to follow the doctor’s recommendation. Being the parent who defies medical orders is not a great position to be in.
