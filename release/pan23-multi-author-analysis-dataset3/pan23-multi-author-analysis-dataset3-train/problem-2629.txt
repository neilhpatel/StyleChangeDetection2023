the irony is by defunding the IRS the smaller unrecorded incomes like said people from the rural areas are more subject to audit.
This is the reality of defunding the IRS…. I am a divorced working parent and they kept my money in limbo. They can’t even get through their current caseload let alone the wealthy using back door tax codes and cheating as their form of white collar welfare….While people like me sat and waited.
When the Covid stimulus checks went out, someone jacked my SSN and filed as me in the 2019 tax year. Remember that the 2019 tax return due date was moved to the summer of 2020.
It took the IRS 17 months to resolve it. That was 17 months I didn’t get ANY of the stimulus checks, didn’t get my refund from my 2019 or 2020 refunds since I couldn’t file it, and didn’t get the early child tax credit.
When I called once per month for an update, the agents were nasty saying things like, “if I’m talking to you on the phone, I’m not working on your case.” Aholes.
It was sorted out in ten minutes once I finally got an agent on the line, but it took three+ months to get someone on the phone due to staffing issues. It was bad enough for me, I can't imagine what that would have been like for someone who isn't used to writing letters, keeping records, and dealing with bureaucracy.
