Can someone with better knowledge of tanks help me understand what components are breaking here? It seems that the treads had been widened and that was causing them to break, but I'm struggling to understand how it all works- maybe if anyone has any resources for track construction that can clear it up for me? This vehicle is based on the T54 tank, if that helps.
Currently doing some research on Soviet tracked vehicles for a project and my sources are (surprisingly) in Russian. I'm having a few issues translating some terms. The particular tracked vehicle they talk about had a terrible tendency, it seems, to break 'fingers' and throw tracks:
"На этом участке было заменено 490 пальцев и 56 траков. По сравнению с расчетным временем приход на Восток запаздывал на месяц с лишним. Кто мог предвидеть такое количество поломок?".
Thank you so much- I've seen a few different descriptions now on different reports accounts but I was struggling trying to picture how it all worked. They mention broken fingers a lot but also that they'd have to get out every now and then and hammer them back in- maybe as if they were working their way out also? It's not an essential part but it was annoying me not being able to translate it! Thanks again Jon.
Thank you, Jon. I am a master student of International Relations and I have become passionate about military technologies, in particular aircrafts. In order to deepen my knowledge I think I should take at least another MA degree, this time in military history for example...
How can one become a military aviation historian? Is it possible only through self-taught? I noticed that there is not a specific university degree focusing on the history of aviation.
