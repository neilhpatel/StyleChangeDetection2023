Cannot imagine Bobo exhibiting this level of magnanimity and principles. I don't think she's physically an/or mentally capable. If she had lost that idiot would be on FN right now yelling about bullshit mail-in ballots and broken voting machines.
The only thing that boggles my mind is how someone this crude, nasty and moronic can garner enough votes to win any election.
That happens in a lot of lopsided districts, and that's what MAKES them lopsided -- not the actual breakdown of voters in the district, but \who shows up\. Convince people that they have no shot no matter what, and they figure, why bother.
Also, now the potential Dem voters in her district know they CAN win. Prior to this result, a lot of them likely thought it was more lopsided in favor of GOP voters than it actually is, and that they had no shot; so many might have stayed home.
I think what this person is talking about is that a lot of Democratic voters in that distract may have sat out, thinking that the district was so overwhelmingly red that they had no chance of changing the outcome. So they may have literally stayed home and not voted. Here's hoping that the closeness of this race showed them that their vote would have mattered after all -- and they \should\ show up next time.
"The likelihood of this recount changing more than a handful of votes is very small. Very, very small. It'd be disingenuous and unethical for us or any other group to continue to raise false hope and encourage fundraising for a recount," Frisch said. "Colorado elections are safe, accurate, and secure. Please save your money for your groceries, your rent, your children, and for other important causes and organizations. I just got off the phone with Rep. Boebert. I called her to formally concede this election.".
