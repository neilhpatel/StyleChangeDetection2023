I don't smoke pot (nor do I ever plan to) but it's nuts it's on the same level as cocaine and heroin in terms of treatment under the Controller Substances Act.
I'll also note medical use of marijuana also prohibits firearms ownership. I don't think potheads are any worse than alcoholics, and you can still own a firearm as an alcoholic.
Well if domestic abusers can have guns I don't see why marijuana users can't. The law was probably put in place by people who know more black people have been convicted of marijuana possession.
On Thursday, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited that decision in declaring unconstitutional a federal law barring people under domestic violence restraining orders from owning firearms.".
Yes. Whenever you buy a gun you fill out form 4473, one of the questions is “are you an addict or user of an illicit substance”, several years ago a note was added to clarify that yes this includes MJ users in states where it is legal at the state level. Lying on that form is a felony.
Well yeah you shouldn’t use a gun while high, just like you shouldn’t touch one while you’re drinking.
Waiting for them to propose people using alcohol to be banned from owning guns; let alone using them. Probably 20x more deaths from people using alcohol and guns. 🇺🇸🗽⚖️🏡🗳🌍.
