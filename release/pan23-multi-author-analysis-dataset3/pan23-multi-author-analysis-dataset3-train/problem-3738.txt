And many Israelis support settlements on Palestinian land, theft of land, theft of water and resources and oppressing Palestinians.
Yes, and Israel wants this status quo to continue, since every Palestinian attack is an excuse for a massively disproportionate reprisal. Israel has, in Hamas, essentially created a self-perpetuating justification for taking more and more of Palestine.
Unless the US government suddenly decides to grow a conscience on the matter and stops unconditionally protecting Israel against international sanctions, the inevitable conclusion to the Israel/Palestine situation is the end of Palestine.
It'll cost them the lives of a few innocent Israelis - but if you tally up those lives against the number of innocents countries are normally willing to expend to conquer territories by conventional means then Israel is virtually picking up Palestine from the bargain basket.
Unfortunaly its not as simple as just don't do anything violent, and some favourable settlement will be afforded to palestinians by the international community.
If the Palestinians ever wise up to the power of peaceful protest, chances are they could force a favorable settlement out of Israel within in a decade or so (especially in today's political climate). But as long as they keep murdering civilians it's only a question of tile until Israel irreversibly annexes all of its claimed territories.
He makes a very good point, and if you ask me, has a more thorough understanding on the situation than most - even if he doesn't do a very good job of articulating it.
