Oh, the authorities in Iran have been very close attention to the Sunni clerics in their country since the current government was founded. Especially since if any revolt ever did happen, it would be Sunni clerics with connections to Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Sunni majority countries that started and fund it.
Saudi Arabia pays people to shit on Iran online while boosting Saudi (and by extension, their brand of Sunni Islam). It's the online front of the Islamic Civil War that's being going on for over a thousand years.
Shi'ites have spent the last 1400 years being persecuted by Sunni Muslims. As such, they have a slightly different perspective to Sunni Muslims when it comes to things like minority rights - given Shi'ites have been a persecuted minority since the Islamic schism.
Worth noting with headline this is from Sunni cleric they’re a minority in Iran and often discriminated against and taking part in protests.
Iran being Shia is due to politics not persecution. It was turned into a Shia state from a Sunni state by a former Sunni (particularly from a Sufi sect) to move the Persian empire away from Ottoman influence. It had nothing to do with minority rights. The Iranian conversion only happened 500 years ago, not during the schism - Shia Islam has deeper historic roots in Iraq, not Iran. You’re also naive about minority rights in Iran, considering these current protests were a response to the killing of a Kurdish woman, Kurds being predominantly Sunni. The current protests are significantly driven by Kurdish alienation given their religious and racial differences with Persians.
