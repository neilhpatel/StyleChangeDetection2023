I suppose the superstition may partly explain why almost all rope is lain that way, however. It's certainly handy to choose one direction and make it a standard, so that sailors always know which way to coil the rope. It might as well be "with the sun.".
Yeah. I think most observers of a dance would be either on a level or above the dancefloor though! And the lead is definitely moving to the left in the corners. As I say though, these are relatively recent, so maybe the superstition had waned, at least in the section of society that was into waltzing.
Some of these superstitions haven't entirely died out either. When I first started working on ship, the older deckhands would get upset if I was coiling rope counterclockwise. When I asked for an explanation of why it was wrong, I was told that it was because you shouldn't go against the sun. Until this post I had no idea that this superstition was bigger than just sailors coiling rope. Especially because I did eventually figure out the real reason I needed to coil the rope clockwise - the strands in almost all rope is right-hand lay, so coiling clockwise keeps them tight.
