The Federal Government is permitted to put reasonable requirements on continued employment with the Agency. In most cases after one year of employment with the Federal Government you have a "property interest" in your job and are entitled to due process before you are removed, but that doesn't mean that the Government cannot impose vaccine requirements. Vaccine requirements have been upheld for over 100 years. There may be questions as to if the requirement for private employers is valid, there are not similar questions with regards to the requirement for federal employees. You can and will be terminated if you do not prove your vaccine status.
You asked if you can be terminated for this. You can. And it can blow up your pension and benefits should you decide this is your hill to die on.
And I know of federal employees who were removed the same day for disruptive or dangerous behavior. What's your point?
Yes, you said that. Just no one believes you as requiring vaccinations in the workplace is nothing new and has been common in a variety of industries for decades.
They're saying that requiring vaccines (or other reasonable personal protection health precautions) is something that has been "A thing" for some time now. So, your worry that this is a "slippery slope" (my term, not yours, but was trying to capture your sentiment) is outweighed by the long term precedence.
