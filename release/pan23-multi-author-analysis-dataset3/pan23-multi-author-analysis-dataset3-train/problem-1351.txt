The spending bills have contributed to inflation and consumer prices...which they have. The Job creation was due to people going back to work after the covid shut downs. And the reduction in the deficit was due to ending emergency covid relief spending.
With the Infrastructure act, Inflation Reduction act, etc. ...It prolongs economic recovery, increases taxes and consumer prices on the middle and working class. There are still trillions of dollars the Fed has to reduce the money supply by that they increased for the pandemic.
And It does not have anything in it that is extremely biased or inaccurate. People seem to be just taking issue with the source being 'Fox News,' and the fact that it is critical of Biden.
Justin, your thoughts on Fox News hosts continuing to push election fraud claims on air when we now know that they knew it was all bullshit?
Besides, Fox News just got publicly outed for knowing they were pushing lies... why would anyone view anything they claim with any level of credibility or journalistic integrity...?
“FoxNews.com” should not be pointing out anything to do with lies. I can already feel the ridiculous bias coming from this article without opening it.
