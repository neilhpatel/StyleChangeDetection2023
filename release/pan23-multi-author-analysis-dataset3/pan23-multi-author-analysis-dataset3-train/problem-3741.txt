NAL, I work for a psychiatrist and deal with prescriptions every day. This does happen sometimes, pharmacists make mistakes at work sometimes just like everyone else — not saying it’s OK, but it’s more likely than theft IMO. They’re being difficult about addressing it because it’s a common issue for people with scripts for controlled substances to try to get more than they are prescribed.
The best course of action is to call your psychiatrist and ask them to deal with this for you. This actually happened with one of my boss’ patients last week, and my boss just had to call the pharmacy and sort it out. Definitely have your prescriber try to fix this as a first course of action.
Ask the pharmacy if any other prescriptions for the same medication was filled at the same time. I actually received more of a schedule 2 prescription than I was supposed to receive because of that. Yes I contacted the pharmacy. I actually was bringing the prescription back at the same time the person that got shorted showed up. He had a weird bottle but his label and I had a weird bottle with my label. Same pills, different amounts. This is going to be very hard to figure out on camera. But they know what prescriptions they processed on that day.
Verify your prescription on the outside of the bottle as well. I've been given a partial fill due to shortages in the pharmacy. It was noted on the bottle as a partial.
If it's a partial, you should see a count on your bottle. Probably to the left of the name of the script. It's gonna show the count on every bottle, so you can just verify that the bottle says 60, or if it gives a different number (35 in your case). You want to count your pills, ALL of your pills, while at the pharmacy going forward. And advise your friends, co=workers, strangers, EVERYONE, to count their pills before moving from the counter. It slows the pharmacy down a LOT, and they lose business this way. You might be surprised at how few mistakes are made in the future.
