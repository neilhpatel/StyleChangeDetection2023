Do you have a pharmacist that you could ask? Maybe you can transfer the substances to another container from a pharmacy to then have them dispose of it?
Also pharmacy’s may have a drug disposal container- it depends on the pharmacy. It’s always best to call ahead and ask.
It’s actually fire departments. They do drug collection/ disposal. You can cal them (non 911 and ask for info about it). Taking it to the police could make an issue depending on who is on duty and department policy- they make have to file a report and whatnot. My husband is a former peace officer who’s license is still current/ he has an associates in Fire Science (at one point was aiming to be an arson investigator, decided to start a business when I was injured).
(I worked in a pharmacy for several years, am certified as a technician, and have intractable pain from a spinal injury- so the trifecta of first hand information).
To destroy a medication you can dissolve it/ mix it with hydrogen peroxide in its container or another regular pill container that seals with a childproof cap that you would get from the pharmacy. Any pharmacy that operates near a pain management clinic should do this, look for non chain pharmacies. They have to have drug disposal for their own damaged product/ do t have a corporate hub to send it to.
