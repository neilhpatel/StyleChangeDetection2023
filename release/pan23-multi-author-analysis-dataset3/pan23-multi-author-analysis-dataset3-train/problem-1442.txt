Most of the aid for the recent invasion really only came online after it was clear Ukraine was actually _holding_ since thanks to the numbers above, people were assuming Ukraine was gonna fold like wet tissue paper and the west would have to support guerilla/resistance movements. for So the aid doesn't really directly affect air force comparisons.
That's understating it. The budget for Russia's air force is larger than that for the _entirety_ of the Ukranian military, as in all branches, combined. And they were supposed to have a 5:1 air advantage. There's a reason why people where completely flabbergasted at them being unable to achieve air superiority with that overmatch.
As mentioned before, the weapons really only came in weeks after the Feb invasion since everyone was expecting said air force and conventional mismatch to flatten everything and it'd be a guerilla resistance. Also the West has specifically _not_ been providing any jets, and mostly land stuff the air force should be able to blowup, since that's the point of an air force.
yes, neither side is capable of gaining air superiority, and so far air power has had pretty low impact to the war overall.
They might as well fly ww2 planes and carpet bomb it would be far more effective then leaving your pilots open to SAMS.
we can joke about the biplane but it can absolutely still fill a military job by being able to haul a decent amount of cargo in and out of sharif rough runways. I’d imagine ideally you could use them to supply FOBs when ground transport is not able to keep up and when you don’t have HElOs in the area as an option.
