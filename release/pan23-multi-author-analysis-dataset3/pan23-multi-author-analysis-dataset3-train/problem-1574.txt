What is that West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Wisconsin? Plus Jacky Rosen in Nevada? And Sinema's independent plan for vote siphoning here in Arizona? Damn, I hate to say it but Dems will need some kind of fucking miracle to retain Senate control in 2024.
That’s the big problem with the filibuster, it stop people from voting No. see everyone talks about how it’s stops the yes. But the No vote is just as valid and provable as a yes.
Ohh damn that’s literally says Justice in the law….that means it 100% is intended to mean the SCOTUS Justices.
It sucks, but there's no way to punish Clarence Thomas or any other SCOTUS judge for not recusing themselves when they obviously should. Our system is built on the assumption that the people involved in the government all have scruples and morals and ethics, and it really isn't equipped to deal with it when they don't. Our whole democracy is basically a gentleman's agreement, but that's pretty worthless if people don't voluntarily play by the rules.
Supreme Court judges have no code of ethics they're required to adhere to, so it's just a theoretical abuse of power really. But beyond that, the only way to punish a SCOTUS judge is by impeachment, which requires a majority vote in the House, and then removal which requires 67 votes in the Senate. Even if the Dems could impeach him before they lose their majority in a couple weeks, there is zero chance that 17 Republican Senators would decide to remove a conservative judge from the court, thus opening a seat for Biden to fill, knocking down their advantage from 6-3 to 5-4.
However, currently the country is pretty evenly divided, and that's why it's basically a game of maintaining the status quo, with minor changes if any. Neither party can really effect change without a strong mandate from the people, and as such we currently have razor thin majorities in both houses of Congress, and a fairly even split of governorships.
