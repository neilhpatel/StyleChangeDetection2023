Most banks won't cash checks older than 90-180 days anyway, so I don't think closing the account is an issue, and you won't get in trouble for a bad check. If he wants the money from you at this point, he's going to have to come to you for a new check.
So the only issue is you still owe him the money. At least until the statute of limitations on that (probably breach of contract, which is 4 years in TX) has passed, I would keep that money available to pay him if he turns up.
You still owe him the money, so hold onto it, at least until the statute of limitations for breach of contract has passed. Given the passage of time, closing the account isn't a problem.
Checks don't expire. However, the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in some form or another in many states, does say that bank are not obligated to pay a check presented more than 6 months after its date, but that they can. Most banks consider 6 months old stale dated, and so they either will refuse to negotiate the check or may require additional measures.
Personal checks expire after 6 months so no bank would even be able to try to cash it or anything like that so you’re safe from getting into any trouble for writing a bad check or anything like that. If you want to be extra cautious, keep some sort of documentation that proves the amount the check was written for was in the bank for at least 6 months from the date of the check.
Gave you tried googling his name? He may have passed away and you might be able to find an obituary. It’s also possible he lost or forgot about the check.
In terms of if he ever tries to reach out to you and asks for the money I’m really not sure if you would be on the hook for it or not.
