Ladies, stop using apps like this! Use a regular old-fashioned calendar if you have to. These lunatics are gonna get their hands on this info and use it against you. Stop using these damn apps.
Honestly, you shouldn’t use those apps at all. They’re not covered by HIPAA and I can’t think of one app company that I would actually trust with any private health data that might get me prosecuted.
When will we accept that what we put into our phones via apps is no longer "private"; aside from information protected by HIPPA Laws through our health care providers.
It's about period tracking apps on phones, which are not protected by HIPAA. If the phone is seized under warrant (and unlocked), all apps/files can be searched. The proposal created a specific exclusion for menstrual data.
Practically speaking, it's not any different than if you had a notebook seized under warrant where you did period tracking by pen. HIPAA doesn't apply because it's not protected records from a healthcare provider, just personal stuff that the owner decided to record.
