What I wouldn't give to see just 6 Republicans just say "fuck it" and cast a vote for Jeffries. I mean, it won't happen, but the thought makes me so happy.
I like that idea too, but in reality it probably won't happen. While Liz would still kinda suck for a number of reasons at least it would probably prevent an endless chain of Biden impeachment hearings and allow stuff like budgets and funding for existing programs to move forward. So basically nothing new would likely happen unless it had strong support by both parties, but the stuff already passed could continue and our government would remain functional. Also since she wouldn't have a constituency to pander to, it would allow her to play a moderator role. I think it's the best thing the democrats could hope for.
Ya that's my general opinion as well. Democrats should pull a fast one and nominate a republican that they could deal with who is more moderate and put their support entirely behind them in the hope they can split the GOP. It would likely prevent a bunch of Biden impeachment hearings fuckery. It would also likely allow the debt ceiling and budgets to move forward.
