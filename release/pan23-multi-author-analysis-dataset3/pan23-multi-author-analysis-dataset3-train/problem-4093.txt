Like I said, “terrifying bastards.” I just would have cracked the barest of smiles as one of them approached to finish me with a bayonet after they decimated my line with cannon.
“Heh, got mittens Hahaha Anyone else seeing this? Fuck…nobody else here speaks English. Damnit. Ooof That fucking hurt” [I proceed to die, Mona Lisa smile frozen on my lips.].
Yup. The literal presidential palace of Chechnya. It’s in a wooded area and so they were in the wood parts but as the camera pans you can see the top corner of his house.
The Chechens fighting for Russia are Kadyrov’s stooges. They make tiktok videos of them ‘fighting’ in Ukraine to show how dangerous they are but it’s generally shooting at empty buildings. Multiple times he has claimed he was at the front fighting in Ukraine but you can clearly see his house in the background of the video.
Best part is, when the Kadyrovites were actually in Ukraine, their nonstop TikTok videos got them geolocated, and they were hammered with artillery and died in mass.
Also reminds me of the Chechen who was live-streaming and go hit with a Ukrainian artillery while live.
Edit: it looks like it’s still disputed, so much going on looks like i fell prey to the fog of war. His name is/was Magomed Tushayev.
