In addition due to aforementioned good relations with both sides, India has served as something as an intermediary for the West and Russia since the war started.
India hasn't really played such a role yet since there's been no negotiations but would make a lot of sense as we have good relations with both the West and Russia.
Along those same lines, India should completely put aside all of its qualms with Pakistan and simply cooperate with them Give them the land they claim as theirs and call it a day In the same overly-simplistic way, Russia should agree to engage in non-facetious and genuine diplomacy with Ukraine.
Seems like Russia would need to make significant concessions to convince a country as powerful as the US to come to the table on a conflict they pointedly are barely involved in.
Nobody that matters wants Ukraine to put down their weapons. Some people with big mouths but no power to broker any deal think that giving bits of Ukraine to Russia is a solution.
Talks, if it happens between Russia and Ukraine would "ideally" be between those two. But in reality, I don't see how that can happen given US has blocked Russian money, Russia would want US on the talks as well.
Not to forget that Indian population is about 4 times that of US. SO effective budget per capita is 48 times less.
