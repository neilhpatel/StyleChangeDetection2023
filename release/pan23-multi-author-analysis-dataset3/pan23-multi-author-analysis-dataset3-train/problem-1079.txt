Personally, I would call the local public health department ASAP and ask them to inspect the property to see whether they consider it habitable. If they find significant mold or otherwise believe that the property isn't habitable, they'll tell your sister to vacate and the landlord will likely be forced to either house her in a different unit, pay for her to stay in a hotel, or allow her to break her lease.
IANAL. Your sister would probably benefit from a consultation with a local attorney who handles landlord/tenant issues.
2) The landlord is partially right, renters insurance will probably cover her property like furniture, electronics, etc. If she files a claim, be as specific as possible in describing each item. Writing "TV" will let them find the cheapest TV on their list and pay her that. Writing "42 inch LED TV of Brand X" will get closer to the real value. The renters insurance may try to go after the landlord or his insurance, but that doesn't concern you. Let them sort it out between themselves.
1) Read her lease. It may allow the agreement to be broken if the property becomes unlivable. It may say she can get a hotel room until the property is fixed. If the landlord has an empty apartment available, that can be an alternative as well.
4) Utility bills. Unfortunately, unless the landlord is paying the water and she's paying him back at some fixed rate there's not much to do here. She can try calling the water company, sometimes they have some flexibility, or a program to assist people who can't pay for incidents like this.
5) Insist that the landlord repair the ceiling. Mold is probably not a concern yet, but if the ceiling is sagging, it should be replaced. Depending on how long the repair takes, she might be entitled to stay in a hotel on the landlord's dime until it's done.
