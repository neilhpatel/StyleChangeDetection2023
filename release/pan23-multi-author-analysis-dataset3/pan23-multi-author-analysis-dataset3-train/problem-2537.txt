Is it very fucked up. Because Russia has the capability to destroy the entire planet, we essentially have to play by 'their rules'. No attacking their territory, but they can bomb the fuck out of Ukraine's.
The problem here is ukraine using western weapons to do this. If ukraine used their own weapons to attack russian territory, that's just normal war. Nukes won't be used. But if NATO weapons are striking inside russia, that changes the whole attitude and perception.
NATO isn't running out of weapons any time soon, we're just running out of the weapon types we were sending so far. We'll just send bigger stuff eventually, if Russia keeps shooting civilians.
Now NATO is thinking about sending the actually modern stuff that's still in production to Ukraine. There are much bigger stockpiles of that stuff since it's in active use all across NATO. That would be yet another big boost to Ukraine's combat power.
NATO is hesitating to send that for multiple reasons. One being that it escalates the fight and might cause Russia to actually use nukes, but also there is the risk of modern weapon systems getting into the hands of Russia, who so far only have equipment that is even worse than NATO's obsolete, 20 year old gear.
