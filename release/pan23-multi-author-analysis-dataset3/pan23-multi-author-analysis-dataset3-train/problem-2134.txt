For real, it is to show NK that they are actively confrontational with Japan so that NK will keep supporting them in the Ukrainian war. It really is that sad for Russia now.
This sounds like a dumb move from Russia. Japan isnt planning on taking the Kuril Island so soon. Theyre gonna wait until Russia lost the war, Putin is gone, multiple parties fighting for power, the economy imploded, the country in chaos, everyone is fed up and depressed and nobody wants another war.
A canary trap is a method for exposing an information leak by giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of several suspects and seeing which version gets leaked. It could be one false statement, to see whether sensitive information gets out to other people as well. Special attention is paid to the quality of the prose of the unique language, in the hopes that the suspect will repeat it verbatim in the leak, thereby identifying the version of the document.
Thats the moment to take the Kuril Island. Now Russia is just deploying weapons where it is not needed and could be better used in Crimea and Donbas.
