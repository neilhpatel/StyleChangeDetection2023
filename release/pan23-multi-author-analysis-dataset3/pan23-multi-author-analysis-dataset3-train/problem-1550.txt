Thanks for your reply. I had the same thought since they can still access that area from the main road. In my opinion, there is absolutely no reason they need to build that far back. If they do, they should expect additional costs associated for that distance and shouldn't expect me to give them access through my property.
I may look into an attorney as you mentioned. I also live in a subdivision with an HOA, so they may be able to help out in denying access since they wouldn't want someone who doesn't live in the neighborhood using it as their driveway.
That is correct. There is currently no vehicle pathway from the main road to where they want to build the home. My cul-de-sac is pretty quiet, so if I granted them that easement then my property would have all the construction vehicle coming through it.
Also consider if you did grant them an easement would that mean that the construction vehicles can use it during the building of the house? If so no amount of money would really be worth that disruption....
