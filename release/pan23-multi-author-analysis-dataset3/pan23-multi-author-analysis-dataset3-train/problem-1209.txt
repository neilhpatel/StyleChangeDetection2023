Likely what the attorney meant is that it is more difficult in Texas to succeed in medical malpractice cases. They have laws (note: I do not practice in texas and am not a medical malpractice attorney) that cap damages for victims and make it difficult to proceed in the first place.
I would not wait and would google plaintiffs attorneys in your area who takes only medical malpractice cases—they’re more likely to know what they’re doing. Good luck!
Edit to add: some County hospitals do have sovereign immunity in certain states. Most doctors in hospitals are classified as independent contractors—therefore they are not employees of the hospital and can still be sued. The doctor and his group will have their own medical malpractice coverage separate from the hospital. But this is a question for the attorney you consult.
Hijacking the top comment to say I’m a medical malpractice attorney, but not in Texas. I would certainly talk to an attorney sooner rather than later and would NOT wait until the child starts to develop the injury. Although the statute of limitations for the child may be longer, personal injury statute of limitations in Texas is two years.
I handle all the wrongful birth and baby cases at my firm. These cases are litigated for, on average, two years. I see plenty of cases filed while the child is young and records regarding the child’s progress are added into the record as the case proceeds.
