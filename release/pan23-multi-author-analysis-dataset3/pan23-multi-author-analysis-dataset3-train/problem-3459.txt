“He said an actuary from New York testified to the workgroup that a single-payer system could save the state a billion dollars a year.
As outlined in the workgroup’s report, the plan would eliminate deductibles, co-pays, co-insurance, and other out-of-pocket costs. It would decouple health insurance from a person’s place of employment, allowing people to keep their health plan and doctors.”.
Insurance company and hospital lawyers and lobbyists putting pen to paper and dollars into politicians’ pockets. But don’t be dissuaded, Oregon. It took 20 years for Congress to enact government health insurance for senior citizens after Harry Truman had proposed it. Let’s aim for 2 years for Oregon.
I'm in Oregon. Medicaid pays me the least. I have to spend more staff time complying with hoop jumping administrative bullshit from Medicaid than I do from any other payers.
No offense, but if you're mixing up Medicare and Medicaid, I don't know that I can take on faith that this would all be more efficient with just a single payer. I run my business. I know what these things cost me and how much I get paid from different payers.
More than I pay now to deal with insurance. Medicaid pays far less than anything else and costs us far more administrative time per patient than any insurance plan.
