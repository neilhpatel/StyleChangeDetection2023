Because again, that would harm the US economy and Democrats don’t want to look bad going into 2024. The majority of Americans don’t give a shit about unions really, they only care about living their day to day lives. In this case the majority of railway unions support the new deal, it’s only the minority holding out. The railway companies have agreed to a very noticeable pay increase of like 25%. If the majority of the unions agree, and the railway companies agree, I just don’t think it’s right to try to please everyone in this case.
Why don't they take the position of forcing the railway companies to comply with the demands of the Unions?
It's partly why the ACA wasn't universal healthcare, for example. Because the minority party still dictates the actions of the majority.
And rejected by the majority of members. A majority of unions, but the majority of union members (the large unions) rejected that deal.
And also, per the agreement between these unions, if one votes to strike, all must strike. Difference here is, it’s not one of twelve, its a third of the unions, who represent over half the workers.
