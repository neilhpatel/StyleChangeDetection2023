The best way to answer this question is simply to go chronologically through the eschatological views of each era.
3. Augustine’s City of God is a good work to bring up because it deals directly with the issue of whether the decline of Rome means the fall of Christianity. The answer Augustine gives is essentially that it doesn’t, that Christianity and the Catholic Church will outlive the Empire. I don’t think that the time period between state religion and the fall of Rome necessarily contained the entire transformation of the eschatology of the whole Western Church. My point was that it was the beginning of the end of a pervasive apocalyptic view. After the Fall of Rome, the Church largely took its place in terms of political power Western Europe. There were still theological controversies, yes, but since the church was no longer persecuted but the one in power, the debate about the end of the world did not center on or hold as a central tenet, the speed with which it would come.
All of this history is contested, debated, and of course given theological significance by various groups (including my own) but the one thing it is not is boring.
