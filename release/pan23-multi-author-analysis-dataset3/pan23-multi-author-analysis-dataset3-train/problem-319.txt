No, OP is worried about being given an unknown drug substance without their consent and about the consequences of reporting this illegal act.
It's quite common for products sold as CBD to contain THC. For example, here's an article describing that an FDA study found that half of products sold as CBD actually contain THC:
If you thought you were getting CBD candy, They aren't regulated or tested and commonly contain THC.
So anyway, just saying that I'm not buying that this person bought 35mg THC candy and didn't know it had that much THC in it and didn't know that they shouldn't give to anyone else.
(IMNAL - just sharing my weed experience/knowledge) I have a medical marijuana card and had to sign a form at the dispensary which states that it's against the law to give or share anything I purchase there with anyone else. I'm not sure what the laws are in Florida, but usually medical cannabis is for the patient who is certified only. Any CBD with that much THC in it would likely need MM certification to purchase. Most legal CBD items that don't require such certification have just trace amounts of THC which most people don't get high from.
It is unlikely to get enough THC in your system from a legally produced CBD product. My clients at work drug test weekly and of the 15 or so on CBD not a single one has ever tested positive. This is important because you did have a reaction to something. Take a picture of the package for reference.
