The federal district court believes the federal government doesn't allow him to reinstate an elected official. He's called on the governor to reinstate him.
Thats what I meant earlier when I was saying something unconstitutional isn't necessarily illegal. You end up with stuff like this. Because there is no legal relief to give because no legislature has written a law that punishes officials for acting unconstitutionally.
“But the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from awarding declaratory or injunctive relief of the kind at issue against a state official based only on a violation of state law.”.
This, however, is a violation of a federal law (the 1st Amendment), and therefore the judge should have jurisdiction to remedy the situation.
I get his argument but the judge ruled he is breaking federal law, which is the 1st amendment. Federal law supersedes all state law, it is just that a lot of federal law lets states rule as they see fit (such as marijuana).
No, he didn’t rule that what the governor did was legal, the judge ruled that it was outside federal court jurisdiction and has to be decided by state court.
No, the judge is saying in the ruling it’s outside his jurisdiction. Anybody can sue in federal court and part of the initial process of that is deciding if the court has jurisdiction.
And to answer the second question, anybody can sue in federal court, part of the process the court follows is then deciding if they actually have jurisdiction to let it go to trial.
No, the federal court is saying that it’s outside federal court jurisdiction. They’re not saying anything about whether a state court could reinstate him.
No, the suspension was unlawful but that court cant reinstate him. What deathsantis did was throw away lawful votes and overrule the will of the people. He is a fascist with ZERO respect for the constitution or democracy.
