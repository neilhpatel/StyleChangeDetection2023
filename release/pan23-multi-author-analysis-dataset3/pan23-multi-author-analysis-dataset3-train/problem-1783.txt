Until the day of travel the ticketing agent is generally responsible for handing any customer service issues with a ticket that they sold under industry norms, however, an airline can "take over" an agency-issued ticket. There's not really a legal obligation to provide good customer service though.
That will affect your next steps -- if you want a refund you will have to work with Priceline or go nuclear and try the credit card chargeback approach (which may cause Priceline to refuse to do business with you in the future...not that you should). If you are in a state where travel agents are regulated (e.g. for California the California Seller of Travel [CST] program) you can try filing a complaint through those frameworks.
In this sense the only real harm from waiting is that seats on your preferred flights might be booked before they get around to automatically fixing them for you.
What is your ultimate goal? To get rebooked on different flights on your day of travel or for a refund?
The ultimate goal is to still travel the same days and not end up having to pay any kind of cancellation fee / difference in price for a new flight.
