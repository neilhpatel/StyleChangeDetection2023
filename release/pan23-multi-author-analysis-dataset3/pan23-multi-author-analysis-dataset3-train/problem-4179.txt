Small claims, bro. As a lawyer, I can tell you, that a judge can (and often will) award the max damages in small claims even if itâ€™s over 500-1000 bucks - just because they understand what a waste of time it is for the plaintiff.
Again, I am a law school student so I wanna sue, and this is an easy case, and I told her I would pay for a lawyer if it costs her any money solely out of principle, but she is hesitant lol.
She told them "I want my money or I am going to sue" and they said "Youre not the first person that has threatened to sue us".
Ya, she is looking elsewhere for work right now, and the labor board complaint is our first go-to, so that was great advice. THere was also someone who said she works for the state of TN here in health insurance compliance and gave some references for places to report that deal with EXACTLY this, so we will be filing complaints there as well.
That's what I told her. They would almost certainly settle this, and if they didn't, a judge would probably award hefty punitive damages. So, again, they would settle lol.
