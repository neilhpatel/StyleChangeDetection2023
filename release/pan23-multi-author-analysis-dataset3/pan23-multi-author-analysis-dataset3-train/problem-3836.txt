I have 35 years experience in dealing with a person who is clinically diagnosed ( 18 years ago) with schizophrenia, narcissistic personality disorder, and bipolar. I raised him. I saw the transformation. I saw the expressions in his art and homework, his language and mannerisms, and his decision making process. I think I can say it.
Sure it is. The only reason that that isn’t where we are is because people keep voting for politicians like Walker, and because the media flat out won’t do its job and expose how obviously unqualified they are.
What the media does wrong with candidates like them is when they report on these obviously disqualifying scandals and inadequacies, and then go forward like they’re still a serious candidate.
Surely a Senate candidate should be easily able to handle that challenge, right? One of the 100 people who get to be in arguably the most powerful branch of government, maybe should be able to hold his own in a debate, alone.
Being able to hold your own in a debate is an incredibly minor thing that elected officials should be able to do. If he can’t do that, what makes him qualified to hold public office, much less take the job from someone who has shown that they can do the job?
