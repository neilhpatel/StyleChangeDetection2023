He did call a random guy a pedophile with no proof once upon a time. It's just back then he was busy running companies people believed in that he bought after they already had a successful plan and good people in place. Now he's running Twitter into the ground and people are shocked to find out he kinda sucks at running companies.
At Twitter, there is no management layer steering the ship, it's just him, and so far he's a disaster. The only way to make his management look competent is to claim he's purposely trying to tank the company. I think the simplest explanation, that he's out of his depth, is the most likely.
There's no grand strategy at play here, this is the first company in over 15 years Musk has run by himself. Tesla and Space-X have strong senior management layers that know how to manage up to Musk, and also how to shield their teams from his excesses.
Elon Musk is a chode. When he was still fighting to get put of buying Twitter, his main angle of attack was that Twitter was flooded with bots, more than was disclosed.
That is the only way to stand against and combat this bullshit, make Twitter irrelevant like the alt-right Twitter clones. When the rest of us allow the platform to drown in obscurity, their power is non-existent.
Don't give advertisers a reason to slink back to Twitter and fund this bullshit, don't allow the money to flow and allow this jackass to dig himself out of the $44B hole.
Why do people equate money with intelligence or morals…he has money and that’s where it should end…he has no right to tell anyone anything…twitter is doomed.
