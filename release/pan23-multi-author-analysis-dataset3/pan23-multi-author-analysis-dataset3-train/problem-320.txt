Certainly in the secondary literature I've looked at, Albert's De animalibus is not associated with Ibn Rushd.
Is there any chance that Albert had interactions with someone who may have known Ibn Rushd's work, or is it more likely that it was entirely independent on his part?
William of Conches, while tutoring the future English king Henry II between 1146 and 1149 produced Dragmaticon Philosophiae, an influential work in the world of medieval science. In it he argued (following Galen) against Aristotle's "One Seed" theory and emphasised that physical pleasure was necessary for conception. However, and here he is either following the 2nd century CE Greek physician Soranus through some unknown chain of transmission or has coincidentally arrived at the same conclusion, William also allowed that while a woman might not "assent with her rational will", her "natural" body might nonetheless experience pleasure and allow her to conceive.
This distinction should have argued against the idea that if a woman falls pregnant she has actually consented, as should the complete refutation of the idea that a woman needed to experience pleasure to conceive by Ibn Rušd (Averroës), but late 13th century and early 14th century law codes seem to have latched onto the idea that pleasure was necessary for conception and could only occur if the woman was consenting.
On the other hand, it's clear from Ibn Rušd's investigations that at least in the Islamic world many women were well aware that you could become pregnant without experiencing physical pleasure, whether within a marriage or as a result of what was considered rape, and it's entirely possible that this was known to experienced midwives or other women who were involved in rape cases. Unfortunately, due to a lack of sources, this isn't something we can ever know with any degree of certainty.
Though I'm sure an answer with a closer look at those sources would be fascinating too, I can't find anything more specific.
