You can probably ask, and even do your own bed search by calling the intake departments of other psych facilities. But in the end, an ER is going to have to send your daughter to a reasonable placement to get her out of the ER and into proper care. There is only so much you can do at this point. I know this is hard. I've personally seen it happen. I would suggest working with the psych hospital staff, being cooperative, asking questions, and reading all the paperwork they give you. Let them know you will probably want a transfer and ask them to help with that. Not all places with bad reviews are as bad as they sound. Most people do NOT have good things to say about being sent to a psych hospital.
NAL, online reviews are bad for psych hospitals because they are hospitals for patients with severe mental health issues who are forced to stay there.
This is especially true for psychiatric hospitals. I work at one and many, many patients who leave us are still mentally unwell and convinced we were poisoning them, misdiagnosed them, locked them up illegally... Others were unhappy about stuff like having to share a room with someone who snored or got up to pee a lot at night.
Not saying this place can't possibly be legitimately bad, but it is in your daughter's best interest right now to be in a safe place, and you won't help her by making a big deal out of this and possibly delaying her transfer.
