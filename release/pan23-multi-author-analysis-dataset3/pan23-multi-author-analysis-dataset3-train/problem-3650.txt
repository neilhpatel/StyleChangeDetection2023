i am on the lease as an occupant. i took the notice to the leasing office as soon as i got it and they had no idea what it was and said that it would have been done through the magistrates office. Can i just dip if i’m an occupant though? i’m pretty sure i read that it meant i have no legal obligation to pay rent anyways.
If you name is on the lease, you're legally obligated to pay the rent just as much as anyone else on the lease is.
If you are on the lease from the landlord your roommates can't kick you out. The only person who can evict you is the landlord by going to court in front of a judge and the judge telling you that you have to move out. If you signed a lease with the landlord you need to contact them so they know you have left because you are still responsible for rent and any damage until the end of the lease if your name is on it. So if they trash the place you are still partial responsible. Also make sure no utilities like the internet are in your name. Even if you are not living there any bills run up in your name are your responsibility.
