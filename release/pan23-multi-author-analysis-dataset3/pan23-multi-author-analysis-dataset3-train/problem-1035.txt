I believe Diamond also argues "beasts of burden" allowed early cultures to develop more efficient agricultural practices, right? I remember a long and monotonous chapter of various grains and their availability as well. I understand that by definition these are not geographical factors, but surely they are related to the point of directly impacting each other. Certain grains/animals acclimated to certain geographies, etc. Is this an example of Diamond taking the conclusion and finding points to support it?
So that's why Diamond's way of applying theory has issues. But as I said, there's more to it than just that. There's also the added problem that Diamond tends to theorize about culture using patterns of theorizing which are simply obsolete. We have a mounting pile of evidence to suggest that societies do not operate in a fashion consistent with the assumptions that Diamond bases his theories on. This is because Diamond fundamentally struggles to understand a lot of the more recent (say, last fifty years) developments in social theory.
Diamond seems to ignore that many of these societies weren't conquered until a good four centuries after the supposedly-indomitable Europeans made contact. The Mapuche held until the late 1800s, and the same period in the American West was defined by Indian Wars until the last free tribes were relocated and subjugated in Indian Territory.
