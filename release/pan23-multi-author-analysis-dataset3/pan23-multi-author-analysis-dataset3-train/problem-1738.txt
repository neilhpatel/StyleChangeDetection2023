Depends on soil and ground water conditions. Peat that dries out sinks a lot, for instance. But for the most part, on human timescales, most of the ground is really pretty stable. Until you start mining, fracking, extracting gas, etc, anyway.
Re: British cemeteries: I’m sure they’re a little higher than the surrounding area, but they don’t really cover very large extents of lands. Here in the Netherlands, as well as most of continental Europe, we remove older burials after a certain period of time.
The Prague Jewish Cemetery is a good if very atypical case study. They had a fixed (and way too small, as the community grew) area of land, they don’t remove old burials for religious reasons, and they had to keep bringing in new soil to have room to do new burials. The ground level is literally a dozen meters higher than an the street next to it (it’s one hell of a retaining wall).
While the ground level of the Old Jewish Cemetery is higher than the street, it is more like 4 meters, far from 12 (dozen).
