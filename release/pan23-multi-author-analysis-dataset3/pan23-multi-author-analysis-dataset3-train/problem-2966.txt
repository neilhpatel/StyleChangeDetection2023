1.	⁠Why would russia bomb nordstream? Answer: because they wanted to. Why they might want to is another question we can come back to.
Great question. Let’s take a look at what you are saying. I’ll answer your questions and then examine your argument.
Fact: Russia was already at the time decreasing their outflows in natural gas - which you say makes no sense because it hurts them.
Let’s assume the typical pro-rus argument of forcing Germany to sever oil ties with Russia and have them import US natural gas.
counterpoint for the sake of argument: Russia blew up the pipeline in order to punish Germany, hoping the pain of losing access to gas would force them to stop supporting Ukraine in order to keep NS2.
One last time: Now in a hypothetical scenario where Germany desperately needs gas they will need to approve Nord Stream 2 and grovel to Putin to turn it on. And because there is now only one pipe Russia can turn it off again with semi-credible claims of technical issues whenever they want to create instant leverage in the future and that's only possible because there is no longer any back-stop.
