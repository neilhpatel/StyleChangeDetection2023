Israel is a girl that has her sugar daddy (US) on one side, and her lover (Russia) she has a hot and cold relationship with.
People don't want to admit Russia is close to Israel. I don't mind the down votes. Russian is the 3rd most spoken language in Israel, after Hebrew and Arabic, and before English.
Yes, things have changed quickly. The world is picking sides, but some are taking a "wait and see" approach, some are playing both sides. But the actions of a country define it. I hope Israel is able to join the "western world".
So we're worried about a proxy war with Russia in Syria might turn into ww3 but we're fighting a proxy war in Ukraine against Russia with NATO and top western weapons?
Hmm I suppose the trade off between a proxy war of Russia/Israel and Russia/NATO becomes moot once NATO actually gets involved (new as of the past few months). Russia has been fanning threats of using their Nukes, so that is ultimately the deciding factor of when a world war starts. If NATO involvement drives Russia nuclear, then the status quo of the Middle East is thrown and Israel would join with NATO forces. In my view.
