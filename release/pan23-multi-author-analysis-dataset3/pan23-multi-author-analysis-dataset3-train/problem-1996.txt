Title: Bank of America ATM ate my non BoA debit card, they told me they "destroyed" the card, but 3 new charges were attempted today.
The bank never issued a block on my card, I just turned it off once the card was taken by the machine, so its impossible that the ATM held it because it was blocked.
It is also possible that the machine ate your card because fraud had already been detected on your account and the machine was instructed by your bank to not return the card.
It is also possible that your car was cloned weeks or months ago and the coincidentally started using it right after the ATM ate your card.
Unfortunately there is really no way to prove that Bank of America made an error that lead to the unauthorized usage on your account. So you really have no cause for legal action against Bank of America. I would however recommend taking this as a lesson in depending on one single form of payment and get a backup credit card and keep it locked up at home. That way if you lose your ally card or it gets stolen you can still function while waiting for the new card to arrive.
What you are saying is someone cloned my card prior to this, and just so happened to wait until the day after I lost the card to attempt a charge, and it was just a coincidence that my card was lost.
