One suggestion - secure any and all paperwork (vehicle title/registration, home deed if there is one, bank information, valuables, etc.) away from his former home, preferably in a safety deposit box at a bank, or in a storage facility that no one else knows about.
I'd also recommend requesting multiple copies of his death certificate (probably 8-10 depending on how big the estate is) - you'll need those to cancel utilities and throughout the probate process.
Ultimately, you cannot prevent them from claiming the insurance benefit if they are the named beneficiary, and they can just obtain a copy of the death certificate from the county/state themselves if need be.
Remember that when acting as executor, it is not personal. You have a responsibility to carry out the duties of that office. You may or may not have a duty to provide a copy of that death certificate, but going out of your way to make things more difficult for them is unnecessary--no matter how shitty the people you're dealing with are, don't be shitty yourself.
That's their option, if they are the named beneficiaries. Life insurance bypasses the estate and goes directly to the beneficiary, who may use the money for whatever they wish. Note that it is possible they are NOT the beneficiary. If you know who the insurance carrier is, you should be able to contact them to determine who the rightful beneficiary is.
Life insurance goes to the beneficiary and it not part of someone’s estate. The beneficiary is not required to give this money to anyone. The estate would be responsible for burial expenses. Death certificates are requested from county or state vital records and you will not need to provide them with a copy.
I know that some require the original death certificate but I know also some say a copy will suffice. I’ve requested 4 to start. I’m sure I will have to get more.
