"Two Jewish guys from Odesa meet up. One asks the other: ‘So what’s the situation? What are people saying?'”.
Sure. There is the nuclear threat. However realistically if Russia launches a nuclear weapon, they will be obliterated within 14min by joint strikes. Nuclear winter is not a genuine concept, the reality is small 14km regions may be uninhabitable for a few years. The probable use case for nuclear weapons would be dirty bombs for area of denial, as that’s Russian doctrine.
However the idea of a Russian force being capable of moving through Europe is clearly laughable. They can’t make it through one minor country. And past Ukraine there is a defensive force that’s orders of magnitude stronger, who’ve been diligently trained for decades on defensive and defeat of the specific hardware the Russians are still using.
When I was training in the military strategy, I was shown exactly how powerful NATO rated the Russian capabilities. As a S put it, our jobs were to slow the Russian assault by clogging up the tank treads with our corpses.
