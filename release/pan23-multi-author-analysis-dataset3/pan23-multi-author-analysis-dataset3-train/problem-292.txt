Under California law, based on what you wrote, you were. There are only 4-5 states where you'd have a fighting chance, and that fighting chance would still be in court. But my opinion of your negligence isn't important. What is important are two indisputable facts: a man was seriously injured in your store, and now attorneys are demanding money from you for compensation. Without insurance you will need to hire an attorney (at least consult with one to reply to the letter, don't try that yourself or you could make things worse) and hope that they cannot pierce the corporate veil so to speak. (Are you incorporated and do you have clean separation between business and personal?).
Even "scummy" lawyers often have solid, legitimate cases. You were negligent. (What if a kid had touched it and died.) Let your insurance handle it. The level of liability will depend on your exact location but in most places you would probably be liable. You shouldn't respond. Let your insurance handle it.
Preferably with your insurance. Since you've made the horrifying choice to not have a policy for your business (which you should be rectifying immediately) with your own attorney who can negotiate a settlement for this.
