Morton, and Ethel Waters all performed in mob country. Again: treatment of performers was generally good, as long they didn't stray over the loyalty line (and if carnage was afoot, they kept performing).
To return to the essential point: Al Capone really did seem to care for African-Americans, and it is unlikely in the midst of a multi-day party anyone would have been abusive to the guest against his wishes. This quote supposedly from Capone himself is second-hand as told to his brother, but fairly plausible based on Capone's other actions:
That final point from Capone's brother is the first thing that popped into my mind. Italian mobs were born from a need to tackle success in a country that tended to push put "the other" from mainstream success. Irish, Italian, black, at one point or another saw each other with more commonality than they had with mainstream "white" America.
Yes it’s only “recently” that Italians were considered main stream white and if they were Sicilian they were treated even lower than mainland Italians.
