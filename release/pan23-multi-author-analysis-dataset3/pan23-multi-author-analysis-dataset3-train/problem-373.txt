Not sure why you attached prop to the word gun, since by common definition it means a replica. The legal equivalent would be a replica gun.
This is a gun on a movie set. It should never have been filled with live rounds in the first place. That’s why you literally hire someone - the armorer - to make sure these type of things do not occur. In my opinion the blame falls squarely on that person.
Even if true, I still think the absolute majority of the blame is on the armorer considering it’s their literal job to prevent this type of tragedy from happening.
Sorry, I agree that this is a failure on the armorer's part 100%, but as I understood it he knew full well they had real fire arms on set and still chose to ignore basic gun safety. There are a few thing no one gets to be lazy on. Lock me in a room with no live rounds within 20 miles of the spot and I still should not dick around with pointing a gun at someone. It was negligent, but criminally negligent? That is beyond my judgment. I just think anyone, actor or otherwise, who will be handling a firearm should always treat basic safety as the Word of God at all times.
