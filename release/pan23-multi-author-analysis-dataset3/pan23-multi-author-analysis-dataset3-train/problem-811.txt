The intent is to very slowly empty the house out of your property. Start with the "under the bed" and "bottom of the closet" stuff. You want to move out the things she is not going to notice.
Go rent a small storage locker. Uhaul has them for example. Then buy boxes and packing material and store it in the storage locker.
Then everyday when you go to work take a couple of things with you. You drop them off at the storage locker. Every couple of days when you have enough, you pack up another box in the locker. Start by picking things that fit into what ever bag you carry with you to work. If possible start with your important legal documents: birth certificates, social security cards, passports.
Start planning for end of lease, because you are moving out at the end of the lease. Because you are breaking up with this bundle of crazy.
You want to be able to empty the house out quietly and thoroughly. In the mean time, find a new apartment that starts the day your current lease ends and rent it without her. So when you move out on the day your lease ends, she is not your problem anymore. You finish packing up your stuff and leave. How she deals with the landlord is not your problem.
Is your name on the lease? What's to stop you from leaving? Also stop all the extras you are paying for. Hire a moving company to move you out. Have a friend over to record her actions.
