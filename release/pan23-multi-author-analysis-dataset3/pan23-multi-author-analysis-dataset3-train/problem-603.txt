Theoretically, yes. If by some miracle six Republicans found their spine and decided that dealing with a Democrat speaker was preferable to kowtowing to extremists then it could happen.
I think some other Republican member will come out as a compromise candidate and convince them to give in, probably by threatening to give some concessions to the Democrats if they don't.
To be fair though in the past, Democrats enabled them to keep doing so by intervening/compromising/attempting to make a deal... If the Democrats remain united, perhaps the least bad option actually appears.
It's the best realistic outcome for the Democrats in this, aside from the self-inflicted damage the GOP's doing with every passing vote.
If the government is in crisis the people responsible for it are not the Democrats and they should absolutely NOT try to save the Republicans from themselves.
Every single time Democrats have bailed out the Republican party from their dysfunction they have been stabbed in the back for their trouble. This is the Republican parties fault, it's their mess and they are responsible for it. The Democrats have enabled them for too long, whether or not it's uncomfortable it's the truth. The Republican party got addicted to dysfunction and the Democrats enabled their addiction by covering for them, compromising with them etc... All they have gotten for their efforts is backstabbing and lies.
That's out of the question because the Republicans have stopped doing anything remotely close to compromising or helping Democrats. They're trying to out-Trump Trump currently and purging anyone not sufficiently crazy enough.
