It says "models predicting". That is a "mathematical model" created by virologists not the swimsuit kind of model.
5000 per day multiplied by 365 days is 1,825,000. The prediction is that the Chinese situation will not stay quite like this all year long. The prediction is also "bad year".
I think this is a bad take. Even right now the vaccines we have arenâ€™t keeping up with it in the west. This is why there remains a race to continuously find the next vaccine to protect against the next variant. And variants are coming up faster than we can produce, test, and distribute a vaccine.
Which is why there should have been 1) more focus in obtaining vaccines from China and from all over the world and 2) more focus on people getting the vaccine.
They had several years to vaccinate and perform clinic trials for their vaccine and foreign alternatives theres no real excuse for this. They used a vaccine with poor efficiency just because it was made by their government and are paying the price.
I am sorry, but even my country did a better job with vaccines, staggered shutdowns/quarentine. We are in the 5th shot of the vaccine for elder people, and the vaccine rate is stabilizing to be one per year, as it should be normally with the flu.
We have chinese vaccines and we have mixed them with western vaccine and the results are even better.
