It’s clear to them Trump isn’t the way anymore. If they do go against Trump, which they most likely will, it’s because they are desperate for moderate votes, not because they gained a conscience.
Then again, his voters are lemmings who do what they’re told by him and Fox, so if it’s not OKed by either of them, I doubt the GOP will buck the trend.
Republicans will do what they’ve always done - look at a 10 % chance of him winning and burning down the country if he runs vs a 100 percent chance of him burning down their party if he doesn’t and … you know the rest.
Idk man, I think the real issue for Republicans is that enough of their voters have already flip-flopped to Democrat (either in their registration or just by voting for Biden and other democrats). As a former Republican myself, do you have any idea how much of a clusterfuck a Republican candidate has to be for ANY conservatives to actually change their stance? And I can tell you if they flip flopped because of trump, they certainly aren't coming back for him.
I literally called it two weeks ago that the democrats were going to do very well in the midterms, while everyone else on this subreddit was just straight doom and gloom about it. You have to realize that even though there are still a shit ton of Republican voters, enough of them have disowned that party because of just how mindbogglingly hateful, stupid, and culty it has become. Biden will run again in 2024 and will win, there just aren't enough crazies anymore (even though they're loud af).
