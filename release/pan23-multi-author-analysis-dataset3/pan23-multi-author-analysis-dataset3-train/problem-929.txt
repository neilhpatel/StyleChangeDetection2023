Your location REALLY matters on this. What also matters is whether the ticket you received is still having any effects on you, like remaining points on your driving history, increased insurance premiums, etc. Finally, it matters whether in your location the ticket was a criminal charge or civil infraction.
Assuming the ticket IS still having an effect AND you think it is worth the effort AND the type of offense has rules that permit it, you MAY be able to ask the court to give you relief from the prior judgment based on newly discovered evidence. If I was in your position, I would emphasize how you discovered the existence of the recording and get an affidavit from the stylist to submit to the court, along with a copy of the recording and email to the police.
The concept is called "standing" and if OP is not still suffering harm, the point is "moot" and a court will not consider any new arguments.
1) If there was a legal judgement on this matter then you could potentially review any open proceedings and have things reversed with new evidence. You'll definitely need to ensure there is some custody of the evidence and how you came by it and have that video documented. If this was a judgement in court then you have new evidence. If this was just a cop at the scene then there is less to overturn but also not a true judgement but more of what the insurance companies agreed on. Something to think about.
First off NAL. 3 things here to think about. Any legal judgement, insurance changes, legal liability.
