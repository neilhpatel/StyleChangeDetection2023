Wax candles in Europe go back to the ancient Romans. While oil lamps were the more common form of lighting in the olive-oil-using Mediterranean world, the Romans used candles as well, both made tallow and with wax. Wax candles were preferred for their higher quality, and also for use in religious rituals (leading, e.g., to wax candles being common Saturnalia gifts). From this, the Roman Catholic Church appears to have inherited a preference for wax candles for ritual use, already in place in the late 4th century if not earlier.
No. That post mentions honey prices in 14th century England, and the introduction of cane sugar (not honey) by the Arabs.
You seem to forget one more important product from the honey in the Early Middle Ages: Mead. Since The so-called 'mead hall culture' was prevalent in North-Western Europe in the Early Middle Ages, I cannot agree to your suggestion that the technology of bee-keeping had been lost after the collapse of Western Roman Empire.
I hope that the examples of Gildas and Aldhelm would be suffice for you to dismiss the total died out of beekeeping practice in post-Roman Western Europe until the incursion of the Arabs in the early 8th century.
