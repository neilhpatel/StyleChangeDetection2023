BUT it's not good! Children really shouldn't be working, and those immigrants are just being abused and will cause a problem down the line.
What happens if we allow more immigrants for cheap labor? Well those companies don't need to rise wages so those jobs still remain low paying and those immigrants while probably better off then in the original country are sill poor, meaning it increases the amount of poverty, while also allowing companies to keep wages the same.
Those jobs aren't getting people because of low wages, both child and immigrants were don't care about that since well kids don't realize the value of the dollar and those immigrants a lot of them are earning more then from their home countries.
There are 2 million fewer people than jobs currently and the people pushing child labor are anti-immigration, so...
Just wait for the next phase of arguments: "Those kids need those jobs to keep their families out of poverty! If we take them away now it'll devastate the economy. You don't want Two-finger Timmy's sacrifice to mean nothing now, do you?".
I did see him there a few more times. But haven't been going to tbell lately due to sky rocketing costs.
I saw a child at my local taco bell serving the drive through window. I had to do a double take as I was totally caught off guard. He was polite and seemed like he had his mind in the right place but man, kids should be out being kids.
