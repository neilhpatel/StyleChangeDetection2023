Japan has also been modernizing their army over basically all of Abe's rule and that is being continued by the new PM. They're not spending as much as the Russians, but they are most likely much more effective in that spending.
“They’re not spending as much as the Russians, but they are most likely much more effective in that spending.”.
Ya, I think Japan’s spending might be just slightlyyyy better than the corrupt-to-its-core quasi fascist state that is Russia where lying, obfuscation, stealing, and selling equipment is the norm.
If russia would've been stupid enough to go fuck around with Japan of all places I'm pretty confident, and I can't believe I'm writing this, it would've been an even bigger disaster for them than this current clusterfuck is.
Yeah I have no doubt Japan even without an ally fighting alongside them would stomp Russia, considering how bad they're doing in Ukraine...where they have land links and even hold territory since 2014, it's absolutely ridiculous how atrocious their logistics are.
Japan is ranked top 5 in the world for military strenh, but then again Russia is like 3 and we saw how that went!
Ukraine is close - they can drive to it within hours, they already held Ukrainian territory since 2014 and they still monumentally fucked up the logistics and are losing territory every day.
