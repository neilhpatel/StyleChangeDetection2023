The only immediately reasonable explanation I can think of is if your second month of rent will be prorated, and the employee isn't understanding your question or explaining it properly? Landlords generally require the first month of rent up front at lease signing. The company I worked for "couldn't" prorate that month, but would prorate the second month of rent that was due from the tenants. IE: A tenant moves in on September 18th, pays 1 full month of rent up front to take the unit off the market, and only pays a prorated amount on October 1st.
NAL, but worked in accounting for a large property management company. Is the landlord refusing move-in until the 18th, or are you unable to move in until the 18th for personal reasons? What does your lease state as your start date?
Most leases I’ve seen are pretty explicit stating what’s due when. But of course there’s no real standard, so I can’t comment on yours specifically.
I think it would depend specifically on the wording of the lease. I don’t believe there’s anything in general contract or landlord/tenant law that specifically discussed prorated rent, so it could be allowed or disallowed based on the lease wording.
