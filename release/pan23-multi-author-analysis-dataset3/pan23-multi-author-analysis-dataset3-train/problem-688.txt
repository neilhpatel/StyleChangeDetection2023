The collapse of the soviet union ended educational programs to train government officials. Putin has brought potential leaders(that haven't fled) into his clique or they jumped out the window backwards over the last 20 years.
It’s true that Putin himself doesn’t place himself in the tradition of Kremlin leaders, and instead claims Tsarist ambitions. The paper he wrote in 2020 that spells out his pseudo-historical claims for Ukraine as a part of greater Kyivan Rus’ proved that nonsense.
Our problem is with Putin, sure, but it won’t be solved while nationalist Russian culture shapes the Kremlin the way it is.
We can only hope that one of the moderates like Sobyanin, who is himself no angel, is able to end up in control as opposed to any of the siloviki. Especially since it’s their policies that got Russia into such a mess and they’re currently losing all credibility.
Btw, I am not trying to excuse Russia, but it's important to realize that the world can't make the same mistake with them, and help them get through the crisis after hopefully Putin gets ousted. Similar to what was done with Nazi Germany with denazification + Marshall plan, otherwise, another Putin will rise eventually.
Honestly very similar tactic to what happened to Hitler, and basically what Ukraine is doing to Russia now.
