I don't think you can change the title. If you follow the news about Iran you won't be asking this question.
Because Iran is not the same as Islamic Republic. Islamic republic is the government and Iran a historic nation. The Islamic Republic of Iran excuted the person not Iran. Do you see the difference?
It is a very very important distinction. Do not honor these monsters with the ancient and powerful word of Iran. They are not Iran, they are her soon to be gone occupiers.
Autocratic regimes often brand themselves with names that do not represent who they are for this exact reason - so people mistake attacks on them as an attack on Islam and they can cry prejudice and Islamaphobia.
Iran is a country full of Muslims. They are the ones protesting this regime. The IR abuse the world Islam as justification for their evil. They are not Muslims, they do not care about Muslims, and they do not represent Muslims.
The Islamic Republic has nothing to do with Islam. North Korea’s official name is Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Denouncing them has nothing to do with denouncing democracy.
A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet and the Islamic Republic by any other name would smell just as foul.
