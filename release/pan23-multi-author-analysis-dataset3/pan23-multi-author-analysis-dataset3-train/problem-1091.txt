Your school administrators are mandatory reporters, and if you're not going to school and your sister isn't either, they're likely mandated to report that to CPS.
CPS might disagree or might find that your parents have the situation handled (which it sounds like they did), but that doesn't mean the school was wrong for reporting a situation that did genuinely exist. From a mandated reporter and liability perspective, the school probably felt (reasonably) that their hands were tied. It's very possible the school has an internal policy where there is a number of absences above which the school automatically notifies CPS to make sure all bases are covered.
That probably has to do with mandated reporting. There is significant liability to a mandated reporter if they fail to report a situation, especially a documented one. At a certain point, the school probably felt that they needed to report this situation to CPS in order to protect themselves and reduce their liability.
The laws err on the side of caution and require schools to report anything that might be an issue to let CPS investigate and determine if there is anything going on. The school reporting a legitimate situation, CPS investigating, and CPS making the determination that your parents have the situation handled is in fact how we want things to work because it's far better than situations not being reported at all.
