My analogy did not ever mention about an annual meeting or the involvement of a nonprofit. My analogy simply illustrated that I as an individual was denied admission by an agent contracted by the township and that did not make it a matter between me and the agent but it was a matter between me and the township.
Unless the factors I presented above are present, the township has no reason to involve itself in the civil dispute that your having with the Ad company. So, I suggest you focus your efforts on getting your money back from the Ad company. You can potentially explore the 1st amendment issue, but it would likely be a difficult and time consuming process.
Depending on the terms of your contract and the specific reason provided by the Ad company will determine what recourse you will have with them. It is very likely that the township does not really have any involvement with the ad company, beyond providing "space" for the ads.
I would guess that the agreement between the township and the ad company is- Ad company pays the township for ad space and then they sell that ad space to you. They might have terms that are set by the township on what they can or cant display (lewd or disturbing conduct, local business only, etc.), but otherwise the decision of what specific ad is there is up to the Ad company.
