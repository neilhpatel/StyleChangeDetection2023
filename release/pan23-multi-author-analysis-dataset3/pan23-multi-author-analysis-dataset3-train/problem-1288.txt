And the wired lights in the rear are certainly legal as they are not on all the time, just when you use the switch. Many work vehicles have rear facing white lights to assist in connecting or disconnecting trailers at night or low light conditions and do not violate any part of the vehicle code so long as they do not stay on while operating on a highway.
No, you have no liability, regardless of the reverse lights thing. The apparent cause of that person's crash was a combination of unsafe speed, unsafe speed for road conditions and weather conditions and failure to properly maintain the lane of traffic by going around you in an area not designated for passing.
However, that'd likely be a separate matter, as from your description, your lights were probably not a direct cause of the accident; the driver's ill-conceived attempt to make a dangerous pass was the primary cause.
Your reverse light setup might be illegal in Texas; it's likely a violation of Texas Transportation Code ยง 547.332:
Texas is a modified comparative fault state, so if a plaintiff is deemed more than 50% at fault for their own injuries, they can't recover any compensation from the other party or parties involved. Based on your description of the events, it's very unlikely the other driver would be found less than 50% at fault for their accident, so their chances of recovering anything from you are very slim.
