IMO if you invested in crypto you deserved the lesson in bull economies. Speculative intangible assets are going to burn you alive the moment that recession flags go up.
What I do know is that it's the exchanges which need regulation and that the governments job isn't to safeguard specific investments(read, specific crypto currencies).
Maybe they are arguing that individual currencies shouldn't be regulated (I agree), maybe they are arguing that the govt may back crypto with something akin to an FDIC (wildly unrealistic).
I think it was clear to the institutional investors that money was being made in crypto but they couldn't see how and the staying power suggested that it was more than a decentralized ponzi scheme (spoiler alert, that's all it is) so they didn't want to miss out. Neumann kinda similarly rode the wave of popularity that uber and air bnb were seeing. SBF had real returns and a respectable net worth before seeking funds from institutional investors.
It's kinda like what happened with Adam Neumann, completely fucked up business plan meets enough investment capital to make it look like its working meets fomo meets mysterious up and coming outsider who plays by his own rules. SBF made a boatload of crypto on his own day trading because no one who came up in the world of arbitrage in the 80's was in crypto and no one in crypto had bothered to open a text book on the history of business. SBF knew what the right things to say were because he had been raised in the world of finance (his parents are the right age to have been young and impressionable when arbitrage was the new hotness) so he looked like the least bad option for institutional investors to get in on crypto.
