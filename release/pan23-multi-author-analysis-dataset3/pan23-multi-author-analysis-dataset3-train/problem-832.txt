You posted the exact same question about a month ago. Why do you expect the response to have changed? It just looks like you’re looking for an outlet to bash unions. If your employer actually wanted to give you those extra benefits, they would have negotiate to include them with the union. Don’t you think your employer has an incentive to discourage you from unionising? Once the union is gone, those ‘perks’ are going to disappear.
The state is not forcing you to be a member of a union. You are free to leave the union and seek employment somewhere else. Think of the union at your job like a uniform. There is no law that say’s you have to wear a specific uniform but your employer will fire you if you don’t.
You have the freedom to seek employment elsewhere. No one is making you stay in the union. Quit and get fired. Your employer has decided they’d rather keep union members than have you not in a union.
So my employer freely decided that they wanted the union yet you claim they are actively encouraging us to vote to disband the very union that they wanted?
There’s no reason to offer better benefits to non union employees when the union has zero chance of ever being disbanded because its existence and forced membership is mandated by the state?
Why would my employer have an incentive to discourage unionizing when it’s literally illegal for union members to leave the union?
Your employer doesn’t like the fact that the union has a strong negotiating power so is encouraging people to get it disbanded. Once that happens you can say bye bye to any of your prior incentives because nothing prevents your employer from sacking anyone who complains.
