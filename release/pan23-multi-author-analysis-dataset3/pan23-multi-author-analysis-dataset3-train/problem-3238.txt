Yeah US intervention in Iran right now wouldn't exactly be the start of World War 3 but it would certainly move us closer. It would solidify Iran and Moscow's relationship and add to already brewing nuclear tensions.
Some people believe it does, and you should stop trying to convince them otherwise, because it's not kind. You may not be religious, but you also may not understand why people believe, so let them have their prayers please.
Most of the current regimes in the Middle East are corrupt as hell, and structured around a complete bastardization of Islam. Iran was on a path to becoming a happy, wealthy modern nation in the early-mid 20th century. Now it's an authoritarian shithole run by a theocracy that's allied with our biggest enemy. That's mostly the world's major empires' intelligence agencies' fault, from what I've read. Too much messing around, too many "special military operations.".
I just hope the Iranian government is weak enough that it won't be able to suppress dissent much longer.
No one is going to help the Iranian people who are protesting. The government is going to crush these protests. The Iranian death squads are shooting the women in their body parts and I don’t mean arms and legs. I mean these scumbags are brutally killing them.
Iran gets a kick out of torturing people to death. They’re not trying to get any information. They just got a couple assholes who love blood and guts and love to hurt people running the show.
