Agree, but when Democrats are pointing out the hypocrisy of the GOP, they are appealing to the Independent voters that can be reason with, not the GOP.
While I tend to agree that I know very few people who go down the ballot and pick half GOP and half Dems anymore, there's a fair number of moderate-leaning-GOP people who have been paying attention and are now moderate-leaning-DEM (I have family like this). But the moment the GOP rids itself of MAGA they could flip back, so dems need to keep the spotlight on the hypocrisy and bad behavior.
It’s so hypocritical and honestly painful to watch these baffoons hold power in the House of Representatives.
Half of them are probably getting their information through right-wing media, which probably only shows the clips of republicans shrieking about having their Twitter accounts banned….
Meanwhile democrats were quick to point out what a waste of time it is, a waste of resources, and the fact that Russian election interference through social media propaganda campaigns actually aided Trump and other conservatives.
They were also asking really leading questions which were impossible to answer, and pressuring/rushing the witnesses to answer immediately with either a “yes or no.”.
