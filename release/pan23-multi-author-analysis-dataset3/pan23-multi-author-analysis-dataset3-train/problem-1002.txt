You can keep harassing the police or you can hire a private investigator and take it to civil court. But the police might not be in a huge hurry to help a person who abandoned his car for months after being evicted.
Sounds like you just took off and left your property behind. If you were evicted and have a court order eviction then you have 15 days to remove said property or they can put items up for public auction.
But the landlord went through the eviction process so there is a court order saying op loses right to property if he doesn't remove it from the apartment by a certain date.
If the landlord went through eviction process, got a court order then ops car turns into abandoned property after the date op is supposed to vacate. Also their is a paper trial of the eviction process and the landlord has evidence that he contacted op and directly informed him of this process that most likely the cops have looked at.
Unless you made a deal with the property to allow you to store your car there while you did not have a contract with them. According to Utah the car was abandoned property once the term of your contract was over. The landlord has to store the property for 15 days and it is the tenants responsibility contact the landlord and retrieve their belongings. After the 15 days the tenant surrenders rights to said property and the landlord can do what they want with the property including take possession of it.
I thought that after 15 days the vehicle is considered abandoned property and the landlord has the right to either dispose of it or sell it to recoup any outstanding amounts owed?
If you were evicted and abandoned personal property at your apartment - could they sell that property to recoup losses due to your lease being broken? Why did you leave your car at a property where you no longer resided instead of putting it into storage?
