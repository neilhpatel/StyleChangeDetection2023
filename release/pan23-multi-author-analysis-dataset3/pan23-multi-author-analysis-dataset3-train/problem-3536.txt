I don't see much of a 180. China has always been singing this song. À la "Ukraine's territorial integrity must be respected, but NATO should stay out of the conflict and let Ukraine and Russia solve the conflict at the negotiation table", yadda yadda.
>One Year Into Ukraine War, China Says Sending Weapons Will Not Bring Peace Sitting on the fence and watching Russia abuse it's power to murder, terrorize and torture its neighbors is the best option for peace...
I don't think it's paranoia to think China was watching the world's reaction to Russia invading Ukraine, due to Chinese desire to crush Taiwan's sovereignty.
China thinks Russia was provoked by NATO and this war is Russia trying to defend its sphere of influence.
Up until 2017, the US and China shared intel on tracking and hunting down ETIM Uyghurs active in Syria. Basically China told the US where they are, and the US bombed them to bits.
China doesn’t have a timetable for Taiwan invasion. More importantly China’s army/navy is too weak for that. Hence status quo is preferred.
Wahhabism sponsored by Saudi Arabia radicalized a lot of ppl in Afghanistan / Iraq / Xinjiang throughout the 1980s-2000s.
