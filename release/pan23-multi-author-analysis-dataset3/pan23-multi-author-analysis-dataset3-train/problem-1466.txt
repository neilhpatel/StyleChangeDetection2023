Yes, that isn’t the issue tho. The issue is that original salary letter stated $4500 as the going monthly rate, and that was incorrect. Yet didn’t notify me about this until March. I stated that I don’t care about the prorating, it’s the not communicating this and allowing me to sign a contract on faulty salary information.
Not so much “agree” as I “understand why” they would prorate my salary. My underlying issue is the lack of communication regarding this change and being offered an incorrect amount in the first place. Like, i assume a competent HR person would be knowledgable of the districts pay policies.
Not under the impression that I would be making 54k for half the year, but at least making the going monthly rate for someone with the same experience and education.
Were you under the impression you were going to be paid 54k for working the second half of the school year?
Which (again, if I'm still understanding this) said "Gross Annual Salary: $54,600." If the contract was for 12 months, and the contract also said $54,600 then you may be owed something. But to be clear, you agree you getting paid the correct amount of money, but your issue is that it is being spread over 8 months not 6?
So it appears that the biggest issue here is not the amount that you are being paid but how many months you will be paid. It sounds like their years run for the school year, September through August. Did they ever say that their pay years were not September through August?
