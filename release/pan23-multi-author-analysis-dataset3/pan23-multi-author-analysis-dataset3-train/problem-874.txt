A general "duty to aid" or "duty to rescue" only exists in a small number of places that aren't California.
There is a context-dependent "duty to aid" that only applies to persons whose actions placed or contributed to placing the victim in peril. The classic example are hiking partners when one gets hurt; abandoning them in the wilderness is negligent because you have a duty to them created by your joint endeavor.
Their fraternal relationship and OP's past assistance do not create any sort of guardianship duty, or indicate that OP placed his brother in peril.
If OP had stolen his brother's alcohol supply and actively prevented him from getting more, or from getting to a hospital, there would be an argument that OP had placed his brother in peril.
You are under no obligation to fund or fuel your brother's addiction, in fact you probably shouldn't be enabling him.
If he shows up and appears to be in medical distress offer to take him to the hospital depending on the situation, your relationship with your brother, and how comfortable you feel, or call 911 like you would for anyone who appears to be having a medical crisis.
