Based on the current reading of the constitution, a reading supported by the DoJ, a sitting President is immune to any process of justice which would make doing the job of President impossible. This makes it Congress's responsibility to unseat a President so they may be properly prosecuted.
More interesting is whether the same would work for a President-Elect in jail under a specific State's legal statutes. My guess is that the govenor of that state would fold and issue a pardon, but that is far from a certainty. At the very least the federal government has enough power to ensure a suspended sentence from the state in question.
You forget this isn't about courage - its about ego. If the GOP rejects him he may very well decide to screw them by running on an independent ticket. I can't see him getting more than 10-15% of the vote (especially if he's running against DeSantis) but that is enough to screw any chance they have of victory.
He's likely doing this as a veiled threat to the Republican machinery - knowing that he'd split the party and all but guarantee another Dem term if they don't support him. And, yes, he is just that delusional and narcissistic to think only he matters. He is, after all, a guy who wants to BE (admired and loved as) president, but not do the actual work of a president.
This is a guy who sponged off his rich dad and who said that he had no idea that the Presidency would be hard work.
