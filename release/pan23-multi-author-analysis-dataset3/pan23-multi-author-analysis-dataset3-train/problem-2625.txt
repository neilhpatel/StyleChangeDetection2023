They have a proud history of rushing technology for the propaganda points. Not properly testing the technology. And it spectacularly failing. (But scapegoating the failures 'cos propaganda).
Russia always spread propaganda about their greatness and often overstretched themselves to failure. It's like there are cycles in Russia about bullshitting other countries into thinking they are all powerful until they believe it themselves and they try to invade a neighbor and then get their asses handed to them and they have to start over again. Also, those events usually coincide with revolution/regime change. Had Tsar Alexander and the war with Japan and the Soviets and their war in Afghanistan.
That would never happen in modern Russia, and it never happened in the USSR. It also doesn't happen in China. Authoritarian governments don't allow for that kind of open criticism of their mistakes.
Their willingness to endure undue risk is also what has led the USSR and now Russia down a lot of technological dead ends. They have a serious problem with "rocket works good enough, why change?".
True enough. Though fuel degradation is the least of the concerns. The mechanics, software, and expertise in these systems is what is the larger and more critical concerns. Liquid fueled rockets are much more complicated than solid. Tons of values, mixtures, etc that have to be just right or you get either a paperweight or a bomb.
It's not just the rocket itself, it is everything that the rocket needs; guidance, tracking, control, etc. Getting the damn thing off the ground is 20% of the problem. Getting it to hit where you want is 80%. Even if 80% of them fail to launch, that 20% that get airborne are going to have high failure rates on hitting their targets.
