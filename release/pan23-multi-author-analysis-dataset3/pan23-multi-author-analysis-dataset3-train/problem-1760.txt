“Sigemund”: After killing Grendel, Beowulf is compared to the dragon killer Sigemund, who is clearly a blending of Sigmundr and Sigurðr Fáfnisbani (AKA Siegfried, if you know the Old High German tradition better).
Other: Interestingly, the structure you bring up of the water-battle does have a parallel in the Norse sagas as well. Grettis saga (a life of the outlaw Grettir Ásmundarson, composed around 1300) has one episode where Grettir fights a troll-woman under a waterfall. The similarity to Beowulf is extremely noticeable, but all attempts to somehow link the composition of Grettis saga to Beowulf have failed. Also, it doesn't work the other way because evidence in the saga (assuming that some of the historical figures mentioned are supposed to line up with reality) suggests that Grettir died around 1030, after the manuscript of Beowulf was made. That obviously doesn't mean that the episode in Grettis saga wasn't attached to other legends before it became part of Grettir's life, just that there cannot be an obvious link from Grettis saga to Beowulf.
One particular passage that struck me along these lines is where Beowulf summarizes his adventures with Grendel to Hygleac. I kinda wondered if this may have at some point been a “previously on the adventures of Beowulf” device, probably this is just silly though .
