“India is being opportunistic” and is that wrong, if so why? India isn’t directly financing the war. Russia is. To say “India time out, it’s not fair you get cheaper oil” is just a crass thing to say in a capitalist, globalist world. Especially when capitalism + globalisation prefer to exploit poorer nations because it’s cheaper to. Is that not opportunistic? I’d be worried if the oil is fattening the pockets of the rich, rather than blaming them for buying cheaper oil. Oil is precious and a necessity.
Or is your definition of strategic sucking up to the west / to “ethics”? Because capitalism clearly doesn’t exploit poorer nations and workers.
Am I reading this correctly? They are being strategic in buying cheaper oil, and Russia sees less profit thanks to western sanctions. Which then means the west can buy refined oil from India for cheaper too (which they do).
That said, India is buying Russian crude oil and converting it into gasoline and the West is buying it. The West is directly benefiting from India buying Russian crude oil - it’s just Russia is selling at such a discount it’s killing their economy.
