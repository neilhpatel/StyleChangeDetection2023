There are a number of applications for marble dust and chips in architecture from Antiquity to the Baroque period, including mosaics, flooring (opus sectile and terrazzo), and plaster (marmorino). I'm having trouble finding a source that explicitly states marble bits left over from the carving of sculpture were recycled in this way, however.
My short answer: I'm totally unaware of sources that talk about the actual detritus of marble carving (i.e., pieces too small for use in other sculptures). But I'll expand a bit and offer some thoughts.
Michelangelo spends some time complaining about his health in a variety of letters and poems (he lived to almost 89, so had plenty of time to develop health problems) but I'm not familiar enough with all of them—or with the effects of marble dust—to say if he's documenting ailments specifically related to inhaling marble dust. Nor am I familiar with accounts from other artists or contemporary authors. But it's a bit outside my specialty; others may be able to contribute more.
