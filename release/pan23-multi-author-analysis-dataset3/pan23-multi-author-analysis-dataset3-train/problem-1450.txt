Also throwing in a hesitant application, because I only have three substantial comments with followups in the last six months:
Following on a few months from my first attempt at a flair application, I believe I have taken the feedback provided then and have worked on addressing it consistently in my more recent responses on the sub.

I look forward to hearing your response, and how I might improve my application if it is not successful!
After reading/lurking, and then commenting here and there on AskHistorians for the better part of 6 years, I'm eager to put in an application for flair! I've popped up occasionally on medieval European history, but I don't consider myself an expert in that. Rather, I'll be graduating very soon with a degree in History and Politics, having focused on more recent nation/statebuilding, development, and political thought.
