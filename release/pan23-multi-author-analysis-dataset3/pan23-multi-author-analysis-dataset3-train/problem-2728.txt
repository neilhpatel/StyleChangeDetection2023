Prosecuting insider trading is notoriously difficult. Martha Stewart didn’t go to jail for insider trading. She went to jail for lying to the FBI while they were investigating her for insider trading. This was at a time when people actually cared if someone lied to the FBI.
It’s almost as if the current laws are meant to deter or prosecute only the most obvious and egregious insider trading while still permitting sophisticated traders with access to information to skirt the law.
The fix would be correcting the insider trading laws so that the crime is easier to prosecute. Congress will probably pass that right after they pass new rules for Congress member stock trades; which is to say never.
I’m saying that regardless of what anyone believes in, this should be a bipartisan thing to not allow insider trading in congress.
At this point it might be easier to just, I dunno, investigate and charge members of Congress who ARE engaging in insider trading? Maybe once their memberships have been shaved down far enough, they’ll pass this law to avoid the scandal/ pain of losing valuable Party members to the Federal prison system.
