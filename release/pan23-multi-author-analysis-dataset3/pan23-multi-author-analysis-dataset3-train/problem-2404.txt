Don't worry, religion will fix it! Seriously, lately they've been blaming the rise of atheism on all our problems. Kind of funny when they think back fondly on the days of communism.
I don't think anything would materialize because self declared independence is one thing- that some EU nations are already uncomfortable with- but joining another country is a whole other thing that even more EU nations are uncomfortable with. If it's up to the EU and NATO, I don't think it'd get a pass. They might even sweep it under the rug and let Serbia deal with it this time.
But Serbia just laughs it off, like nah, bro. It’s all good. And just keeps pounding. And keeps pounding.
I feel like Serbia is that hammered friend at the bar when everyone is hanging out and feeling the right amount of drunk. The vibe is great, everyone is laughing, but Serbia just keeps pounding shots. And keeps pounding shots.
And everyone kind of jokingly (but not so jokingly) is like, Serbiaaaaa. Don’t you remember what happened last time when you got black-out? You started going on that racist rant you do, swung on anyone within 5 feet of you, and then puked all over us when we all had to carry you out to the car. Could we maybe not do that tonight, please?
But, for Serbia, this is just another day of the week, drinking on the town. Going to jail. Or getting knocked out. Whatever they’re feeling tonight.
