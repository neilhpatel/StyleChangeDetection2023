It's very difficult for them to transition out of the zero covid policy at present. People in China are sick of lockdowns, but the problem is they are also widely nervous about COVID ripping through.
The West has already been dealing with both COVID and Chinese lockdown effects causing industry over there that we get products from going down for 2 years.
The total is 68%, but if you look at it by demographic you're going to see that the vast majority of that 30 that haven't gotten vaccinated are in age groups where COVID is not a big concern in the first place.
100% full population vaccination is a unreasonable and unattainable goal because you can see in the demographic stats that people are assessing the amount of risk they have and each demographic is roughly making a good decision based on that risk.
Apparently, the issue isn't total vaccination rate, it's the vaccination rate among the older people as far as I can see. But I haven't found proper statistics on a quick look. I'll edit it in later.
