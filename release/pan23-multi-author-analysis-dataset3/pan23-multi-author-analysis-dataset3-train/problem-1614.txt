A lot of people don’t realize that the majority of what Russia says is for their people. They know it’s bullshit but the average Russian doesn’t. They fully believe accept it.
1000% agree. I really honestly believed that Russia even with 1960's tech was at least a little trained. Maybe somewhat capable of large scale military operations. When, in fact they employed a 40 mi convoy into Ukraine(madness). Showing tactics that were, well, for a lack of better term REDICULOUS. Their military, is inept. So anything that I hear from Russia sounds like a Monte Python threat....
That part might be the scariest, tbh - Nukes are the only game Russia has in a conflict with NATO. They're virtually guaranteed to use them, because it's the only thing that would be even moderately effective - assuming Russia's nukes still even work.
One thing I like to remind people of - NATO has spent its entire existence preparing for war with Russia. Every single conflict, every military action, every training drill, every strike and mobilization they've ever done - it has _all_ been practice for Russia. There is no opponent on earth they are better prepared for.
Especially given Russia's performance in Ukraine, I think it stands without question - a NATO conflict against Russia might be the single most overwhelmingly one-sided battle in history. The Russians might as well be using spears and slings for all the effectiveness they'll have. Short of launching their nukes, there is nothing at all Russia can do against NATO. Nothing.
NATO fighting Russia at this point would be more like watching an anthill get obliterated by a precision missile from five hundred miles away - laser-targeted and absolutely nothing left.
I mean if China and India can agree to fight with sticks I think NATO could make it crystal clear that the only russian targets are those in Ukraine and that no further escalation will occur if they just fucking leave. I mean is Putin going to end the world over Ukraine? Maybe.
