Short answer: they didn't, but being promised peace from a war that's going badly was always going to down fairly well.
Longer answer: Not all the soldiers supported Lenin. And Lenin and the Bolsheviks largely regarded the army as an ancien regime force fighting an irrelevant bourgeois war among other bourgeoisie - to be used, but only as disposable pawns in the game of power.
Lenin and the Bolsheviks existed in extraordinary times - even a more intelligent and cunning politician or rebel in most times in history would likely get nowhere, as Trotsky (another Bolshevik and the founder of the Red Army) would later say.
Anyway, as that answer I wrote discusses, the Bolsheviks effectively disbanded the Russian Army and built a new Red Army from scratch, albeit one that drew heavily on pro-Bolshevik units of the old army like the Latvian Riflemen. As noted, that new army also drew significantly on tsarist-era officers, who eventually made up maybe half of the total Red Army officer corps during the Civil War, but even then most of the tsarist-era military officers involved were serving in various White Armies instead.
So relatively few soldiers supported Lenin, in fact, that in the months to come, the Bolsheviks had to form a whole new army, the Red Army, with some Tsarist-era soldiers hired as military advisors - a necessary compromise to win the civil war.
Just to build on this (and to also draw on an that I wrote on an similar topic) - "the military" didn't really support the Bolsheviks, as much as bits of the old Russian military did. The Russian military in 1917 was rapidly losing a lot of its morale and coherence, for the reasons mentioned above, but also because peasants were taking over and redistributing land, and many of the peasant soldiers in the army returned home to get a share. The Bolsheviks courted their support by condoning this, but it wasn't really a Bolshevik-led policy as much as them recognizing facts on the ground.
