While I love the "the island is leaving" answer, the actual answer is demographics. Most estimates suggest that actually taking Taiwan would require somewhere in the ballpark of one to one and a half _million_ troops, and due to the one-child policy from the late 70s China can't field that many without changing their standards or making use of conscription - both of which have huge impacts on combat effectiveness.
Not only are the logistics for a Taiwan invasion incredibly difficult (there’s 180 km/100 miles of open sea between the two countries, it’s not as simple as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), Taiwan has literally been prepping for an invasion since they first became a country. The US is making its preparations too, I’m from the Philippines and next year to get a foothold in Southeast Asia in preparation for possible Chinese escalation.
US will know weeks before they know China will attempt an actual invasion so it wont be an actual secret and plenty of time for US to put their own presence in the area known. China wont be able to invade with just an air force. Taiwans beaches will be mined to shit in time for China to make a landing.
