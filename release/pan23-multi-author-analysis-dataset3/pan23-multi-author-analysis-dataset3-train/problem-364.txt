You can throw an engine out of an aircraft by calling it “dead weight,” but it doesn’t mean it was a good idea simply because the plane didn’t immediately drop out of the sky. They are built to glide, so while it’s still possible to land safely, doing so will not prove it was a good idea. In fact, it was an idiotic idea to do so, and most of your sane corporate sponsors already deployed their parachutes the second you lost your mind.
The fact you would immediately make such an assumption regarding gutting a giant corporation shows how ignorant you are on the matter. Corporations move at a snail’s pace, and the impact of any decisions are also delayed in nature.
Why does everyone think companies move at a snail's pace? Second guy answering that. Would love to have that work experience, that's guaranteed. New projects have to be launched in no more than one month and sooner the better.
In 2 years Twitter will be nothing like it is today, besides payments which Elon has been extremely vocal at, I wouldn't be surprised if they try to expand to streaming (more like YouTube). Or it's dead. It's also an option, but that would require internet hive mind to stay pissed at Elon for a looot of time.
