"It was a significant incident because it convinced Hitler that the Russian Bear was a tame beast indeed.".
This. Top notch night vision gear for Ukraine is much more of a priority and advantage than a lot of people recognize. So is great winter gear and training so the Finns are offering a very important support to Ukraine that may not be as sexy to most people involved in reporting and media but experienced war correspondents will know.
lmao I would definitely take that offer, the Finnish are really fucking proficient (and scary) soldiers, and they've been preparing for a Russian invasion since WW2.
As a Finn I think Finns definitely know how to deal with winter warfare, but let's also keep in mind Finns know how to deal with winter warfare in Finland. Ukrainian climate, terrain and daylight patterns are very different and not everything is directly applicable. In fact, some of the winter survival stuff may be an overkill, in which case you end up wasting time, energy and equipment/money that you don't need to waste.
I think the ski commando myth comes partially from WW2 where regular infantry who could ski was extremely effective. Kaukopartio/LRRP ski dudes were probably what people mean when they think of "ski commandos". Nowadays tiedustelija (recon) and sissi (guerilla) troops are relatively close in their capabilities, in that they can move to and operate in behind enemy lines mostly unsupported for long periods even/especially in winter.
Knowledge and training is always good, but let's also remember that Finns being very specialized in their/our territorial defense means that not everything generalizes super well.
There's also a very true meme family where any time Finland is mentioned hordes of Finns rush to the scene to offer their commentary. E.g. .
