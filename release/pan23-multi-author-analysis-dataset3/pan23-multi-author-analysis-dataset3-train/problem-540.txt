No one has claimed responsibility for any of the attacks on electric substations in the US Northwest. But two dipshit burglars in Washinon were arrested for doing some of them. They had the brilliant idea to cause a power outage and then do a burglary, thinking the alarms and stuff would be off.
I've still not seen any evidence these electric substation attacks are terrorists, much less any particular kind of terrorist.
As others have said terrorism has a specific definition. It requires non-state actors. The state cannot commit terrorism no matter what it does. It can commit crimes against humanity, war crimes, or even violate its own laws. It cannot commit terrorism.
RuZZia is not only a terrorist state, they are actively committing genocide. They are a literal Nazi/Fascist genocidal regime. They refuse to recognise Ukrainian nationality and are ethnically cleansing conquered areas of anything Ukrainian, by murder, rape, kidnap and forced relocation. I still don't understand that the West has any diplomatic relations with that sort of regime. Terrorism is nowhere near the top of the list of their crimes, they've been conducting terrorist actions in the west since Putler got to power. The Salisbury poisonings, Litvinenko, Czech munition depot bombing..
