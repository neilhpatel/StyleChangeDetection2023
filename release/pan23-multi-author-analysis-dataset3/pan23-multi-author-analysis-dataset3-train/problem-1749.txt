We already have open primaries (no need to register with a party) so either keep it that way or move to top 2/top 3 primary win system similar to California.
The California procedure is to hold an open primary on the 1st Tuesday after the 1st Monday in June (other than presidential primaries), and the top 2 finishers, from whichever parties, appear on the November general election ballot. Even if a candidate wins a majority of the votes cast in June, there's still an election held in November. Turnout is MUCH HIGHER in November than June.
Swell as long as there are clear majorities. What happens when candidates A, B and C each receive, say, 87,654, 87,653 and 87,652 votes, respectively? Candidate A is clearly the best? What if 90% of Candidate C's voters would prefer Candidate B as their 2nd choice? That should be ignored even though with RCV the 2nd round would give Candidate B over 63% of the vote?
Plus, the idea of wasted vote seems more likely in RCV. If every R voter had R as their top votes, and D voter placed a third party higher than a D, they risk that candidate being eliminated.
Certainly if R and D candidates receive the top 2 vote counts in the 1st round, one or the other would win in the final RCV round. To that extent, bad odds for 3rd party/independent candidates.
Right now, 3rd parties struggle to even appear on the ballot and even when they do they have depleted a chunk of their resources due to sabotage.
At other times they will sue 3rd parties, wasting their time and resources even if 3rd parties eventually get on the ballot.
RCV helps a little because 3rd parties are sabotaged by the 2 main parties when even getting on the ballot. Recent example is the Green party in the NC senate race. Dems on the elections board kicked them off the ballot just because. They had to get reinstated via the courts. That wastes time and limited campaign funds.
