AP isn't college curriculum, its a high-school level course that pretends to be as rigorous as a university-level course to make sheltered suburban egghead kids feel smart and to inflate their GPA (it's common for schools to weigh AP courses on a 5.0 scale instead of the regular 4.0 for the non-AP courses).
AP classes aren’t even required They’re equivalent to college freshman-level courses and are taken by high schoolers to get college credit before college. JFC. And Black History is American history.
How has African history, for instance, been written by white heterosexual males? We only knew what they told us? Lol. This concept is true for much of western history, but for many international topics we know what the winner of whatever war told western educators and scribes.
Science can be a brain wash as well. The illusion that everything you agree with is supported by hard facts leads to pretentiousness. Scientists can be bought as easily as politicians can. This is not a defense of religion, but a criticism of science. Anyone who claims they are right 100% of the time should be viewed with skepticism.
