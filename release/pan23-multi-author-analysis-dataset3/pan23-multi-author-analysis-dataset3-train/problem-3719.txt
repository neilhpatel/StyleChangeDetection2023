The nuclear threat is the only thing that hasn't failed Russia and its most likely because they haven't used them yet. They are still badly outmatched by NATO technology. Russia doesn't have modern military capabilities and NATO does.
I've heard the opposite. Their budget isn't nearly enough to keep all their nukes active and they've had some failed tests during the war. Russia runs on corruptionb from the bottom up. It's too much money for a Russian not to steal it.
Corruption is total in Russia. Nothing is excluded which is why Russia is losing in such an embarrassing fashion. They don't exactly reason through things. Putin was also sure Ukraine wouldn't really fight back and the war would be won in 3-4 days. Putin also claimed that his military could stand up to NATO, not just the US. Putin is wrong most of the time.
I'm not talking about Putin being right or wrong in matters, whether in his control or not. I'm talking about how the Russian state as a whole operates. Putin, while in charge of the Russian state and leaving it in a state of stupendous corruption, is probably still keenly aware that "his" nuclear arsenal is fundamentally key to his continued rule, as well as his country's geopolotical future. Just as he (mistakenly) viewed starting and prolonging this war the same way: as necessary to his continued rule and future of Russia.
