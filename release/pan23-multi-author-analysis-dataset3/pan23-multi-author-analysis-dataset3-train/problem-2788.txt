The entire first paragraph is actually very cool. I'm not being sarcastic. I'm a bit jealous, actually. I should probably say my friends didn't say I have a case, they just agree it's a defective tire, even if hard to prove.
But no matter what have the remaining tires checked for safety by someone competent to do so before you drive on them again just in case.
If you don't have comprehensive insurance you will need to find a products liability attorney to consult with regarding the tire separation issue to see if there is any manufacturer liability.
A large manufacturer is going to have a bigger legal team and more engineering experts to legally make a case that sometimes things happen with tires, and at that age and with 5-digit miles on the tire they are absolutely going to have a strong case that it’s not manufacturer error.
A tire manufacturer does not care - they will immediately go straight to ‘tire is used, and you can’t prove what conditions it was kept in three whole years, such as weather (humidity - as in, the rubber staying in hydrated condition), road conditions, and general wear and tear.’.
