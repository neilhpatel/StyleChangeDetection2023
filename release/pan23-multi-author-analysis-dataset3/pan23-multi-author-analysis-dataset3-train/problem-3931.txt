OP seems to be claiming that his coworker intentionally harmed him, which could negate his WC package (depending on company policy). If this is the case, OP should try resubmitting the request without passing blame (which would mean sucking up that desire for revenge and just taking the money), or OP could file suit for the damages. Without video evidence however, the latter option could be the more difficult option.
But as others have pointed out, intentional injury may fall under tort/criminal law rather than a WC issue. Say that I worked at a hardware store, and one of my coworkers decided to hit me with a crowbar, fracturing my forearm. That is still a workplace injury, but my company could recommend personal legal action rather than a WC claim since it was intentional.
You can consider a civil claim against your coworker as the burden of proof would be less than a criminal assault case. Whether it was intentional or negligent on her part, you may have a claim against her but you will def need a lawyer to assess all the facts of the case and to litigate it for you.
