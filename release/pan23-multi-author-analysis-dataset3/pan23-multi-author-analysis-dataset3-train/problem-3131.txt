That is a major, major, hurdle to home ownership that falls squarely at the feet of credit reporting agencies. If you want to make a dent in the housing crisis lobby your representative to force legislation to count rent payments towards your credit score.
Also final note: lots of rental companies are rolling out programs that help leasers build credit by paying rent on time, thus helping them eventually buy a home.
They're not buying as such, they're building new tract housing with the intent of renting them out like apartments but targeted towards single families. I don't think this would have any real impact on the housing market unless it's a runaway success. A 1 billion investment in real estate is really only like 3000 homes.
$1 billion of houses is somewhere between 1000 and 3000 houses, not counting all of the costs to manage them.
Final note: While seeing "$1 Billion in a headline is eye-opening, the truth is that $1b in single-family homes is probably around 4,000 homes. It's not a lot in the grand scheme. But, this deal is just one of many that's happening out there. And, if the housing market goes tits-up (as it has in the recent past), the market will change shape again and this may not be a super common model in, say, 10 years.
This entire topic could have (and likely will have) a dissertation written on it, but the concept of where and how people live in the United States is a really fascinating and ever-changing topic. The build-to-rent model is just the latest in a long line of new products being offered by large investors, and frankly, getting all pissed off about it kinda feels the same as people being big-mad about .
