So I called the cycle bar and they cannot provide me with a signed contract all they keep saying is that they have an invoice for me.
Call the local bar (probably a franchisee) and ask for a copy of the contract that you signed. If they cannot produce a copy of the contract you signed, that should end the inquiry.
With a contract that last in perpeputitty until canceled, those contracts have to be in writing. This is your normal fitness club contract. Those have to be in writing because parties are agreeing to terms so far in the future that the law wants it memorialized in writing. So she likely doesn't have a contract here unless there is a local rule that makes an exception to the normal practice. I was just giving her a heads up.
This ends up being a headache that really sucks. First, I would try to reasonably go around the people calling you. Cycle bar is big enough to have a corporate. Send them a lette to corporate counsel saying I never signed the agreement. I never came after the month promised. Send them 'evidence.' And tell them you will escalate if they continued to act.
After that if the continue, then you likely have a cause of action. There are people who specialize in creditor rights who hopefully will speak up and you'll find in the noise. Some of the rules entitled you to court costs, fees and damage multiples if a collector continues to harass you. But that is sufficiently out of my wheelhouse that you need someone who practices in that area.
