Have you complained to the people at the website that sold the gift card? Have they refused to refund? Are there reviews about this website?
eBay is not going to arbitrarily deny gift card usage, so there must have been a problem with that specific gift card being flagged. I've used many gift cards on eBay, never had any problems.
If ebay found an issue with how the website paid for the gift card, why doesn't ebay just say as such?
Well if they know the website didn't buy the gift card directly, then why isn't ebay saying that?? If that were the case, then I would have immediately gone after the website to explain how they obtained the gift card.
They're not going to give you details of how the gift card was activated. If you are the legitimate owner of the gift card, you should be able to confirm to them those details with your proof of purchase.
Let me put this another way: prove to eBay that the company had lawful authority to sell you the gift card. Until you can do that, with appropriate documentation, they are going to conclude the site sold you a stolen card, at which point your remedy is to go after the site for doing that. I'm not sure why you think the problem is eBay and not the site.
