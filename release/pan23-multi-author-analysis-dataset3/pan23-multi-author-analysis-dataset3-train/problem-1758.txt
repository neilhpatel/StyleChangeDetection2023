If you can't find it this way, talk to your municipality's planning commission or building inspector. Either one may also be able to give you the scoop on both the easement or whether the farmer has previously squashed development. If it's a public road the chances are pretty high there is an easement.
there is usually a right-of-way easement off the public road. The city/county/state that builds road usually buys enough land off the side of the road to account for this .... the property owner has no choice in this matter. Talk to your power company.
As others have said, this is between the other fellow and the power company. If they have poles already along the road, chances are they already have easements. If they have an easement, there’s not a whole lot the neighbor can do to stop them putting more poles. Worst case they could put poles on the other side of the road until they get to your property (not 100% of the layout based on your description so might not be possible), or do directional boring.
Just stop talking to your neighbor. Let the power company deal with him, it’s literally their job. I’ve had to do some pretty creative things to get someone with difficult neighbors power (it’s actually extremely common, especially in rich suburbs for neighbors to not want poles). I guarantee you your power company engineer has some backup plans in the case they can’t get an easement. In my case, we had an agreement with the city that we could place poles anywhere within 50 feet of a city road, regardless of easements, and we just got easements as a courtesy. Ask your engineer if you’re nervous, and just work with them.
