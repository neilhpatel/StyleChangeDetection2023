I am not sure about Hamburg, but in the case of Bremen the zoning of Germany among the Allies following WWII is an important aspect which also answers the question about Bremerhaven being part of Bremen.
That's not a correction, since the question was: "why did only Hamburg and Bremen REMAIN as City states", which is totally correct, only those two REMAINED, Berlin BECAME a city state after WWII (it was a free city under joined allied control, officially neither belonging to West nor East Germany). Prior to 1945 it was never a city state or any kind of free or imperial city, like Bremen and Hamburg, it was very much the most important city of Brandenburg and never gained (or seeked, i guess) independence from Hohenzollern control.
In short: Bremen today is a city state because unlike the surrounding area it was part of the American occupation zone after WWII. In the 1949 founded BRD it remained as its own Bundesland.
Germany was divided into four zones - a Soviet zone (which eventually became the DDR), a British zone, a French zone and an American zone (those three eventually forming the BRD).
When the British, French an American zones formed the BRD in 1949, the structure of the Bundesländer was heavily influenced by those structures established by the Allies in each of their zones between 1945 and 1949 (which is also the reason why Germany has some Bundesländer without an 'own' cohesive history as a region e.g. Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz or even Baden-Württemberg). Within the American zone Bremen was administered by itself due to its isolation from the rest of the American zone and remained a separate Bundesland even after 1949.
