Her actual post says something different than the title, so if you had actually read the post, you'd know that she is married.
>So I tried to file my taxes today and found out that my husband had filed jointly without my consent or signature.
(1) It's illegal for him to file a tax return in your name because he needs to forge your signature to do so. I'd encourage you to review the /r/personalfinance FAQ for their identity theft page. You should speak to an attorney before doing anything else on that front. .
2) You are allowed to contact his CoC. People screaming for you to report the adultery are wrong, at least at this point, and should be ignored. Adultery is a UCMJ violation. The problem with just filing these reports is that UCMJ violations can have consequences, like separation or reduction in rank. The number of times I've seen spouses shocked that their child support/alimony/etc drops (or DFAS allotments outright stop) due to disciplinary action is absurd. Hurting his career doesn't make sense if it hurts you, too.
3) Is he still providing your financial support? If not, contact base legal and ask them to notify the command and to get your financial support. You also need a bank account in your name.
