Leaving aside the "terror" aspect of bombing civilian targets, at least the carpet bombing of WWII did impact Germany's military industrial capacity, but Ukraine is getting most of its new equipment from outside its borders.
The Russians are just pissing their money away on missiles, and making it harder and harder to ever rebuild their relationship with Ukraine.
If russia were trying to destroy Ukraine's logistics with these strikes, the targets would be things like factories and transport infrastructure. People can point to the power infrastructure attacks but that's really not the ideal way to go about things- militaries can use portable generators, and if you're taking out military industry it's a lot more cost effective to hit factories rather than power stations that can shift load and be repaired/replaced rather quickly, as evidenced by Ukrainians consistently restoring power within days of attacks. Factories are centralized points that can take months or years to restore to operation, depending on the damage.
US general Ben Hodges has spoken extensively on this if, if you'd like to know more you can google him.
