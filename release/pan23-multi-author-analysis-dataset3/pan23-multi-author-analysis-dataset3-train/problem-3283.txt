So there's a divide among the religious in this country: there are those who are fully encumbered upholding the moral code the Bible lays down in whatever twisted version it is presented to them, and there are those who believe that the morality of the Bible is a starting point for building their own moral code (which most Christian sect would claim is heresy).
The reason the divide looks so religiously motives is because the 'nones' naturally have to build their own moral code, which puts them alongside those more 'progressive Christians' who aren't willing to take the code they're presented at face value.
Here's the actual divide: Christianity has been preaching for a long time that you can't be ethical or moral without God and that all morality comes from Divine Grace.
So it sounds like you support a deity and you dare not question its morality, for better or worse (based on mere faith) that your chosen deity is moral. If you are wrong, you are immoral if your deity asks immoral things of you that you consider just "being nice". Also by supporting an immoral deity, you would be complicit in it's immorality. You cannot decide whether or not you are immoral. You can only obey the orders.
