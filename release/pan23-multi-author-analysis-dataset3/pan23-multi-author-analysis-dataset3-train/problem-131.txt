Read, don’t read, I don’t actually care. You’re obviously very good at copypasta, so do what you want. My point is that you are the one who put social connotation on a simple and accurate label of her nationality. As a matter of fact, she is of Chinese descent, which makes the “redditor” correct. Don’t make this more difficult than it needs to be.
Honestly, you should read more about this topic. Taiwan as an independent government emerged after the rise of the Chinese Communist party. The old Chinese Nationalist party escaped to Taiwan in 1949 after a civil war. In some ways, Taiwan is more Chinese than mainland China.
Han Chinese is the largest ethnic group but there are smaller ethnic groups as well. I appreciate your attempt to continue the conversation even if you can't quite get the facts correct.
The redditor was wrong to say Chao is Chinese. She's by country of birth from the Republic of China but ethnically Han Chinese.
I have plenty of friends who are Han Chinese but that does not make them Chinese. They are from Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, Etc….
