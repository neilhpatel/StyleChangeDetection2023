Title: Running a donation account, all proceeds are donated. PayPal is asking for confirmation of taxpayer status, we went over the threshold.
In the alternative, could PayPal be convinced to not issue a 1099-K by treating the donations to date as a "gift"? For example, what happens if someone receives a $26,000 gift via PayPal? Maybe OP could forward the evidence of prior donations to PayPal and convince them not to issue a 1099-K for at least the $26,000 in donations that took place in the past?
Given that that the $26,000 received was not for goods and services (it was for charitable donations - no different than if OP had gone around with a collection box and at the end of the day given all of the cash in the box to a charitable organization), could the OP just not report the $26,000 as income in next year's return, since the fact of the matter is, no income was actually received?
I assume this approach could draw an audit. But if OP has tax receipts (or at minimum other evidence of payment) from each of the charitable organizations that received the funds), couldn't those be produced in the event of an audit?
