It isn't a "pretty clear case for self defense" in the DA's mind, since they've filed criminal charges against your ex-partner.
If your ex partner is being charged, his case may not be half as straightforward as you're suggesting. The version of events offered by the state is vastly different from his. He needs to accept the possibility that although he may be innocent, it may be in his best interests to accept a plea bargain. I know this sounds unfair, and it is, but if he goes to trial and is convicted, the outcome may be much worse.
Legally, your options are clear cut: pay for his defense knowing that it's a gamble or don't. r/personalfinance may be able to offer more specific advice on how to manage this financially.
Then he should gather documentation of his income and assets vs debt and expenses and see if he's eligible for court appointed counsel. Public defenders are every bit as qualified as private attorneys and may be more so due to the fact that they exclusively practice criminal law.
If you want to pay for his defense, go for it, but don't be surprised when the case doesn't get dropped after all.
