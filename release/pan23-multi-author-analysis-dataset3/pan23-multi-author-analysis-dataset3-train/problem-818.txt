1. They fight all the charges and nominate trump as the President candidate in 2024 and probably lose.
Actually it might be in the Rs best interest to have him arrested at this point, they have 3 choices.
3. They let Trump go down (and pray half of the GOP doesn’t go down with him), blame the Ds and galvanize their base to vote for Desantis…No infighting, you run the guy you want and probably win.
All this tells me is they are doing their best to avoid losing power in the Republican Party by only focusing on trump instead of all the people who also helped him accomplish this like MTG Ted Cruz etc.
My hope is, as Trump feels the squeeze and is shunned by the GOP establishment, he desperately runs as a 3rd party candidate and siphons just enough votes away from DeSantis or other shaky red seats in 2024 where we get Dems in to enshrine some systemic changes and focus attention on the blatant corruption in the Supreme Court.
DeSantis is almost more terrifying than Trump, not that I'd want Trump back in the White House. Trump sabotaged Trump when he got mixed into the midterms.
