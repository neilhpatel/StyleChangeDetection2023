Sounds to me like that's an owner occupied 2-family. I could be wrong. Do you understand a different meaning?
trust on behalf of a member of the immediate family of the person or persons establishing the trust, provided that the.
member of the immediate family on whose behalf the trust is established permanently occupies the unit; and (3) a.
dwelling unit which is permanently occupied by a member of the immediate family of the owner of that unit, provided.
other guesthouse or part thereof rented to a transient guest or seasonal tenant; (2) a dwelling unit which is held in.
residential purposes, OTHER THAN (1) owner-occupied premises with not more than two rental units or a hotel, motel or.
One generally becomes a landlord when they arrange for and allow someone to move into their space, whether they rent or own that space.
If he had the original rental agreement, and you did not make an agreement with the owner, but with him, he could be considered your landlord. He does need to give you proper notice and can't give you three days. If he locks you out, call the cops because that would be an illegal eviction.
Either way in order to evict they have to properly serve you with notice. Saying move out is not proper notice. It will be a formal written notice and it will have to give the legally required minimum amount of time which I assume is 30 days in your state based on what others have posted.
