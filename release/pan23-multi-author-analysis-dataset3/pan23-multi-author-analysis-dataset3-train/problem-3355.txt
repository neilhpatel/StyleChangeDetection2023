The reason why unions are so important is in the cases of billions of dollars of capital negotiating as a single unit (corporations), while labor negotiates as individuals. The labor/capital curves end up looking like the supply/demand curves of a monopoly. Unions are one solution to this problem, the other being breaking up giant companies. When mom and pop places hire people, they have to compete with all the other mom and pop places in their industry the same way workers compete against other workers. Imagine if the gardening department and menswear department of Walmart had to compete against each other for retail workers. Both wages would rise.
So unions hired by corporations are more likely to have fairer wages, and tiny businesses hiring individuals are also more likely to have fairer wages.
The alternative, where workers don't have the backing of a union and are consistently being taken advantage of by the employer, is not tenable.
Maybe because underpayment and companies abusing their rights as employers have forced employees who need to work to live (a lot paycheck to paycheck) to fight back?
>Employers were able to defeat unions so effectively because, over the years, labor law had become heavily tilted against workers and toward employers.
This is a very fair point - as companies consolidate workers lose choice as well and necessitates a similar consolidation of worker power. I’d love to see some of these massive companies broken up.
I’m not anti-union, but the fallacy in your argument is that there is only one corporation. There are thousands of companies, which means labor can vote with their feet. If the company isn’t doing right then employees can leave and work somewhere else.
