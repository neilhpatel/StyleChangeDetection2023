So Colorado is a one-party state, but there were no parties in that conversation that knew they were being recorded.
I don't think I commented on that, in fact I hadn't responded beyond asking if they were notified. You are making a lot of assumptions about what I said and what I am suggesting.
And I feel that the person making sweeping assertions is the one who has to back it up. All I said is that it's not as cut and dried as you and another commenter seem to think. Responses to OP, therefore, should reflect that ambiguity. I have no burden to prove something I never asserted in the first place.
When a private residence is a workplace, I don't think the statute is nearly as cut and dried as you do. If you have a Colorado case that says otherwise, please share it.
Lastly, it is a felony in Colorado. Last I checked, this sub focused on what was legal or not. Not your opinion of what a DA would bring charges against.
It is unlikely that the eavesdropping statute will apply. Yes, the home is a private residency and not a public space. But, there is a big difference between the homeowner and someone invited to work on the property. IMO, most courts are going to say that your privacy interest is limited when compared to a person's ability to monitor a person's private home, especially since the recording device was in the kitchen (a public area).
