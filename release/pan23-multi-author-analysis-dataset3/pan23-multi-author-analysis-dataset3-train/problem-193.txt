What will happen is that Russia will have fewer planes and bombs to attack with. Until Russia stops attacking entirely (which of course includes leaving Ukraine and freeing the people who have been kidnapped), that's all that matters, destroy as many Russian military resources as possible.
Given the need for Ukraine to further disrupt Russian artillery operations, those seem like a very logical target.
Surely you must see the danger in trying to tell Ukraine they can't defend themselves with any and all means available to them.
I just fear if Ukraine does what Russia is doing to its civilians they risk losing western support. Ukraine targeting and killing Russian civilians is just a lose/lose for them... Russia being bastard war criminals shouldn't in my opinion justify Ukraine being the same. They'll lose much of the worldly support they currently have.
I'm against any civilians being targeted during a war but if Ukraine do this they risk losing the support from many if not all allies. That's why it would be a stupid thing to do...
