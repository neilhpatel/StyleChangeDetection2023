I doesn't make sense that Russia did this on purpose (if they even did it in the first place). You don't risk a war with NATO over something like this... Of course, the possibility exists, but it just doesn't make sense.
Yes they are at fault, but context matters and they consequences change depending on it. Firing on Poland and firing on Ukraine and hitting Poland by accident are 2 diferrent things.
Could have been fired by Russia towards Ukraine but due to a technical difficulty in the rocket / middle hit Poland instead.
From what I've read it was a Ukrainian anti-air missile that hit a Russian missile which landed within Polish territory. Put simply, it was an accident. Russia isn't ballsy enough to jump on that nerve.
A lot of Russians aren’t buying the full war with NATO lie. And those near the top putting pressure on Putin aren’t buying it either. If there was at least a partial war, that changes things.
Not saying this is definitely what happened here, but just that it is in line with their recent actions. Basically I wouldn't be surprised.
