Agreed. Depending on prices, is have the contract say that the seller may stay for two weeks paying utilities plus taxes and other such costs. After two weeks, rent is some amount over twice fair market rent, and a couple of years worth of that is escrowed to pay it.
If you let them stay two weeks congratulation they are established tenant and you are now a landlord. You may need to go thru the eviction process to have them vacate the premises and that will add months to the process with little chances to recoup your cost/losses.
With late fees of $150-200/day on top of rent, moving and storage fees, temporary housing costs, and legal expenses it can be well worth the hassle for the buyer even if it takes a few months. An extra $20-40k in the bank for your troubles after your expenses isn't too terrible - especially when you don't even need to collect since the money is already in escrow.
If you've got a good real estate attorney and the previous owner has enough equity, a very hefty chunk of the sale price held in escrow as security is a powerful motivator to leave and it's very common around here.
