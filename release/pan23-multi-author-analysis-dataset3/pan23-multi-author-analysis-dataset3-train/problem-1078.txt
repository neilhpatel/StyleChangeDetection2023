I also want to chime in that in my experience, many of these people can't recognize that people might think differently than them for any good reasons.
Similarly, an old coworker of mine thinks Leftists and Dems are part of an insidious cabal or have secret intentions because, to paraphrase, "no one believes or wants that hippy dippy commie shit, and if they do then they're brainwashed.".
So much this. Really saw that demonstrated when COVID hit. People thought that if they didn't "believe in COVID" then it wouldn't hurt them or something. I just don't understand people like that.
They can’t understand that a man (or a woman) can be so many other things and it does not affect them one bit. Gay men can be masc or femme, they can be drag queens or jocks or anything in between. Trans people existing does not affect a cis person at all. But they’re so hopelessly attached to these old binaries and changing that scares them so much, even when it has nothing to do with them.
Oh for sure, their homophobia and transphobia is just good old fashioned sexism with extra steps. They hate women and femininity so much because it threatens the patriarchy and what threatens the patriarchy more than a man who in their eyes “gives up” their masculinity by allowing themselves to be penetrated by another man or by transitioning into a woman.
Conservative men are threatened when a transwomen exists, because this is a person who rejected masculinity entirely.
Conservative men are threatened when a transman exists, because they're afraid the transman might be a better man then them.
Conservatives know how conservative men look at women, and they're threatened about the idea that gay men might look at them the same way.
