I'd like to flip this around, actually: I don't think AH readers realize how much it means to me--to us--that you're out there interested in history, and in getting into the grit of history instead of TIL.
Right?! I recommend digging through the post histories of /u/hillsonghoods and /u/Commustar, in particular, if you're ever in the mood to really get deep in something you either didn't know even existed, or never dreamed there was a story behind it.
Because the thing that unites everyone here isn't just that we love history. It's that we love sharing it. And look, it's the Internet--every single person reading this thread has been That Person shouting into the social media void, at one point or another. AskHistorians isn't a void, and that's because of the community as a whole--posters, regular lurkers, people who click on a link on their front page as a lark.
As one of the regular lurkers who constantly visits this sub and devours the info here, I also want to extend my gratitude to everyone involved. This is a very special corner of the internet.
This is my favorite place on the internet. I get answers to questions I would never have thought to ask. I am profoundly grateful that so many people take time out of their busy lives to share with the rest of us.
