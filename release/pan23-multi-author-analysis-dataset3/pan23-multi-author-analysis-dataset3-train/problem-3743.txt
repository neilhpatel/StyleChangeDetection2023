There’s no way to fix the things that are breaking our country which is why it will just continue to collapse slowly.
Right there with you on citizens United though, since the constitution doesn’t say money is speech but still with this corporate run scotus it would take a constitutional amendment which will never happen.
Good luck getting rid of the freedom of association we have guaranteed by the constitution in order to get rid of right to work laws.
So, there are no incentives for union busting/suppression, nor any for "Right to Work" regulations on the other side of the pond.
However, for "Right to Work", it wouldn't be a problem, if unions were actually free, and had, at least, the same rights and freedoms as in Europe.
IMHO, the biggest thing America is lacking is a free and well organized workforce (e.g. real unions, workers' owned news media, workers' NGOs and other associations, etc.).
Huh. California is the world's fifth largest economy, so they should be able to pull that off. And I'll bet they could sell to Washinon and Oregon as well.
