They should do what the GOP does in every state they lose the governor: pass a bunch of bills in a lame duck session to effectively take all the governorâ€™s power away.
I keep telling people, the best outcome is for the Dems to control 51 seats of the Senate and for the Republicans to barely (1-3 seats) control the House.
Dems have to run the table of what is available to get the majority so I don't think we are going to get to a "no path" for Republicans in the House.
They will, in the form of vulnerable Republicans who don't want to lean too hard into the MAGA brand anymore because they see it's a losing prospect. They will even have some Republicans who have just voted with Dems on stuff regardless in the past because they do actually support it, or at least enough of their constituents do.
But the critical difference, and something the Democrats have not at all had to deal with, is that a notionally Republican-held House will also have to rely on several representatives who are actually insane psychopathic traitors. Manchin and Sinema may suck, but they don't "Jewish space lasers" suck.
