Glad it has been relatively calm, but it’s disturbing to think that it could escalate even further again. I am sorry.
That’d be great. While Russia will certainly steal everything they can and then some, at least they’ll be out of there. We won’t have to worry as much about them holding this over Ukraine.
Additionally, if this happens, I feel like it’ll tell us a bit about how confident Russia isn’t in terms of taking over more of or holding onto all currently occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia oblast.
The world doesn’t work in absolutes, even if Russia loses every inch of land in Ukraine it doesn’t mean it will cease to exist and it’s not clear whether it would be in Hungary’s interest or not to maintain the same role, even with a weaker Russia.
Unfortunately, the EU and Russia are still interdependent to some degree, and the EU can't just cut 100% of the trade without serious economic consequences. Considering how geographically close the EU and Russia are, it's not all that much of a surprise.
