You can withhold rent for an uninhabitable place. They are breaking the lease by not giving you a place to live, so if they try an take you to court for an eviction you can present that evidence. Any damage fix yourself can be deducted from your rent.
Best advice would be to find a new place and let them know they've broken the lease by not proving a habitable place.
That said, you can't demand rent from an inhabitable dwelling, nor demand that the tenants "clean up" the mess - not of their own making. Yes, owners are under pressure in this economic environment. However, there are some obligations that are solely the owner's responsibility.
The owner can only charge for habitual dwellings. The owner's insurance will cover their lost rent - possibly trying to collect twice.
The owner's insurance is covering the clean-up, so it appears that the owners may be trying to collect twice.
The owner should be picking up all the utilities being used - their insurance policy is reimbursing them, so the owner may be charging twice for the utilities.
Since it was a water heater, it is really no ones fault, and ultimately the apartment owners insurance should cover the remediation.
