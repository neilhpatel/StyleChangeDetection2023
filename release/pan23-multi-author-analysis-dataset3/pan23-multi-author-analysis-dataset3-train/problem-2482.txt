So what exactly do they get out of this sponsorship? Especially as they will have already paid to line up supplies and staff.
Quite a few of these gulf Arab states will sell you alcohol in your room. Its tolerated so long as you don't go out in public.
So, what do we reckon was higher. The bribes qatar paid, or the 75 million that budweiser pays for sponsorship?
The hilarious thing is, the only reason Qatar spent all this money on this was for good global publicity.
The joke is on those suckers who are going to Qatar. As long as there are “fans” for whom the game is bigger than issues like the ones which Qatar is accused of, we can never expect better.
At this moment it’s only a question: “how far Qatar can bribe or threat the way of their national football team into tournament”, not “what shit towards fans or serving personnel Qatar will perform”.
Guess they just bought private event for themselves and totally don’t care about profit or representation. They just bribed enough to do whatever the fuck they want. It’s pretty optimistic to think that those “religious” spoiled and filthy rich people would count anyone except themselves as human beings.
