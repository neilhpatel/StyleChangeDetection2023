Did the letter or the circuit court case information online give any type of explanation as to what this debt was for?
If there is a return address on the letter, does it show that this letter came from an actual court or from some type of credit/debt collection agency?
Also, you should send a letter to these jokers via certified mail (copy your AG) stating that you "dispute" the debt. It's important that you use this word. You are probably aware that you can dispute charges on your credit card. They take this charge off while they investigate. You pay the rest, of course. What you should do here is fire a shot across their bow by disputing the charge formally. They can't impugn your credit while the charge is disputed. This makes sure that they know that they're not fooling with some dummy. Based on other comments, it would seem that they have no basis to come after you. But their hope is that you're a dummy that they can bully into paying. Don't be that dummy. Dispute the charge right away legally and formally, and at the same time contact your state AG to see what help they can provide. If your AG contacts them, they probably will fold their tents and sneak off. Good luck.
You should contact your State Attorney General, consumer protection division. We did the same thing with a rental dispute. Contract was entirely in our favor. After the landlord was contacted by the AG, they folded like a cheap suit.
