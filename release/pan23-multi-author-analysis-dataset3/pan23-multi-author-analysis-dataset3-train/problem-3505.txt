Ann Kerns. Who will shout if not us? Student activists and the Tiananment Square Protest, China, 1989.
And this is a post containing several links on the nature of Tiananmen protests, for those interested:
There has been some prior discussions about the scope of the Tiananmen Square protest and its representations in different medias:
The goal here is to highlight that Tiananmen had implications for political entities outside of Beijing. The narrative we are used to hearing has been heavily influenced by pro-Western Hong Kong journalists and historians, who have vested interests in deflecting any insinuation that China is capable of liberal change.
Also the claim that the narrative (at least in Hong Kong) is shaped by journalists who "deflect any insinuation that China is capable of liberal change" is quite strange. Until recently, the stance of media from the so-called pro-democracy camp is that of mild Chinese nationalism, as manifested by their generally supportive approach towards human rights activists inside China. If they try to deflect any insinuation that China is capable of liberal change, I can't see the reason of depicting them in such light.
Actually it's more likely because the idea of a liberal China just doesn't sit well with the Western narrative that China is the "enemy" in some way. A complex narrative of competing liberalisms isn't that hard to imagine, people have no trouble accepting the Constructivist consensus that Gorbachev was a liberal reformer a la perestroika and glasnost.
