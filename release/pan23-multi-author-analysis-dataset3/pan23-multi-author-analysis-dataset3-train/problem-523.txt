I think his getting away with shit has generally been due to the cost-benefit analysis of those in power. He's a useful idiot to monied interests and can be easily manipulated. His presence motivates both Republican and Democrat turn-out (even if it seems his presence is starting to be toxic for the GOP voter base).
I'm assuming Garland and the DoJ haven't really wanted to go after him as they're hyper-concerned about seeming impartial in their determinations, while also fearing all the downstream bullshit that we'd see if any legally meaningful consequences were levied against Trump. Not to mention how many major DC figures would be implicated in the related investigations...and likely be worthy of charges as well.
At this point I don't want to see another stupid story on this unless it's indictments dropping or the wrongdoers getting away with it. The constant drip of "get ready to get ready" is taking it's toll.
Trump's behavior was obvious and it is clear that he was fishing for the fabrication of votes. Will he be indicted?
The DA has to have yet another grand jury to get her indictments. This article is misleading you to think the DA can charge Trump now. There's a reason she hasn't.
