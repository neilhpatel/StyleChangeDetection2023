It's their laptop and this is the digital equivalent of not allowing kids to read comic books or play on their phone during class.
The school can more or less do as they please with their own laptops, even while those laptops are in the possession of a student. They're not required to allow your son to use the laptop for anything else, or to allow him to read other material during class. Just about the only thing they need to avoid is turning on the cameras and microphones outside of class time, without your consent.
What I was suggesting is that he _not_ enrol his personal devices in the school's management system. If he needs to do classwork, he'll have to use the school's laptop, but for other activities, research, and so on, he can use his own, as he sees fit.
If you want your kid to have a laptop they can use freely, buy them a laptop or an iPad, and limit their use of the school laptop to schoolwork only. The school will likely not allow any other laptops to access the school's portal, so he'll have to use that laptop for class, but he can read (outside of class) on his own device.
Ultimately, a school-issued laptop is controllable by the school and so long as they are doing so in a lawful manner (and this seems like a lawful, if inconvenient, manner) there's not much you can do. Hyperbolic metaphor aside, I don't see a legal issue here.
