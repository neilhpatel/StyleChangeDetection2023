Guard rails (MBGR) along roadways are low to the ground. It will be expensive, but a 2.5-ft high fence can be built which will protect your property.
How high of a fence did you propose to the City? The City Code you posted states that the fence cannot be higher than 2.5-ft. This is because they do not want to create a site distance issue for vehicles exiting out of your property. Having a high fence can block your view of oncoming cars as you exit your driveway.
Yeah, if there is this amount of accidents at this intersection, something is off. Either the signs need to change or traffic lights need to be installed or something.
You can try to research just how many accidents happen yearly at this intersectionâ€”I doubt that it is just the cars hitting your house. Then ask for the intersection to be evaluated for better safety.
You might also want to consider what signage there is on that road. If there isn't much a few well designed signs could remind people they are approaching a T in the road. You would be surprised how effective a few good signs can be. Your public works department might be willing to work with that.
