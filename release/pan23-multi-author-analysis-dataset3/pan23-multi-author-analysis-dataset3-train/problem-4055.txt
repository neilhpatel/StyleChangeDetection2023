However, MTG doesn't want that nor does her buddy Bozo. A majority of Congress does not want that, so it will not change.
Should probably spend time investigating things that matter and aren't known - but Republican's won't investigate themselves in good faith. They'll just do sham "investigations" to further undermine the credibility of the government that they want to tear down.
Basically they're daring the targets of their probes to be as dismissive of the process as they were, thus reducing the impact of investigations to just another partisan stunt, like impeachment, that the minority party uses to throw a tantrum.
Sham investigations serve to undermine legitimate ones. They want to defang house committee action the same way they did impeachment, because fascists do not like to be held to standards or precedent. That gets in the way of exercising power.
The GOP would rather have a dysfunctional legislative body that nobody takes seriously than a functional one that might, on occasion, act on nonpartisan principles.
