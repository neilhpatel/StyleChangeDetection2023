You don’t know your hourly wage? Did you fill out a W-4? Your check reflects FICA withholdings. There isn’t enough information here to determine how much you hourly wage is.
You haven't provided enough information here to determine whether there is an issue with your pay. There is an issue that you aren't getting paystubs showing your deductions. You can make a if you wish.
Your take home pay is different from your gross pay (which is of hours multiplied by hourly rate), which is how you determine if you're being paid minimum wage.
If they do give you your pay stubs, you'll be able to use the gross wages earned divided by hours worked to calculate if paid the minimum wage (or if the pay stub is a big fat lie on hours worked, also common for bad employers).
A big reason bad employers in California don't give pay stubs? Because it makes the fact you were paid less than minimum wage obvious.
If they don't give you your pay stubs, it is almost certain they are paying under minimum wage and should file a wage claim. Retaliation is almost universal in the garment industry in Los Angeles for doing so. So don't bother telling them before hand if you are going to file a wage claim. The DLSE has waged something of a minor war with the Los Angeles clothing industry for over 25 years for constantly paying under minimum wage and numerous other wage violations.
