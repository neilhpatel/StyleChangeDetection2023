In some places like the Capitals of several countries there are Soup Kitchens, shelters, food banks, and other resources. There is supposedly a child protective service of some form in most places too.
You can and probably should call the UK equivalent of child protective services without his permission. Ultimately this won't be solved without the involvement of the police. But through google I've also found the organization NSPCC, which might be a good group for you to call for advice. /r/legaladviceuk might also be able to provide best advice.
Also, it was a bad idea for him to get drugs even in exchange for a meal because he's now done something illegal. He should definitely not do that again, can you give him free food instead? He shouldn't talk to the police without a solicitor (but I believe in the UK he can get one for free during a police interview) and he certainly shouldn't show them the video without the advice of a solicitor. I'd think it's unlikely he'd be prosecuted but he should protect himself.
