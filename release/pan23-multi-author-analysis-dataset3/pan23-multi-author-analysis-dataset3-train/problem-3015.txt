The translation here is idiomatically incorrect. He didn't say Putin is a "nobody" as if he was a loser. He suggested that Putin doesn't exist, being either dead or incapacitated, and therefore cannot possibly meet to discuss terms with Ukraine.
It could be, but in this other interviews this week he more directly said that Putin is possibly using a body double to hide the fact that he's dead or dying.
I'm talking idiomatically not literally. He's not saying Putin is "nothing" as if he's a loser like most people in the thread are implying. He's suggesting that Putin isn't the decision maker in Russia.
To me its more likely that either Zelensky is genuinely pointing out Putins absence or he wants to provoke Putin for whatever reason.
I interpret it that perhaps Zelensky recognizes Putin as someone who pathologically lacks integrity to the point the president of Russia acts even against his own interests. This happens more often than you think. Putin is suspected to be a sociopath or a narcissist. This means he will always renegade on any agreement as long as he feels like it, even when it's irrational.
