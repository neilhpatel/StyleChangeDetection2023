It's really unlikely that there's anything your coworker can do. Yes, the person was an intruder but her dogs mauled a person just because they didn't recognize them. Laws about dangerous animals vary by jurisdiction (and are usually, in the US, applied at the city or county level) but something like this could easily put them in "dangerous and need to be destroyed" territory.
Just so I have this correct: her dogs broke out of her property, entered another person's property, and attacked someone there to the point that the person needed to be hospitalized?
Also - it's unclear from your post if the dogs attacked the thief on your coworker's property and inside a fence or if they went next door to do this.
Need city. And also need more details about where the intruder and dogs were. If the intruder was in a fenced yard on her property, that's a much different situation than her dogs escaping her property to attack a person on her neighbor's property.
So the wrecked car was sitting in her driveway the dogs managed to get outside of the house and outside the fence it defense to attack the guy that was essentially going through the The hood of this wrecked car So the dogs were outside her fence but it was still on her property.
