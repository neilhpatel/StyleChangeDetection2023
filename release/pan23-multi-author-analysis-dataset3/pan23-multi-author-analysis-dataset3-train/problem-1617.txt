But who fires them? That's the issue. Generally voters are supposed to be the bosses who fire them, and having an unelected body of some kind remove them risks undercutting voters and abusing the system against political opponents. And then you get into murky territory of what actually counts as a lie or is just a mistake or too ambitious of a promise.
Note the case in this article involved a Republican trying to sue a Democrat over an accusation they felt was incorrect.
Can you imagine the shitshow that would ensue if Republicans had a legal cause of action allowing them to litigate whether a Democrat lied to them? I know itâ€™s frustrating because Republicans operate in bad faith but the real answer is for the press to report the lies and let the people decide by voting.
Right now many people believe that the lying and dishonesty in government is destroying the society. Should a possible solution be rejected merely because potentially "a single innocent person being charged and losing power over distinguishing what is true or not?".
IANAL ... but IMO no. The 1A says the government can't make a law limiting what they (or anyone) can say (excepting the categories of prohibited speech such as incitement); so in general they can't be legally punished for a crime of saying an untrue thing. And US Congress-members have a special protection in the Speech and Debate clause of the Constitution. But the 1A doesn't establish a positive "right to say anything you want without consequences" - other laws (defamation, slander, fraud, etc) apply to what they say/do when/if they cause harm by intentionally lying.
(And yet other laws may mean that if they do harm through lying in the course of their official duties then the penalty will be on the government rather than on them personally.).
