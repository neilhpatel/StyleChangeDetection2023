State is important here. For example in NY renters are allowed to have immediate family members and/or one additional person & their dependent children live with the renter despite what the lease might otherwise state.
The landlord is within his rights, if you have violated the lease by having guests in excess of the allowable period (unless your state law grants an exception for family as has been noted). They are concerned about having your ex be seen as a tenant, and gaining tenant's rights.
I would speak with a tenants rights lawyer in your area. You can contact the Tennessee bar association for referrals.
Check with an attorney who can tell you if there are any statutes that might grant exemptions for child care.
The terms of the lease could be completely valid in which case the landlord has a right to write you up. Under 66-28-402 of the Tennessee Code, there are no limitations on rules pertaining to guests.
Seems like landlords can restrict guests to a reasonable degree. Your babysitter is not a guest, but a necessity, and kids are supposed to be considered in these clauses, so this is not reasonable.
