If you do otherwise, like take the matter into your own hands without communication, they can sue you to recover the costs and will almost certainly win.
A month is not very long. You should sent them certified mail that lays out you are attempting to return equipment, and if you don't have an arrangement within (no less than, more if you can) 60 days of <date.
Send a certified letter to HR informing them that they have 30 days to contact you to make arrangements regarding these items, or they will be disposed of.
I would send the certified letter immediately and 90 days should be long enough for anyone to retrieve/ give instructions what to do with their equipment.
Really your best bet is to send them a certified letter stating they have 30 days to send you a mailing label and packaging for their item to be returned, or the items will be considered abandoned and disposed of. You are not a storage unit, they only have the most basic of rights to their equipment back. They will also not sue you for this, this kind of thing is peanuts to employers. It will cost them more to sue to get stuff back than the items are worth.
