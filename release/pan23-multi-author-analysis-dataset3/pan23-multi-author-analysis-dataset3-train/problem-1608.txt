The licence only relates to US sanctions on Venezuela. The sanctions mean the US will punish anyone who does business with that country. The licence just allows Trinidad and Tobago to negotiate with Venezuela and extract the gas without being punished, so long as no money goes to Venezuela. As the article notes, it's going to be a problem getting a deal to work with the no-money limitation.
The licence is only to avoid US sanctions on Venezuela. It doesn't give Trinidad and Tobago any right to the offshore gas; that still has to come from Venezuela. In fact, since the licence still forbids any money going to Venezuela, it's hard to see how Trinidad and Tobago will be able to make a deal.
Trinidad & Tobago would like to do business with the US without being sanctioned for dealing with Venezuela, hence the exception to sanctions with some limitations granted.
Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela are two sovereign, independent countries, so why the hell would they need a license from the US to cooperate with each other?
