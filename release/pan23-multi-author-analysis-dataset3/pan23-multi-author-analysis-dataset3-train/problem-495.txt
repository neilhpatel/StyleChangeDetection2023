Them being private doesn't exempt them from the Civil Rights Act of 1964. However, they can deny an exemption. They could deny it because it's not reasonable, or they could deny it because they don't believe it's a truly religious reason. One recent case:
There are AFAIK no established religious exemptions for COVID given that there are two entirely different sorts of vaccines, so if there's a religious issue with Moderna, there's always Pfizer, and vice-versa. Even Christian Science practitioners, who believe in prayer not medicine for healing, are not religiously opposed to being vaccinated.
Is this the only vaccination you are attempting to receive a religious exemption for? Have you had the MMR, for example?
If you have a demonstrable religious exemption to the vaccine (which is dubious) the school may still not be able to accommodate you being on campus; and your recourse would be working with them to determine a reasonable accommodation.
The school is likely pushing back because there's virtually no religious organization pushing an exemption to the COVID vaccine, and even less so if you've been receiving other vaccinations.
Many schools didn't anticipate the number of individuals who would suddenly come up with a dubious religious objection to a vaccine that's highly effective against a dangerous, highly communicative disease. As such policies have had to be revisited.
