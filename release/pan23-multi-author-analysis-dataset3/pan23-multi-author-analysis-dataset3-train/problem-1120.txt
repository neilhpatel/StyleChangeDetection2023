This is great, and shows the power of NATO. Training up Ukrainians now isn't just useful in the short term - a future NATO-member (hopefully) Ukraine will be a valuable ally to every other country in the bloc, being recently battle-hardened, well-trained and well-equipped. A defensive pact means training any other member benefits you too.
I really hope that, after Ukraine has won the war, we start to learn more about the clandestine operations that allowed for all these remarkable sabotage achievements.
The interesting thing is that Ukraine’s strategic goal is draining the fighting power of the Russians with as little losses as possible, while also buying time for better weapons and more trained personnel to come online.
They have to fight the Ukrainians somewhere, so even if it's not worth the direct cost, they need to engage and destroy each others armies so it still makes sense to go ahead with the fight.
We know Ukraine will ultimately defeat tyranny, and the UK will continue to train and arm Ukrainian forces with the equipment they need.
