You didn’t say they had to track your hours, just clock in. I’m in the same position and my employer just uses a clock-in to know I was there for the day.
First, clocking in does not make one “functionally” an hourly employee. An hourly employee is one whose pay varies based on hours worked. A salaried employee is one whose pay does not. A time clock is often used for tracking hours worked for hourly employees in order to calculate pay, but it’s also used for other purposes. If the employer says you have to use a machine that takes attendance at the job site, that doesn’t transform your employment type.
Second, if you have at will employment which is typical in US jobs that aren’t unionized, you don’t have the ability to “challenge” your employer for making you do something you don’t think makes sense. They can require that each day you come in, sing the Marseillaise while hopping in one foot, then do a double cartwheel. If you don’t, they could fire you. It’d be pretty dumb on their part, but not unlawful.
Sometimes there are requirements that don’t make sense. For instance, time tracking might be required for an accounting or legal reason which you don’t know about. Or maybe there’s no good reason, but it doesn’t seem like a good battle to fight. Save it for some dumb thing they might do that really does diminish your quality of life and where other employees feel similarly.
