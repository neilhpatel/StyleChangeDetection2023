Washinon protects the employment of DV victims who request accommodations (safety/tell/counseling). It doesn’t sound like OP requested any accommodations until after they were fired.
If they just termed OP and didn’t say anything I wouldn’t think OP would have much in the way of a claim.
It would be a lot harder for OP if they hadn’t said anything, but if OP had told them about the issue a case could still be made out. In any event, they did explicitly say it, so this should be relatively easy.
The lack of anything in writing isn’t an issue, people pursue claims all the time where everything is verbal so the record is simply the former employee’s testimony against the word of the company. In those cases the judge or jury has to make a credibility determination to decide who they believe more.
Edit - The reason is it would be a violation of public policy to allow employers to take advantage of employees who are ignorant of the law. Even under the American’s with Disabilities Act, if an employer reasonably knows that the employee needs an accommodation they have to provide it, if the employer didn’t know that this was a DV issue then they could probably terminate OP for not being focused or something, but since they KNOW its a DV issue they cannot escape simply because the employee didn’t use some magic word.
No, you cannot escape your requirements to provide coverage simply because they didn’t ask, employers have an obligation to accommodate employees who they reasonably understand needs an accommodation.
