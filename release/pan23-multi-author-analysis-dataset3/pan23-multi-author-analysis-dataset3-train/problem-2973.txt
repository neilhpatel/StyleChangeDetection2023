I hate it but it makes sense. China wants to have a safe and consistent source of oil imports and Russia can provide that. Also China dislikes Europe for the century of humiliation, so China is more than happy to take actions that would annoy/piss of Europe.
This is not to say that China views Europe with seething hatred or intense animosity, but purely a propaganda tool to get their people to not blink twice at aiding Russia. And it may be an investment, as the more Russia is funded (TBH China probably just wants cheap accessible oil) the longer the war lasts, the more Russia is grinded down, the weaker it gets. This may or may not be a 4D chess move from China to give Russia just enough help to prolong the war and damage that it will do to Russia. I don't know what China can/will do with a greatly diminished Russian neighbor, but I am sure there are a few possibilities that all look good for China.
Not only that this will bring Russia closer to a vassal level rather than equal, just as China likes it.
First, China wants a friendly relationship with Russia regardless if Putin/Xi is the leader now or not.
And all Russia seems to ask for is China to say they aren't abandoning Russia. Sure why not give some lip services for essentially free energy and food.
