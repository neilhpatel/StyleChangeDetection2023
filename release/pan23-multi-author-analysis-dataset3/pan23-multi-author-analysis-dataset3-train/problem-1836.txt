This was my thought too. One person is not enough, purely for safety reasons. It’s not just about doing daily tasks - if one person can do the daily jobs alone that’s great, but you need two for safety.
In these situations, where are the higher ups? They should also be available during turnover times and come in if needed. It doesn’t sound like they’re doing enough to maintain staffing.
I don’t think so, if it’s a pattern I could see the requirement to have two staff onsite for staffing, ie, staffing only one employee at a time is chronically short-staffing and failing to anticipate for problems.
Typically, positions that require these sorts of strict, constant-staffing measures, are required to have 2 or 3 people being paid to do the job for every shift, and a few people 'on call', so that the odds of this happening are basically 0.
This isn't just about you, it's also about the people in your care; you can't realistically be expected to provide adequate care after 16+ hours of being awake. By the bosses enforcing such an expectation, they're not only potentially (definitely) abusing you, but also failing the people their company is charged with caring for.
Call the state agency that deals with licensing of these sort of facilities. They are likely out of compliance.
