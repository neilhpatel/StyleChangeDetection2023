It would depend on where you are geographically, but assuming "somewhere in Europe" as a decent constant, the first thing you'd notice would be the much smaller armies. (Byzantium does things very differently mostly because they were able to keep up their land tax system--u/hesh582 has an excellent answer right below mine as an informative contrast.).
These are generally made up of noblemen and their retinues, each of whom is more or less "self-funded" out of their estates instead of being paid from the central state fiscus like you are. This in turn limits the ability of the king to compel them to do things like "pay taxes" or "serve for 20 years", so there are few if any of the big, disciplined, combined-arms, professional-infantry-centered, expensive full-time armies going around. Medieval battles tend to involve hundreds to thousands; the Roman battles often saw twenty thousand or more combatants to a side. Without the kind of centralized state apparatus that the Romans had, the typical Medieval ruler simply can't afford the legions, and instead has to rely on warlords who swore their allegiance to him (and smaller warlords who swore allegiance to them, et cetera).
Great question! I'll answer this in two parts, as I see it: what physical building differences existed between a castle circa 1000AD and an earlier fort? And more importantly why didn't castles show up earlier in the post-Roman era?
What sort of fortifications were prominent before then, in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages? With the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the political fracturing of Western Europe, I'd imagine that skirmishes and wars of conquests between lords were quite common, so why did castles emerge only later?
