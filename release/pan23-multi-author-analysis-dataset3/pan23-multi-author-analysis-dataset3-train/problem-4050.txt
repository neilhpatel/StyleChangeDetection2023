I fortunately already have a freeze on my credit due to being the victim of a rental scam about a year ago, but as far as speaking with an attorney goes, my only concern is of course cost - as you can perhaps tell from my above description, I'm not exactly wealthy, raising kids and a sick mom or going to college don't pay, my whole family is pretty decently below the poverty line. Are there any avenues to seek at attorney that won't jeopardize things like payments for my mother's cancer or epilepsy medications or food - because these are the realistic cost/benefit analysis factors I'm having to consider here. Note that I do not qualify for a court appointed attorney as the court is not pursuing prison time.
I just sent off an email to my school's legal department asking if they have any services like this. Thank you for the tip! It would be great if this pays off, if not they may at least be able to point me in the right direction, as you said.
I actually looked into that - I have IOS and my tracking is off (damn my desire for privacy!) so there's no data there. However, I did recently purchase an ipad, so it's possible that that data tracking is not off on there, so I'm going to look into that, as well.
Just a thought- if you have Google Maps or a similar app on your phone that tracks and records your location data, it could help you establish an alibi.
