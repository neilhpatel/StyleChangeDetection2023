The university has specific requirements it must follow, for accreditation and federal student loan eligibility, in regards to accepting students. It is following those. No legal action you can take is going to alter that.
Setting that aside and assuming you were dropped from programs/no longer a student for the vast, vast, VAST majority of this 19 year period, your course selection and completion are ultimately upon you, not the school. You could have requested an accommodation for a disability. The school isn't psychic and can't just grant one, nor can that be done retroactively.
Regarding the course errors; if you let them stand for 12 years it becomes extraordinarily difficult to render you assistance.
I tried repeatedly over 12 years, including upon my initial discovery of the situation in 2002 through 2005 when my enrollment was put on an academic hold because of other classes that I did poorly in.
After my academic hold in 2005 I continued to try and get this situation resolved in person - roughly on and off again until 2014 when I was able to make some headway.
I last attended UCF in 2006, and from 2002 through 2006 I was on campus trying to resolve this situation.
