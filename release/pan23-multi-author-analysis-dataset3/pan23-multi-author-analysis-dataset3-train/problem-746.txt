If that wasn't your intention, well sorry. In this case, I agree, Qatar needs to be hold against the same standards and therefore pressured / forced to end their horrible foreign worker system.
Doesn't help that national governments / parties have the tendency to push unwanted politicians into EU institutions to get rid of them.
To criticise that is not hypocrisy. It is not as easily dismissed as "but in the past, you did that too".
Over the human history, slavery was practiced everywhere by nearly everyone. The fixation on the transatlantic slave trade is honestly odd in this context.
You think countries that are poor/somewhere in the middle right now didn't meddle in slavery? Didn't have a genocide or two? Don't have/had way bigger problems with corruption than the rich country club?
It's really nice to see corruption starts to get uncovered. It's a long way to transparent and fair "democracy". There's this german former minister Sigmar Gabriel who makes similar comments on how the conditions of the foreign workers have changed so much for the better. Always sounds so fishy...
