Plenty of off ramps between staying in his room and partying with election deniers from the previous administration and are in government. Kavanagh is not worthy of his position.
I think Kavanaugh should just lean into it, at this point. Nobody went after Trump with all his "indiscretions.".
Yeah. , supposedly an upstanding citizen, Supreme Court Justice in fact, partying with a supposed child trafficker, pervert having a few drinks and laughing at the rest of us...funny eh? Is the American public laughing? Of course none of this proven in court, (enquiring minds wondering why!)These two clowns need to be removed from their positions for “the crime of total stupidity”... Really how much do we have to put up with?????
So given all that’s (incredibly) transpired to this point, over the past 3 years...what do think the odds are of the Union collapsing, because people are tired of hearing and seeing all the crap being done and no consequence or accountability, has be had for any of it...You cripple the soul of a country, by failing to do what average law abiding and law respecting people, obviously think and want done in a country that’s being abused continuously, by one political party and group of seditionists. “Without Consequence”! The silent majority is done with this shit. Act and Act soon, or perhaps it’s too late and people no longer really care what you do... “complacency is what kills most things”, perhaps your already there ..you just don’t know it yet.......
This should be posted at the door of the house and Senate, let alone the Supreme Court...the question to ask is ...is this the Republican manifesto aka fascist MAGA, ....reasoning behind it?
