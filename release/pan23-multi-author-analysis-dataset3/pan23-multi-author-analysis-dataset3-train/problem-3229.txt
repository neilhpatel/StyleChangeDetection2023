Can you point me to a more discussion/community embraced (you know, since this is reddit after all) history sub, so I can mute/avoid this one?
It's fine if you don't like the subreddit, but please don't be dismissive of the contributions it's made to the field of public history.
Members of AskHistorians have participated as presenters at the 's national conference, (, actually) and at the conference of the .
We joke about it this way: It's like walking into a fine dining restaurant and throwing a tantrum because said restaurant doesn't offer chicken nuggets, despite there being a McDonald's right next door.
Because the McDonalds across the street has them, and there are a lot of McDonalds all over the city so they are obviously doing well and it is stupid trying to serve anything else or 'better' since they sell so many, so you should have nuggets!
It seems the argument is that since 99% of subreddits are drivel, this subreddit with rules to stop such drivel getting through must also be drivel, and should stop having rules to stop drivel.
