Unfortunately in NYC your neighbor harassing you doesn’t fall under the family court one or the Supreme Court one. For the criminal one you’d need him to be arrested. So you’re best bet is to go the police station with your evidence and try to speak to a supervisor or even maybe try to contact the DAs office if that doesn’t work.
I did both of them so far the police came 4 time just talked to him and DAs office keep telling that its police area of authority and they have to arrest hime first until we can process.
This guy has been here for along time and he is their tenant, the sw management owns the entire building, so I could argue that the threats are coming from another tenant which is their responsibility.
Well the rent mentions that they have to provide a safe habitable place and its not safe or habitable anymore this person constantly coming up and yelling and disturbing and threatening I have all the evidence recording ... and its been doing that for a long time to other tenants too for at least the last two tenants that I know but management company and landlord does nothing cause he is on rent control.
exactly each tenant when they come they have to limit their noise and make sure they do not concern others like me when I signed my lease, so I assume he has to do the same which now he is violating and its their concern since it was in my lease.
but I have the section that I have to adhere to building rules regarding noise and not disturbing other tenants and provide a safe environment for others.
