The frequency of tragic events has no bearing on you stating that having a mass shooting linked to allowing firearms in casinos would somehow be a good thing.
I don't disagree that casinos could be a valid place to ban firearms. That said, it's more likely that this was an unintended change when the judge in question enjoined the law stating that everywhere was a prohibited location outside very specific exceptions.
In other words, NJ used to have a law that banned carry in specific locations such as casinos. But when they passed their new law, they took out the language stating that certain locations are banned for carry and replaced it with language stating that all locations were banned for carry along with a list of places that are exempt from that provision. When the judge said "banning carry in all places is not okay," and enjoined the law, it doesn't revert back to the previous law banning carry in specific locations, that law just doesn't exist anymore. And when the law governing banning carry in certain places doesn't exist anymore, it falls back to "if it isn't explicitly banned, then it's allowed.".
Of course. Yet, it's legal to outlaw guns in courts & government buildings. These Republican 'judges' are a bad joke. This is why we can't have anything nice in this country..
