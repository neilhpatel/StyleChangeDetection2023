In the eyes of the Republicans, DeSantis has many advantages. He is younger and less divisive. With DeSantis, it is in a way Trumpism without Donald Trump. An alternative that is gaining weight in view of 2024.
Donald Trump wants to shrug off his responsibility for the Republicans' poor showing in the Midterms, but he will have a hard time avoiding the subject.
Best way for Trump to recapture some of the narrative here for his base would be to blame McConnell and establishment Republicans for the midterms. Talk about how badly the funding was distributed. Even claim they played favorites between the MAGA republicans and those darn RINOs.
You can even try to rope DeSantis into it. Claim he was in on it and that's why all the media suddenly started talking about him.
Conspiracies. The GOP and his base especially love them. And it feeds off their natural dislike for McConnell.
Eh Trump in the general is political suicide for the GOP. All he is politically now is a warhead to lob at the GOP. I hope he has a lot of success in the primary personally. Then crashes and burns.
