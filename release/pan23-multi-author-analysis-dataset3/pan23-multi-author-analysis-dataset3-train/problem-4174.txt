See, I don’t really want to live longer (just the population problem alone puts me off that), but being healthier up until the end would be great. Like if I could be basically an 80 year old with the general health of a 45 year old and then kick the bucket? I’m down.
Yeah, I’m not sure why I feel this way, but I always have. I’m 45 now and pretty much only feel committed to the next 20 or so, until my kid is grown and has a good sense of herself in life. I enjoy life, but the difference between 80 and 85/90 doesn’t really matter much to me. I would rather end on a strong note after a good life than dwindle and become a burden. If I didn’t have a child, my timeline would be much shorter.
I sometimes wish I'd been born 200 years later - imagine that. We'd be on Mars by then, perhaps starting to colonise the solar system. Ageing may well have been reduced, as per this article and people are living twice as long. AI and automation will be in a really interesting place by then. We may have discovered evidence of life elsewhere in the galaxy, causing all sorts of debates and discussions about the meaning of life and maybe finally religions will start to die out.
