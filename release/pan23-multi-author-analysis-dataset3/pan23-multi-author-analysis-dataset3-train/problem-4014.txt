Even giving an inch to Putin's nuclear threats only emboldens him and makes a nuclear strike more likely. NATO is only a threat to Russia's conquest to conquer neighboring lands, never have they been an offensive threat to the Russian Federation's leadership. Fuck being scared of Russia and their nuclear inventory...the west has at a bare minimum, the moral obligation to give Ukraine the military means to teach Putin a lesson, and halt his conquest to recapture Soviet territory.
lets be clear, NATO is afraid of escalation not because they are afraid of having to face Russia, but the holocaust that will come from a Russian nuclear attack after they lose their shit when they've been destroyed.
So much as two remaining working nukes get fired at some European capitals, or even detonated dirty in Ukraine or the sea, and that could fuck up the whole region for generations.
The nuclear implications seem pretty clear and make more sense to me than economic concerns, for why the US and NATO are wary of escalating.
I'm sure the motivations for not entering the war are more about geopolitical and trade implications than the threat of nuclear war. It's not the 1980's anymore.
