First is the context in which colonialism is discussed. Colonialism isn't usually taught as a topic by itself. It's usually taught in a history class, like western civ, or a political science/sociology course. If you're learning about colonialism in western civ, it will be discussed in the context of european/american history. Japanese colonialism doesn't come up because it's not relevant to the course's subject. If it's in the context of a sociology course, the course is probably focusing on American society, assuming you're american. Again, colonialism will be discussed as it pertains to the subject of the course as a whole, not as a stand alone topic itself. Also again, Japanese colonialism is not very relevant to american society and how colonialism shaped it.
It's also worth noting that, in terms of studying "colonialism" as a concept, it really does make sense to start with the European colonial expansion, as that is essentially what set forth the blue print that Japan would attempt to follow in it's colonial ambitions.
That's not a great answer though, certainly not up to the sub's standards, so let's go a bit further into reasons why Japanese colonialism isn't part of general discussions on colonialism.
I’m interested in knowing what sources discuss the reasons for Japanese colonialism and sight the driving force behind it as being posturing with The West. I browsed a few articles on a database but I’m not getting that conclusion from them. I may not be using the correct search terms though.
