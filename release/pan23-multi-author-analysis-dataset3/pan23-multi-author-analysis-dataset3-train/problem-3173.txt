In a situation where it's going to cost money either way, people have strong incentive to find a way to pay for lawyers if they're needed. For example if the landlord evicts OP then they'll have to look for a new apartment within a month and put the damage deposit down on that.
Furthermore, if your landlord really wants you to leave, they have no grounds for eviction and would need to do cash for keys.
Tell them if they try to evict you for calling the fire dept, that would be an illegal eviction and they'll just get in more trouble than they are in already.
Only if the person is able to avoid an illegal eviction and all the time it will take to fight it. Let's say tomorrow the landlord serves these lovely people with an eviction and then starts to make their lives miserable. Obviously that eviction is illegal because of the rules of New Jersey. Now they have to fight that eviction, which might mean going to court. They'll have to possibly deal with landlord harassment, which is a lot of effort. They could just wait around for the shoe to drop and refuse to leave.
Paying a lawyer is a layout of money that can reduce the amount of stress and time spelled to deal with illegal shit. Makes sense?
