(This is actually important since saying “charge my wife’s insurance” doesn’t do anything if he does not have his primary insurance from her. If he has his own insurance plus her, her’s may be listed as secondary).
Says he told them it was thru his wife's insurance. That he wasn't there for work and they told him that it didn't matter. That his employer made it clear all employees will have their test proceeded thru this specific company. Which seems wrong to me too begin with, but my biggest concern is this testing company have the results to human resources and then to his supervisor who then called him to tell him the results. Sounds like a very large HIPPA issue and big class action suit as it effects all company employees in this area.
I would assume he filled that out on paperwork at the hospital. And you'd think it wouldn't be but the company owner apparently is referred to as the law in the county. If he wants it, you will do it regardless of if you want to or not unless you want to end up shut down.
My coworker felt he was exposed and went to be tested. As to why he felt exposed I'm not certain. But you don't have to be mandated to get tested. And your first 2 statements are correct but instead of asking the hospital to send them, just told them what they will do whether they wanted to or not.
