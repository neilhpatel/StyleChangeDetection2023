Every single one I mentioned is legally a non-profit, whether or not you agree with that assessment.
I hate to bash Europe specifically here, but sports associations in Europe tend to have significantly higher problems with corruption than their American and Canadian equivalents. Perhaps being based in only two countries that are very closely aligned politically does help corruption, but all Iâ€™m saying is scandals in North American tend to more often involve executives betting on games, or deflated balls, not country-level bribes.
And you have clear regulations against corruption yet FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations on the planet, maybe just a smidge behind the International Olympic Committee.
Why don't they just defy FIFA by eating the fines involved for having their teams no show, then have them both play each other in a European stadium in a neutral country?
id imagine the consequence would be FIFA throwing a fit and doing something dumb, followed by FIFA representing the last 3 or 4 countries who havnt withdrawn yet the day after.
If FIFA tries to ban players or whole teams from the founding members of football, FIFA will die in record time, and at this point, they deserve nothing else. FIFA can be replaced in an afternoon. Football will stay, and should a replacement come along, i see no problems with sponsors and countries hopping over right away.
