Not sure where to start here, or where that rumor comes from. It makes various honestly strange assumptions, among others that.
Cheers! Same here but for pre-1250s Iberia . One issue for me with these type of questions (apart from those I mentioned) is when they span two continents plus multiple centuries - so this worked really well I find.
b) that there is some kind of homogenous group of Latinxs, certainly not the case. Note that current genetic studies e.g. of Mexican regions find an intermixing of various indigenous, European, African and even Asian groups depending on the region since early colonial times, which I suppose would make isolating specific population groups from within Spain even more complicated (speaking as a historian and no expert on genetics here);.
Now, I'm not a geneticist, so take this all with a huge grain of salt, but given the vast diversity of people's that have passed through the Iberian peninsula I wouldn't be surprised if some people who lived there were of Arabic descent at the time Spain was invading the Americas, but I would be very surprised if there were so many of them that they had a significant impact on the genetic makeup of American populations. The Arabs were only ever a small minority on the Iberian peninsula - even when they ruled the majority of it - and I'm doubtful that they could have had that much of an impact on the population, especially centuries after their dynasties had all disappeared.
