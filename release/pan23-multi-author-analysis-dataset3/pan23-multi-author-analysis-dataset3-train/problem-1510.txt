Besides that, he's a single man who is free to date and financially support whomever he likes. I'm really not sure why you would think this is something to go to the authorities about as certainly no crime is being committed here.
In few states would you be legally required to pay for his care, however his personal assets and estate would absolutely be on the hook for it. This is more likely to drain any inheritance you may be expecting than a paramour, frankly, but so long as this is his money, there is nothing you can do to stop him from spending it how he likes.
Legally? Likely nothing. If this is a former patient and not someone he is currently treating, it may not be a serious breach of professional ethics depending on the timeline, but if you wanted to report that you would go to the appropriate licensing board as opposed to the authorities.
It's not _entirely_ clear whether your father would be violating his licensing rules - we don't know what he practices (social work, psychology, and psychiatry are often licensed separately, for example), or what state he's licensed in, or how long passed between seeing his patient as a patient and any other relationship he may have had with her.
