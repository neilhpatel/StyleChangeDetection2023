The president of Peru has a legal precedent in the constitution to dissolve congress, so he tried, but was declared an enemy of the state by congress and the military made a big show of imprisoning this dastardly school teacher.
Given that immediately after Castillo assumed office the military and right leaning congress members harassed and threatened his cabinet and forced many to leave their office, blocked every piece of legislation proposed by Castillo and his party, and their natural aversion to his more progressive direction what with increased rights for workers and controls on corporations being a part if his plan; it is safe to say they impeached him because he was good for the people and bad for business.
From what I know, they accused him of corruption. Colluding with companies, giving favorable cabinet positions to his friends, and accepting bribes, all of which was based on very weak “evidence”. They tried and failed to impeach him twice, the third time they were going to succeed after paying off enough of the congress (“they” being the fujimoristas as well as the military).
A month ago the former president illegally tries to dismiss the legislature while they were starting a third round of impeachment, gets ignored and the legislature succeeds on the third attempt, he tries to flee and gets stuck in traffic. He’s now in jail.
