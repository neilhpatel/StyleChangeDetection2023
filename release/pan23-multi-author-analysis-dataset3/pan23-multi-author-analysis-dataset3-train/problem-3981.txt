Once you've opened a claim with your insurance, they should make you whole, regardless of what the other person is saying.
The insurer will then try and recoup their losses by going after the other party - but you don't need to worry about any of that. That's the insurance company's worry.
Work with your insurance company. Stop paying attention to the other company. Your insurance company has the same obligation to you.
If you have a liability only policy you are responsible for paying for your own repairs. After paying you can then try to collect on your own through a civil court case against the other party. This is why the other party should be motivated to be truthful about what happened because the consequence is they may have to pay out of their own pocket. Some people don't care though, or aren't bright enough to figure this out. They can also be dropped by their insurance provider if they're found to be lying.
If you carry collision insurance you will be covered for the damages, but you will responsible for paying your deductible.
If they go through their insurance provider for repairs the insurer will collect the deductible on their behalf and reimburse them once they receive the payment from the other insurance. Usually the insured is reimbursed first before the provider. In a lot of cases if the at fault party's provider finds their insured at fault they will go ahead and send payment for the deductible in advance before the final repairs totals are known if it is requested - this depends on the company though.
