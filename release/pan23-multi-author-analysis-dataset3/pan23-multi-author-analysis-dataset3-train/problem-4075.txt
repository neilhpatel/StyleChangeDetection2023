It’s is insanely accurate how true this is. Like every little point in this paragraph is 100% accurate about the current right wing. As ridiculous as them describing themselves to the tee while accusing the left is, what’s actually FRIGHTENING is that their supports who are a large part of the population eat this up by the boatload.
I actually have no idea if the Republican supporters are just going along this because it is the party line and in support or if they actually believe this drivel.
It's interesting that the cores of both the Republican and Democratic parties - both of which are owned and operated by the special interests that fund and control them - are being pushed by their respective "wings." In the case of the right toward Christian Nationalism Oligarchy Fascism. And, in the case of the left, toward doing what a government SHOULD do, represent and act in the interests of the populace as a whole. I hope, for all of us, that the left-wing (which I have to say, is really the center of what a representative democracy should be) wins.
