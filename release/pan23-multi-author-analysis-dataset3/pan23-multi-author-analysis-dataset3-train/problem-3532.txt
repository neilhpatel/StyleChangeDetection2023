This has been going through the courts for around 2 years. It's the court ruling that's just come out in favour of the settlers, seizing the land and evicting the palestinians who've been leasing it from the church and living there for 70 years.
The property owners themselves are evil anti-jews because......they own it and they made a complaint that their property rights were compromised?
Jews bought land in East Jerusalem, this is a crime punishable by death in Palestine, so Palestinians and their friends are outraged.
Palestine claims East Jerusalem, but it was never theirs. Even in '47, when the land was partitioned, Jerusalem and Bethlehem was 'corpus seperatum'. Israel is 'occupying' Jerusalem (both West and East), but the last de jure internationally recognized administrator of the land was the British Empire, and before them the Ottoman Empire. Neither exist today, though they have successors which make no claim to the land (and any claim by imperialist powers would be laughed out).
Palestine can say Jerusalem is theirs if it wants, but it was never Palestinian, it's been Israeli for 60 years and there's a Basic Law making it all but impossible for an Israeli government to partition it even if it wants to.
Either Palestine is a country has illegally occupied, or Israeli is operating an apartied government over second class noncitizens with no rights.
The Israeli government literally pays non-citizen non-Israeli's with Jewish heritage to move to Israel and grants them citizenship to live on land Palestinian families were ejected from after they've lived on them for hundreds of years. Jews need 'space to grow' and can constantly expand developments into land stolen from another country, but Palestinians can't expand into Israel.
