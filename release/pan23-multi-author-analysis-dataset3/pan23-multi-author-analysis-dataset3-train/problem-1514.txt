If the tenant won't pay, you should start in small claims court. It will cost you a lot less than pursuing a mechanics lien, and you can generally ask the court to include your filing fees in the judgement.
You had an agreement with the tenant, so you demand payment from the tenant. If the tenant had a deal with their landlord that's between the two of them, its not your problem.
Only problem I see is no contact, no signature, no nothing from the landlord. And, at least where I'm at, you have to pay a fee for each filing. Seems throwing good money after bad to even involve the LL unless you have some evidence of their involvement/approval aside from "bob's" word.
So, you're a contractor, and did a job with no agreement in writing ahead of time, no deposit, no nothing - just this guy saying "oh ya Bob said it's cool, he'll pay"?
Your agreement was with the tenant, assuming you never spoke to the landlord ahead of time and only relied on the tenant to play middleman.
Odds are the tenant will be the one who is liable to pay you since your agreement was with them. Then they will have a separate claim to be reimbursed by the landlord. But if you are going to court, go ahead and list both parties on the suit and let the judge sort it out. Small claims court is usually pretty cheap and you don't need a lawyer. This should be a fairly open and shut thing, you have receipts for your work and a copy of the estimate and the texts.
