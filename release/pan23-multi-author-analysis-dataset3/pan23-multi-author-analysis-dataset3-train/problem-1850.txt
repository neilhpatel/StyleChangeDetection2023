If the title (or loan) is in your name alone, congratulations, it's your RV. If he wants any more than 0% of it it will be either at your good graces, or after he sues you for it.
A lawyer might be a good idea just to get him to listen to reason and untangle this (and your business) cleanly. Notarizing is irrelevant here, you need a lawyer to draft a proper agreement. All notarizing does is prove that he's the one that signed it.
If it really went to court, it's possible they'll pour over how much value each person put into the RV and figure out an equitable split. However you took ALL the risk involved in that loan, and all the liability. It's your RV.
It sounds like the RV is legally yours. A lawyer could certainly help you in determining your rights to the hobby and any rights that may arise from a common-law marriage or living and working in the RV.
If he leaves with an RV you own, you may run into serious troubles if there is an accident, or a crime committed involving the RV, etc. Even if you are innocent of involvement, the stress, time and money required to deal with it can last years and be soul-destroying.
