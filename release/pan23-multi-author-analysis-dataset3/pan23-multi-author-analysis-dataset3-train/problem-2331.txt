Work with care credit going forward and in the meantime, find another dentist but do not tell them about your past experiences. You dont want them turning you away because they think you are a trouble maker.
I have a feeling that the resolution will be that somehow you get the trays and you pay the full 3500 (which is fair) or you pay a minimal amount to cancel the tray subscription and never do business again with this dentist.
I want a new dentist very badly, however, at this point I have paid for the full services of orthodontics at this practice and would owe monthly for services I would not be receiving. I have paid for the trays through the credit line that they set up for me without my knowledge.
I now have a $4000 line of credit through Care Credit that they signed me up for without my knowledge. They charged $3500 to that credit line and will not reverse that charge, whether or not the dentist will see me. So now I owe that payment monthly no matter what I do. If I walk away they get that $3500 and I have a monthly payment with no services.
