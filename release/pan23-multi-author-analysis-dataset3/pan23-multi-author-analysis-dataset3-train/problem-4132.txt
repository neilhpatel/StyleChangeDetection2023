It seems likely that there is some good reason to believe that OP has drugs or guns in their home. However, 2 raids in 3 weeks of the same address with no arrests is unusual. If they did it again it would really start to stretch credulity. A judge should not be signing off to bust a place up every other tuesday without results.
Official harassment does happen, but if these were the types of cops that were going to do that they would have "found" their drugs and guns the first time...
If anyone living in the house right now has a history of drug- or weapons-related offenses, or associates with people that do, then pursuing a claim against the police is very unlikely to succeed.
If you, your boyfriend, or whatever family members currently living in the house feel strongly that is unlikely, then you or they should speak to a lawyer.
In both instances the police presumably had a warrant, authorized by a judge, to enter and search the property. Presumably the police applying for the warrants presented sufficient probable cause.
You have the right under the Charter to not be subjected to unreasonable search and seizure. Needless destruction of your personal property during execution of a lawful warrant would be unreasonable, but determining what constitutes necessary versus needless is a subjective determination that would need to be made in court. If the police or crown attorney can present compelling arguments that their actions were necessary to properly search the premises for hidden weapons or drugs, that is likely sufficient.
It is possible that someone does not like you and are reporting you to police with some sort of 'evidence' that would make a warrant sufficient. At this point you NEED to hire a lawyer to represent your interests and find out why you are being targeted.
