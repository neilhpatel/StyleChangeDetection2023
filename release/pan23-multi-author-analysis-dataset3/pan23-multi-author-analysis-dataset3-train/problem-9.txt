Yep they are say it’s about importance of population creation and humanity. Yet even when gay couples say they want to adopt or use ivf and get married they’re banned from that too.
I mean why do their culture shuns LGBT to begin with if their religion doesn't prohibit it? In the west, resistance to LGBT always gets blamed on religion, and yet here we see in many Asian countries LGBT still gets shunned anyway even though their religions allow it.
As long as we both agree LGBT in Japan are growing and pressure had him fired/step down, and it's not just western people mad that's good.
I don’t think LGBT population in Japan is “growing” as much as people are becoming more comfortable with coming out as who they truest are.
LGBT polling in Japan and views in Japan have radically changed and is extremely accepted by younger generations, and all generations have seen uptick in polling as well as acceptance and calls for laws to change.
No one should compare a country to another country, but I love how you tried to go down the path of "Just accept that Japan hates gay people stop judging them from a western perspective", dude Japanese people, the PM and others in the country were mad about it enough they got fired.
