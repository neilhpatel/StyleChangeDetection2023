Correct. There are really three majority parties in the U.S. - Republicans, Democrats and Eligible Non-voters.
The fact that power changes hands between Republicans and Democrats by such small margins is indication that the status quo will continue to prevail.
What’s even more frustrating, is that based on the fact that the GOP has dominated in SC for so long, I would assume it was a policy pushed through by our conservative legislators. Then, when it comes time for them to actually live up to the policy THEY wrote or having their completely unqualified but Republican candidate, they just totally ignore it. It’s truly maddening.
Oh yeah that’s what’s infuriating. I’m a political science major and so clearly do all the research and she won’t just listen to me when I tell her things with backed up evidence. Also, nailed it with the religious and racial elements. Great contract negotiator though 🤷🏻.
Tried showing that video to my mom and she tried to explain to me that “he was saying it’s silly to keep doing things as we are.”? I mean I made her listen to the whole two minutes of it this utterly bugfuck tirade and she still tried to carry water for him. She said “oh well I didn’t know about all that,” when I told her, with evidence mind you, about the abuse allegations. She claimed the women were lying about the abortion accusations and that he wasn’t a lunatic suffering from CTE even when I showed her where Walker himself admitted to struggling with Dissociative Identity Disorder. She claimed he’d be better than that other guy (Rev. Warnock) anyway. She’s a smart woman so it’s very sad to see the conservative brain rot that makes people like her actively supporting the destruction of our political system.
