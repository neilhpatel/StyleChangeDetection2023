We intervene and its going to open the flood gates for all the bad that seems to always come during foreign interventions. The people of Haiti will suffer.
Haiti is a lost cause. They offer nothing to the world but poverty, there is no incentive for anyone to ruin their own reputation and send their own soldiers home in caskets to try and remove shit out of a sewer. And they will just get mad at whoever comes to try and help them, not to mention the problems with foreign soldiers bringing rape and disease. Haitians just need to find an equilibrium state with their gangs, because sending them money so it can be stolen is not in the interest in anyone outside of Haiti.
honestly at this point they really fucking need it Haiti is a clusterfuck and its people need more help than the sad excuse for a government can provide.
All I can do is raise awareness on the situation, donate to relief efforts and support the people of Haiti through this ordeal.
I'm not blind to the human suffering of the situation, but will an intervention actually solve things?
A provisional government can be established by the UN until the country has stabilised enough to hold proper elections. It wouldn't be the first time it was done.
If they ask for help, then the international community should answer that call, but nost Haitians are against it and rather distrustful of foreign intervention (for good reasons too).
All I know is that most Haitians are against intervention and are very reluctant to trust other nations, especially the US and France.
