I understand your mother has substantial injuries and needs that match them. But her recourse is worker's compensation, and she needs to focus on that instead of wasting time trying to circumvent it.
I assume you mean that she has a worker's compensation attorney. If she is dissatisfied with their ability to get her post-hospital treatment and permanent disfigurement compensation, she can get another.
Worker's comp is a "sole remedy, no-fault" system. It doesn't matter if her employer was negligent in training her, and it doesn't matter if she was negligent in her operation of the machine.
No matter how much upper-case emphasis you put on her gruesome injuries, worker's compensation is her sole remedy for those injuries.
Pain and suffering is not covered through worker's compensation. Worker's compensation is also the "exclusive remedy" for her injuries, meaning she cannot sue regarding this accident. Unfortunately they're all correct, there's no other recourse. I'm so sorry for the accident. That sounds terrible.
