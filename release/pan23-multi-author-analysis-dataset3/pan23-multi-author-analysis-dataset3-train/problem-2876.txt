This is mostly accurate, I deal with UPS on a daily basis with my job since I work in logistics. We have customers who instruct us not to add additional coverage and have us ship $3,000 3D printers, in general most packages arrive without problem but there is still something like a 5% chance it will get damaged or lost and in that case they just have us ship out a replacement. There are costs for getting additional coverage and adding it to every package is more expensive than occasionally having to send out replacements.
However, I would like to point out that it is not "insurance" as actual shipping insurance is much easier to deal with. Unfortunately, due to the laws there is a limit to the liability a carrier is responsible for when it comes to damaged or lost package. When you are purchasing additional coverage you are just purchasing additional coverage that expands the liability above those limits. But it only kicks in if the carrier determines they are liable for the damage or lost package.
Title: UPS broke my stuff, covered it up, and refuses to pay for the damaged item or shipping I paid for.
In this instance, there isn't much OP can do as UPS will only deal with the shipper when it comes to the damage. If the shipper didn't do properly package the items then UPS is going to say it was the shippers fault. All they can do is demand a refund and go after the shipper to get their money back. If the shipper feels it's UPS' fault they would have to sue UPS but that is going to be impossible.
And also ups store is separate from the UPS company so it's very difficult to deal with claims. Best to just wash your hands with it and fresh with eBay.
