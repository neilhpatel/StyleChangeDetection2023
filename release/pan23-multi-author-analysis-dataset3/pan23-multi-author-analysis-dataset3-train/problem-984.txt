Are you really serving the public good? I'm trying to enrich a historical PC game with interesting real-life personages. I really want some help on this from legitimate historians, and if some would like to help me, why should you prevent me from asking?
On the whole, our legitimate historians tend not to choose to answer questions like this. If you're trying to enrich a historical PC game, I'd suggest you ask instead about books to read to better understand this setting beyond the stereotypes; these books will, of course, give you people to include as well as a more accurate understanding.
Yes, you would get bad responses, and we would remove all of them for breaking the rules. What we're trying to tell you is that if we were to let this question stand, we would probably delete all of the answers, so the only way for you to get a list of names would be to ... post in the Friday Free for All.
If you really just want to fight here rather than actually get an answer, then fine. But you're not "showing us" by refusing to play by the rules. Feel free to try /r/history instead.
If you really just want to get examples to include from our users, then all you have to do is wait until the Friday Free for All thread gets posted tomorrow. This kind of question is allowable in there.
