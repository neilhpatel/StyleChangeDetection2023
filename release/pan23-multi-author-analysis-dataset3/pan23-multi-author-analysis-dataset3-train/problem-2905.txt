Yeah I think it just kinda leaves the door open for China to attack nuclear armed nations with conventional arms and not start a nuclear war, the reason the U.S. doesn't codify the NFU is because of those possibilities.
The reason why the US doesn't codify the NFU is because we used nukes first (Hiroshima and Nagasaki), so what kind of counterparty would find such a declaration credible?
This didn’t really answer my question… you’re just saying “nuclear posturing” like that’s a meaningful statement, and pointing to a list of countries the USA had war or conflict with.
Here maybe bold will help your reading comprehension: "The US used nuclear posturing and threats" And if you don't know remotely any history about those conflicts, you can't just say "it didn't happen." You just don't know what you're talking about. Which is why i recommended a book you could read that describes it well AND then you would know what you're talking about!
The united states regularly uses nuclear posturing and first strike threats in geopolitical negotiation. A NFU policy would take the fangs out of the threat. That is why it isn't codified.
