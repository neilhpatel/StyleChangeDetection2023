Good luck. Maybe next time consider not being selfish and trying to exploit a system already filled with lies. All you're doing is hurting people who truly need the assistance.
You tried to hide your dog from your landlord and only followed the correct process when you got caught. If you truly had a need for an ESA, why would you not have gone through the process legitimately?
Where did you get this ESA paperwork? Did you get it from a doctor who is currently treating you for the condition or disability that he is prescribed to alleviate?
That's not quite what I asked. Did you find this person online and pay them for this paperwork? Or is it your actual doctor who's actually and actively treating you?
Yes it’s my actual doctor. He’s not the doctor that originally approved me because I moved across the state two months ago and found a new doctor to keep prescribing me my anti depressants and found a new therapist. So I didn’t want to say they were the ones treating me the ENTIRE time because I just moved.
