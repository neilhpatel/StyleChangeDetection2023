Putin (aka little tiny coward) is grasping for anything to turn HIS personal mistake and miscalculation throughout his attempt at genocide.
One Russia expert told the Mirror: “Whatever Russia has in mind to inflict on Ukraine the Kremlin appears to be expecting retaliation on its own soil from Ukraine or the West.
This is interesting given Ukraine’s self defensive posture throughout along with NATO’s policy towards Russia and its unprovoked aggression against the Ukrainian people and government.
I do not support the decision of the government to invade Ukraine, especially under the premise of “defending Russian people in DPR/LPR” - if the threat was indeed real, there were other options of saving them. Their claims of “saving brotherly nation from the hands of Kiev Regime” are laughable, too. As a Russian citizen, I do not see any outcome as a “win” for common folk.
Nothing out of ordinary, believe it or not, gas explosions happen here (in Russia) every year. The current war has just put us under international spotlight, so every boom seems like a conspiracy to redditors.
The conflict between Russian Federation and Ukraine would happen anyway, especially after Maidan, although I expected it to happen in my 40s - I haven’t hit 30 and yet here we are.
