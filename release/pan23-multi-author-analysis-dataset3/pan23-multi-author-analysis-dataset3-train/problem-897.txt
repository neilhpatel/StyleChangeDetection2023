Not according the the alleged mainstream media like CNN. What really poisons the progressives is that they have only small media outlet, The Young Turks network that is advocating for progressive policies while the rest including MSNBC and the rest declare progressive policies as fringe or extreme. Also they equate the far left to the far right as if those two poles are equally as bad or detrimental to the voters.
I couldn’t think of a better way of indicating the left extreme of the political spectrum in congress. Whereas the word has been hijacked to mean nutcase.
One of the unfortunate elements of political discourse at the moment is that it’s virtually impossible to discuss the political views a person holds without it being attached to a character assessment of the person holding those views. I know they are related in some way, but in many conversations healthy dialogue with differing perspectives can exists between quite normal people.
The main issue is the binary descriptor for people’s political positions. Political philosophy is so much complex and nuanced than the Right and Left monikers we assign to people.
My impression is that this is an asymmetrical problem: leftists tend to label rightists as morally at fault, whereas rightists tend to think leftists are just irredeemably stupid — and this has been stable over decades. Am I wrong?
