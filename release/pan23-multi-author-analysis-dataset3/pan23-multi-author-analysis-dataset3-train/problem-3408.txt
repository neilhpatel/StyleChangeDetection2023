Nato need not retaliate for anything short of a deliberate attack, and even the looniest redditor isn't going to seriously argue that Russia is going to fire a multimillion rouble cruise missle at a polish tractor.
While ultimately Russia's fault, Ukraine's immediate assertion that Russia fired the missile and the Baltic states calling for immediate NATO action is dangerous and irresponsible.
It also needlessly undermines Ukrainian credibility, introduces cracks in NATO and provides fodder for Russian apologists in the West.
I mean if it was Ukraine then they just killed a lot of their credibility but trying to blame Russia and bring nato into this. I understand that Russia started it but drawing others into a war that they are not responsible for through devious means is gross.
NO, you just essentially gave justification for Ukraine to bomb another country and try to blame it on Russia in hopes it incites war with NATO which would probably expand into a world war most likely the last war to ever be. If Russia does bomb another country purposely fine go to war otherwise avoid if possible. I sympathize with Ukraine but there is a line. They are receiving Billions from us already.
