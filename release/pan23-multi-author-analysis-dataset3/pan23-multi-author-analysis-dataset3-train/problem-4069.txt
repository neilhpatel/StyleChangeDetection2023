Article 1, Section 5: Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members.
I doubt this would work; they wouldn't have standing, and the Constitution says that "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members" -- I'm not sure the courts would want to get involved.
If the Speaker decides they want to seat Santos anyways and the party in power in the House supports that decision, there's no political recourse until the next election. A lawsuit against the elections board that certified the election/candidates qualifications may get the election results thrown out, though.
That’s not the qualifications to be a House rep though. He had to be a citizen for 7 years, so one of his constituents (or his opponent) likely have standing to sue to elections board to disqualify Santos if those requirements aren’t met.
No because there's a fundamental difference, if Santos actually isn't a citizen he is legally not allowed to take office. If there had been voter fraud in 2020 I would support it being fully investigated and legal remedies taken, Trump lost 52 lawsuits about the 2020 election because he had no evidence.
Edit: Also Santos being ineligible for office would not mean his opponent wins, I think it would be treated the same as a candidate dying in office, there would be a special election. Trump was trying to actually get the election results reversed, again fundamental difference.
