If the new fence is removed, the removal cost would be on the neighbor, but the replacement fence would be the responsibility of both home owners, assuming the neighbor follows the correct procedure this time.
I agree. However, that fence is no longer available for inspection. Your neighbor could assert that the fence has fallen down numerous times over the years and that, this last time, it was just the last straw. As the original fence is now gone, it will harder to prove that half the fence was almost new and in good shape.
We have pictures of the fence from before it fell over, and pictures of the good half after we rebuilt it a year and a half ago. In the past, we sort of alternated doing any minor fixes that were needed, with us doing more of the major fixes. The half that was rebuilt was 100% our cost, so we've already paid to fix half the entire fence.
You can tell them that you would gladly pay 1/2 cost of the "repairs" to the old fence. Period. A neighbor taking on the costs to replace the entire fence is 100% on them.
