Thanks but two problems. My brother didn’t take photos since it was just an engine problem. Also he doesn’t have upgraded credit card that would serve as primary insurance so he has to go thru his car insurance only. In unlikely event his car insurance won’t help the credit card company should. But one thing he is good at is being patient…he didn’t even care about this letter. Was going to throw in garbage because so ridiculous. I pointed out he will have a collection agency chasing him in a few months if he ignores.
Thanks. So that would require they provide specifics on damage, parts, labor etc? EDIT I am not sure it applies to Sedgwick as adminstrator for Budget, but the FTC website on that FDCPA reads like it probably should. They are not a debt collection agency per se, but rather a huge claims administrator. Thanks.
You are welcome. Not much info I could give, I was never a damage specialist and only worked on a couple of US cases. Also I was laid off at the beginning of covid wave 1 and a lot has changed since then (internally and process wise), but these should still stand.
