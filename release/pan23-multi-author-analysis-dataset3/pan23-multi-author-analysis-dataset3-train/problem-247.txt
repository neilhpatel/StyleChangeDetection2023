Likewise, could the Republican's two faced double standard of pillorying Hillary Clinton for her private email server.
I don't know how much more vast or right-wing you can get than the Republican Speaker of the House abusing his power to invent phony, two faced investigations into Hillary Clinton for the purpose of destroying her political career.
It would be far weirder if the party in power of congress opposite to the presidents party didn’t conduct any investigations.
The investigation into Biden is literally a question of whether he was selling access to the Obama administration.
Ideally if there’s suspicion of criminal behaviour it should just be referred to the DOJ and they should take it from there. The idea congressmen are supposed to be acting like law enforcement seems ridiculous to me.
It would suck to be subpoenaed to congress. There is a expense process but it is not reasonable. If you are not a wealthy person who can just afford to take whatever time off and spend a week in DC, its a huge pain.
