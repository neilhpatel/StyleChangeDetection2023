However, in the (seemingly unlikely) case your son's father files for custody, you may have to go back to Texas (and bring your son back) to appear in court and argue why it's in the best interest for your son to remain where you two plan to relocate, and the courts may decide that your son must live in within reasonable distance of his father.
Then you have primary physical and legal custody over your son, and you do not need to notify your son's father about your plan to move.
Edit: I will add that you should probably file for custody once you've established yourself in NC, partly to avoid the father surprising you by requesting custody or trying to interfere in your life later on.
If you're able to contact him and get his consent, then he can fill out a form to allow you to get your son a passport. (DS-3053).
If you legitimately try and are unable to locate or contact him, then you can fill out a form explaining the situation and requesting a passport anyway (DS-5525). You can also file for custody and once you satisfy the court that you can't locate the father, you may be able to get full custody.
The father is on the birth certificate, we were never married and paternity wasn't established. There was never a custody agreement or child support order. After we split up when my son was a baby, I just didn't want anything to do with the father and didn't want to pursue any legal remedy due to fear of retribution.
