Turkey had applied for candidacy years ago and that was revoked when it became clear that Edregon’s policies did not respect the impartiality of the judiciary or of the press. So it can be revoked, it’s just that the EU takes educated guesses on who likely a country is to clean itself up after membership.
The EU requirement is the big thing. If they didn’t make moves to embrace western democracy and remove political corruption they would not be joining the bloc after the war.
Losing your country’s sovereignty to Western influence is itself - corruption, a betrayal to your people and your state. You think all this support is for free? Nothing? No future favours? Cmon. Zelensky is choosing the lesser of two evils (in his opinion, the west), but don’t have any illusions, Russia and the west are both evils in this scenario, Ukraine doesn’t have a winning outcome for herself or her people. Zelensky is selling her soul.
If death makes you happy there’s plenty of that around. Considering all soldiers “imperialist pigs” kinda shines through your consideration of the whole picture, which unfortunately looks narrow.
