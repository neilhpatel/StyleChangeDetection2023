There is no way to make an agreement to avoid child support. Even if she agrees to it, but later files for it, the agreement will not hold up. Even worse, if she ever files for welfare benefits, she has to assign her right to child support to the state.
Edit: in Texas, you may seek termination of her parental rights under Tex. Fam. Code 161.001(b)(1)(T) with a conviction for sexual assault under Tex. Penal Code 22.011.
There are several cases where minor boys have been raped by adult women and still made to pay child support. So even if the baby is the result of rape, you may be on the hook for child support.
As an example, if you want the baby put up for adoption but your rapist won't allow it, under Tex. Fam. Code ยง 161.001 (b) the court can order the termination of her parental rights. But doing so requires a conviction for sexual assault.
You were drunk and unable to consent to sex. She raped you. You have texts where she admits to having sex with you while you were drunk. File a police report.
What state are you in? Laws vary from place to place, but some places exempt you from child support in the case of rape.
You were the victim here. If you don't want to file a police report you don't have to. But without doing so you won't be able to have the legal protections that come with your rapist's conviction.
