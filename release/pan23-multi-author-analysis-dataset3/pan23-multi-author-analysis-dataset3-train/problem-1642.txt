You could contact the creditor again to see if they will agree to a modified payment plan, but keep in mind that they are under no obligation to do so because you had failed to pay them back for so long. You can also try to save up enough money to pay the debt in full as well.
The next step is likely that the creditor/plaintiff will move to garnish your wages until the judgement is satisfied.
Your creditor is likely hoping the judgement will motivate you to come to an agreement with them about repaying the debt. If you have any capacity to enter into a payment plan with your creditor it's a good idea to reach out to try to come to an agreement.
Now that your creditor has a judgement against you they have more powers to collect on the debt. They have 10 years to collect on the judgement from the day it's registered with the court.
As for bankruptcy, it would clear most judgements, but you should speak to an insolvency lawyer for specific advice.
You CAN file for bankruptcy, but you'd have to be eligible to qualify for bankruptcy. Definitely see a bankruptcy attorney if you plan to go this route.
