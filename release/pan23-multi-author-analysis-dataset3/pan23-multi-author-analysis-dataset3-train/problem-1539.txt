The Chicago Residential Landlord Tenant ordinance states, in section 5-12-110(b) states that if the landlord fails to deliver possession of the dwelling unit to the tenant in compliance with the tenantâ€™s rental agreement, i.e. on the date the lease started, the tenant can withhold rent until possession is delivered and the tenant may either (1) terminate the rental agreement, with written notice to the landlord or (2) demand the landlord give the tenant a key (aka deliver possession) in writing.
I would recommend getting it in writing that your landlord is refusing to provide you a fob and then send that and a copy of your rental agreement to the property management so that you can make a case that you have tried to go the proper route by having to condo owner purchase a fob and that they've refused.
I work for an apart-hotel company, and all of our property partners have secure buildings that are accessed either through a fob or a code. Providing access instructions to the building goes hand in hand with giving access to the actual apartments being rented. Having to rely on a 24 hr security guard to let you in does not sound like you have possession of the apartment, it sounds like you are a guest of a resident.
