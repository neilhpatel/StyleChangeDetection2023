It could be someone else with the same name and they just got the wrong address, or the victim lied and gave your name and address. Do you know anyone who may have been assaulted recently who might have blurted your name instead of their own in a moment of panic after being traumatized? Or someone who is convinced you are being abused and might file a (false) report on your behalf?
Let your lawyer contact them instead of you. It's possible they filled out the wrong form (or someone filed out another form wrong that led to the message that was delivered to you) and someone actually made a complaint about you. If it's not a case of mistaken identity, it could be something like a neighbor seeing you standing naked in your kitchen through an open window and thinking you were doing it on purpose, or a delusional person imagining a situation that never took place. Let your lawyer handle it.
Thats the plan, going to let my lawyer handle this. I live in a high rise and it is entirely possible someone saw me naked, as I dont draw the blinds all too often. Not that I walk around in the nude often, but it has happened.
There was a section at the bottom of my little note that reads "Pursuant To Act 155 of 1992, The below person acknowledges receipt of the notification of victim services form: XXXXX" (The X's being a number).
If anything I dont think its serious. With a night of sleep under my belt I am beginning to wonder if this is a request to speak because they believe I may have seen something suspicious. Time will tell.
I thought this could be the case as well. However, I can also attest that I have not been the victim of any sort of assault.
