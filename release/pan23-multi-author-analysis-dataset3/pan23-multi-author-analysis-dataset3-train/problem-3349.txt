It's all a headache, this treading thin ice around Russia, and red tape bureaucracy preventing countries exporting other countries stuff - whilst they all deliberate, needless Ukrainian lives are being lost.
Wouldn't you want to be proud of being first to stand up to Russia with a big fuck you and supporting Ukraine? I know it's logistically more difficult than that, but stop pussy footing around Russia - they're already exposed for what they are. Decide now, or later isn't going to change what Russia may or may not do.
I seem calculating and cold but i think we hold Back so russia gets grinded down slowky and not stompt in in go. So they Lack the will and Power to lauch atomik or further attaks in general.
I myself think thats bullshit and they should just free all our animal themed warmachines already so they can roam Ukraine and hunt russians like they where intended. Morally there cant be a question after all the warcrimes of russia. Hell they clearly state all the time in TV they should just destroy some Nato countrys every week. They are enemys and should bei treathed as such.
The other one would be a reminder of weakness and incompetence. No one wants to do revive acregime Like that.
