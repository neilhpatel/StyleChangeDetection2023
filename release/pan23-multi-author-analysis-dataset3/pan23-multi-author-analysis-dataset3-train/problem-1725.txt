It's quite a hairy matter. 48 states have laws banning car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Tesla appears to have taken the novel approach of... completely ignoring these laws and doing it anyway. They're being sued in quite a few states over this, and that litigation is still ongoing. Other manufacturers aren't eager to test those laws in the same way that Tesla is.
It's becoming apparent that this model won't work for Tesla or other makers as there are not enough service centers to service its cars. What you think is bad only for dealerships will be also bad for customers if they can't get their cars serviced. My closest service center is 2h away and I'm in no way far from a bigger city. Good luck expanding sells to these areas.
Dealerships provide more than just sell you a car. Corporations such as Tesla want to increase profits by not providing even remotely close service to it's customers as those through dealerships.
If you add back Toyota dealer profits they have margin of something like 43%, which is higher than Tesla.
