It's astonishing. Most hypocrites at least try to sound reasonable, even when the reason is bullshit. Like when mcconnell said it was okay to block Obama's SC nomination because it was an election year, but when he wanted to push through barrett he said "oh it's different when the presidency and senate are controlled by the same party". He knows it's bullshit, we know it's bullshit. But at least there's a flimsy reasoning. This guy just blatantly says "i can do this but you can't" or "what i did was not a crime, but she did the same thing and she needs to be punished for it.".
This is just funny. After all the heartache he caused while being POTUS and saying dumbshit things it’s nice to just chuckle as the imbecile flails about.
This is Trump’s stupidity and his ego talking. He’s threatened by DeSantis, so he will try to discount him in any way he can. No matter how idiotic it sounds.
Now don’t take this as me supporting DeSantis. I actually think he’s worse than Trump. DeSantis is a calculated fascist who knows he can use fascism to control his base. Trump is an egotistical moron who’s not fascist, even his most dire supporters are.
As that’s unacceptable, the party will ALWAYS follow trump. They don’t care about him, they just can’t stop him in any way.
If he tells his voters to stay home, which he will if the republicans do ANYTHING against him, he will make it so the republicans lose in every single state. Which would be the end of the party.
