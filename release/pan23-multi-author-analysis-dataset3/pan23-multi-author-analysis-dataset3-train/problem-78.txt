She's overwhelmed. We're trying to figure out a game plan. I'm going to try and get ahold of (or help her get ahold of) an actual detective in either Missouri or Tennessee tomorrow. At this point she's just focused on filing a report and she's frustrated that neither police department is allowing her to do so.

Or she and the attorney can decide it's worth talking to the ex first and seeing if he can get this conduct to stop, with the understanding that if it doesn't, she'll pursue a protective order and/or the misdemeanor charges.
I'm really sorry to hear this has happened to your girlfriend and I hope you're able to find a way to get this behavior to stop and gets legal justice as well as support to process the situation.
