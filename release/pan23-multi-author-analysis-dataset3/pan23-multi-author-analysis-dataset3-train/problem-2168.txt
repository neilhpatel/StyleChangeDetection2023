If you want fast elections, nationalize them, enforce a certain number of polling places scaled to the population of a given precinct, and use machines. It's literally the only way. It's not a mystery why Brazil can tabulate votes within a few hours of polls closing.
The presidential election in 2000 took a month to resolve and required the Supreme Court to intervene. This assertion that elections have always been smooth up until recently is completely fraudulent.
Wouldn't that remove all bullshit theories of election fraud? At the end of election night we would know the results. If early voting starts in october there is no reason they wouldnt be counted before election day, mail in ballots should be counted as they are received, and should be in before 2 days before the election.
If you literally allowed elections officials to count early voting and mail in voting as it happens you would see results within hours of the polls closing. Florida has that system where votes are counted as they happen and they produce results within hours. The US already has electronic vote counting if GOP state houses in states like PA didn't intentionally make early and mail in voting hard to count then we wouldn't have this issue.
Read the article- Mailed-in ballots take longer to count, donâ€™t always arrive at election offices before Election Day, and often are put at the back of the line.
If you send in the ballot within a week of it being due it will arrive, and if you really care, send it in early or drop it off.
