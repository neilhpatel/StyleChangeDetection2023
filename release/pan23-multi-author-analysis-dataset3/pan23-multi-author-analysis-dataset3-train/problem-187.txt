The HOA will argue that you can use an invisible fence, a stake-and-lead, or just go out with your dog every time you want to take the dog outside (what people in cities and apartments do).
The common dog containment solution for the region seems to be invisible fences, which wouldn't solve the distraction issue, but I'm not sure how to explain to the HOA what work my service dog would be doing off-leash while I'm in the back yard & how distractions would limit that work. Haven't been able to find other examples of how this is best handled online.
Service animal, for alert & notification. Off-leash would be necessary, as he would have to be trained to go inside & push a button during emergency as one of the tasks.
I'm not looking to contain, more to remove potential distractions. Basically, an alert & notification dog should be paying attention to me instead of other people/wildlife. That works if he's on-leash attached to me, of course, and we have him trained for our current back yard (fenced). Off leash in an unlimited area would be interpreted as "fun time" instead of "work time" for a dog, so breaking line of sight is an important tool to direct focus.
