Oh yes you did Don't play innocent Innocente like a little Infantino We're wise to you, you hypocrite football fan.
But the days of the World Cup being held in democracies seem to be over. Hosting the World Cup is great for political leaders (especially if they're corrupt), but it sucks for the people. So countries where the people have a say in what happens aren't going to host it.
Well, "ever" is a long time, but there are plenty of hellhole dictatorships elsewhere, so it should be a while before Afghanistan or Iran get a turn.
It's not about Middle East it's about these dictators running their country as authoritarian Theocrats to hold on to power but at the same time want to be glorified. If Middle East has a functional democracy with decent human rights, people will not have problem with who ever is hosting.
Also, If you call the world news pool for an international event while you have never had any free journalism in your own country a lot of shit is going to come out that you will not like. So Qatari's just need to be prepared.
The problem is we are not allowing the evil in the name of religion to come out, so they hide behind the oil money and keep financing these religious bodies all over the world and keep holding on to their victim hood.
Me thinking, Not just the middle East, there are other Fundementalist Theocratic authoritarian regimes all around the world... Let me google and find out... Holy crap, it's all just in the Middle East!
So the big distinction you are trying to make is it’s not the actual dirt/ground the “Middle East” sits on but the fact that it’s filled with authoritarian theocracies….
