Second, and importantly, once a state has taken jurisdiction over a case, another state cannot claim jurisdiction until either (1) everyone involved moves out of state or (2) the original court gives up jurisdiction (and some others that probably aren’t relevant).
Assuming you have a custody order issued by a WI court, the NJ court should transfer the case back to WI.
Filing a request for custody does not give you custody. They would have to go tot court to get custody. So the earliest they could get custody would be at the court date in August. Of course NJ is not the correct jurisdiction as your child has lived in WI for at least 6 months so they would need to file in WI. Also, there would need to be proof of their claims to actually take your child away, courts don't generally just take away a child based on one person's story.
First, the proper court to hear a custody case is the child’s “home state.” This is the state where the child has lived for the past six months. If the child has lived in NJ for the last four months and they’re trying to keep the kid until August then they could claim NJ is the proper state.
The child has been in NJ for six months, plus or minus a few days. NJ courts may say that the child is now a NJ resident and NJ has jurisdiction, not WI.
I recommend hiring a lawyer in NJ to attend the custody hearing. He should ask for the court to grant him his fees, because the NJ court granting a hearing is way out of line.
