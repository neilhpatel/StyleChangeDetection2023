If what you really believe in is hierarchy, with yourself somewhere in the upper half, then all of these priorities look harmonious. My ability to enrich myself, my ability to break rules while demanding that you follow them - those things are what's best for my notion of "the country.".
It will never happen. Speaker controls committee leads and what legislation makes it to the floor. There is no way a majority essentially gives up their majority for that on purpose. Now, if the 20 or so obstinate Republicans vote "present" for one round instead, that would really fuck them up to the point McCarthy might try to stop the count immediately.
Mr. McCarthy could win the speakership with fewer than 218 votes by persuading lawmakers who do not want to support him to instead vote “present” or to not vote at all.
If enough Dems vote “Present” instead of for a person, then McCarthy can get a plurality without any additional votes. I don’t see this happening this week, but if someone with a love for the country was trying to lick between loyalty to their party or complete financial meltdown of the US economy, I think some of those bleeding heart liberals might cave.
Edit: In return for the present votes, I’d expect McCarthy to turn right around and leverage that bleeding heart to make them choose between complete financial melt down or something wantonly brazen and cruel, like jacking up Medicare insulin prices and sending the money to murder puppies of disable vets.
