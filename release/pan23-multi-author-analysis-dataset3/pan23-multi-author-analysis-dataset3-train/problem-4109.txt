Moved from Chicago over the summer to Pittsburgh. Voting yesterday was so satisfying. My vote was weighted so much more for once and now I get to celebrate!
I've never been more proud to have my "I voted" sticker. Well...aside from that time I helped vote out Trump, that was cool too. Oh and that time I taught some guy's kid to ride a bike in 30 minutes after he spent weeks trying and I saw him yelling at his kid so I helped. But that's it. 3rd proudest I've been in a while.
It's like when you are so nauseated that you just KNOW you are about to blow chunks all over the place but then your burp and you feel 100% in 10 seconds. I really felt like PA was going to blow chunks there for a while.
Saw past it? As a Pennsylvanian, it's blindingly obvious that even a severely brain damaged Fetterman (he's not...but I'm saying even if he was) would be infinitely better than Oz. Oz was going to be a fucking yes man to whatever the GOP wanted while helping to destroy democracy while fucking PA over and getting rich off of his office.
Pittsburgher checking in...my wife and I both voted for hoodie man. Our families lectured us about how terrible he was, but damn he looks so cool in that hoodie.
