I got in trouble for calling him a Shit Gibbon. Apparently there are way more gibbons on reddit than I was aware of and they can't take a joke. I got tired of "you're giving gibbons a bad rep." comments.
>After President Joe Biden took office in 2021, a Chinese spy balloon briefly transited the continental United States, as administration officials have acknowledged. Afterwards, the intelligence community ran some of the balloon’s signals through the US’ intelligence holdings and other data to see where and when they may have popped up in the past.
We got conflicting signals from the Chinese balloon, starting with there was no threat to US intelligence (when it was floating across the US unknown to the public) to "the balloons may be a biological weapon" (when the balloon was visible to the public.
So if I was China and I wanted to send my actual sophisticated spy balloons to specific sensitive locations, maybe what I'd do is first send a ridiculous, huge, easy-to-spot balloon to pull away everyone's attention.
