Great answer. I am interested in knowing how this emphasis on spirituality came to be taking place in the late antiquity. Surely Christianity cannot be the only answer, as the shift to abstraction predates Constantine, and if I remember correctly, temple building decreased under Diocletian.
Now, while I don't agree that later Roman art swayed away from marble revetment and classical decorative motifs, there was a clear move away from realism, particularily in sculpture, even if this predates Constantine.
I generally feel like Byzantine culture has shifted away from its Roman roots so far that it wouldn't be wrong to say that it is entirely different, such as using an entirely different language, different art as we saw etc. It's especially obvious when you compare it to let's say China, which save for a few short periods, is dominated by a single culture for the same period of time from Romans dominated classical antiquity Rome to Byzantine Rome, and as such the culture never changed so much that it is unrecognisable ie with the same language, art and architectural style. Now I know that today we consider Byzantines to be Greeks, but if Byzantines still called themselves Romans, how did this come to be?
