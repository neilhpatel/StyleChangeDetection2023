Fantastic answer! Not OP, but this was also a question I had in the back of my mind after having read The Prince, because from my layman's perspective, it didn't look like a satire at all.
So I don't think that The Prince is satire, nor do I think the view that it is can be defended. Machiavelli himself certainly treated it as a serious piece of work, and used it as a companion to his far greater work, The Discourses. The view that it is satire arises mainly as a rather simplistic way to explain apparent contradictions between Machiavelli's two political treatises, but I think if we take the view that The Prince is his guide to how things work and The Discourses is his guide to how things ought to work, the contradictions largely disappear and the two treatises can be read together as Machiavelli seems to have intended.

It's also worth noting that Machiavelli adopts the same method of analysis in both documents. He uses historical examples, often one from antiquity and one from his own day, to say that a particular behaviour or action will yield the same result. Underpinning both pieces of work is the idea that history repeats itself, which is used in both treatises to analyse what works and what doesn't. Many apparent contradictions can be explained by what Machiavelli was actually analysing. The Prince is about rulership; what gets a person into power and keeps them there. The Discourses is about how the Roman Republic rose to power, and the potential for replicating that rise in his contemporary political landscape.
