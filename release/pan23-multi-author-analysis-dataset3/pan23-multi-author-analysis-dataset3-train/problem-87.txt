The way our legal system is set up someone having a psychotic break can be detained and "treated" against their will.
Then there is just the fact that someone thinks it's OK to tell adults that they aren't allowed to have a perfectly legal product if they want treatment for any other issues.
Personally I think that the conditions in these facilities are pretty bad. I think that some of the treatment options are basically torture if they are done without a patients consent, and the UN seems to agree. I'm sure that a full inspection of all the places where people are detained in Australia would show an appalling number of vulnerable people who have been subjected to inhumane conditions.
There are plenty of Australians that find this embarrassing but also other issues such as off shore detention which no doubt will be one of the things that come up in the report. Another would be the over representation of First Nations People within the prison system, not a uniquely Australian problem but a problem nonetheless.
