Figure up what it would cost you to move, add in a full refund of your deposit, and add 25-50% more for the general hassle of moving, and make that your counter offer. Don't be afraid if it's 10 times their initial offer. They only made that lowball offer because they thought you wouldn't know your rights, and they could take advantage of you. The ball's in your court now, so make them an offer. Be ready to give back some of the 25-50% extra, but don't go below your moving costs plus deposit. They have the money to buy a building, so they can come up with enough to buy you out.
Having paid pet fees for 5 years certainly puts you in a good position to argue that you had prior written permission. If they're going to argue that your pets weren't allowed, then you'd be in a good position to demand your pet fees back.
Them letting you pay a pet fee was written consent for you to have pets -because why else would you be paying it?
The texts back and forth stating you were allowed to have pets count as "prior written consent". Save that evidence. It sounds like you've also got the word of the previous property manager and landlord that pets were allowed.
You could counter-offer on the amount you're willing to take to move, because having such a hostile landlord is no fun.
You should probably start looking for new housing and try to get a buyout from the new landlord. $5000 would cover moving expenses and a deposit at your new place.
