So if canada stands with people expressing themselves, and then there are governments restricting that expression, then canada should be doing something right?
Here’s another thing, these covid restrictions were provincial, Trudeau had 0 control over the things they they were protesting. It was the dumbest form of protest.
The convoy people terrorized the people of Ottawa for 22 days, honked train horns downtown, disturbed peaceful enjoyment, used children as human shields, waved foreign flags, and wanted to depose the democratically elected government.
I’m very well aware. They’re fucking scum. Ruined small businesses, prevented hospital access, patients had to delay appointments when they could have peacefully protested like everyone else does but instead decide to terrorize Ottawa for 22 days.
They were honking train horns at all hours of the day, small businesses had to shut down, hospital appointments were delayed, and the emergency actions were used because the Ottawa PD were completely ineffective.
Entire streets were shut down, innocent residents were harassed and subject to toxic emissions and constant horns, people died from ambulances not being able to get to their location in time, businesses couldn't operate. You don't think that crosses a line for what's acceptable, especially when the vast majority of people in the country don't agree with what you are fighting for?
There are lines I don’t support crossing but it’s bullshit to act like the only correct way to protest is to quietly hold a pre-approved sign in a pre-approved roped off area where it won’t bother anyone or be a nuisance in anyway.
