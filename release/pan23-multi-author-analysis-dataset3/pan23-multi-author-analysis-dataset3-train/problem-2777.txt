It's secret while it's happening, cIA wants ruzzia to know they had the director of the CIA inside Ukraine talking to the president, and they didn't know about it.
3) Ukrainian intelligence stumbled on a CIA operation and he went in person to Kyiv to tell Zelensky to brief him so the op doesn't fuck up.
1) Putin is dead, the CIA is operating a coup to have him replaced with a moderate, and he went to ask Zelensky to slow done so the Hawks don't get momentum.
In what way is it in our interest to drag this out instead of destroying Russia's military quickly and getting Putin ousted as a result?
"Us focusing on China can only amount to an actual civilizational conflict, so I wouldn't be so eager if I were you".
"Us is allocating very little money for Ukraine. When they announce 2.5b or give a total.of 35b for.ukraine, they don't give the majority of that money to Ukraine. It's just a number on paper that represents the purchase price of the equipment they are giving when it was new, but the us isn't sending much new equipment, it's sending stuff that was mothballed or was old stock. Then the military gets money to buy new stuff.".
I mean that's kinda what I meant above. Was just saying he'll need more than just the minimum to pass it with the dems. The caucus will need to be on board.
He needs half his caucus if he wants to keep the speakership. Probably doable if it doesn't get tied to the debt ceiling. There's more pro Ukraine Republicans than whackjobs.
