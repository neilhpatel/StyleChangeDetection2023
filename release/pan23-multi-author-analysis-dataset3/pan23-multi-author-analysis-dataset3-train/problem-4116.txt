Why do you think that Trump named his social media as "Truth Social" .. it's because it fit his propaganda that everything but his approved network is Fake News. Which, as part of the dictators playbook, attacking the real press is one of the very first objectives.
I wouldn't bet on that. Would it speed up their economic decline? Sure. But their ability to commit war is based off their civilian resolve to withstand hardship, accept whatever IOU's they roll out to drive their internal economy, access manpower, and utilize their own resources.
Think about it, the only difference between a wartime economy and normal economy (for dictatorships) is whether you can acquire the resources to produce and if labor also participates (whether slave, prison, or willing civilians). Compared with a Western / more free country, which has the added layer of implementing compensation (war bonds, etc.) for the private industries they temporary takeover.
It's not an uncommon tactic for bad actors to name things to be the opposite of what they do, it's part of the propaganda.
It's just that propaganda uses 'truth' as name for their source cause propaganda literally tries to convince its customer that information it is spreading - truth.
