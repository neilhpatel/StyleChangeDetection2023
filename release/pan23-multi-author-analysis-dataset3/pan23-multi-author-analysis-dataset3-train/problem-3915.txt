Thank you for the response. I'm not too worried but I'd like to keep the door to come back to US open so I'm trying to accidentally not do anything illegal.
Thank you. One thing i noticed since this whole thing started and the media limelight shifted to ethiopia is how inaccurate the news covered by big media companies (CNN, Al Jazeera, BBC and others) is. I'm certain syrians, Afghanis or other citizens of countries where there's been a war can attest to this. Word of advice: when you hear international news, take it with a grain of salt.
Yeah i definitely need to consult someone on this, i have too many questions to be posting on reddit. The problem is I can't find tax consultants here. Does the US embassy give consultancy on these type of things?
They're ethiopian citizens so they aren't even eligible. I need to talk to someone but can't find anyone in my country, does the US embassy give consultancy on tax returns?
I work in US cross border tax issues and lots of the advice you are getting is incorrect or incomplete. You are a US citizen, you will likely have no US taxes owing but you need to file a tax return if your gross income is over $12,400 USD (for tax year 2020 assuming you are single). There are also many foreign reporting forms you may be subject to depending on the value of your assets in Ethiopia or other foreign countries (eg. FINCEN form 114). Yes, the US does have the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, but often just taking a foreign tax credit is more beneficial. You should contact a US tax accountant in Ethiopia and they can help you.
