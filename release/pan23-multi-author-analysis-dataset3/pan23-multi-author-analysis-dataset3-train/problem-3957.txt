You are really all over the place. Specifically what fraud do you feel happened and why do you feel your husband is at risk of being accused of said fraud?
As long as the money was used for his mother it likely isn't going to be a giant deal. He just needs to change who is in charge of her account.
You cannot sue for emotional distress. Life is difficult. That isn't a lawsuit. And this whole thing seems like a non issue.
If the father obtained money by lying about the mother's situation, then certainly both the father and the son might have problems.
That’s the problem, the money was obtained fraudulently through false reports and his mother had not been getting the care she needs. His father is taking her money, and he abuses her. It has nothing to do with my husband. If my husband was rep payee and he was doing the reports and all the info was factual it wouldn’t be as big as a concerned. We were told becoming a rep payee can be as simple as an online application. It’s been 6 years of my husband looking as if he was the one filing the reports. He dad was calling and pretending to be him. Isn’t that identity cloning? Isn’t the fact that his father rerouted his mail and opened it address/mail theft and the fact that his father used his card identity theft. There’s no way it’s nothing or no big deal.
So basically, we did what we were supposed to do by reporting this, and his parents will be charged and we will just have to deal with the emotions ourselves. I’ll except that. I won’t accept my husband going to jail for years or paying fines/restitution. That wouldn’t be fair.
