What makes this so important is that if many of these rejected ballots are cured, the overall number of ballots remaining to be counted increases. So while there's perhaps 6 to 7k remaining right now, additional cured mail-in ballots could be added to that total. If you are in CO-3 district, you can go to to see if your mail-in ballot was counted. If not, you can type in TXT2Cure via text message on your phone. Here is about mail-in ballots. This race is NOT over Frisch can still win this.
I wanted to give an update on this race. I live in Boebert's district (unfortunately). There are a certain number of mail-in ballots that have been rejected because they signed ballot doesn't match the signature. I was one of the rejected ballots. That being said, a rejected ballot can be turned into a "cured" ballot by either going to the elections office, mailing in, or going to a website and providing a valid Colorado license and updated signature. At which point, if all is well, that ballot is considered "good" and will be counted with other remaining ballots in a few days.
As I understand it, the absentee ballots can still be accepted into next week, so Iâ€™m not sure we really know how many ballots are left. Not possible to say.
