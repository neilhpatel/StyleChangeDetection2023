So the plan is to leave NATO which would "permit Putin to save face if he ended Russia’s military and political debacle in Ukraine" and what's the plan if he doesn't end it?
I'm not saying that we should pull out of NATO, but I don't think you really understand what their objective is when it comes to Ukraine. Whether Ukraine wins or whether Russia eventually wins but is ruined in the process...we win. If it was really about protecting Ukraine, they would have landed troops.
NATO unity in the support of Ukraine is all we have to confront both of these tyrants. China may not have the military we have but they are a very powerful country. In comparison Russia is just a gas station and the Ukrainians are struggling.
Any of y’all ever been to war? I pray each of you calling balls and strikes concerning this war is correct in your optimism. I don’t want to bet my children’s lives on my opinion from across the ocean.
Xi of China did. If Russia is successful in Ukraine he will invade Taiwan. Can you spell conscription? Are you ready to send your kids and grandkids to war. War with China will require this and war with China is what you will get if NATO is not successful against Putin.
