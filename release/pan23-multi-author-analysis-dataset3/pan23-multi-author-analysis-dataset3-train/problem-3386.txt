"There is no doubt that the phenomenon of addiction is in decline in Portugal," said Joao Goulao, President of the Institute of Drugs and Drugs Addiction".
"Currently 40,000 people in Portugal are being treated for drug abuse. This is a far cheaper, far more humane way to tackle the problem. Rather than locking up 100,000 criminals, the Portuguese are working to cure 40,000 patients and fine-tuning a whole new canon of drug treatment knowledge at the same time.".
So there’s that. It’s not just people looking to get high, nor even lacking healthcare. It’s what works, even though they pose addictive risks and of course, prior to the development of such opioids, doctors were prescribing narcotics such as Valium, Soma, Miltown, etc. My mom was hooked on those in the 70s and 80s, when Quaaludes were the big thing.
A lot of them suffer chronic pain. There’s a broad range of reasons a person might obtain or be prescribed opioids.
Unexpected potency is one of the primary sources of overdose, and it almost never happens to those taking opioids by prescription.
Fentanyl is eclipsing heroin and prescription pain pills as the go-to opioid. The epidemic has hit the young with alarming speed and disproportionately killed Black people and Native Americans in recent years. In 2020, overdose death rates increased 44 percent for Black people and 38 percent for Native Americans.
The Drug Enforcement Administration, the country’s premier anti-narcotics agency, stumbled through a series of missteps as it confronted the biggest challenge in its 50-year history. The agency was slow to respond as Mexican cartels supplanted Chinese producers, creating a massive illicit pharmaceutical industry that is now producing more fentanyl than ever.
