But when you set up a camera expressly for the purpose of surveilling your neighbor's property without their permission, that's a violation of their privacy. Sometimes people who get caught doing so argue that they were really only videoing a very important corner of the roof of their shed, and just so happened to capture their neighbor's property in the process. It's a foggy area that depends on the totality of circumstances.
It gets a little fuzzy depending on the state, but a lot of people try to pull the old "sure the camera is pointed at my neighbor's door but it also has 0.02mm of my fence in there so technically it's pointed at my property and coincidentally capturing my neighbor's property" line.
Not "outdoor property", but "your neighbor's property". The distinction is that it's okay to surveil your own property, and it's even okay if in doing so you happen to surveil a public place (such as a public sidewalk) or even some of your neighbor's yard.
Then you get into situations where a neighbor has a camera mounted on their roof to look over their neighbor's privacy fence, but argues that the six inches of their own property visible in the frame justifies the invasion of their neighbor's property.
Actually there is an expectation of privacy in your backyard when you have a privacy fence, and they can't focus camera on your door or windows.
I don't know what type of fence the OP has but placing camera on his property pointed at his house is a 100% no go.
Not too long ago there was a case of city using a drone to record and photo people's fenced in backyards court said NO, I do not recall city/state.
