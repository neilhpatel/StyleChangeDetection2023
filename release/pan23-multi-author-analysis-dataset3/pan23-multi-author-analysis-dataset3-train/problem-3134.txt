1A is still involved. That's why you can't successfully sue a news org for simply getting stuff wrong, even if it leads to damages.There has to be intentional malice, which seems pretty clear in this Fox case.
Even with these civil cases it has some bearing. You can't successfully sue just because a news org got something wrong. They have to know it is wrong info and damaging to you.
>But mistakes are one thing; knowingly telling lies is another. What Fox’s pious proclamation of press freedom misses is that lies of the sort the network appears to have told its viewers don’t enjoy or deserve constitutional protection.
I’d also like a carve-out somewhere in this case to discuss whether FOX News can rightfully enjoy the "press" part in the 1A freedom of the press privileges.
In legal terms, "actual malice" in defamation cases refers to making/spreading false statements while knowing they are untrue (not malice, as in hatred or ill will). Also … Defamation requires actual malice OR reckless disregard, meaning the defamer might not even know whether the statements are false, but continues to make/spread them with reckless disregard. These cases are usually difficult to prove against defendants who deal in widely covered stories about widely known people. But apparently FOX News has accidentally provided created more evidence against themselves than most defamation cases ever have submitted.
Even the most rudimentary understanding of libel law reveals that if you print or broadcast something you know, or have reason to believe, is false, you have opened yourself up to serious legal exposure. No legitimate news organization would ever do that. Take it from someone who worked in local and national news for a decade.
