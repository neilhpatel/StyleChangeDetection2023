The term "silent majority" gets thrown around a lot in political discussions, but women literally are the majority in this country - they vote in larger numbers than men, they vote more often, and they tend to vote for democrats. When you take into account the huge number of newly registered voters across the country (and particularly, the uptick in new women voters), it doesn't look good for republicans.
Keep in mind too there's a lot of explicitly pro-Republican polling "firms" that are trying to skew the averages, and putting out a lot of suspicious low quality polls that, shockingly, are extremely favorable to Republicans.
There are a lot of factors at play: Trukmp's erratic behavior, pollsters relying too heavily on landlines, people being polled not willing to participate, and even being dishonest in their responses. Pollsters relying too much on "traditional" weights that may not apply anymore: the mid-term "slaughter of the President's own party, for instance.
One of the things pollsters do here is they conduct polls of "likely voters", as opposed to registered voters or adults in general. The difficulty this election is that after the overturning of Roe v Wade by our Supreme Court, a boat load of people registered to vote. When the pollsters calculate who is and is not a "likely voter", one of the biggest factors is whether or not a person voted in prior elections. If you didn't vote in 2016, 2018, or 2020, you're not likely to vote in 2022. That's their logic. But Roe v. Wade was such a significant event that it's difficult to tell what percentage of the newly registered voters will show up to vote, or what percentage of voters who were registered but abstained from voting in the past.
