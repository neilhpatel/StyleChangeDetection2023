There was another where we got some pretty HD footage of a grenade to a face.... That one was grisly. Terrible for all involved.
Yeah it’s awful. So many young men were killed in this meaningless war and even more young men chose to leave the country. The future is really dark.
It’s nothing new. In the last 15 years or so Putin decided to make gay people the punching bag and the scapegoat of Russia. Whenever Putin’s popularity takes a nosedive he screams in fear and anger “Guys guys listen We should blame gay people It’s all them, it’s not me If Russia ever fails it’s because of the gay people Let’s protect the motherland from the western gayness!”.
Putin fails to understand that the anti-gay propaganda is not working anymore because Russian people are afraid of an economic collapse way more than they are afraid of gay people.
So what Russia is saying is that their society is so fragile the west could collapse it by airdropping a bunch of gay people in to have a Pride parade in Red Square? The CIA should get on this.
