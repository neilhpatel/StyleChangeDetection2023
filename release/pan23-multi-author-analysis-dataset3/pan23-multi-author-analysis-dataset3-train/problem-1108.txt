Will be interesting moving forward. Even though it's fair to say Biden has accomplished a few more-than-mediocre achievements, I don't think anyone in the country wants to vote for him again. Sure, Chuck Grassley just won another 6 year term at the age of 89, but for POTUS we need younger leadership.
If Biden somehow stays mentally where he is (god, that’s a low bar) it’s possible he could contend again, but things obviously have to change for Americans if he wants to win again.
Red wave my ass The senate Republican are going to end up giving the Biden admin a bigger advantage in the senate than they came into the election with.
That was true when we only had 50 each though, and technically had a Dem senate only because of holding the WH/Vice Presidency. Makes it only slightly easier if we have a more progressive appointment, but judicial and cabinet appointments are important, they’re still not everything we need.
Manchin and Sinema typically fall in line for judicial appointments and cabinet appointments, they’re rarely a problem in that area. That’s what we’re talking about here if the dems lose the House as expected.
