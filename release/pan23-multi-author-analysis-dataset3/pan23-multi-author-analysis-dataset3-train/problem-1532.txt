I'd also hope that we specifically target Putin and all other senior leaders in Russia. If they drop the bomb, they should personally feel the responsibility for their actions.
They won't do nothing, but I don't see NATO dropping a nuke on Moscow or something like that. I like to think the NATO has very good intelligence on where most of the nukes are stored and launched from, and we have contingency plans to swiftly hit dozens, if not hundreds, of military targets all around Russia to severely limit any ability to launch another missile.
Let’s be honest, if Russia didn’t have nukes, NATO or the US plus a coalition of the willing would have swept into Ukraine and ended the whole sorry business in less than three months, maybe bombed the shit out of Moscow for good measure. Nukes means NATO is toeing the line, supplying Ukraine but not getting directly involved, lest any of those nukes land too close to a NATO country.
For context, Ukraine gave the Soviet made nuclear weapons back to Russia in exchange for Russia promising to never invade their territory. How'd that work out.
