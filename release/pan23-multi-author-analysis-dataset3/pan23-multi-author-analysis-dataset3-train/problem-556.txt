In TX, a city can only establish rent control when a state of emergency has been declared, and the rent control ordinance has to be approved by the governor.
Yes it’s possible as long as Texas state law doesn’t ban laws prohibiting rent control then the municipalities can make laws that go to this issue. If TX has a state law banning rent control laws then the state law would be supreme over the municipal code/law.
As others have mentioned, there aren't statewide rent stabilization laws in Texas. If it's the former and there are way cheaper places, just move to one of those. If it's the latter, it sounds like you were getting a steal for a long time.
Wait, by "every other complex is not NEAR their new rates" do you mean that the new rates are too high? Or even with the new rates, the prices are still lower than other nearby complexes?
Oh cool, you're good! No legal protections here, but I think you could either show them these prices and tell them you'll move out if they don't lower the price to whatever you find reasonable, or just go somewhere else. Just bear in mind the costs of moving etc.
