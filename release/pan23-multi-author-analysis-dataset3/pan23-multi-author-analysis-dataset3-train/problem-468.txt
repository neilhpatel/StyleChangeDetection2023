I totally agree. I would pay for another seat plus fees to let my dog fly with me in the rare times that I want/need them to come on a flight, but the only option is for them to fly with luggage where dogs have died or have been severely traumatized from the experience.
Itâ€™s up to the airline and it has never happened, which is likely due to not enough pet owners being open to paying extra and/or having restricted choice of flights in order to be able to fly with their pets.
Pet owners are not availing themselves of the services of a pet friendly airline within the limits of thats airlines allowance for such services.
The laws between Service Dogs and ESA are already very different, and while businesses and airlines must allow well behaved SDs (within reason) they do not have to allow ESA. Airlines used to but had to stop because ESAs typically aren't trained to the level of an actual SD. ESA designation is really most important when it comes to housing, because an apartment company that doesn't allow pets has to allow ESAs.
The problem really is that we need qualifications for these animals - both that the person legitimately requires a SD or ESA and that the animal is behaviorally fit to be in public. But please let's avoid blanket stigmatization.
Technically no, ESA are prescribed by a licensed doctor as a psychiatric necessity. Yes it get abused, but there's many people who legitimately suffer with psychiatric problems (which are living HELL btw) who are immensely helped by an ESA and it allows them to lead a more normal, productive life with less suffering.
