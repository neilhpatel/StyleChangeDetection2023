I have a few questions. Did an insurance adjuster come and look at your car? If not this is likely a scam and these people are spoofing the insurance phone number. In accidents they always send an adjuster to assess damages. I'd say this is a scam otherwise. I would talk to the police about this as well. Other than phone calls, have you received any actual letters from your insurance? If not then this would also point to a scam.
Honestly this really seems like a scam. If they were saying they are a "special investigator" that also points towards a scam to scare you, and clearly it's working. You don't have to answer to anyone.
If it's real and they want to sue you, that's fine. Your insurance will defend you including hiring lawyers.
They aren’t the police, they’re an insurance company that you paid to insure you. Ask to see the video, if it’s legitimate accept the claim and then find a new insurer. Good luck.
NAL but worked in insurance claims: I’m not sure why the insurance company are so invested in getting your admission. They have the evidence, they clearly have reached the decision that you are at fault, and the claim should just be paid out. It’s very common for people to (obviously) argue that they weren’t at fault and for the insurance companies to reach a different view.
