Charging them with terrorism seems a bit much. But it does sound like the protesters were unlawfully protesting. Absolutely doesn't justify their deaths, but they shouldn't have been doing that. Protests should be done lawfully if they are going to be done at all.
Sounds like the point here is that the location that they were protesting at wasn't public property where protest can be done, or something like that.
Listen, I’m with your overall point but in certain circumstances you have to admit that a lawful protest is going to change nothing.
If lawful protest won't solve something, I don't see how unlawful protest will be more likely to work.
While I will always be pro peaceful and lawful protests, I don’t know how any protest on public land would stop the progress of this cop city. This was also made worse though when an operation was carried out and apparently not a single camera captured the incident. So if police can act without oversight, why is the average citizen being held to higher standards?
