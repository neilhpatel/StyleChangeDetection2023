I think you'll be surprised how quickly Ukraine manages to fix things, at least to a basic level. Power plants are big, and a single conventional missile won't completely destroy them.
I mean yeah, you could bury stuff so deep that not even the largest nukes could get them, but it's realistically not a feasible solution. The cost would be astronomically high.
If any of the 5 permanent members are doing something that deserves punishment or intervention, they can use their veto to instantly quash any resolution that gets brought to the Security Council floor.
Cost is irrelevant. Russia has used nearly every weapon in their arsenal save nuclear weapons, including bunker busters.
The only defense Ukraine has in this regard is that Russia has completely failed to assert air dominance over the region. This makes delivering the bombs much riskier.
Even more civilian and infrastructure bombings, and perhaps even WMDs. Russia’s military doctrine states that nuclear weapons can be used in response to “aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.” Russia has started to hint at this in response to current attacks against the newly “annexed” territories, but they also must know that the world is rolling its eyes and saying “Yeah right that’s not actually yours and everyone knows it, you better not use nukes here.” Once Ukraine starts lobbing missiles into Russia, the status quo changes.
The US and other Western NATO nations fear any attack outside of military targets by Russia will allow Russia to escalate (Chemical weapons or the use of Nukes. ((Nukes are less likely, but chemical weapons would be devastating in Ukraine.))).
