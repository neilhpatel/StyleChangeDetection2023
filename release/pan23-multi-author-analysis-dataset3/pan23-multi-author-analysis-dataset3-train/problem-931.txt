As I understand it, most Mediterranean and near east war elephants were either from India or North Africa, the latter being a now-extinct species (possibly sub-species) that was smaller than either Indian elephants or sub-Saharan African elephants. So states like Carthage or Ptolemaic Egypt could tame their own. Persia traded with India for war elephants, many of which Alexander captured during his conquests. Seleucus famously traded his eastern provinces to India for a large force of war elephants, which he used in his wars with the other successors. Polybius describes how the Seleucid Indian elephants outclassed the smaller Ptolemaic North African elephants at the Battle of Raphia. The elephants Rome used in its conquests of Greece came in large part from captured Carthaginian herds.
I donâ€™t know much about the details of the elephant trade, but this should at least be a rough overview of where different ancient armies got their elephants.
What do we know about the ancient elephant trade? Where do the elephants in the mediterranean and near East come from and how did they get there?
Tried asking this twice before in posts, one of them was mistakenly posted on April 1st so didn't get the answer I expected. So will try here.
