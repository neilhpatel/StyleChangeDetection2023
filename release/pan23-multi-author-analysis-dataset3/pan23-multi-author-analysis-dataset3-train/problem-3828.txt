This isn't how it works in OP's state of Oregon. You cannot terminate most tenancies, even without a formal lease, without "good cause" which is very limited. An owner can only move into one unit, they cannot move into all their units. Oregon, California and New Jersey make it very hard for even an informal month to month tenancy to be ended.
Oregon doesn't recognize month-to-month like most states do (OR, CA, NJ for example). There are only a narrow set of reasons that a landlord can terminate a month to month tenant, "no fault" reasons. With caveats. In this case, for an allowed termination (landlord moving on) 90-day notice is required for a tenancy that long.
Unless your mother has a fixed term lease that extends beyond that 90 day period, she should plan to move.
For future reference: if your mother had a lease, the new owner would have been required to let her live out the lease. So if it was a 12 month lease and he bought the building in month 6, then he would have had to wait 6 months before he could move in. Or he could have offered her "cash for keys" where he pays her a bunch of money to leave early. Being a tenant without a formal lease offers very little protection, if you can get her in some place that does year long leases she will be in a better position next time this happens.
