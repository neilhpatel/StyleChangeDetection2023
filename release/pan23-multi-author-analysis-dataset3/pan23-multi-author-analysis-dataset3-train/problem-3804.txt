(Also, as wasteful as its military spending can be.... it turns out it is actually quite efficient comparatively speaking.).
1. Russia would not have accepted a referendum that does not support their claims, they would have refused the outcome saying it is a fraud, meanwhile they would have tried to manipulate that referendum as much as humanily possible with coercion and bribes. They are not acting in good faith. SHOCKER, I know! Russia would have invaded regardless, they couldn't care less about the people of Donbass. If they did they would not have caused so much suffering for them. Causes for this war are many for the Russians but a humanitarian operation for defending the liberties of "oppressed" peoples it is DEFINITELY NOT.
2. Eastern Ukrainians are not the fanatic pro-Russians you imagine, some might have been sympathetic to Russia and they use the Russian language but that does not automatically mean they automatically oppose liberation of their territories. Ukraine's own president is a Russian speaker, its just a language. Their "separatist governements" were puppet republics lead by Russians (from Russia) defended by Russian soldiers. Do not imagine this was a civil war, it was a barely disguised foreign invasion.
3. Ethnic cleansing is what Russia is doing in occupied regions - conscripting men so they could die, deporting civilians, stealing children. Outright murdering the population, as seen in liberated areas. Replacing these people with ethnic Russians. The idea that it will stop if these areas are annexed to Russia and peace is declared is, quite frankly, outright moronic, and you should reconsider your opinion.
