Honestly, the only person who screwed you over was your dad. No one else sounds like they are trying to cheat you out of anything that's rightfully yours under the law. It's only your inheritance if dad left it to you in the Will, and unfortunately for you, he chose not to.
It's unlikely you will be able to challenge the Will. Not only are there very narrow grounds for challenging a Will, but you already signed the waiver of process. In signing the Waiver of Process, you indicated that you believe the Will to be valid and waived your right to object to the Will (hence the name).
You can speak with a probate attorney, but if you were considering challenging the Will, you should not have signed the Waiver of Process.
You will need your own attorney just for the purposes of him guiding you through the probate process and to be there to get your questions answered.
Find a good probate attorney in your father's state, contact them with these questions, and follow their advice. Initial discussions are typically free but as a note, this could very expensive.
