The time for gradually building up steam is way past. Democrats have been asleep at the wheel while the GOP has attacked the foundation of our democracy like rabid termites. Those foundations are rotten and starting to collapse. They barely held through Trump's administration, and the pace of that collapse has only increased since.
Those millions who voted for Trump are outnumbered. But unless everyone else pulls their head out of their asses and votes blue, all that happens is we ignore the termites for another cycle while they keep packing the lower courts, state houses, governor mansions, and state legislatures with election-denying fascists.
I don't expect it. I think we're too late to stop where we're headed. Best case at this point is to maybe delay the due date and soften the blow. That is an important enough reason for me to vote, but I'm also doing other things.
I get how polls work, but the point again I’m making has nothing to do with polls. RvW was absolutely a reason people voted, however in my opinion it didn’t factor in the elections overall outcome. Republicans won where they were expected to and so did Dems. The Senate was always projected to be +/- (1-2) seats in either direction. The results show a lot of split tickets from Congressional to Governor races when you compare them, in some cases again where GOP did better then usual. The red wave was an over sell based on historical precedent and not the political realities of now imo.
