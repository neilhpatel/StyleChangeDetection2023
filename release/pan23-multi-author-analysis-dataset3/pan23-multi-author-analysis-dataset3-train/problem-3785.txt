Parishes, and that is not a requirement in Louisiana if abandonment or surrender of possession is not in question. Generally an eviction action is an action to reclaim possession of a property plus whatever money is owed for that property. Once tenants move out and give back possession, there is nothing else to give back except for the money owed, so the eviction part is moot at that point.
They can still evict once they move out if there's still a lease and no lease termination fees have been paid. Some counties require the formal eviction process to end the lease and regain control of the property when no abandonment clause is written into the lease. It's also a type of protection for the landlord since if there's no way to protect your investment most people would just leave early and save a lot of money on rent and fees owed.
They can "evict" you formally, sue you for the money owed, get a judgement against you where they can seek wage or bank account garnishment all while your credit history takes a massive hit for 7+ years.
