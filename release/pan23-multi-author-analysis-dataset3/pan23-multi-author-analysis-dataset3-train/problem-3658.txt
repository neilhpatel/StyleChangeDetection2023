Crystal Mason cast a provisional ballot with the help of an election official because she was not certain if she was eligible to vote.
Rosa Ortega cast several regular ballots after incorrectly (fraudulently) certifying that she was eligible to do so.
I personally don't believe that either of these cases warrant prison time, but there's a pretty significant difference in the two. Provisional ballots literally exist for these edge cases where validity or whatever is in question. You take the provisional ballot and, if after extra scrutiny it checks out, it's added to the tally.
The risk in casting fraudulent votes is not worth the reward (the rare chance of tipping an extremely close election result).
I feel like the more they report on the rare cases of voter fraud, the more it cements in the minds of republicans that voter fraud is rampant. Even in the case of republicans being the guilty party, it proves to them that it can be done, so their false claims of stolen election must be plausible.
This is why Republicans say Democrats win elections because of cheating, even when there's no evidence that Democrats cheat and then change the election outcome.
