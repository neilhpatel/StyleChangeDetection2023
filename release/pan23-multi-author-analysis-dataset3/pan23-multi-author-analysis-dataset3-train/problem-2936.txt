The only remaining thing you could argue about is the depreciated value of the furniture. Did they give you details about whether they're depreciating at all? FYI, a quick google suggests that a 7 year depreciation is typical for furniture, so they might not be knocking off as much as you think.
Replacement value of 20 year old cabinets is pretty much zero, not because of depreciation, but because their usable lifespan is about 20 years.
My company doesn't allow this. Instead we charge an early lease termination fee that is 1.8 times the cost of a month's rent. So, if your rent is $1000 a month, we would charge you $1800 to cancel your lease. We don't allow sub-lets or reassignments of leases. Once the lease is signed, it is a contract and we enforce it.
As to the fee for reassigning your lease, that's going to depend on the exact wording in the lease you signed with them. It may not matter who found the tenant, or who paid the new tenant's application fees, only the lease will tell you what you agreed to.
If your lease ended and you provided correct notice, then there is no reassigning of your lease and you simply did them a favor to find a new resident.
Reassignment of lease: ask them to show you where your current lease explains this. If they say it doesn't and that's how they do business, tell them "I'd rather stick to the terms and conditions outlined by the lease".
