The short answer is that it was, but there is a longer answer. Obviously I can't claim to cover the entirety of the so-called 'Closing of the Steppe' from every angle, so here I'll focus specifically on the Ming and Qing empires.
Sort of? It's definitely a bit of a trope by adjacent sedentary societies that the people of nomadic societies – particularly men but in some cases women as well (the Skythians in Herodotos, for instance) – were exceptionally warlike by comparison. At the same time, it's perhaps worth stressing that nomadic societies have extremely unspecialised labour arrangements, so 'warrior' is not necessarily a meaningful category if that makes sense. There's a culture that has overtly bellicose aspects (after all, raiding is one way to secure resources that cannot be obtained on the steppe), but not one which glorifies the warrior.
Related to the nomadic military advantage, would it be fair to say that such societies tend to have a warrior culture? Perhaps this is related to and results from a lifetime of hunting, but it seems to be a bit different and an additional advantage that just on the job training with horse and bow. The idea is that in nomadic societies, the men simply are braver, fear injury and death less, glorify war more, and thus are less likely to run from battle and more likely to endure hardships (have a higher morale if you think of it in wargaming terms). I know next to nothing about the Mongols and Chinese, but am thinking about this from the perspective of my ideas of Native Americans and American society.
