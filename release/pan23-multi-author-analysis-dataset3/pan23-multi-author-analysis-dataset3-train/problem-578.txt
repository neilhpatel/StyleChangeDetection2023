It's possible, you don't need to vote for your own party or anything. So far they aren't doing it though. I feel like the democrats should try to choose a republican candidate and just get a few republican votes on it, to basically choose their speaker of the house. It seems unlikely 6 republicans would switch to the democratic party nominated democrat candidate.
A subset of republicans would refuse to vote for whoever democrats voted for thus nullifying the number anyway.
Not sure if you're aware, if Republicans do not show up for the vote or vote present it lowers the number that is needed to reach the majority. One Republican has already voted "Present" that lowered the threshold for the nomination of Speaker to 217. If 11 more do it the Democrats win by default.
And then the Republican party would purge them from it for getting Democrats to vote for them. It's a no-win situation. The person who got the Democratic votes would get primaried, be called a RINO on Fox News and get death threats. Republicans could just not show up claiming "family issues" which would lower the amount of votes leading to Jeffries winning, OR they will vote for McCarthy after he surrenders to the insanity.
Watching c-span today they said something along the lines of 3 republicans(not confident all are Republicans) had medical/family stuff come up and might not be there for any more votes, does this make it to where Jeffries would be closer to becoming speaker?
