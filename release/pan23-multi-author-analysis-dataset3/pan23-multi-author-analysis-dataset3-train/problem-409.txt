A combination of all three of the factors you mentioned; the site of Ai Khanoum itself was destroyed during the Soviet-Afghan conflict. In addition, many of the cities have been continuously occupied since antiquity, which further complicates the investigation of their remains.
Quite likely. To take one famous example, the coins of Menander, the most famous ruler of the Indo-Greek kingdom, sometimes combine Greek and Buddhist iconography in interesting ways.
I remember watching a video of indro-greek influence somewherr on youtube and that it talked about the lingering influence of greece and it can be seen in the likeness of hercules supporting buddha.
This artistic influence remained not just in the realm of political iconography and numismatics, there came a large influx of so called Greco-Buddhist art. At this point in time, some Greeks in the Greco-Bactrian kingdoms began to adopt Buddhism with lead to the development of Buddhist art which had hellenistic styled influences. There are still remnants of this influence today in some depictions of the Buddha. (There is still some debate on how influential the hellenistic styles were in potentially information changes in buddhist theology at this time.) One of the later Indo-Greek/Greco-Bactrian kings, Menander, is known to have been, at the minimum, a patron of Buddhism and Buddhist art, being referenced in several buddhist theological texts. The coins of Menander's reign are extremely prevalent and show the combination of Indian and Greek language and culture/religion.
