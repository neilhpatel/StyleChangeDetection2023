Nah, 1:3 dead-to-wounded would be for moderately-competent at evac & healthcare - that's the estimate for UKR. I've seen estimates of 1:1 for Russia in this war.
I was wondering this too, are they counting the Russian rebels in this figure too? I remember the first picture I saw of the invasion was a dead rebel who was wearing a crude uniform and red armband. There was definitely a shit ton of them that died early in the war.
My mind cannot even comprehend how disastrous this is for Russia, pretty much any sane person would’ve seen the losses and admitted defeat which in this case would simply mean leaving Ukraine alone! But nope, Russia is drafting hundreds of thousands more people for guaranteed death. They’re gonna have major demographic problems in the future.
I’m just imagining all the different ways those soldiers might’ve perished. Getting blown up, bleeding out, freezing to death, maybe even starvation or dehydration…I just remembered the young guy who surrendered to Ukrainians with maggots in his arm. I can’t believe the Russians let this carry on for an entire year.
