I'm also a realtor in Colorado Springs and the State of Colorado does not have Dual Agency agreements, this person is acting as a "transaction broker" meaning they do not have any fiduciary duties to either party, but have to act as a neutral party to both sides. Quick Edit: Its not just they aren't acting as a fiduciary for either party, they can't perform ANY fiduciary duties to either party either. I would consult a Real Estate Attorney ASAP since you're closing in two weeks.
As far as the details of this particular deal I have no advice other than talk to a real estate attorney. It is possible the deal could be null and void but I am not a lawyer and only a lawyer can guide you through the intricacies of contract law.
I’m not a lawyer, but have bought and sold homes recently and the contracts always had clauses for termination of their representation. There are boards you can report her to, and if she works with an agency you can forward that video right along to them. If you still want to sell your home, don’t let your personal feelings get involved - you can request a new agent and drop her, and continue to closing while assuring she does not get anything.
