And Article 5 only applies to attacks in Europe, North America, the North Atlantic, or the Mediterranean. No attack on Japan would merit NATO involvement unless it was attack on Japanese shipping on the other side of the world from Japan.
It's highly unlikely that you'd get unanimous political agreement for Japanese membership in NATO and it's highly unlikely that Japan would want to join NATO.
But if the political will were there, the geographical restrictions of the original 1949 NATO Treaty text would be entirely irrelevant.
Like any international treaty, the NATO Treaty can be changed by unanimous agreement of the parties. Accepting a new European member already requires the same unanimous agreement. And in practically all countries, the internal mechanism (parliamentary vote, etc.) is identical for a treaty change decision and a "invite new NATO member" decision.
When NATO changes the charter it was founded in. Under article 10 it limits to only nations with land in Europe joining after its founding (Canada and Us are exception).
The actual important part is that the treaty says new members have to be European, meaning not even countries like Mexico could join even if they wanted. Canada and the US "gets around this" by being founding members.
