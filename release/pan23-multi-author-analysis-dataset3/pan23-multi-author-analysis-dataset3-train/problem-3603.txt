You’re doing your part, but you’re right, it’s really just virtue signalling. It gives me a sense of control however so I’ll just keep signaling and voting with my values until the people who can make a difference decide it matters to them too.
I'd wager most represent their voting supporters in some way or the other in order to retain said supporters. There are political parties where action on climate is a serious concern. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you lean), they tend to have smaller number of supporters probably due to their policies having a fairly big impact on the quality of life in order to achieve their goals.
Most of the developed world has some level of democracy where the people choose to vote in their leaders. It seems to me that action on climate is not at the top of most people's priorities.
This is not the best way to sell climate action. The rich, powerful and connected that make the decisions will not be effected that badly by climate change. They will just move to some place where the weather is nice or build it, for themselves. It is those they rule over that will die by the millions...
The way you sell climate action is by explaining that dying people have nothing to lose and will be very angry at the people the led them to their deaths. We need to stress at every opportunity that this is all the fault of the rich and powerful and that the people will cut their fucking heads off when things get bad enough. Once the rich and powerful realize that their own heads are on the line, they will try to blame someone else, but if that fails we will then see a lot of quick and decisive actions to save the environment.
We understand that large companies are soulless profit-driven entities who will destroy the planet for an extra dime, but that's not an excuse to absolve consumers of our role in the climate crisis.
