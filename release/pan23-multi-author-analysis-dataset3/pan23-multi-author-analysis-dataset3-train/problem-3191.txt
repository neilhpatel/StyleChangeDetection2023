Polls are useless propaganda tools. Remember u he polls leading into 2020 elections how Biden was losing but won? Remember 2022 mid term polls had a "red wave" which also turned out to he false?
Are these the same polls which assured of a Red Wave during the midterms? Or that Biden would lose to Trump 2020? Call me skeptical, but I don’t think the polls are, shall we say, trustworthy these days….
I don't know why people are so vehement in writing off polls like this. Trump eeked out a win in 2016 with narrow wins in the swing states and lost in 2020 with narrow losses in the swing states; regardless of whether you like him or not, he's gonna be competitive in a general election.
That being said, unless there are polls showing Trump ahead in PA, WI, and one of NV/AZ/GA, then Trump isn’t ahead in the polls. National polling is pretty irrelevant.
The polls had Biden leading Trump in 2020, especially leading up to the election when he looked like he had double digit leads in places like Michigan.
They were still wrong, but in the sense that they expected Biden to win more comfortably than he did.
