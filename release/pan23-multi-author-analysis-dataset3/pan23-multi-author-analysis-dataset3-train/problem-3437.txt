This is a classic scam. The intent of the scam is that you will cash the cheque - which is a bad cheque, but not so obviously bad that it'll get rejected immediately - and withdraw money from your account to pay someone else. Then the cheque will bounce, once the banks involve notice it and potentially weeks down the line - leaving you liable to pay your bank back, and with no real way to get your money back from the "client.".
As you already deposited the cheque, let your bank know immediately that you've realized you're being scammed, and leave any money that cleared from the cheque in your account until the bank reverses it. Do not send the money back to the scammers - see above.
It's a scam. The check will eventually bounce and you'll owe the money to the bank. That's the best case scenario. You could also be caught up as a money mule in a fraud investigation.
Block your "employer"... Did you give them any of your info (ssn etc)? You need to put fraud alerts on your credit reports and freeze your credit. Talk to your bank and explain that you just realized this is a scam. Don't touch the money, the check will eventually bounce and the bank will take it out.
