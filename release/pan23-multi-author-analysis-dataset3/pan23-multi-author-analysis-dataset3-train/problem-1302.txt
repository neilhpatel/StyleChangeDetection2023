The level of local and state interference is disheartening though. And itâ€™s worsened by the fact that the fossil fuel industry is able to fund an endless stream of misinformation that causes the public to bombard their local and state governments with bullshit culture wars instead of demanding they move forward on these projects.
Refusal to embrace renewable energy and attempts to keep our energy infrastructure feeding money to the wealthy fossil fuel elites, could be Americas biggest mistake.
The US is in a great position to do so, but it hasn't because it's politicians are so focused on fossil fuels and fossil fuel companies don't want renewable technology to exist at all. Allies should be alarmed because the US getting serious about this will diminish their chances of cornering the market significantly, even though as allied nations they would still benefit greatly from the technology.
This is about energy, and energy is the one commodity that dominates global politics. It's why oil kingdoms in the middle east get to do whatever they want. It's a reason why Russia got away with their shit for so long. OPEC has more political strenh than most world governments because they control the supply of what everyone needs.
It's the sort of geopolitical move that establishes global dominance. The US and its allies still compete, they just do so in ways that are generally friendly and nonviolent. You don't want to be dependent on someone, even an ally, because what if they turn out to no longer be an ally at some point? And even if they are, you might be able to better serve your citizens by doing things yourself.
