I’d like to take this opportunity to remind everyone of Katherine Harris, George W Bush’s Florida campaign manager and at the same time Secretary of State of Florida. In her capacity as FLSoS, she purged 170,000 voters off the voter lists, under the pretense that they were felons, a pretense which was never proven and in many cases shown to be utterly false. Just straight up stole thousands of citizens’ right to vote. And the vast majority of them were black (and almost certainly democratic voters).
It's not just a majority (which would be fair, since Dems cast more votes overall). Dem ballots were thrown out three times as often as Republican ballots.
Democratic voters, who are much more likely to vote by mail, made up more than two-thirds of the total canceled ballots.
Yes I actually did the math and the ballots were rejected at the same rate at which Dems voted by mail. To put it simply, roughly 70% of PA mail in ballot requests were from Democrats. 68% of rejected ballots were from Democrats.
68% of ballots rejected were Democrats. Roughly 70% of mail in ballot requests were from Democrats. This is a complete non-issue.
Yah the article even points out how Democrats make up a majority of mail in voters. I did the math and 68% of ballots rejected were from Dems. That's basically exactly what percent of Dems requested to vote by mail.
It would follow that all other things being equal, a majority of cancelled ballots could easily be from Democratic voters.
