But…. on the tiny tiny chance that they’re just looking out for themselves, you should absolutely engage your own counsel. Legal advice from an adverse party is seldom good advice to take.
Don't take legal advice from your adversaries. The agreement they are offering undoubtedly has a full release written into it, whereby you would be releasing them from all responsibility for anything and everything. Retain counsel - quickly. You should have done this when they started encroaching on your yard and house. Their easement does not include your entire property. Also, when discussing this with prospective attorneys, ask them about including their legal fees in your claim for damages (normally this is not included).
If you get a lawyer, even if the agreement is identical to what they're currently offering you, they would have to cover your legal expenses and their costs go up.
Next time the rep comes by, get an offer in writing. If possible, get them to admit that they know they are trespassing etc. in the written offer. Do NOT sign anything. Take that offer to a lawyer of your choice.
They knew they were in the wrong. They made you an offer because you called them out on it and figured you would accept the payment and the promise to fix everything and they get off cheap.
BTW, I'm not a lawyer. This is literally how I would handle the situation. You should definitely speak to a lawyer and have a lawyer review any offer you get before you accept it.
