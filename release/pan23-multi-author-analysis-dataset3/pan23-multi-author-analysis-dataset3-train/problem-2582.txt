I’m assuming you don’t have individual leases? That you are joint tenants? Because if so you are all responsible for the entire amount of the lease. I’m sorry you have been put in this position and you need to be aware that this eviction is likely to cause you problems in renting in future but the only way to avoid it is to pay the total arrears yourself and I’m not advocating that.
If only you want to do this and the other tenants don't, plus you're all named on the same lease, I don't know if keeping yourself off the eviction by leaving in advance would be possible, but it might be worth consulting a lawyer about your options.
Unless there’s a lease agreement that explicitly outlines each of your rental obligations and limits evictions based on that, you are all responsible.
Any eviction on your records diminishes the pool of landlords who will consider renting to you. There are plenty of landlords who will just not take the risk, no matter how small it may be.
If you are all on the same lease, you may be able to negotiate with the landlord. If you all agree to leave and then do so, it's likely that the landlord would be satisfied with that rather than going to the trouble and expense of an eviction, and you would not have try to find a future rental while having an eviction on record.
