Then you get crazies who act on rage. It's why idiots assaulted Asians during covid. It's why twice (that I'm aware of) people got arrested in the last few weeks for talk of attacking Jews. Because people are agreeing with Kanye. Expand your mind and see the bigger picture.
No, the idea here is saying shit like, "they're indoctrinating our children, they're harming them.".
No, and that's my point. The right wing is up in arms about drag shows complaining that they are inherently sexual and that drag queens are sexualizing children, but not a peep about pageants for all of these years, which are all about sexualizing little girls.
Yet you don't see anyone gunning down pageant moms, right? You don't see the right wing freaking out about pageants, right?
All of this anti-drag rhetoric is just the villification of LBGTQ people, hidden under a veneer of "Won't anyone think of the children?!".
Right. Kids never enjoy dressing up in costume or dancing. That's adult stuff only. Better tell everyone who has their kids involved in cheerleading, dance, pageants, acting, etc. that they are grooming and sexualizing their kids.
