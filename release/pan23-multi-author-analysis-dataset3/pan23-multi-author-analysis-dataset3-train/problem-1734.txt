It wasn't "well known" at the time, both countries use s300 missiles. Furthermore, it was a Ukranian s300 used defensively to try and hit a Russian missile out of the air. For all intents and purposes it may as well have been a Russian missile, and the polish government said as much when they declined to blame Ukraine.
Remember when Zelensky kept repeating that it was a Russian missile that hit Poland even when it was known that it was actually an Ukrainian missile? This guy keeps lying because he sees getting NATO involved (in the actual fighting) as a way to win the war.
Afaik, DPR guys using Russian missiles. Possibly on the orders of Russia (I think an article about that last part came out recently).
I have no idea where I you read that I advocated for that in my comment. I was just commenting on how Zelensky seems to have a pattern of spreading lies to try to get NATO involved in the war.
Zelenskiy was just repeating the facts that his military provided him with, and trying to make clear that there are risks to everyone in the region.
