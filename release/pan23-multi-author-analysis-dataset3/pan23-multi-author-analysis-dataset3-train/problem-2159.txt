Why kill the children?! At least three of them say that the wives and children were also found dead. One of them say with blunt axe marks on them. The fuck.
Yeah no shit. Everyone knows it, and the Russians know that everyone knows it too. But that's why they do it.
They want you to know it was them, and the bodies are probably tortured/broken before being tossed out the window. They want everyone to know what will happen when they get on Putin's bad side. But the defenestration and false autopsy gives them just enough wiggle room to deny it while laughing in everyone's face, while we all know it wasn't an accident and Putin knows everyone knows too.
If you pay attention to how Putin's critics end up dead, there's not much effort put into making it look self inflicted or accidental - and that's the point.
People are going to start assuming that it is perfectly okay to assassinate Russian leaders within Russia, at some point.
At some point, Russia's tendency to assassinate people in other countries is gonna come back and bite them in the ass.
