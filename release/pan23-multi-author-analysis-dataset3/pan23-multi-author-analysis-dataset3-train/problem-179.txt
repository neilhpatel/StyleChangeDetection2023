Beyond whatever corruption exists, Russia simply doesnâ€™t have the economic means to service the number of vehicles in reserve.
Though, to be fair, it seems that the Russians have returned 600 T-62s to the fields of Ukraine if reports are accurate (specifically a Bulgarian article citing a little known Ukrainian outfit). If true that would be a significant achievement. Whether or not they can sustain that sort of surge. After all, the T-62 went out of production nearly 50 years ago.
It is known that Russia had several thousand T-64s in reserve, and 8,000 T-72s as well. This is on top of the 2,000 T-72s which were in active service.
Something like 2k (each) T-62 & T-64, another 8k T-72 tanks, 3k T-80s and who knows what else are all in reserve. Something above 10k tank hulls are designated as some level of operationally capable reserve. There is no way that Russia can adequately maintain those vehicles in anything approaching a serviceable state.
As we've seen, Russia's number of operational vehicles were far less than even they knew. A running truck with rotted tires is just as useless as one that doesn't run.
