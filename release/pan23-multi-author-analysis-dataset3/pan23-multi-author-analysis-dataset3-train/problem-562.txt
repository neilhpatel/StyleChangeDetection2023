"I've worked hard and I deserve this", "I am looking out for my family", etc can show a very different picture depending on what side of the fence you are on.

Set up a pillow fort in the living room and watch Fern Gully with her. Watch Severn Suzuki's 1992 speech with her when she's old enough. Watch Stephen Fry in Last Chance to See, and Nova and David Attenborough. We need to keep having this conversation with the younger generations, it cannot end with us.
