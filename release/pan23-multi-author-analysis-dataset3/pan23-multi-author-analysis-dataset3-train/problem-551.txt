There's also a good chance that baby daddy and your ex plan to go after you for child support the second you lose the ability to fight it. Ex and baby daddy live together and are raising the child together, but ex is trying to convince you you don't need to take action because you're not on the birth certificate? And baby daddy is totally cool with raising the kid, but doesn't want to claim paternity or any of the rights that go with that? Sounds like an obvious long con to me.
OP, just in case this isn't clear, it doesn't matter if you're on the birth certificate or not. The law considers you the father until you get an order that says otherwise.
In my jurisdiction, I would probably file a motion to amend the divorce decree so that the decree reflects you are not the father. I would file this in the same case as the divorce.
You may be able to terminate parental rights in the divorce decree. (I’m a lawyer but not in Texas.) Otherwise you’ll need a separate proceeding to terminate your parental rights. I would imagine with a negative DNA test that’s a slam-dunk. Opening the proceeding would likely force your ex to get the baby tested. Best of luck.
