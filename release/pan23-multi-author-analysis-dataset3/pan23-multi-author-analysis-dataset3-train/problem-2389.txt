Because each refinery is owned by someone else and they’ll expand and get the price increase while you get just the price. Shareholders like seeing production expansion.
Funny enough, there’s been very little new refineries because there’s been an oversupply. I think everyone forgets oil was in the shitter post 2015. So No one’s investing in a new refinery that’ll requires 20+ years to finally return a profit just because oil and gas is expensive for a year lol.
Plus Oil companies see that fossil fuels are approaching the end of their product lifecycle curve and are not wanting to invest billions upon billions in new refineries that won't recoup on....so we have very real bottlenecks in the production chain.
If there is a shortage over there (caused by little things like a global cabal cutting production or sanctions on one of the largest oil producers in the world due to a war) and people over there are willing to pay more than we are; our domestic goes over there or we pay more.
More than likely when those markets get really big, I think Energy companies will start buying up players in that space.
