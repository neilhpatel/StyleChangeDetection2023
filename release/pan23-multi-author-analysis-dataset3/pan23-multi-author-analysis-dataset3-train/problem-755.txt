It’s fact specific on a legal and medical side. Someone is going to have to look over your medical files and see what should have happened and if what should have would have made a difference in outcome. You’d need to prove they deviated from standard of care or were negligent.
Anyone who said "No, that's not malpractice" would be taking a risk. It's not bad to tell a person who has no case "you have no case". It's literally the worst thing possible, though, to say "you have no case" to someone who does. Telling someone who has no case "you totally have a case" is nowhere near as devastating as being the person who talked them out of pursuing a legitimate legal claim.
There's nothing wrong with asking, and the reluctance of people to answer isn't from a lack of desire to help.
It's just that in the case of malpractice (medical, legal, etc) the only safe answer is "It could be malpractice, but you need to talk to a lawyer".
But there's another reason for the stock answer: if only for your peace of mind, if this troubling you you should talk to medical malpractice lawyer.
