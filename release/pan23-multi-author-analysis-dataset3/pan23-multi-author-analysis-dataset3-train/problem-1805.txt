If you do not own the home you should at least have renter's insurance. If you do not have renter's insurance, then you should reach out to your landlord to see what their homeowners insurance policy covers.
This is the proper answer and the reason why people have home-owners insurance. The insurance company has lawyers who are paid to work for you when you need to file a claim in a situation like this.
Can you clarify who you mean by "them"? Are you referring to the police department / city, or your insurance company? Homeowners insurance will fix just about anything you file a claim for, even if it's your fault or nobody's fault. And if it's somebody else's fault, they'll pursue them and/or their insurance company for compensation.
If neither of these options work for you for whatever reason, you should seek out an attorney that specializes in Real Estate Property Damage for a consultation. Do you have a rough idea what the dollar amount of the property damage is? Edit: Aside from contacting your insurance company, this is the next step you should focus on, so you can be fairly compensated for the damages that occurred.
Your homeowners insurance will pay for the repairs, then go after the city or county agency to recoup the money. They have more resources and attorneys to force them to than you individually.
