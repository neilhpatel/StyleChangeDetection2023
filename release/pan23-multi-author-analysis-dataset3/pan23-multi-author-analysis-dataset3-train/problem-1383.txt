Slavery in Anglo-Saxon England, pre-1066, was slavery. Full stop. We are not talking about serfdom, or indentured servitude, or another different institution. Now this does not mean that slavery in England was the same as it was in other historical contexts. The numbers of slaves in the Antebellum South were much much higher as a percentage of the population than in England, but nevertheless they were present.
Slavery was an integral part of Anglo-Saxon England from its very inception. Law codes, penitentials, and wills all attest to slavery as a widespread practice. However this was not necessarily the same kind of slavery that is naturally assumed by people today. Americans especially often associate all slavery with the race based chattel slavery of the Ante-Bellum South, but this is not always the case historically.
Is there some standard definition of slavery that historians use that is different from the common usage?
As a follow-up question, why was slavery outlawed, if it was presumably, socially acceptable prior to that point? Was there anything resembling the Abolitionist movement that led to the banning of Trans-Atlantic slavery centuries later?
Wait so if slavery was outlawed in England in the 12th century, why were there slaves in the American Colonies? Did the slave ban not apply in colonies?
From the post, it seems like serfs should be considered slaves. You could also make the argument that a sufficiently restrictive employment contract with a transferability clause would constitute slavery.
