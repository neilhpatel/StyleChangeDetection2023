i’ve been riding since December. I’m a really new rider still so I don’t like going fast. I don’t actively speed because i’m still not 100% comfortable with riding.
i have no idea what my speed was. i was pacing the person next to me not the leader bikes. i’ve been told by a few i should fight it because you can’t radar everyone in the group. the guy in the back with the broken bike is fighting bc there was no way he could go 80 in 2nd gear without making his engine sound like it was struggling.
it’s actually very common to lose sight of those in front. the leader bikes would stop at every turn we had to take and waited for the rest of us to catch up. every turn or every emergency. we definitely weren’t going the same speed all the way for 5 hours straight.
It is unlikely that you would have been able to keep pace for 5hrs without going similar speeds. If you do not know how fast you were going, it's very likely that you were indeed going 80mph.
It sounds like there were a group of you all keeping pace with each other. The lead biker was going 80 and therefore you were all going roughly 80. You were all pulled over.
