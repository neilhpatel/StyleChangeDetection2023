If they run with this as a reason not to indict, the entire country should quit working and take to the streets. This isn't going to fly with people that have been paying attention.
The midterms have proven that Americans aren't willing to put up with obvious lies, and this is as obvious as a lie gets. This excuse will not stand.
It’s not an excuse - it’s just a fact. He’s a narcissist. Anyone who knows anything about or has dealt with narcissists know ego absolutely was involved in any decision he makes. He couldn’t handle the ego injury of being rejected by the American people. He took things he decided were his because he needed to make himself feel powerful and important. He likely showed them off or at least bragged about them to people to bask in their awe at how important he still must be to have those things. There are also still a bunch of empty folders. Ego and money are intertwined for him. He is definitely not above selling state secrets if he thought he could get away with it (and he’s a narcissist who has a well-honed “deny and delay” tactic that he’s used in court for DECADES so he is convinced he can get away with it). This isn’t the last of this by a long shot.
He’s an unintelligent, narcissistic moron yes but he still broke the law…many many times. I think the people who are freaking out he’s not going to be charged are jumping over a huge gulf to reach that conclusion. This article is just stating a fact. I don’t think it’s suggesting no charges are coming.
After reading this, I don't believe the will indict him. They had plenty of time to do it before he announced his run but chose not to, therefore adding another excuse to let him off.
So why were there a bunch of empty folders. There must have been something in them so where are those contents?
