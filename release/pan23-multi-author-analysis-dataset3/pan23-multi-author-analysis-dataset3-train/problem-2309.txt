The paper provides an overview of Russia’s nuclear forces. Russia’s strategic nuclear forces have about 310 ICBMs with 800 warheads deployed, 176 SLBMs with 624 warheads deployed, and <70 bombers that can carry.
"According to official and unofficial sources, Russia’s ICBM force currently comprises 310 missiles that can carry up to 1,189 warheads, although only about 800 warheads are deployed and available for use...
All available evidence suggests that a) Russia has been engaging in a modernization program of its nuclear armed forces for many years now (and verified by independent think tanks), and b) it frequently does nuclear drills including the launch of ICBMs and SLBMs.
Surprised this is all the way down at the bottom while the armchair nuclear weapons experts above argue about how Russia is either increasing their nuclear weapons or none of them work.
But then again, many people on this thread are fucking idiots, who willingly ignore all evidence of Russia modernizing its nuclear arsenal.
Yeah, the Soviets were perfectly capable of building good nuclear weapons and missiles, and like literally every nuclear power, Russia is busy modernizing it over time. This really shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone, really.
