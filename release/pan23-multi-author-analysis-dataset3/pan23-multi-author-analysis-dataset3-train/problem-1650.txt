Through norms and conduct. If it is normal for you all to stay out of each other's bedrooms without permission, then that is a norm or conduct that can be used through testimony to establish the boundaries of the expectation of privacy. Not everything has to be spelled out in a contract or agreement.
Invasion of privacy laws require an expectation of privacy and a violation of the privacy. Your roommates don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in areas where they are not supposed to be without authorization, i.e. your bedroom. If you invite them into your bedroom for whatever reason, now they might have an expectation of privacy. For example, if one says can I change I try this dress on in your room, and you say yes, and they disrobe, you might have a problem as there was an expectation of privacy.
Adding to this: anyone with permission to be in the bedroom has a reasonable expectation of privacy in it.
A situation where the tenants all use bedrooms interchangeably would be the one that's considered unusual and require proof.
You are correct that the apartment lease probably didn't specify, but the housemates between themselves most likely did and should have little problems arguing that based on who's stuff is in what bedroom.
Yes, but if it is designated as your specific bedroom, and you do not share that room with another person, you have the right to reasonable privacy. You can have a camera.
