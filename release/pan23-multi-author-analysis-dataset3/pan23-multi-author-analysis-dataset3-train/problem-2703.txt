"Likewise the Emperor has conceded to us churches, priests, and baptism according to our custom in Constantinople and in other parts of his empire; these churches, priests, and baptism are exempt from Imperial authority...".
In that case, the point of conceding churches and other buildings to the Venetians (and, later, the other maritime republics) was that they would be allowed to use their own Latin rite there. Otherwise they would have to worship at a Greek rite church, which might not have been a big deal earlier in the 11th century, but Rome and Constantinople had been out of communion with each other since 1054.
And all of this, really, stems from the 1082 chrysobull where Venice was granted special rights for the first time, including Latin-rite churches.
In the 14th century we see Venice warming up more and more to Rome and eventually adopting the Roman Rite as a conformation of this. In 1451 the many different forms the religious heads of the region were combined into the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice.
