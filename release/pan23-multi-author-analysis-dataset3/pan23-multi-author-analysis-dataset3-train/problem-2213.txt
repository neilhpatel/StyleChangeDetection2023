Ben Shapiro must be pissed he wasn't asked, he claims to have a complete understanding of the Jewish faith when he tells actual religious leaders they are wrong.
I'm going to take you at face value and try to explain it, because Judaism doesn't work in the same way that Christianity does in this case:
I mean, Christianity is just pagans appropriating the culture of the ancient Tribe of Jews to the point they claim they're the real Israelites now and Jews aren't. Took their books and customs and land. If that's not cultural appropriation idk what is.
Are there republican Jews? Of course. But they're a tiny minority of a tiny minority. Idk why certain people in this sub seem so interesting in spreading this malicious bullshit narrative that there's loads of Republican Jews when it has no basis in fact.
That being said, there ARE a lot of very antisemitic sounding "critiques" of Israel I find super disturbing and inaccurate.
While it's good for our country to address the disturbingly popular rise of antisemitism, I must say that we cannot classify criticism of Israeli government as antisemitic.
Many antisemitic people ONLY see Israel, and seem unable to criticize their own country of origin, which is obviously biased.
Yes, but those same traitors call people like me who criticize the Israeli government by that same word "self hating jew".
For example I sub to r/Lebanon and while there's a lot of Israel hate they almost always make sure to clarify they don't hate all Jews or even all Israelis, which is incredible and lovely to see. I see the same sentiment towards Muslims among young Jews.
