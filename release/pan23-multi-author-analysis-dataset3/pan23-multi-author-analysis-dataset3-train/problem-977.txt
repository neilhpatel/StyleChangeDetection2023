The M1128 Mobile Gun System has the same 105mm gun as the original M1 Abrams (can fire standard 105mm NATO L7 tank shells) and was set to be retired by the US Army at the end of 2022 in favor of 30mm and CROWS-J (Javelin / Mk19 coax).
It possesses sufficient cross-country mobility to keep up with the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, medium and long-range firepower capable of defeating any vehicle on the battlefield, and is adequately armored to protect the crew from artillery and small arms threats. The Bradley is able to close with and destroy enemy forces in support of mounted and dismounted Infantry and Cavalry combat operations.
The Bradley is an infantry carrier that can do reconnaissance and destroy other tanks. If it was a light tank there would be no capability for mechanized operations.
They are much lighter than our Abrams tanks but are still very good at taking our Russian tanks from long range.
Their anti tank missiles have longer range than Russian tank cannons so Ukraine can shoot and scoot while staying out of the range their target can retaliate with.
