A POA agent, as a general rule, has no obligation to distribute any money to anybody, unless the POA document says so. The usual exception is paying the principal's bills. If the agent changes the insurance beneficiary without authorization from grandmother, that might be fraud. As soon as grandmother dies, the agent loses all power to act as agent.
Do you think that cousin got herself listed as beneficiary of the life insurance before or after your grandmother died? I'm trying to figure out the exact sequence of events. Whose life was being insured, your father's or your grandmother's?
"The key thing here is that I know that my grandmother cashed out my dads life insurance. Then she died just months later. My cousin now has that money ...".
IF your Grandmother did not cash in the policy, then the insurance proceeds become part of her estate.
So, my grandmother did indeed cash in the life insurance. I donâ€™t know how much it was. Then my cousin gets my grandmother to sign over POA to her. My grandmother passed away only a few months later. So... what happened to the money? My cousin will not let me see any paperwork.
