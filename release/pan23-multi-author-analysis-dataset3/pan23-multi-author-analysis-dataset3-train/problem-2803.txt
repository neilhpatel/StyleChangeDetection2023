Do they honestly think God gives a shit about whether their football team wins? I mean seriously. What is it with Christian nationalism and the idea of sports somehow implying some sort of divine favor?
“Regulated” comes from “regular” which is how a master mason is to govern a lodge, equitable to how the sun rules the day and the moon governs the night.
They wrote the constitution, so the conventions they used must have been particular. So I’d say a well regulated militia means one that is governed consistently under rule of law.
Alexander Hamilton had the best description when he argued against having ALL men in a "well regulated" militia:
"A  tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a WELL-REGULATED MILITIA, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss.".
Well not really. In my high school students got sent home or otherwise punished for wearing shirts with alcohol products depicted, references to drugs, etc. Hell in my middle school they cracked down on kids wearing pajama pants (I've always thought that was ridiculous). Then of course there are the standard dress code rules about skirt lenhs etc. But yeah, historically schools do control what kids can wear.
Don't most PUBLIC schools have dress restrictions with respect to disruptive attire? Whether this T-shirt should be considered such is a judgment call, and I could see reasons to believe banning it would be, er, overkill.
