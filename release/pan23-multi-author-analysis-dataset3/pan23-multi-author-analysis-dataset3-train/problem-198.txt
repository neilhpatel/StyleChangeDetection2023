I have a doorbell camera. I’ve watched these occupants come and go daily and the time they moved in . Ty for responding. I didn’t know about the marijuana . I’m not sure if she saw the other things. I saw a quick glance of the picture she took. I do know that there’s a rifle that one of the occupants moved in with but I have no proof if it’s real so I’m keeping quiet on that . It’s probably most likely real tho.
To your knowledge it's real. So call into the PD and report a narcotics user in possession of firearms. Sure weed is legal in California at the state level, but federal rules still apply to firearm possession, and federally, Marijuana is an illegal narcotic.
Not a lawyer or ll, just a pothead, but individuals in ca can have several ounces of cannabis in their possession legally.
That's gonna be your easiest path, since the Marijuana isn't necessarily illegal at the state area (since you don't know how much). Constant I'm and out probably means they're dealing, but you don't know that for sure and it's gonna take a while for the PD to get anywhere with that.
