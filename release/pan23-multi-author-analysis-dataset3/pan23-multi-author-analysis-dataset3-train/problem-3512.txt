Re: the Athenian Agora, was the first hour to 6th measured by sunrise? So from the first hour of sunrise to the 6th, which is presumably a little after noon?
The first hour always began when the sun rose, and noon was when the sun was at its meridian. At Athens' latitude, this would be the equivalent of about 6 AM to 1 PM in midsummer.
Unless the library had a dedicated water clock (unlikely; it was pretty small) you would have had to check a sundial. Some water clocks were designed to chime or make other noises on the hour, but these were expensive and rare - and in any case, since everybody was setting their clocks quite imprecisely by the sun, all of Athens' clocks would have sounded at different times.
"No book is to be taken out because we \[the members of the association running the library\] have sworn an oath. (The library) is to be open from the first hour until the sixth".
If the library was only open for six hours, what did its staff (attendants? docents?) do for the rest of their day?
