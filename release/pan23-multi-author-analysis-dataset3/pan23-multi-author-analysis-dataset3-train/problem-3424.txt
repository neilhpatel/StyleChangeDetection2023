Source? Is that an overall number or was this one exit poll? Because that would be a massive increase from 2020, and it’s too early to have an credible analysis done, what we do know, for a fact, is that women in all racial/ethnic demographics are more likely to vote Dem than men.
Some people just refuse to acknowledge reality. She was never treated like a media darling, especially when she was running for office. And not only has the mainstream media been hypercritical, but she also had to deal with non-stop fabrications, decades of attacks and grifters selling books full of conspiracy theory, and the entire rightwing media hellbent on her destruction. Whenever someone claims Clinton was favored by the media it’s clear they don’t pay any attention to the media.
Yeah, Clinton did some things wrong, and what's worse is that the media and the electorate wronged her, too.
The DNC is not the reason Bernie got 3,700,000 fewer votes than Clinton. One guy sent an inter-office email saying something about attacking Bernie for being Jewish and that guy got immediately fired for it. If Hillary Clinton's private email server and the Russian hack of her campaign emails wasn't enough to tank her then Bernie can't blame his loss on a single email, I'm sorry.
Do you remember when Sanders came out and said "Can we please stop talking about Hillary Clinton's damn emails?".
I get it. Only confidant men are ok with you. Confidant women don't know their place. I see your thinking, just disagree completely. So you got the very "confidant" trump. So confidant he thinks he's still president. But complain about Hillary. Wow.
Yep. And if women wanted to have rights then they could have given the Dems 2 more seats in the Senate and control of the House to codify Roe. But that didn't happen, so a woman's ability to control her own body will, for the foreseeable future in America, be between a woman, her doctor, and 'local political leaders'.
