If what they did was somehow outrageous they may have liability here. If they did things more or less right and the condition of the roof or the weather led to an unfortunate outcome you may have a challenge.
There is an expectation of them covering the roof with tarps, etc. in the event of rain. The amount that came through implies that they failed to do a satisfactory job of attempting to keep the rain out. There was at least one tarp in sight and not in use and they were all taking a break during the rain and not trying to cover it better. We were also told that once the waterproof layer was up (which it was at this time) that rain would not be an issue.
There was nothing in the contract releasing them from liability for water damage caused by them. This is not common or acceptable from what I can find out through internet searches.
The conversation I’ve had so far with my company contact gave the distinct impression that this is a big deal and they plan to do something about it, I’m trying to get an idea of how much to expect in terms of reparations.
