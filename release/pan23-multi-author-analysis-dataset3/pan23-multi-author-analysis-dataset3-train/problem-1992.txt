Courts are always pretty lenient on deadlines when asked (that may be somewhat less true in the appeals process), preferring to see cases decided on their merits rather than technical error. So you might be prepared for the fact that the appellant may be able to respond to your motion to dismiss by coming current and keeping the case moving.
If a deadline has passed in the appeal process without the correct action by the appellant, you may be able to move to dismiss the appeal.
If the other side has not filed its brief, the appeal may have been dismissed for lack of prosecution.
I'd also say appeals can be very technical and you might need to retain counsel if this person's appeal is active and if you need to file a brief.
I would strongly consider filing a letter with the appellate court with jurisdiction requesting the Court provide a status update of the case, whether any extensions were granted to the appellant, and whether the appeal is still an active case on the docket. I would include in your letter that you have received nothing from the appellant or the court since November 2020 and you are inquiring in order to protect your due process rights.
