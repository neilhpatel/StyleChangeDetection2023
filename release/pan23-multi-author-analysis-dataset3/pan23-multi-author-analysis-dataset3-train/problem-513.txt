"H - Hypothetically speaking, imagine that Taiwan is a big jar of honey. In this situation, China is like the bear trying to get at the honey. That's not their honey to take! China has no legitimate claim over the Taiwanese territories".
It's would China invade Taiwan. Obviously the Chinese military is no where near the US military capability and effectiveness.
If China wants to eventually become a global military power, they would have to either charm Taiwan into a military alliance (away from USA influence), or take it. Until they do, China's ambitions are restricted to a regional basis.
What China is preparing for is just in case the equation shifts. The CCP does not think in 4-year election cycles. They plan in terms of decades. They are hoping most of all for the USA to someday remove itself from the picture, such as an insular pro-isolation President and Congress, possibly following a financial crisis. Alternatively, the US could find itself embroiled in a military conflict where it could not possibly commit forces to directly defending Taiwan, especially navally. But another very important consideration is if the USA lost its main allies for logistics: Philippines, Japan and South Korea. Say maybe the US elected a president who insulted every ally in Asia and was openly racist to Asians, offending all their governments. Or if China managed to charm all those countries into their allies (not likely right now considering how it acts).
The worst, most power hungry Chinese leaders aren’t imperialists like the worst western leaders. Their main ambition isn’t to increase power or wealth or standing relative to the world. It’s to cement control over China. You pursue the former only to bolster the latter. Xi might be this kind of leader.
