If OPs lease doesn’t SPECIFICALLY include a dishwasher couldn’t their landlord remove the dishwasher and call it “fixed” because it’s not guaranteed in the lease?
I think you can tell them that you it is the landlord's obligation to provide a functioning dishwasher and he's in default of the lease and you expect this to be resolved or "cured" in X days or you will deem it a breach of the lease and take legal action, etc. Does the lease mention the dishwasher or appliances?
Why not? If landlord has a an obligation to provide a dishwasher, and landlord doesn't do it, and is given notice of the issue and fails to cure it, isn't the landlord in breach of the lease?
There is nothing mentioned in our lease specifically but the indiana tenant laws states that we have the right to pay rent towards getting the problem fixed if they don't.
So, in most states you can't deduct repairs from rent (especially as they've "repaired" it 15 times). It's typically a violation of a lease for a tenant to make repairs at all (and they can withhold your security deposit after move-out if you do), but your lease sounds a bit lacking.
If your state AND lease allows you to make repairs, and includes repairs that are not exclusive to the Warranty of Habitability, then you typically have to put any withheld rent into escrow. I'd call my state code enforcement to confirm that you are understanding the law correctly, b/c they can just deduct that missing chunk of rent from your deposit when you move out.
