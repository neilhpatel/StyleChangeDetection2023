If the battle did turn into a hand-to-hand melee, the Turks would sling their bows over their shoulders, and use their other weapons - shields, clubs, and small swords. Ideally, by this point the enemy would already be terrified and exhausted.
The Turks did practise precision, as noted in the Mamluk archery manual. But from a distance, accuracy was not too important, and their arrows may not even have been lethal. At least among the crusaders, heavily-armoured knights might not be killed by arrows, but arrows would get stuck in their armour - it may have looked amusing in hindsight, but at the time it was probably terrifying, never knowing whether the next arrow would pierce the armour or not. The Turks quickly realized that European knights were pretty ineffective without their horses, so they targeted horses if they could.
But compared to Turkic cavalry, European knights were very slow. There wasn’t really an organized mass of cavalry or foot soldiers for a crusader army to charge at. The lighter and faster Turks were constantly charging at them, loosing their arrows, retreating, regrouping, and repeating. Advantage 1: an army of heavy cavalry was too slow to catch Turkic light cavalry. Archers on foot could shoot at them, as long as the Turks stopped in one place, which they usually didn’t.
It seems strange that the men wouldn't have encountered arrow volleys before weren't they used in battles in England?
But, not to take your question too literally, yeah they must have been familiar with archery in warfare in France and elsewhere on the content. But as Hergrim noted, apparently they had never encountered archery quite like this.
Was there ever any success in countering mounted archers with archers or crossbowmen on foot? Seams to me that on foot you can have a more powerful bow (wider range) and are shooting at a bigger target that has no or little armor.
