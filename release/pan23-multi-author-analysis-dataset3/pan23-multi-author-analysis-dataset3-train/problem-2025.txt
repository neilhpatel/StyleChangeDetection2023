So the visa he has right now is not one he applied for just to come see me. He visited the US some years before we got together and the purpose of this visit was to be a tourist and visit attractions for 2 months with his family. It was weird because the CBP asked him some random question about the visa application: “Did you say you were a college professor when applying for your visa?” I don’t even know why he asked that lol.
Well because you can’t transfer your credits from a Brazilian university to one here (We have looked into it so he would be able to move here sooner) And it’s dummy expensive comparatively. Why would you restart your degree when you’re only a year and a half away from being done?
Last visit, (3 month duration) he was taken in for secondary questioning but they let him go and didn’t shorten his stay.
They would have had notes of his prior secondary inspection when they hassled him about his three month visit in 2019 or 2020. They know you're real. His relationship with you is the problem, in their eyes.
