Utah has a pesky law that basically says if you are in 'physical control' of a vehicle while intoxicated, you can be charged with a DUI.
The definition of "Actual physical control" in Utah DUI law is earlier in Chapter 6A. It lists some of the factors a jury may consider. Your attorney will probably rely on an argument about the "totality of the circumstances" and argue you were collecting possessions from the truck and never intended to drive it.
You may have an excellent defense to being in "actual physical control" of the truck if you were not in the driver's seat. The testimony of the officer and the witness may be a necessary component of that defense.
The only reasonable argument is that you weren't in "actual physical control" of the vehicle. The prosecutor probably has irrefutable evidence of your intoxication, and in Utah there are probably no juries who are nullification-minded about DUI.
That's only necessary if police are going to ask you questions while you are in custody and want the answers to be usable in court. Most DUI prosecutions are not based on statements made by the suspect while in custody, especially not when the suspect is passed-out drunk.
