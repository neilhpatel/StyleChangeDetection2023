Well, others are giving legal advice but if I was warned that police were coming to an inspection there would not be anything questionable or illegal at my apartment.
If your landlord IS accompanied by a police officer and that officer attempts to enter your home, you may (politely) state to the officer that you do not consent for them to enter and that you would like for them to wait outside. They may enter anyways, in which case you should not interfere with them and let them do their thing. Remember, the only place to argue and fight with the police is the courtroom.
I wouldn't be surprised if this whole thing is a scare tactic by your landlord anyways. Do you live in a high crime area or student housing?
If you do have anything illegal inside your home, it would be advisable to make sure it is not in plain sight regardless. The police conduct searches unlawfully all the time, both through malice or incompetence (or both), and you will be footing the legal bills and dealing with massive headaches even if they arrest you pursuant to an unlawful search. Additionally, your landlord seeing and reporting illegal things in your unit during the course of his lawful inspection may give the police sufficient evidence to get a search warrant of your home.
Baring any exigent circumstances, or a reasonable belief that your unit has been abandoned, your landlord generally cannot allow the police to enter your home without a warrant.
You can deny the police entry if you want to, they have zero right to enter unless they have a warrant or there are exigent circumstances, even if your landlord is there with them. You have exclusive access to the property through your lease.
