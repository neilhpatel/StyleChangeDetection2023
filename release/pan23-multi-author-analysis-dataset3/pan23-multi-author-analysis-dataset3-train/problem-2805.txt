Incest leads directly to mental and physical birth defects and sexual predation in the home. As there are no positive sexual or mental health aspects to incest it should be strongly discouraged and banned wherever promoted.
Edit; after reading more of this thread I honestly can’t tell if you’re advocating against homosexuality or in favour of incest. It seems like you’re anti-gay, but you’re only expressing it through making relatively compelling and long winded arguments in favour of allowing siblings to fuck each other lmao.
There's so much clear daylight between calling DiCaprio a creep, and calling for the violent murder of gay people that I cannot believe you're not being deliberately disingenuous.
I think DiCaprio exclusively dating women half his age is creepy, deeply immature, leering behaviour. There doesn't need to be victimhood for people to disapprove.
And again, in the context of "the backlash to an LGBT couple I in fucking Yemen" you go "but people on the Internet saying he should date women closer to his own age, and it's comparable oppression" you're either a troll or a DiCaprio Stan who recently suffered a head injury.
His post is not "in the context of the backlash to an LGBT couple I in fucking Yemen", it's in the context of "people being angry at what other people do in their personal lives if its between consenting adults".
