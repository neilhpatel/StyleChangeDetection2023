What's happening on the boat deck is that barely anyone is there, and those that are simply won't get in. Why would they? Titanic doesn't seem in any serious danger and she's too safe to actually sink, right? And even if she did, it might take hours- even days. Lightoller knows opposite and he's on a time crunch. He lowers away the first few boats from the boat deck mostly empty because he has no time to waste waiting for passengers to meander up to the boats and decide if they want to get in or not. His decision here is right- Titanic did actually sink before they were able to get off all her boats. There is, quite literally, no time to waste.
The big ones were 24 hour wireless service (Titanic's wireless was running 24/7- but that was a rarity), and basing lifeboat space off passenger capacity and not the weight of the vessel. A few others- all of these were adapted by SOLAS and became maritime law at the recommendation of Lightoller.
You mentioned that Lightoller's recommendations for maritime safety were adopted, what sort of stuff did he recommend?
