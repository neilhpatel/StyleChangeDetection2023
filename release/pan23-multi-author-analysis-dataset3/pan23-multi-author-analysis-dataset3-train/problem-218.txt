It has literally always taken this long. it's just that when someone is winning by enough, you can call the race early but the counting still goes on for weeks.
Close races should not have anything to do with what I am saying. If it was a close race it should be stuck at 99% without a winner called. I'm talking about the races that were stuck at 40, 50, 60% for an entire week. That was never the norm.
This is actually the norm for elections. We know who the winner is within a few hours typically because you can see the voting trends and call it. But the actual vote count always takes a week or two or three depending.
It has never been the norm to need more than a week to count ballots. We have always known who won by the next morning with the exception of Bush v Gore. Now we see patterns in two consecutive elections where specific races are drawn out for several weeks and it ends up favoring the Democrat by 78%. Are we not supposed to ask questions? Can we not have a transparent audit (not recount)?
