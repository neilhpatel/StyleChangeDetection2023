Sure they can. But right now, the landlord has no incentive to do anything as long as the tenants are paying rent. You need to give the landlord a reason to intervene.
Hire a lawyer to send a letter notifying the property owner that his tenants are creating a nuisance and impairing your use of your property and that if they don't stop you will sue the landlord for nuisance.
In some places, New York and California, landlords can get sued for negligence of their tenants' repetitive bad behaviors. So if their tenants causing trouble for the neighbors and you have reported it to the landlord, you can argue in court that it was the landlord who permits such nuisances.
In short, just send a letter to the landlord, adding other neighbors' testimony if you can as well, should force their hand to do something about their tenants if they don't want to get sued. (Not that I know about Iowa).
File a formal complaint with the police, take pictures and video records as well. Send the copies of those records to housing agencies and the landlord. Explain what is going on and how their tenants causing you distress.
If you're considering suing the tenants or landlord, as other commentors suggest, then you should do a few things. First, start a log of each time they do something untoward. Loud party? Write it down. Urinating outside? Write it down. Trespassing on your property? Log it. Time, date, and what happened.
