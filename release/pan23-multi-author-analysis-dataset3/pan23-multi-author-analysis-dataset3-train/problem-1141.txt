If you're following all the rules and laws for lending money in your state (and theirs) then it's fine.
And if you have to go to that sub to borrow money, you're a terrible risk, which is why no actual lenders will touch them.
Bluntly, if you can't afford to do credit checks and keep up with lending laws in the states you do business in, you're taking on a huge risk by loaning out money. Not only do you take on the risk of defaults without adequate tools to gauge that risk, but you also take on the risk that your lending business violates the law in some way. Other than interest rates, many states have disclosure requirements for certain lending products, or limits on what kinds of recovery or acceleration terms can be included, or lots of other factors that could easily affect your loan portfolio.
A significant number of these kinds of loans include terms that are illegal, such as excessive interest above state-specific usury caps. The specific rate varies by state.
It depends on the state. The vast majority of the loans on that sub are illegal (violate usury laws). Also it's pretty unethical to charge desperate people huge interest, it creates a never-ending cycle of dependency. But legally, most states have usury limits (CA for example the maximum is 0.83% interest per month).
