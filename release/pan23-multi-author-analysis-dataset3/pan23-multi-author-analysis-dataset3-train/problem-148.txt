You don't say the state it happened in so that does make a big difference in what he could be charged with. If the legal age of consent in that state is under 18, that's a whole different story.
Good on you for surviving abuse and looking at standing up to this predator. You seem to be doing well, but counseling can still help.
Edit: Your local SHARP rep (or other service equivalent) likely has posters hanging up all around your unit. If you can't find their contact info easily, you should be able to call the base operator and ask for the base sexual assault/ harassment coordinator.
Someone like this doesn't stop at just one victim. He is likely a serial abuser/rapist and needs to be stopped. Who knows what he does to his daughter as well.
All military branches have sexual assault reps that you can contact (SHARP in the Army). While you probably are in a different area, they can at least give you resources, including counseling, to help you process this and determine your legal options. This would include experts in the state you are from who can talk about the process and what, if any, legal risk you have.
Whatever you decide to do, I think the most important thing is that you seek professional help. You're the most important part of this equation and you're worth it.
