Buried lines don't cause forest fires during dry seasons, don't collapse in ice storms/hurricanes/tornadoes and aren't an eyesore, but at least aerial power lines are cheaper. .
Yes. That’s how it used to be run. That was the system and then it was corrupted for profit. And now the companies running it have no incentive to fix it but may rely on the taxpayers to fund the infrastructure investments.
I don’t feel like the system, once deregulated, continued benefiting customers. I could be wrong but I don’t see Texas’ grid being elastic enough to meet demand without harming households/individuals. It’s a system where the firms running the grid do not have an incentive to invest in the infrastructure and seem to expect government to subsidize that investment. That does not feel like capitalism to me although it is what capitalism has become. Privatize the gains while socializing the losses is not capitalism but a corrupted form of it.
Privatize profits, socialize losses: we the people always pay for the greed, ill planning, and gross incompetence of the corporate psychopaths that control our representatives. I’m sure the investors in the privatized Texass power grid will not give one cow patty sized shit as they count their money (surely this includes many many Texass politicians too).
