Wow! I can finally provide some help with a question on /r/AskHistorians as a lawyer who does some labor, employment, and wage work, and as a big fan of the show. I can at least give some background on what we know about the show and about the wages Al earned while joking with Griff and.
Even better, we actually know Al's base salary! In , Al is offered "a year's salary" for an early retirement. How much? $12,000. At 40 hours a week that breaks down to about $5.77/hour. Or $231/week. Of course, Peg spent Al's retirement bonus in a single day, as she is known to do, and Al returned to work the very next day. (.
. As you can see, recent years have been historically extremely low. Rates generally consistently increased from the mid 7s in 1971 to double digits in 1980, to 17%(!) in 1982 before declining again.
It would have gotten worse for the next few years and then better. There was a “stagflation” economic crisis in the late 70s and early 80s, which means economic growth was low and inflation and unemployment were both high. This is a somewhat paradoxical economic outcome - usually unemployment and inflation move in opposite directions. When inflation is high, nominal interest rates are high also. After the early 80s, mortgage rates declined substantially.
