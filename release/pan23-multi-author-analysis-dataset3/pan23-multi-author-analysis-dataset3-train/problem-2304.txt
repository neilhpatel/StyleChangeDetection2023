In the dental world, OP just had a surgery (cutting into his gums and trying to find the foreign object). They next one could be more involved, but since it is in the same physical office, it is likely more of the same, just with an oral surgeon instead of a standard dentist.
In fact, you may have signed a similar form for this visit, but perhaps the dentist didn't bother since it was expected to be such a minor procedure.
That form would have covered side effects in general terms, so it wouldn't have said "you might end up with a bit of drill bit left in your mouth", but it would have covered the possibility of follow-up procedures and that is for things exactly like this.
That said, when you had your wisdom teeth out, they should have given you some paperwork that noted possible side effects and you would have had to sign it before they did the procedure. As far as I know, this isn't mandatory, but it's so common as to be a red flag if someplace doesn't do this. They have to have your informed consent to do surgery, and this form is how doctors cover their ass in case you come back later and claim you didn't consent.
