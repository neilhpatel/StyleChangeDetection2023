If it's a centralized government- then they need to STFU with all this backwards stuff. No more electoral college, no more abortion bans because a few states wanted it.
If federalism is the correct model - then we should abolish a lot of the rules that make the coasts subsidize the south and Midwest. We should be free to legalize what we want, ban what we don't. And the federal government should be forced to recognize our will. Obviously this will impede a lot of commerce and travel since people won't want to cross the line into places like Idaho.
If we go by the original constitution we are to be a federation, and more akin to the EU with various states with a high level of authority to make their own decisions.
But since the civil war, we really said "hey you fuckwad backwater states can't be trusted" and pulled towards a more centralized system where federal law reigns more powerful.
But really we need federal help to overturn the gerrymandering because the state is not as conservative as the legislature makes it seem.
Gotcha, so I should leave GA so you can have 2 less democratic senators and further concentrate liberal votes into already liberal states further ensuring nothing ever gets done?
