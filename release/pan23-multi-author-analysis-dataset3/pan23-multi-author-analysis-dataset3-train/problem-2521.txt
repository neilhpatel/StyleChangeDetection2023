Giving pets as surprise gifts is a horrible idea and the adoption agency is not going to allow that. They will chip the cat with the agency name as well and if the car gets out may refuse to return it to this random person.
I hope you consider how this will effect your friend If this cat gets outside and the rescue refuses to give it back to your friend six months, or six years, from now and your friend can't get the cat back.
If the friend doesn't want to go to an adoption event, smaller rescues that foster their cats will probably be able to arrange for you and your friend to visit the cat in their foster home, which is a quieter and less stressful environment.
I know the idea of showing up at your friend's with a cat with a ribbon around his or her neck is what's in your head. I get why you want to do that. But I have years of experience with this. Please trust me. The adopter and cat need to meet before the adoption -- for both of their sakes.
I'm helping a close friend with anxiety and other mental issues adopt a cat. They've owned a pet previously, and have no issues taking care of them, but have never gone the adoption route before. I was intending on going and adopting the pet for them (along with helping them with vet visits etc while they're getting their anxiety issues worked out) as a gift to them for Christmas, as they are going through a rough time and I wanted to surprise them.
