Right, the notary would be in our state, with us, but the people we are getting Power from (her parents) are in a different country.
Their version of a Power of Attorney (luckily called the same) sent in both languages to be sure, then getting signed and notarized, then taken to an apostilles for certification, then sent back to us.

As the other Parties to a Contract with your inlaws, I would want evidence that they/inlaws have given their Power of Attorney to someone in a documents that I am familiar with and that the Courts in the State recognize/have found sufficient to bind the principal.
I'm not sure you will to want to use "their version" of a Power of Attorney as the Parties to a Contract (in YOUR STATE) will want/only recognize the "statutory" State POA used in your State and recognized by the Courts.
