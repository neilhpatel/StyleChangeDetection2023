Did German soldiers captured by the Soviets in 1945 have accurate preconceptions of the way they would be treated? Where did those beliefs originate?
While I can certainly believe that German POWs were mistreated, it also seems like such rumors would have served as useful propaganda. German leadership would have wanted soldiers to hold their ground, and the Western Allies likely wouldn't have objected to the Soviets being delayed in the push to Berlin. I also wonder how well the stories of German POWs could have been relayed to the front, given the rapid collapse of the war machine.
I heard that some Allied commanders had local German citizens marched through concentration camps to show them what they had allowed to happen. How did these citizens react? Did this practice have any real effect on the popular consciousness? (I've only seen American/British perspectives on this, mostly documentaries but also the Death Mills film.).
A few things. I've about the unrealistic hopes that the Western Allies and the Soviets would have a break-up, and thus all Germany needed to do was hold on long enough for that to happen, at which point an honorable peace with the West would quickly be made and they both turn on the Soviets. German propaganda pushed this heavily in the final months, and certainly some people believed it, even if there might have been a voice in the back of their head telling them how crazy it was to hope for.
Anyways though, this one anecdote sums up the perspective of some, a mix of despair at the destruction wrought on Germany, and anger at the Allies for causing it, as opposed to the German leadership for bringing it about. Even those glad the fighting was at an end still has the dark reality of circumstances to face, after all. In any case though, by no means is there one, consistent perspective.
