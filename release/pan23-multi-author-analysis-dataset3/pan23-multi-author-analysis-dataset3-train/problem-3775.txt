The media is lying they said he did drag for 3 years but he was actually born a she and is in drag right now the call from the drag is coming from the house.
They seem to think that if left politics are pro drag queens reading to kids that the left must be pro any person in drag doing any thing, because visually they look the same.
A stop sign means stop because we assign it meaning, not because of something inherent to red octagons.
Yeah this is the funniest response I see online - "aren't you guys supposed to be into this?" as if they've caught the left being hypocrites, because they don't understand that signifiers and signified are separate things.
Anyway, what I meant was that conservatives seem to have a thing where the signifiers of politics are the politics. If you wear a certain hat, dress a certain way, then you're probably on that "team.".
"Fine. You got me. I ran the city's brunch circuit and was voted 'best drag storyteller' by the nation's kids, but I definitely didn't kill those homeless people who were found dead under the overpass.".
