ACA as it was passed was created specifically so it could pass to act as a placeholder that the Republicans would struggle to get rid of until we are able to create the health plan we’d make if we didn’t have to squeak it by a party that hates the idea of any government health care insurance.
I see some of the anti-single payer proponents of the ACA tout the premium subsidies (that is, what few of them actually talk about costs at all - it seems most of them just ignore the details entirely), but say nothing about the copays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums. Makes me wonder if any of these people actually bothered to look at the ACA marketplace on the first place.
Every year, I see articles like this and lots of people cheering it on. Just because you're enrolled in a healthcare plan doesn't mean it's affordable to actually use it. I myself haven't seen a doctor in over 2 years. I finally decided to bite the bullet and eat the copay and whatever inevitably ridiculous charge I end up getting for a visit I have scheduled next month - currently fighting with my insurance company (ACA plan, by the way) because the only doctor I could see at my local clinic before the end of the year isn't currently on their "in-network" provider list.
I suppose a $7,000 annual deductible and out-of-pocket maximum might not seem like a lot to some folks in the U.S., but to folks like me, it might as well be $70,000.
