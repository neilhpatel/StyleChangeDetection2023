It's often difficult to explain ancient jokes and there will be different explanations for this one. The basic elements are pretty standard fare for Greek comedy: donkeys are stupid and stubborn, figs are commonly used as a slang term for female genitalia, and unmixed wine - the drink of barbarians - is a great recipe for comedic chaos. The word used for fig in the relevant passage (Diogenes Laertius 7.185) is indeed the word that is often used to mean, essentially, pussy. But that doesn't seem to be the joke here.
In other words, Chrysippos saw two things that reminded him of Dionysos, and saw immediately that a third thing could complete the picture so perfectly that Dionysos himself might just have to pop down from Olympos to give him a round of applause. Donkey + fig: funny. Donkey + fig + unmixed wine: what would be the odds?
Rather, these three elements have something in common. They are all symbols of Dionysos, the god of drunken revelry. Donkeys and figs are associated with him - in the case of figs, the reason should be obvious - and nothing could be more Dionysian than unmixed wine.
If I remember correctly, Mary Beard in her work on ancient jokes said that the donkey didn't just eat any figs, but figs prepared for Chrysippos. In other words, the donkey was eating human food. She compared it to a few generations ago when "chimpanzee tea parties" were held at London Zoo. People laughed to see chimps behaving like humans - or not behaving like humans - at a very human event.
