China "That's literally the same thing you have done since 1945 and it hasn't worked since the 1980's! During my military experience we just try to bully smaller countries and when that fails we react disportionaly and cry about how unfair it is that we don't get what we want. And we make threats, a lot of threats. Maybe even kidnap some foreign nations and ransom.....I mean discover they are spies.".
This is the truth. Lived there many years and am in regular contact with friends and family. I can think of two times in the last year people mentioned the tensions or propaganda about war. Most of the conversations other than checking in to see how everyone is, revolves around the shit economy, zero COVID and now COVID surge, things like that.
I met a good number of young guys who were into military stuff, just like in the US - it's a biproduct of growing up in a militaristic nation. Most of them were fairly reverent of the US military and respected its capabilities and history (which is available in China if you care to look for it), even if they viewed it as an adversary.
War would be bad for the entire planet but, as someone not from the US, itâ€™s genuinely comical to me that China thinks it can engage the US in open war and win.
I think this is shortsighted; in a war with China, the only reason fighting would happen near the mainland would be because the USN expects to win it handedly. Blockades thousands of miles away from any Chinese land, like in the strait of Malacca, would cripple their ability to fight via a lack of fuel, as well as their economy as a whole. Taiwan is, of course, an important piece of land to consider, however I am unconvinced that the PRC could take it in a timely manner even if the USN refused any major engagements in nearby waters.
