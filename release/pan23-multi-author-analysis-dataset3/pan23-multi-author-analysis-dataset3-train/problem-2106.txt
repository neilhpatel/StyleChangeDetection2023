Even if this was investigated, the 'instigator' of the event is going to be looked at more harshly, and the person pressured into it would be the victim - which seems to describe your situation.
While incest between siblings is technically illegal, I don't think there's ever been a prosecution where the abuse started prior to age 18 and occasionally occurred afterward.
Further, background matters. Being that you were forced into this situation in your youth by a person with authority over you is going to be seen as "extenuating circumstances" ...kind of like if you ignore a 'no trespassing' sign and enter a spot where you are legally not permitted, but you are doing so because you are being chased by a murderer. No one is going to charge you with trespassing. Similarly, with your situation, no one is going to charge you with incest because post age 18 you had sex with a half-sibling.
