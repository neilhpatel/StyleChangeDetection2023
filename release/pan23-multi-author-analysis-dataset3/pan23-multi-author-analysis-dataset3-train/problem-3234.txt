I understand that, I was just wondering for a way for them to stop knocking in general legally speaking. ESPICIALLY after office hours. I shouldnt have people knocking at my door at 2am.
Not in this case due to Covid, I have to work somewhere but for me and my family our safety comes first, I dont want strangers (tenants) coming anywhere near my property for health reasons but also due to personal property and nobody likes their door knocked on all the time. My bosses approve it.
If i didn't have an office, MAYBE. But my bosses are in agreement with me, mostly because they want all interaction done via email so there is a clear communication and nothing can be twisted. Not saying Properties do everything right but Tenants also will fabricate conversations to get what they want.
It is not harassment for a tenant to knock on the property manager's door to discuss a matter with their leased property, no.
It is not illegal to knock on someone's door whether it's private property or not. The only way it would be considered harassment is if someone refuses to leave after you tell them to.
