Well, to advise you of the best process and the likelihood of success of that process, the questions in throw040913’s comment ask for the information needed. If the manager’s “harassment” of employees is legal, then there is no realistic chance of success of reporting him to any agency, the best bet would be to complain en masse to the franchise owner. If the harassment is illegal, that changes the advice.
I mean, the law says that once you report illegal (in this case sexual) harassment, the employer has to make it stop. You generally can't take legal action until after you've reported it. They don't have to reprimand or fire anyone, they just have to make it stop. Since they didn't make it stop, everyone who was targeted can file a complaint with the UALD. The transferred server might have extra things to report, if the transfer was in any way detrimental.
If this was reported to his boss and they didn't stop it, then each person who experienced this harassment can write up details of that harassment and separately report it to the Utah Antidiscrimination and Labor Division (UALD) and, if they won't take the case, to the federal EEOC.
Oh no worries. The point being that being harassed over X,Y,Z reasons isn't illegal, whereas A,B,C might be. And in many locations (where are you?) having fewer than 15 employees means no legal protections on this at all. But generally speaking, harassing someone on the basis of protected class characteristics (race, religion, gender, etc.) is illegal, whereas general harassment isn't.
You haven't articulated why this would be something the EEOC (not "equal opportunity employer" but "Equal Employment Opportunity Commission") would be interested in. What state is this, how many employees, and what is the nature of the harassment? Is it legal harassment, or illegal harassment? Most harassment is legal.
