The will was probated no? If there was a claim it should have been adjudicated then. If there was a valid claim on the part of Aunt 2 then Aunt 1 did her dirty by not bringing it up when it was supposed to be. I mean, she was executor of the estate. It was her job to make sure that none of that got missed. The deadline for that claim, valid or not, came and went with the formal disposal of the estate.
If there was an agreement and Aunt 1 didn't do her job in putting it in the settlement of the estate in the form of a lien or some other form of paperwork then she's the one responsible for any discord.
If OP did this, hopefully it would be with the advice of counsel and in the context of a settlement agreement whereby Aunt 2 agreed to waive any further claims.
NAL- If the will went through probate and the estate closed, there was an opportunity for your aunt to make a claim in writing to the admin to honor a verbal agreement. It doesn't mean she won't try to sue you, but his will appeared to be very clear. If she needs money, she could ask you for it outright rather than implying that you 'Owe' her.
