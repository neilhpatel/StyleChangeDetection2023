(And also, "Why won't Democrats help us?" ask people who did not give Democrats enough seats to pass legislation.).
Well, it needs to be stated. It’s as if you were solving racism by wishing everyone was white. Also, you’re still focused on “struggling”. The struggle comes from nonacceptance. If everyone just let us be ourselves, there would be no struggle.
I notice that you didn’t wish that we would be accepted for who we are. Almost all of the issues with depression and suicide for trans people come from the lack of tolerance and the persecution we face.
I believe that hormone blockers are used for people who are younger than 19. Starting later than that means that you will have to go through puberty, which takes a lot to undo later in life.
Still they’re used around the time kids are supposed to hit puberty, not 6 year olds like some people believe.
Correct, the only time puberty blockers are used in very young children is for a condition called precocious puberty, where kids are getting facial hair and boobs in elementary school.
It's not about payment, these states are criminalizing any kind of gender-affirming care and trying to get parents/doctors labeled as child abusers and felons. Like, literally have the meds ripped out of your cabinet and your kids ripped out of your hands by CPS, that's where they want to go.
