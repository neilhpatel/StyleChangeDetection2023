I’ll be honest if money is the only language they understand and if we’re playing into capitalism, then the solution has to be money oriented.
Require licensing for every gun and make it a rigorous process that requires reapplication for certification on an annual basis, including medical reports, psychological assessment and mandatory safety training certification at regular intervals. This generates revenue that way, and operates just like driving license.
Those that are negligent will lose their license. Those that are repeat offenders will be uninsurable. Make possession of a firearm without a license or without insurance a criminal offence, making money for private prisons.
Because the gun manufacturer never committed a crime. Just because they manufacture something dangerous doesn’t mean they are liable for how it’s used. It’s like saying ford should be sued every time one of there vehicles is used in a crime.
You can get a car even if you have a criminal record. Making a gun harder to get by having training requirements wouldn't prevent mass shootings, suicides, or gang violence.
While that wouldn't fix our violence issue in America or solve all gun crimes, it would simplify some things and help ensure we knew who was supposed to be carrying which guns and those guns were being carried safely. It would also have some possibility of getting through, because it would have a few pro-2A points (full reciprocity and fixing some stupid ATF rules).
