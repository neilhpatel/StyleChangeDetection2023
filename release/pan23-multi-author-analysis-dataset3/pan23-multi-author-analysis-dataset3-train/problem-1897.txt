One of the cities have two million people in it. Think apartment buildings. Maybe 6-8 families per building. Kids, old and sick... Imagine more like 20 per building.
all you have to do is guess that on average, 20 people died in each collapsed building. to me that seems pretty reasonable. some would have been empty, some would have had hundreds, some would be single story, some five to ten stories. so even if you just estimate 20 people per building, we're talking about 100,000 potentially dead.
I wouldn't be surprised if the death toll surpasses 100,000. That's a huge quake to hit a densely populated area with not the best architectural standards.
A 7.8 earthquake is insanely powerful, and two back to back will fuck up all but the most reinforced structures. For reference, “The Big One” along the Oregon Hills and Cascade Subduction Zone is modeled at 6.8, and it’s estimated that 14% of the buildings could be lost in that scenario. 7.8 is 32x stronger than 6.8.
It depends on the location and the people organizing cleanup, but usually you start with vital infrastructure and creating safe staging areas. Think restoring major roads and clearing the way to hospitals and logistics hubs. Usually debris are gathered and piled in a designated spot outside of major population centers (aka a landfill). With disasters like earthquakes and wildfires, landslides and debris flow are also a big concern because they contaminate and block potable water sources.
Even with as good as we are at that, major earthquakes destroy so much infrastructure and create so much dangerous terrain that it’s still a logistical nightmare.
