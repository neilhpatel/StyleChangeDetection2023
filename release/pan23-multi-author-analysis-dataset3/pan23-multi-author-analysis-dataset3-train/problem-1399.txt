This is the official data released straight from Moscow (i.e Putin), which means it could very well be BS.
For all we know Russia could actually be in a recession and they're hiding it both for pride and so their citizens don't rebel.
Russia hasn't "suddenly" had a recession. Russia had a bad quarter last quarter, and their "sudden" release of economic data from this past quarter makes two straight quarters of declining GDP.
It is worth mentioning that a recession is defined as two successive quarters with falling GDP. So it does take at least 6 months for a recession to actually be declared. And in Q1 Russia still had an overall growth. Add another month or so to collect the data after Q3... and they got about as quick into an "official" recession as they could.
But there's so much more to the economics that it's hard to just point at a simple number like GDP and declare a recession. I feel like this AP News article talks about the nuances of what a recession entails pretty well:
The "typical" definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters with negative GDP. The US hit that mark with Q1 and Q2 in 2022. But Q3 saw GDP up which indicates that it no longer is in a recession.
