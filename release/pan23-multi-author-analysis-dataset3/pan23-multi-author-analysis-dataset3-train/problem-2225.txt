China has police stations in foreign countries to deal with this. If you are of Chinese descent, you are not safe from the Chinese police in most major western cities.
So there's over a hundred Chinese police overseas stations. If we believe the numbers, each station is coercing 6 Chinese people a day. Shouldn't we have something like safe escort services for when Chinese people visit these stations to renew their passport so they don't get blackmailed in person? Require proceedings to be done in English with a real domestic officer present?
The only solution I see for these people is to completely cut ties with your family and make yourself uncontactable so that blackmail on your family can't be used. I know that's not realistic for 99% of people, especially students or those who are on a temporary visa.
Anyone else find it weird that we call these police stations? Obviously in western democratic countries these police have no way to effect a legal arrest or detain someone. Unless they step into an embassy. They have no way to legally compel someone to step into a plane and return to China, they operate using blackmail and other underhanded tactics. Supposedly they convince 220,000 people in a year to return in this way. Supposedly 2 passenger planes of people a day are compelled to return to face crimes in China.
Why are so many Chinese people committing so many crimes against the state? How are the Chinese police so effective? Didn't you hear, it's impossible to escape the Chinese police.
