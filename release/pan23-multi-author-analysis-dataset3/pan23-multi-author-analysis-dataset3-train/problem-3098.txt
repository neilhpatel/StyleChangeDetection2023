I spent 8 days in her district (vacation) and I don't get it either. The entire district seemed to be full of intelligent, hard working, surprisingly liberal minded (aside from guns) people. The only thing I can think of is the district is full of single issue voters.
Yes, but I'm talking specifically about this district. Not that I really care about downvotes, the downvote button isn't supposed to be a disagree button.
What I'm saying is if more young people voted, they would had voted Bobert out. I don't know why I'm getting downvoted. I'd bet dollars to cents if you look at the percentage of eligible voters who voted, by age bracket, you would 100% see a smaller percentage who voted in younger brackets. You don't think so?
Voter turnout also increased as age, educational attainment and income increased. Voter turnout was highest among those ages 65 to 74 at 76.0%, while the percentage was lowest among those ages 18 to 24 at 51.4%.Apr 29, 2021".
I mean just answer honestly, do you think that if they checked the statistics of percent voters by age group, you wouldn't see lower numbers in the younger age bracket. Remember I didn't say young people. I said apathetic, didn't even bother voting.
No you said young, apathetic voters. Are you from CO District 3? I am, and Iâ€™m downvoting you because you are perpetuating a bad trope of blaming kids for adults fuck ups. Their apathy is at the feet of us adults who have done nothing to show them we support their fight.
