When you say is what the terms are. Is that their terms or was that a judgement? Currently court may take some time for a date to be assigned due to how backed up they may be. But generally you will be given a date at some point.
Bankruptcy stops the above from happening. Yes once you file it will hurt some. But for an apartment you may need a bigger down deposit. May not be the end of the world. The downside is, you can't really have a savings until you file. Basically once you get ready to file you want your bank accounts to prove you're broke and have no money. Otherwise the trustee can try and claim it. Still suggest a consult, most lawyers off a free consult.
Don't fail to attend court. Can try explaining your situation and go for a payment plan. Some of the worse cases may be wage/bank garnishment or liens.
Just a suggestion but if you're able, talk to an bankruptcy attorney and see if you can file to have the debt discharged.
I have considered speaking to a bankruptcy lawyer but Im hesitant. It could help but it could also hinder me from getting into a new place.
