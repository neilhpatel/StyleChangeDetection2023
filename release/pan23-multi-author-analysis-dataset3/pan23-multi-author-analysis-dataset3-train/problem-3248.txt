Since enough people on both sides of the aisle voted in favor, this makes it a bipartisan achievement.
Bipartisan: any political act in which both of the two major political parties agree about all or many parts of a political choice.
As such, we need Republicans in congress who are willing to vote against party lines when it matters. We need people like Liz Cheney who are willing to stand hold their peers accountable when needed. We aren’t going to flip everybody D, so we need as many Rs as possible who are willing to do the right thing.
I disagree here. These are Republican congresspeople from Republican areas. If they get removed they’re going to be replaced with more Republican congresspeople. There isn’t any situation where the entirety of congress flips Democrat.
And we shouldn't be seeking bipartisanship. The Republican party continues to reject the concept of compromise. The White House needs to drop this and focus on getting shit done despite the Republicans, while highlighting Republican obstruction at every opportunity.
