You might want to warn your mom about waiting. You can't squeeze blood from a stone, so if your aunt spends all of the money then it may not be possible to get it back.
I’ve tried to tell her that but she’s dead convinced my aunt won’t withhold the money. I’m afraid my mom would rather lose her inheritance than confront her sister legally.
From what my mom has told me (which may be biased) there is no way my aunt has lent my mom enough money to withhold her entire inheritance. My mom has borrowed about a hundred dollars a year, which yes adds up. My mom agreed to let my aunt keep half of her inheritance which is a significant amount of money, yet my aunt decided she should be payed all of it. My aunt keeping the entire thing would mean she’s being paid back more than double what my mom owes her.
Money given to your mom by your aunt has no bearing whatsoever on mom's inheritance from grampa. If your aunt is withholding based on this, as others have said, your mom needs her own attorney to go to court and have the aunt removed as executor.
This is just me spinning my thoughts here, but I believe that if your mom hires an attorney, the course they could take is removing your aunt from her position as executrix. If a second person is not named in the will for the executor/executrix, then someone else will have to petition the judge for the role of administrator. Unfortunately, whomever that person is will have to start the whole process over again. With most things (some things, not all things) they will not be able to pick up where your aunt left off. This is just to my understanding, again I'm not an attorney so take what I say with a bag of salt. I highly recommend you and your mom consult with an estate attorney.
