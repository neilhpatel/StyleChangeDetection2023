That's the point. "Rules for thee, not for we." It is a part of the Nazi / Fascist playbook. 'The enemy is both all powerful, and super weak'.
While at the same time, Dems are too strong to be caught for those apparent crimes, the diversity that they hate is giving Dems more and more voting power (the idea of white replacement begins to take hold in Republican minds), and the LGTBQ+ are apparently a part of a Jewish 'Deep-state Soros-controlled' Cabal that is trying to tear the Fatherland US apart.
It's the whole "It's okay if we do it and get caught, because imagine what Dems are doing, and not getting caught for?".
(\ yes. It is deeply amusing/frustrating that they also have enough cognitive dissonance to like Trump because he disrupted order. But part of that also comes from them thinking "he was reorganising things to be more how we want it". I do miss the days when they'd stop talking there though, rather than having to admit out loud that they wish they could be more of a bigot).
That's why when their team breaks the law, "it's not that bad" (because they didn't disrupt order).
Most people read that and think law is the important part. Often the people you're talking about view 'order' as the important part.
I think it's that down to their fundamental core being they believe that that "Law" and "Order" is for everyone else. Its ok if I do it. I can break these little laws(perspective re:little: trespassingdriving how "I" wanttax fraudvoter fraud, storm the Capitol) it's not a big deal. Basically Entitlement.
