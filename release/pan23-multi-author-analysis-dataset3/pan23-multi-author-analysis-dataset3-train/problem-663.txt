You should also ask for proof of rabies vaccination since the dog bit you and let the person know that you’d like a reply so you don’t have to escalate the matter.
This cannot be stressed enough, if you don't yet have the other parties rabies info you need to start the shot yesterday. Once rabies gets to a certain point there is no surviving it. Call you doctor immediately, tell them you were bit by the dog and the owner is not giving you vaccination status.
If you go to the ER or urgent care they are mandated to report any animal bite to the health department. Then the animal warden. They then quarantine the dog to make sure it doesn't have rabies. It doesn't mean the dog will get in trouble. Some states have a one bite rule that the dog gets in trouble when it bites a second person. I would report it to police so if the dog attacks a Second person such as a child they can use your report as a first attack. You can take her to small claims court for all the bills. You can also have a free consultation with a personal injury lawyer.
