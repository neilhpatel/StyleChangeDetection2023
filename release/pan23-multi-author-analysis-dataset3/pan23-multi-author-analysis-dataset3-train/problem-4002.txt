I wasn't. You said that if the government starts forcing businesses to enforce a dress code, you'd be fully opposed. But the government does force some businesses to enforce a dress code, for health and safety reasons, because you can't just leave that shit up to individuals to decide what's best for them and everyone else.
Really? So when the government tells a hospital that, for example, a surgeon is required by law to wear a surgical gown and mask at all times when they are in the OR with a patient, you fully oppose that?
Are you seriously comparing requiring surgeons to wear surgical equipment to the government deciding that everyone should be required to wear suits or they get fired?
A company requiring their employees to do it vs the government mandating companies to require it are very different things though.
I had colleagues who lived abroad (specifically India) get suspended because they weren't vaccinated. There were no fucking vaccines in their countries for their age group, and even if there were, why the hell were remote workers required to be vaccinated?
youre the one whos comparing getting vaccinated to wearing suits, and now you play dumb as if the other dude is the one doing an unfair comparison, please stop.
