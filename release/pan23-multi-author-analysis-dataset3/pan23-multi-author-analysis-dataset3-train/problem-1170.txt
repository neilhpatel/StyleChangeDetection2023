The Qatar World Cup will go down in university marketing lectures of precisely what not to do. Qatar had a pretty bad, but not the worst, public image. Bought the World Cup from FIFA. Planned to show the world a new, attractive, shiny Qatar. Publicly walked back promises of alcohol sales and paid stipends to travelling football fans and showed that the Government can't be trusted because it breaks contracts, even enormous ones like the World Cup (and there are none bigger), and in the process decimated whatever original image plan they had in mind.
No alcohol is fine but this should've been up front and clear 7 years ago when the contract was signed. The public fallout from this is unrecoverable. It's also going to inflame Islamophobia in the West.
I feel like Muslims in the west are generally united against the discrimination they face. But I'm the ME, they're like, "Fuck it. Sectarian hate it is.".
Right. If they were upfront from the beginning it would have been fine. But even now, the one love wrist bands are not allowed and the captains will get a yellow card if they wear them……..so like.. it just keeps getting worse.
