Sounds like it was crowded in part because early voting was compressed into 5 days rather than the usual 15, and turnout has been fairly high.
Too few polling stations for the population, too small a station for all the people showing up, and too few people working the polling station to help everyone who arrives.
Often it's deliberate sabotage disguised as fairness. "We'll run one polling location per 30 square miles, and in the name of fairness all stations will have the same staff!" Intentionally glossing over that in the rural areas this means a few hundred people coming to vote at the station vs many thousands trying to vote at the same station in an urban area.
Sometimes they don't even try and disguise it. They've pushed in court with too much success that the constitution doesn't name political affiliation as a protected class, so blatant discrimination against democrats isn't illegal. They only have to offer enough opportunity to vote to avoid being accused of not of allowing votes. They can't legally deny you the opportunity to vote but they aren't obligated to make it easy.
