It's fucking disgusting that voting rights is a partisan issue. Honestly if you're trying to stifle voting rights I don't give a fuck what you have to say.
Maybe I am out of the loop but are voting rights anymore "under attack" than they have been for the past 100 fucking years?
I was saying it before, voting rights should have been first and only until it was passed. Spend whatever political willpower you had to protect democracy.
Protecting democracy is the most basic thing any party which values democracy can do. And Democrats are not committed to it as a party. They'd be whipping the hell out of anti-democracy members otherwise. They'd be running primary challengers instead of blacklisting them.
But they don't, because liberals value status quo more than democracy. They seem to be OK with a slide into some form of non-representative government so long as it doesn't affect the business cycle and their own investments too much and doesn't happen too quickly. And Republicans are all too happy to oblige.
It is entirely performative for them. They'd pass it right quick if they really cared and wanted. OP's point is that the Democrats waited until they knew they were powerless before making it a major public issue in the forefront. Because it is to mitigate the damage they know is about to happen with Moore v Harper, where even the most moderate position is that the SCOTUS is likely to rule slightly in favor and hand down a modified interpretation which completely dissolves real democracy in this country.
The Democrats are akin to cops saying that murder is wrong and should be prevented, as they watch a murder happening in real time and refuse to get out of their vehicle and stop the person.
