Serbian NATO candidacy would almost certainly never happen. Serbs despise the alliance due to its intervention in the Yugoslav Wars. Itâ€™s also a problem for NATO candidate Bosnia, whose Serb minority continues to agitate against NATO membership.
If Serbia wants to join the EU, they can act like it, if they want to side with Russia they should be sanctioned, and if the average Serb don't like the result of their country's politic, revolutions are a thing for a reason.
I guess so, but one day Serbia should look at a map, and realize they'd be a lot better off allying themselves with the EU, than with Russia.
Serbian people and Russian people have always been closer than Serbia and Europe. People there consider Ukrainian people Russian. You can't do a lot when they say "they are the same people they speak the same (-ish) language and there was no reason to split them in the first place". "It must have been someone from outside". "It was NATO and the wester countries". You can't really do a lot when that is the standard idea among the people.
And second and foremost Serbia ain't joining EU as long as Kosovo is described as an independent state. So yeah, don't think they give the slightest about EU allowing them in or not until that issue is settled.
I'm Serbian and I'm not on anyone side in this. I don't live there but have family and go from time to time.
I have to say I feel that Europe should first kick out Hungary from EU. Because otherwise you're just saying you don't want Serbia in EU but you accepted and keep Hungary in, which doesn't make a lot of sense.
