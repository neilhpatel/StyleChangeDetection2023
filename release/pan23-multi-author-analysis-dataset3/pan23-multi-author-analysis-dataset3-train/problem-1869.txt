That's a fascinating historical footnote. So the 4th Circuit was all but declaring the poll tax constitutional, but not making an explicit judgement of the question. Was there a later case that explicitly declared them in violation of the 14th? Were there earlier cases that explicitly declared them not in violation? Or did the courts just punt for a century?
The court found against him on both counts. They said it was a political question, in that the effect of the lawsuit was primarily to abolish the poll tax, or else to effect a change in the state’s electoral process, which was within the state’s sovereign rights to dictate.
Since Congress has created no means to enforce the law, and the one court to consider the matter has decided it's a political question, no one (other than Congress itself) has ever had the ability to enforce it.
That's actually a really interesting case judgement by the court and rather responsible of them if they were not to find in favour of the argument, since it sets no precedent other than "that's the job of Congress".
