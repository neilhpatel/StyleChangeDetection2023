It’s odd how little economics (specifically the Great Depression) gets mentioned among the major causes of WW2.
The article confirms what I remember reading in Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reich. Germany was actually seeing a slow, but steady recovery. The Depression crippled their economic growth which was very reliant on American loans and investment, as well as exports. The US in particular was there biggest industrial exporter, which evaporated as the US put numerous tariffs in place.
The rise of Japanese fascism in the 20’s can be directly linked to economic turmoil that created a nationalist fervor among the peasant class which made up the core of the military and many of its officers.
U.S.A. is way more fascist in its social fabric ( pledge of allegiance in classroom, overblown military-industrial complex, relentless mobilization against the external enemy of the day e.g. the communists, the Muslims, the Chinese etc. ) than present-day Italy.
So you’re Italian. Then you know that she’s a fucking fascist in the direct spirit of Mussolini and that they have been growing in influence and power in Italian politics recently.
This woman is the granddaughter of a fascist dictator. What other analogy are we going to compare it too. I’m not even sure if we are on the same page. Right wing populism is real.
Edit: Here, read this if this is just a downvote out of frustration. Hitler and the Nazi’s had a massive populace wave in 1932.
Hitler was voted in out of desperation from the German public. The only person who defined themselves as fascist in Europe was Mussolini, who believed in being in “leagues” with people, which is really and old Italian thing, like the Roman’s.
