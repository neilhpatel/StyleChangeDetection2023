For the record, I disagree, a little, with his conclusion. He was arguing about them confining us to a shtetl or ghetto; I say that modern "golems" need not be tied to a location. (An example of a "modern golem": a bot that posts refutations in response to blood libel.).
2. Actually you are the one making the claim so you have to provide evidence of Israel effectively buying votes. But all of Israel’s and aipacs budgets are public so it shouldn’t be too hard.
But what you are doing isn’t legitimate criticism which is ok you ar electing an unfounded accusation.
Israel doesn’t give money to aipac at all its sonars are Jewish Americans. In fact if you did any reaserch on it you would see aipac is non partisan and reaches out to both sides of the aisle. On top of that Aipqc isn’t some nefarious organization where we tell senators how we want them to vote, it’s more an advocacy group which explains our thoughts on the matter to different congressmen. Plenty of more nefarious groups do the same thing.
