Classic bubble economy fueled by extreme low interest rates, low inflation, overleveraged market and general "hype". A lot of people put money into highly speculative financial product better known as "crypto" which make easy for con artists to operate on it with insufficient control over it.
The only way for any cryptocurrency to gain value is for enough people to buy it, which means that the only way to make money on crypto is to sell it off to some poor idiot for more than what you bought it for.
But if you steal even one dollar from the wrong kind of people who use crypto to conceal their identities so you have no idea who the money is coming from, who it is going to, or even who really owns it.. well you are the problem and you won't be a problem for long.
Crooked bank could be this crooked because they deal with unregulated crypto market instead money. FTX and other who failed at best and was a outright scam at worst connect one thing, because they were in crypto market they skip a lot of regulations from "classic" financial market.
FTX is not crypto, it is a centralize bank and investment company that invested in crypto and stole customers money. Crypto didn't fail here, a crooked bank did. Stop being gullible.
