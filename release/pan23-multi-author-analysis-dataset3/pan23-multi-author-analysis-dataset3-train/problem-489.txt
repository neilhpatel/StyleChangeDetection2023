Remember Trump used to claim to be a democrat. He "ran" for president before and got no traction except as a joke.
A career long liar and grifter found a group of people dumb enough to manipulate in republican voters.
Ironically these same folks about politicians being liars. Show me another politician, of either party, so blatant as this moron. His mother died on 9-11, but not really, that was just fraudulent remarks to gain votes. He is Jewish but not really. It’s more “Jew-ish” despite not even being Jewish religiously let alone nationally. The dude is the walking definition of fraud, that lied to thousands of voters to personally gain, but it’s cool because he has an R by his name.
Lying, fear mongering, and manipulation are hallmarks of the Republican Party. It’s not even just Trump, it’s the entire party. And Republican voters are cool with it.
Thats just every republican though. Ron Desantis pretends to be tough on immigrants but he knows the oranges wouldn't be picked and the cows wouldn't be milked and the sugar wouldn't be harvested without them. Its just a front for all the old white fuckheads who hate people who are darker than them that vote R.
