The grandparent of Arabic script is the Aramaic alphabet (strictly speaking, it's an abjad rather than an alphabet, since it only has consonants). Surviving early examples of Aramaic are "blocky":
Abjads can cause problems, since two words with different pronunciations can be written identically. For readers who are familiar with the language, this is no more a problem than homophones (although it will occur more often), and context will usually resolve the ambiguity. For readers who don't know the word, it is a big problem if the pronunciation is important. Thus, some abjads have developed optional vowel markers, and alphabets with symbols for vowels were developed.
An abjad (/ˈæbdʒæd/) is a type of writing system in which (in contrast to true alphabets) each symbol or glyph stands for a consonant, in effect leaving it to readers to infer or otherwise supply an appropriate vowel.
Many alphabets (and abjads) have two forms like this: a blocky form, often preferred for carved inscriptions, and a cursive (joined and often curly/curved) form often preferred for writing with a pen or brush. We see blocky and cursive forms of Greek:
Greek and Latin are still close to Phoenician letter shapes. Aramaic/Hebrew are quite divergent already, for me only hebrew D, G and L are somewhat recognizable as coming from Phoenician.
