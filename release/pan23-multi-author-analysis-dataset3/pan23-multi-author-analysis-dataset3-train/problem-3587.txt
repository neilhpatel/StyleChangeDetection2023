It’s decently common that people file outrageous lawsuits near the end of statutory limits for accidents. Your insurance will defend you and might even pay out some go away money even if it’s ridiculous. But worst case they’ll negotiate and usually they’ll settle for policy limits at most if there’s anything credible.
If you feel you’re sued beyond that and your insurance refuses to help you can get your own lawyer to look out for your interests.
It means they can refuse to settle with the other side, and let the other side file a lawsuit. At which point they assign a lawyer who will work with you to defend the case. They will probably try to get it dismissed at an early stage, and if not, as discovery proceeds and the evidence of the plaintiff's actual damages comes to light, the other side will probably settle at that point. Almost all civil lawsuits settle.
BTW, make sure your limits are high enough for a serious accident, not a fender bender. If they aren't, increase them.
A bare minimum of liability coverage should be $100k per person/$300k per accident. As you can afford it, increase it to $500k or $1 million and get an umbrella policy for another million. It isn't that expensive unless you have a terrible driving record.
Because some injuries, like soft tissue injuries, or other injuries to the neck and back, can take time to manifest, and can worsen over time. It's not atypical.
