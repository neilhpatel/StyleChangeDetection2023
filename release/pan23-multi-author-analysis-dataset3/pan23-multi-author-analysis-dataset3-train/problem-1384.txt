Lol, China has the most interest in the West exhausting their strategic ammo and weapons reserves when they are planning on invading Taiwan. China would be stupid not to supply Russia.
Which is why Russia is getting its ass handed to them. Russia's fighting and losing a 1980s war against an opponent armed with hand-me-down 2010s technology.
Russia is was importing a guidance chip made in Taiwan and assembled on a board in China. Now they're buying whole drones from Iran because they can't buy those parts anymore.
In case you haven't noticed, Russia does not have any modern microchip fabs. None at all. They literally do not possess the capability to build these chips for themselves. They have to import them, and the sanctions have stopped that pipeline cold. (And it's not like they can just swap it in with a Commercial Off The Shelf replacement either - commercial GPS units have limiters built in specifically to stop them from being used as precision weapons.).
2. Tighter control on supply routes. Something along the lines of the global database for tracking where each product ends up going. Complex goods already have serial IDs might as well extend it to other products.
The obvious problem is might end up sanctioning half of the world, which could be problematic due to global supply chain.
