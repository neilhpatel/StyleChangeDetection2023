Making Imamoglu the candidate with a backup in case he’s banned during the election process is a favored move. It would reinvigorate the electorate if he’s banned and the backup would het more votes as he’s with the victim.
Erdogan dared the opposition by banning Imamoglu. Opposition needs to call his bluff, but looks like it won’t happen and we’ll lose.
Actually there is no way he could win even tho opposition does every dumb thing to make it harder for us. And none of the opponents who have a chance to win against him is in jail right now.
Since 80s they placed their their member's into every important parts of the state starts from the military schools. But they were also doing that by stealing the questions for the exams(every student takes the same exams every year for the high schools and universities in Turkey), that's proven.
Fun fact for foreigners: most of the opposition parties are rooting for the candidate which has least votes against Erdoğan even tho public is rooting for both Ankara and İstanbul mayor's.
Well the mayor of Istanbul for starters, because he won an election against Erdogans party. Also Turkey introduced a similar "fake news law" like Russia, where you can basically go to jail if you dont believe the government lies. There are like 100 journalists in jail still.
