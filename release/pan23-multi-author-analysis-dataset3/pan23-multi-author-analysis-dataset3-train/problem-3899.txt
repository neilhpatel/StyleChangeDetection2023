Well, based on this most recent answer it sounds like your LL/property owner is selling FSBO and that's why no one has an agent. That's also why there is chaos. Have you looked at the Zillow listing? Is it selling as a tenant occupied property? Contact the owner. Ask for cash to vacate the property commonly called "cash for keys". This solves two problems.
Is there a clause in the lease about cooperating during showings during a period of time generally 30 to 60 days before the end of the lease?
Don't let them in if they aren't with an agent. Just say no and close the door This advice would be different if your place isn't listed and the LL is selling on his own. Is there a sign? Or is it being advertised in the MLS/online? Or both?
Don't let anyone in without an agent. The agent is suppose to set the appointment with the sellers agent and actually show up with the buyers to show the property. It is normal for 24 hour notice on a tenant occupied property.
The landlord needs to give 24 hours notice before they enter, unless the lease says otherwise. Utah has no statutory notice requirement for agent/buyer showings, so the lease will control there.
