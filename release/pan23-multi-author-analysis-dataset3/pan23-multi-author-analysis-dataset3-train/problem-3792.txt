100% require all "law enforcement officers" to be qualified, certified, and licensed through their respective state. License and certifications must be renewed at least every 2 years. This includes a background check with full financial disclosures, review of all complaints against the officer, testing on knowledge of the law and civil rights, providing first aid, defensive driving, firearms qualification, and physical fitness test. Not passing certain tests (fitness, firearms, driving) doesn't disqualify you from being police but it would disqualify you from being on patrol.
Once they all realize that their badge doesn't shield them from consequences we'll see a drastic change in how police act in this country.
Look I'm not defending the police our whole justice system is broken and it's not just the police that need to change. I would also guess that this wasn't the first time that unit has used excessive force or had complaints filed against them. Those types of units operate more like a counter insurgency than a police force.
It seems really hard to make good changes with real lasting progress when emotions are so high. Everyone has a knee jerk reaction to it which also causes the police everywhere to become super defensive and close rank, which always leads to more anger.
Yeah, which was the cops not immediately getting defensive and closing ranks. Mostly, anyway. Which is exactly what I said the problem was, and has nothing to do with the people's enflamed emotions from a heinous crime.
