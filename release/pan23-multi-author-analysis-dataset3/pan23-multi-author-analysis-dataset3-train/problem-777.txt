Barr straight up lied that trumps status as president had nothing to do with the decision not to refer for prosecution, the Mueller report explicitly states that it did in fact did.
And the fucks made it all go away by making Mueller testify and asking him whether or not Trump was guilty and he said repeatedly that it wasnâ€™t his determination to make but that the evidence was right there in the report.
Mueller really comes off as a bit of a tragicomic figure in this whole drama: tasked with an investigation which was, whether due to his own idiotic notions of propriety or fuckery from his bosses, forbidden from determining anything other than innocence. So he lays out a whole bunch of facts that clearly show enough for any reasonable person to conclude that Trump & co. did lots of bad shit, and simply refrains from determining innocence. And America just goes "whew, innocent after all!".
More accurately, "this does not exonerate the President, and it also doesn't accuse the President of crimes, purely on the basis that I have decided it would be unfair to do so given the limits of my mandate.".
Yep. He's a GOP problem fixer from way back. He released a "totally exonerates the president" note before he even read Mueller's report. Then he sat on it for weeks while he redacted any information that made Trump look guilty.
