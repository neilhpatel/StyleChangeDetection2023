Problem is, them "staying out of the conflict" still means they will let russian troops attack from their territory, just as they are doing in Ukraine now, while lying that they don't participate. But the thing is, if they don't do that, then Russia will just annex them and do it anyway. Belarus is only an independent country on paper, as long as Lukashenko, who is only propped up by russian interference, is in charge. If an invasion of the Baltics were to happen, you can be damn sure Belarus would participate at the very least as a russian staging ground. Question is what would NATO do then. They could absolutely wipe every military asset in Belarus out in a counter-invasion, but would they call their bluff of "staying out" as russian troops are pouring out of Belarus into NATO territory?
I think the difference is using Belarus as a staging post for an invasion of Ukraine (largely under funded and unprepared military) is very different from using it as a staging post for attacking NATO allies.
Russian tactics seem surprisingly inept versus limited western arms being deployed in a limited scope. To think that Russia and Belarus will simply overrun the Baltics based upon their performances thus far in Ukraine is to give them too much credit.
I take your point but the deterrent of NATO is that it would not be a simple Baltics v Russia and Belarus fight.
Ukraine is doing what NATO doesnâ€™t have the balls to do, the least we can do is supply them with offensive weapons so they can take the fight to Russia.
We are here in 2023 facing a war in Ukraine directly because of a weak response to Russia in Crimea in 2014.
