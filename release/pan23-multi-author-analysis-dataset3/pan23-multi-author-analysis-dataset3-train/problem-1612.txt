Same happens in NZ, but they pay triple iirc. It was a big issue when the lockdown happened, because the unis are used to hefty boosts from rich Asian kids.
It's always made sense to me and I was surprised growing up to realize everyone else in the world doesn't do something like that. Students are a future investment for the economy. The government invests in training up the next generation of experts, then incentivises them to stay in the country with no interest. The now qualified professionals contribute to the economy, the people are happier, and the government sees a net gain on their investment through economic growth.
This is great, it encourages a smarter workforce, which benefits everyone, plus people should be able to attempt new careers without bankrupting themselves.
Even if you need to charge interest for student loans, it should be something minimal like 1 percent. You'll have fewer defaults as folks will be more inclined to make payments when there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
Helped keep the burden of loan repayments from being too much until i could financially afford to pay it off.
This is what I've being saying should have been done in the u.s. get rid of the interest, reset the loan to be the borrowed amount minus what's been paid, set up a 20 year plan for everyone to pay it off, if they can.
Also if you move out of the country (like I did), while you earn interest on your loan, you're only obligated to pay 1k a year and can take a 6 or 12 month repayment holiday when you move.
