If a person was ostracized would they just need to leave the city of Athens proper? Could they live elsewhere in Attica or would they need to leave anywhere controlled by Athens?
The Achaemenid Empire also sometimes gave refuge to exiled Athenian politicians. Perhaps most notoriously, the Athenian general Themistokles, who is considered largely responsible for the victory of the allied Greek city-states against the Achaemenid naval forces in the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE, was ostracized in around 472 or 471 BCE. After being ostracized, he eventually ended up going to the Achaemenid Empire, where he became the governor of Magnesia on behalf of the Achaemenid ruler Artaxerxes I!
Additionally, many of the men who were ostracized from Athens were allowed to return to Athens before the period of ten years was over. Xanthippos, Aristeides, and Kimon are all examples of men who were ostracized who were allowed to return to Athens before the full ten years had elapsed. The total number of men who were actually ostracized from Athens for a full ten years is probably less than ten.
If the archons counted any fewer than six thousand ostraka, the ostracism was considered void and no one would be ostracized. If over six thousand total ostraka were cast, then only the person who received the highest number of votes would be banished and they would only be banished for a period of ten years, after which they would be allowed to return.
