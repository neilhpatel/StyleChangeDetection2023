Usually, HOA dues are paid separately from your mortgage. It’s not like taxes or insurance that is due once a year. The administrative burden of tracking HOA dues for each mortgage would be a nightmare. You probably saw when you were applying for your mortgage that they include the HOA in your estimated monthly payment, but that’s just so you know how much you will need. If you haven’t been paying it separately, you may very well owe this.
You cannot owe money out of nowhere without a full itemization of the items… but it could be owed depending on what it is.
Lastly, in another comment, OP mentioned that the mortgage paid the HOA and some mentioned this is highly unlikely.
If money was stolen by prior management or board, this would have to be investigated and I would expect the HOA carry Crime Insurance/Fidelity Bond to reimburse the association if that is the case.
So to answer this directly, it could be possible if there is a CDD (Community Development District) where assessments are made through taxes and the mortgage would escrow your taxes which includes the CDD dues so the $40/mo dues are very reasonable at this point, assuming this is the case. If not, then there is likely a large amount of mismanagement of funds and the new management is trying to fix the association and get you guys back on track.
