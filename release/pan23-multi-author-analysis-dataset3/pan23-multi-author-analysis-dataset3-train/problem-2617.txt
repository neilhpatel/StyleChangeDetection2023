Egypt is called Misr (Arabic influence) by Egyptian now. What did Egyptians call their region (modern day Egypt) prior to Muslim conquest?
When writing to foreign powers, the ancient Egyptians referred to their land using the Semitic toponym Miá¹£ri, which is still used today as the name of Egypt in Arabic.
Mycenaean diplomacy is more of a mystery. Archaeologists have found letters to/from the Mycenaeans at the Hittite capital, and all of those letters are written in Hittite, but they may have been translated copies of letters originally written in another language. The main languages used in the Hittite empire (Hittite and Luwian) are distantly related to Mycenaean Greek since they're Indo-European languages, so it'd probably be a bit easier for Mycenaean scribes to learn Hittite or Luwian than a Semitic language like Akkadian, especially since the Mycenaeans occasionally raided the Anatolian coast and took captives. We do know that the kingdom of Arzawa in western Anatolia had few or no scribes who could write or understand Akkadian, which suggests that the Mycenaeans were not familiar with it either.
Yep, Akkadian was the lingua franca of the Bronze Age, and most of the letters exchanged between the Hittites, Assyrians, and Egyptians were written in Akkadian. Diplomatic letters were sometimes written in other languages like Hittite and Hurrian, but those are relatively rare exceptions.
