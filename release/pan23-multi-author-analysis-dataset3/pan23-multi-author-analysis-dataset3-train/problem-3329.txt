So, in theory, if I was REALLY adamant about not paying the fee I would refuse the deal and let it go to court to, hopefully, be acquitted ? So basically Iâ€™m buying a guaranteed not guilty verdict.
If acquittal were a certainty, then a prosecutor would be obligated not to proceed. Despite misconduct by many prosecutors that makes the news, they have a legal and ethical obligation NOT to file charges unsupported by evidence, and not to pursue charges if conclusive exculpatory evidence is discovered.
Other sorts of resolutions like probation or fines-only sentences often accumulate multiple fees like victim funds, DNA or fingerprint collections, service and warrant fees, etc.
For most people, the time they will invest in appearing for trial and the cost of legal representation and the risk of conviction are all reasons not to expose themselves to trial. A small court fee should be near the bottom of the list of considerations, slightly below the excellent bean and sausage soup in the cafeteria on Thursdays.
