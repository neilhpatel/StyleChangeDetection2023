Why does she have different letters? Are they from different providers? Why didn't her doctor just write her one?
Registered how? There is no actual registry for ESA's. Did she get a letter from a medical professional that is actively treating her for a disability, and does the letter state that she specifically needs two ESA's?
So she does have a letter (or letters) from a doctor currently treating her for her disability? Does the letter address why she needs two?
ESAs are also distinctly not service animals (psychiatric service animals exist, they are different from ESAs), and you/she may want to be careful of that in the future.
Edit: As another poster mentioned, there are potentially ways for non ESAs (such as, actual service dogs) to be justified for more than one, but ESAs are just "emotional support", thus only one per disabled person is "reasonable".
This is common, only one ESA per disabled person is "reasonable". After all, it's job is, as the name implies, emotional support, and one can do that. Too many people mistakenly think that having an ESA letter is a free pass to violate pet rules, it's not. She'll have to pick one to get rid of.
