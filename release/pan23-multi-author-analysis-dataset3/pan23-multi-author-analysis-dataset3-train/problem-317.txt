Women have fought in Indian History as well, most famous one would be The Queen of Jhansi who fought bravely against the British Invaders and was slain.
There are so many more references to women fighting, leading battles worldwide across eons. Always love learning new (to me) ones. Thanks for sharing!
Right? Not like women in combat is some weird modern invention. “Woman King” just reminded the world the all female Agojie were not only capable, but fearsome and highly effective warriors. Israel mandates a minimum of 24 months of service from female citizens. My tiny Jewish friend from Israel served and knows Krav Maga and how to use an uzi. There’s historical evidence of female Vikings. There’s the legend of the Amazon’s. There are plenty of examples where women can be trained to be a capable military force and commanders with the side benefit that they don’t sexually assault the population they’re deployed to.
So yeah, I’m impressed India permits women to serve in the military, has an all female contingent, and has deployed them to an active combat zone. I don’t view that as a bad idea.
Not sure where you’re deriving the soldier = saints equation from here. Also, we’ll aware that females can be sexual predators. I have friends who are sexual assault survivors of women predators. Speaking in probabilities, it’s far less common than from men.
