Did your initial offer of employment that you signed include a report date? Did you report to the place of employment on that date, or the date initially agreed upon verbally? Have you tried going into the office or physical location at all? Something seems amiss here.
Something is off here. You should never be asked to resign a federal job to take another federal job. It should be done as a transfer with the gaining office negotiating your transfer date with the releasing office.
We looked into Transfer, but from what I was told, you could only Transfer after being employed at said office for 1 year. Any less than that, and you have to be rehired.
What I was told by this Supervisor when we met, was that because I would be leaving my current (now previous) office and being hired to the new office immediately after, I would not be required to go through Orientation again, OR the Carrier Academy. I was told that I would have to go through Drivers Training again and then would essentially start carrying right after.
No it didn't. Which is why this is all a bit confusing to me. When I was initially hired at the Ohio office, I wasn't given a start date on paper, or when I met with the PostMaster. I was given a date and location for my Orientation through Email a bit later.
In my case i'm unsure, but yes we are unionized. I've not known who to even reach out to. But maybe my aunt can speak to someone for me when she goes back tomorrow.
