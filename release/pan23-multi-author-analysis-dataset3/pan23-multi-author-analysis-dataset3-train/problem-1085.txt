The big issue is the number of S-300 missiles (well over 50K) of those. Normally Air to Air but can be used for Air to Ground attack.
There are other weapons they can perform an attack with. Russians lost many tanks, which weakened their abillity to penetrate Ukrainian defence lines. Kalibr and Iskander are guided precisions weapons which can be used to destroy important targets like munitions depots, hardpoints, artillery, air defence deeper behind Ukrainian lines. Once those get depleted Russians can do only artillery shelling and motorized infantry pushes which is inaccurate or airstrikes with jets and helicopters whichwill be intercepted with air defence. After russians deplete their guided missiles, Ukrainians can then move closer to the front their artillery, mrls, air defences, munitions depots without worrying about them to be destroyed.
There is a constant flow of new anti-air units and radars into Ukraine, so Russia have fewer and fewer missiles and lower success rates every time they fire a wave.
