To be fair man, the main thing skewing the balance isnâ€™t the people per house seat it is the electoral votes per person ratio caused by Senate.
Yes not all house seats are equal, but when we talk about the outsized power of small states it is with the EC and Senate especially.
The NH House of Representatives is also the single largest lower body of congress in the entire US in terms of member count. Representatives are paid $100/year by law, and serve for 2 years. The real perk is a special license plate if desired, and maybe reimbursement for tolls on legislative business.
EDIT: The districts are not necesarily along town lines, but are usually smaller towns rolled into geographically proximate slightly larger towns to increase the residents/representative ratio.
NH resident here. The state house is made up of several representatives from a series of districts, and each district can have anywhere between 1 and 11 representatives. There are 400 seats and 204 districts. I'm pretty sure that the districts subdivide within the town lines, meaning each town basically gets at least one representative, and larger cities get several districts with at least one representative. The multimember districts often result in mixed-party representation.
Yes, the individual districts in a city could be geremandered in theory, but they would be geremandered at such a fine level and only in the cities that there is no real perceptible effect.
