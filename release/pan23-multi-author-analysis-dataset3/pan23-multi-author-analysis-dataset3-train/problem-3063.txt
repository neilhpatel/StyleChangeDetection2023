This is a good answer which states the standard view very well. But here is my problem with the standard view:
I always hear people making the very plausible case that British have exaggerated the level of Spanish brutality and whitewashed their own. Sure! But this is an important caveat, not an actual answer. The question still stands: is the Black Legend actually a pure legend? Or is it an exaggerated propaganda version of some underlying truth? Or is the opposite true, and Spanish colonialism was actually the least brutal?
I'm much more familiar with the English and Spanish manifestation of colonialism in the New World. I'll leave the intricacies of French, Dutch, and Swedish colonial practices to my colleagues who can hopefully fill in the gaps left by my ever so brief answer.
See Alan Gallay The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South, 1670-1717 for more information.
One more book you might find useful is Rereading the Black Legend: The Discourses of Religious and Racial Difference in the Renaissance Empires. Itâ€™s a collection of essays that attempts to put Spanish colonialism in an historical context.
If the Spanish were as brutal as English-centric history books said, we would be just as white as Latin America is now. But we aren't. That's because the vast majority of the Native American deaths attributed to Spanish "brutality" were really just victims of the pandemics of European diseases. Even today, Latin America has far more surviving indigenous people than the United States or Canada.
