So we live in the woods and are pretty close to two property lines. The trees on one side are owned by a neighbor that we get along with well. Whenever one of us hires an arborist, they check the edges of the property line without worrying about borders and if something needs/wants to be cut, we go cut it up together without worrying about which side of the line it is on. The other side is owned by someone who doesn't live there. We called them and they came out when the arborist was there, and then when a tree was being removed. (On our land, but felling it on their land.) It was still nice, but much more formal.
TL;DR - Doesn't matter if they are already fallen or diseased. He does NOT have the right to cut them anyway if they are your trees. (Depending on where you live, there may be some rules that apply if they are a danger to his property - although still not him just randomly chopping - but this sounds like it is definitely not what is going on here.).
Okay. Thank you. Someone said something about putting up a temporary orange snow fence. Was that you? It does not appear on this feed. It was just in a notification banner on my phone.
I thought you were kidding. I just looked it up and it is a real law. It went into effect in early 2020!
LOL, Mr. ‚ÄúBob‚ÄùLawyer feels untouchable. I am pretty sure he will take them down. Ordering hunting cameras too. But signs will go up this weekend. We planted 8 globe arborvitae inside our property line years ago. ü•µThey were gone within a week. They were in the way of him mowing our grass along our street. When confronted, he said the deer must have eaten them. ü§¨.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or you‚Äôve edited your post to comply with the rules, .
