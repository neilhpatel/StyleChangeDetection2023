Well the people scared of hazmat suits can deal with it. Why should someone sacrifice their personal safety when it’s not causing anyone else any physical harm? There’s a pandemic, and some people don’t want to get infected, and some people who are immune compromised can’t take that chance, so if some people have a problem with that, too bad, they can mind their business.
Covid is spread through the air, and hazmat suits create a more effective air barrier compared to masks, especially when you’re in a contained environment for a long time like on a flight. You think hazmat suits are purely to prevent skin contact? You’re wrong. A friend of mine just caught Covid last weekend on a 2 hour flight to NYC. She was wearing a mask, but was on a plane full of people not wearing masks, and the guy next to her was coughing his guts out while not wearing a mask. Masks are helpful, but they’re not perfect, especially when no one else around is wearing one. Had she been in a hazmat suit, her chances of catching Covid would have been significantly reduced.
Anyway, Covid severely reduced the amount of time I bit my nails when not in my home. Wearing a mask was a wonderful preventative.
Masking most likely helps (not that much if you’re the only one doing it). But I think your thinking here is a bit reductionist.
Think you need to weigh the impact of that versus other things that may have changed since pre-pandemic.
1. Are you more cognizant over washing your hands after riding the train and not touching your face than you were pre-pandemic?
