I'm sorry to hear that man, that sounds just terrible. I would work your way up the chain of command at your police department until you find someone who will take this seriously. Also, get a restraining order like last week. Go to your DA's office or courthouse, and ask the clerk where to start. You'll fill out some papers, and a judge will review sometime soon.
After that it may be time to start thinking suing him for the damage, but speak with a civil law attorney, and your divorce attorney, about how to proceed there.
If you believe the judge made a substantive error, and it does happen, your best bet is to get assistance from domestic violence agency and, given that you are divorcing, get guidance from a good divorce attorney.
B. That you lived separately by 100 feet but that was not close enough for a protective order to be granted. (Thatâ€™s not correct).
This is what someone else said, and probably very accurate. I am immune to it by now, and waking up to slashed tires, etc, has become second nature, especially months/years in.
