The thing that scares me is that I believe there are enough low information swing voters out there who don’t understand how fascist and authoritarian Ron DeSantis is (more than Trump even), but who would likely vote for him over Biden based on age alone.
While it is entirely possible that a younger more exciting candidate may have a better chance to win than incumbent Biden, there are far from any guarantees that that will be the case, and I’d actually wager that it’s less likely than not.
Soon will come the rerun against Trump, likely without significant primary challenges to Biden, but again with the same strong likelihood that Biden is the only Democratic figure of any prominence that can beat him — yet away we'll go again with folks lamenting that we're stuck with this incredibly effective and dignified president with a strong likelihood of winning instead of... someone who can't win and probably wouldn't get anywhere near as much done even if they did, I guess?
Especially since Biden has shown that he's sharp enough to dupe these Republicans live on national television so I'm not too worried about his cognitive abilities at the moment.
Not saying age isn't related, but pretty sure Biden isn't a fantastic speaker because of his stutter. That seems to cause most of his difficulty speaking. When he spoke publicly decades ago he sounded almost the same as he does now.
