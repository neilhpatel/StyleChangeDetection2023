Did your written contract include daily contact? Did your contract include anything that gives your a right to cancel it? Most of them are written to be permanent.
OK. Then you are likely out of gas here. You let someone else adopt your dog that you were unable to care for. They have zero legal obligation to keep in touch with you.
Don’t bother hiring an attorney. You gave up the dog. You have no legal rights in this situation. It’s only been 2 days, you really need to have patience here and leave the new owner alone.
You said it’s been 2 days and the new owners are ignoring your texts (multiple). Take a step back and stop texting them or you may find yourself getting in trouble for harassment.
I understand your heartbreak. I would be devastated if I had to rehome one of my dogs. However, the dog is no longer yours. You surrendered her and are not entitled to pictures and videos. Barring any language in the surrender agreement that states otherwise, they haven’t done anything wrong by ignoring you and you would have no case against them.
