What does anything they say matter? Finland and Sweden made an agreement with the Turkish government. They were doing what Turkey wanted them to do, and I'm sure that deal didn't have any clause saying "if some nutbag burns a koran, all bets are off!".
Pffffft. They went in and fought against the Kurds. They weren't fighting against Russia or Syria, they were fighting for them. And Libya is still a mess.
We have long range missile systems that are accurate enough that NATO can close that down with or without Turkish assistance.
Turkey has had a big army and the domestic resources to support it for a while. The thinking since the Cold War, between not just Nato but also Russia, has been that Turkey could probably hold their own coming up thru the Caucasus while everyone else works east across the North European Plain.
On the flip side it's also not in Turkey's interest to really jeopardize the cohesion and stability of NATO too much. It's membership in the alliance may be troubled at times, but it still allows Erodgan outsized influence on the global stage. Even if Turkey seeks to deepen it's bilateral relationships to NATO competitors like Russia later on (like after the war), being in the alliance gives it more leverage. You'll know that everything worked out if some resolution is reached where neither Sweden nor Turkey are all that happy lol.
"Lol what is this corn talking about, pretending like he has power or respect in NATO. They're laughing at him and just letting him kick and scream like a petulant toddler. Just like a little child, he will soon be put back in his place once his Western daddies have had enough.".
