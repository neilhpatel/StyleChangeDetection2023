100%. Disgusting fascist Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro said that these attacks will continue unless the LGBTQ community stops grooming children. They want gay people dead. And they want to be able to pretend that they don't. They do. Fuck them.
They need to fuck right off with this groomer shit. I know far more conservative households that groom their kids to be ignorant, religiously zealotic assholes than I do homosexuals who groom (zero of those to be exact).
Let’s be clear: there are actual organizations calling for the deaths of LGBT, and it’s not a bunch of conservatives in the west.
This rhetoric from the dumbasses being spread here is one of the reasons the debate has gotten to this point. You say something absurd like “if you don’t like LGBT then you clearly support the mass shooters” removes any credibility you had.
They don’t advocate for hour genocide. They disagree with you way of life and are bigoted buffoons, but after years of dealing with conservatives and religious fanatics that VAST majority don’t want the destruction of LGBT.
I ain't advocating for anything specific here to be clear but this shit has been so one sided with the attacks on the LGBTQ community, it'd be better if the scales were a bit more balanced.
Edit: to be clear they are targeting all of the LGBTQ community, particularly the trans community right now, but they will work against anyone who isn't like them.
