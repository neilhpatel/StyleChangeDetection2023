This year, once again, it was above 0 degrees and we have no snow. Now it's -5, but the rain already passed.
When the snow season starts it's usually around -1 so it snows, snow settles and stays. The sun can't warm up the region anymore.
When I was a kid we had snow every year at the beginning of December. It's February and there is no snow.
There's been very light snow in NYC this year. And only a couple times at that. We used to get feets of snow to where I'd wake up in the morning to watch the news to see if schools were closed.
It's the middle of February. This summer and all summers to come are going to be unbearable. We are past the point of "when" and into the "now". Global warming and the effects its going to have on the planet are being seen every year with increasing intensity and its only going to get worse.
And as pessimistic as it sounds to say, it's already too late to change. We can only hope to mitigate the impact but I somehow doubt we'll come to our senses as a collective and make that happen.
