Is your mother not paying for her phone? Her legal guardian should be able to access call records from the telephone company.
The police will likely have gotten a search warrant for your sister's phone records and mobile telemetry. This will aid in them finding her. She is also going to be in NCIC, which is a national system that will alert any officers who might happen to run her information. If she has any police contact, she will be snatched up and brought back.
Now, the police took the report and spoke with the boyfriend. If he says he hasn't spoken to her and she isn't there, there isn't much they can do. He has no legal obligation to speak to the police, and they don't have any evidence that she is with him. They cannot subpoena his records, search his residence, or anything like that simply because he was heard talking to her earlier in the night.
It would be unusual for an agency to not assign a detective for 20 days on a runaway, but every agency is different. If that is there policy, I would advise escalating your concerns up the chain of command to see if you can grease the wheel a bit. The FBI is correct in that they don't assist in investigations unless requested by the agency. They do not get involved in runaways unless there are significant extenuating circumstances. This sounds like your typical run-of-the-mill runaway.
This is a runaway situation, no matter how you look at it. Your post says that she packed her bags and left. This is what running away is. She wasn't grabbed out of bed in the middle of the night at gunpoint by this guy. She left of her own free will.
