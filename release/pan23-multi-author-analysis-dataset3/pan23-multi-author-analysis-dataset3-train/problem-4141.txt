When people thought that Russia inadvertently attacked Poland they were outraged. When they found out it was a stray Ukrainian counter-battery missile that was used to try and defend from a Russian attack, they aren’t.
If a country on a crusade hits a Nato member that is a big difference to an anti-air missile being miscalculated when defending from an onslaught of attacks. It's a terrible situation but had Russia not been attacking this wouldn't have happened.
And none of this would’ve happened if the Russians weren’t attacking. Criminals are held liable for injuries and deaths that occur during the commission of a felony, even if they didn’t directly inflict said harm themselves. The Russians are the criminals here, if they want this to be avoided they can walk their happy asses out of Ukraine. It’s super easy, the border is literally right there.
Well, no, that’s not what happened at all. Ukraine was attempting to defend itself from Russian missiles, and a Ukrainian defensive missile accidentally landed on Polish soil. They didn’t attack shit.
