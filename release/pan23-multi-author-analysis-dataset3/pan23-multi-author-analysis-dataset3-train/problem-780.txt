He finally ended the Sisyphusian slaughter Obama had put on cruise control. Sure, GOP is going to try to frame Biden on this but give credit where credit is due, Trump ended that mess and we got the same result we were always going to get.
Where do you think legitimacy comes from? Neither the US, the Taliban, nor most of the people within said government thought it was legitimate.
Bro, what Afghan government??? They were our handpicked puppets with zero legitimacy, only our dollars. What do you think the Afghan “government” was going to accomplish?
Afghanistan was done the second it became the nation of Afghanistan. There’s little unity in the people behind the country itself. From my understanding, they still see themselves as subsects and their own groups vs a singular nation. I’ve listened to a lot of soldiers who were actually there talk about their perspective regarding the withdrawal, and the majority of them were basically like “yeah, the taliban was going to take over no matter when or how we left.” If the people aren’t going to fight for democracy themselves, it’s just not going to happen.
