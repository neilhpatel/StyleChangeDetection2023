If we're going to have a filibuster, it really needs to be a speaking filibuster. Preferably one with rules where you have to be talking about the subject under debate. Iirc Texas has pretty decent filibuster rules the Senate could adopt.
I think it's the filibuster. And to make it worse, you only have to make it known you will filibuster, you don't actually have to do it. In the old days, senators would speak at the podium for as long as they could to block the vote. If they don't want to get rid of the filibuster, they should absolutely bring that requirement back. If you want to filibuster, you should have to work for it.
Modern filibuster rules are they just send an email saying "we filibuster this." They don't need to stand and speak continually to block the floor vote.
Republicans only want tax cuts and subsidies for the donor class. That's all they need to pass to keep their base happy. Both can be passed with budge reconciliation. Otherwise a bipartisan bloc of 60 votes is needed to pass anything.
Need 60 votes in the Senate to pass a bill around the filibuster. Democrats have a majority at 51, but they need 9 Republicans to break ranks and vote for legalization in order to actually pass it. Otherwise the bill just dies.
