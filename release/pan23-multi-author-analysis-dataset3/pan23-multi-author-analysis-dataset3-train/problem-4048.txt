It's not really states rights when the question is whether the legislature of a state actually needs to listen to that own states constitution and courts.
There’s no state legislation without state constitution. To say elections are excluded from that fundamental condition is to signal that anyone who claims ownership of any title in what was formally government, is now done so outside of governance. Even for states trying to entertain a semblance of fairness. If the rules can be blown away by a strong gust of wind, those rules don’t exist.
If elections are ruled that they cannot be defined within the law and instead entirely up to those who sit in seats within our state capitals, how is any of our government legitimate from that moment onwards, including those in the position of sitting on the Supreme Court?
The North Carolina legislature is before the US Supreme Court to argue AGAINST state’s rights in national elections so they can legally gerrymander local districts to keep themselves in power.
The North Carolina legislature is contesting whether or not the North Carolina Supreme Court can make rulings with regard to the constitution of North Carolina, in particular how elections are held. The North Carolina legislature's basis for contention is based on an archaic and discredited legal theory that states can not decide how federal elections are held. Justice Thomas has his basis in legal theory that states should be left to decide their own fates with regard to their constitutions, and in a case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States, where he was serving as a Justice, said that only state courts should judge state laws (this is paraphrased). The lawyer representing the North Carolina Supreme Court quoted Justice Clarence Thomas to Justice Clarence Thomas, demonstrating that his decision is clear, but in reality Justice Thomas is more of a political hack than a stalwart of principle.
