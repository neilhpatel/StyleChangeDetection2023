Navalny himself previously based his positions on . The Venn diagram of Navalny supporters and Z supporters exactly comes from this nationalistic base.
Navalny is not a liberal politician, he only frames himself as much as his base of popularity is to be oppositional to Putin. And just because he is the "best" that Russia has left, since Putin assassinated all the actual opponents to his ideology, does not make Navalny worthy of our support.
Now explain why Navalny isn't to be preferred to Putin because as I see it that take is nonsense coming from people who know enough about Russian politics to be completely wrong.
Kind of an unpopular opinion, but I honestly think Navalny is just another tool in Putin’s arsenal. You’re right, why hasn’t he had his most vocal opponent killed? He’s had oligarchs murdered in broad daylight under false pretenses, what makes Navalny so special? Don’t give me the “it gives the public just cause” bullshit. They’ve had just cause for almost a year to completely oppose Putin’s regime, if Ukraine’s invasion did nothing then I doubt Navalny’s assassinatiin would make any difference at all.
Anyone who actually follows russian politics knows that Navalny and his team are pro-west, pro-democratic and anti-war. Like, excepting questionable past and some controversial takes, it's whole their agenda that they push every day.
