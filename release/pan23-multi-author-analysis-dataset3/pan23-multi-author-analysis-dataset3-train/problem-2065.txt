For so many years, decades even, russia has been living off this fear they presented to the world. Of their army, of their military might, their military weapons, their military intelligence. They showed themselves as ravenous bears on the battlefield. In reality, that masquerade popped as though that ravenous bear was truthfully a balloon bear.
While this war is not over, I believe it will irreparably reshape the forces of power in Europe and Asia.
I find this fascinating. This war is horrible, but as an observer of military conflicts and one who studies past wars in history, this has been very interesting. Between the determination of the Ukrainian army, citizens, and leaders, to the idiotic choices of russia and their military incompetence.
Unfortunately for Russia, it gets all three problems: shitty generalship, insufficient trained manpower, and lack of materiel to supply the troops that come in.
Russia couldn't take Kyiv because of logistical incompetence well before the West's first supplies started rolling in.
The supplies that they're getting now aren't even close to top-of-the-line, either. Russian incompetence vs. the West hasn't even scratched the surface.
Let's be honest, it's Russia's incompetence vs. the West ... Russia miscalculated in Western support and involvement, had the West not intervened, the war may have been over.
