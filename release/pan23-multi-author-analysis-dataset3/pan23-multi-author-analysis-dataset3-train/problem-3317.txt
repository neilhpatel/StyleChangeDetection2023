So this guys lies are worse than other politician? I see this guy as a professional troll. What he’s doing is highlighting how hypocritical the nation is. One lie or even a failed campaign promise is unacceptable for elected officials. If you make excuses for X, Y, Z politician but think Santos needs to go, you’re a hypocrite.
Santos is a piece of shit, and the more lies he spews reflects on the rest of the GOP in a way that's outright embarrassing. Not for the politicians, them, no. They have no standards except "protect our own." However, but there will certainly be enough moderate and fringe republicans looking at this shit, seeing them defend him, standing by the blatant lies that may make them question what the fuck is going on.
He won his election, the GOP won a majority of the house, so it's unfortunately pretty clear that a majority of voters actually support this stupid crap.
The electoral college only applies to the President, Santos ran for the House, and he clearly won the majority vote (142,472 for Santos vs 120,737 for Zimmerman).
Gerrymandering or not, he won the majority of votes in his district, as did everyone else who won a seat.
The points you're bringing up don't make sense, it seems like you're confusing the different branches and their procedures.
