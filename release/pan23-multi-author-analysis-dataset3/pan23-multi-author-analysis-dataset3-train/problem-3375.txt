Don't loan money you're not prepared to never see again. If she has no money, legal action isn't going to magically put money in her pocket to pay you back with.
If you can afford to lose the money, and are willing to take that risk, then how long she has to pay you back is a question of negotiation, not law. You should, however, look up what the maximum interest you can charge is in your state.
Is there a reason she can't get a line of credit from her bank? That's a completely reasonable amount of money to borrow, but a lot for you to loan to a roommate.
It's also a good reason for you not to loan her the money. Someone who is being supported by someone else can be very difficult to collect from because they may not have any or many assets in their name that you could go after. There's no guarantee that you'll be able to force repayment, even if you go through the courts.
There is no guarantee that she would make any money off of the book. Also, on a practical note, don't mix business and friendships. Suggest she start a GoFundMe.
