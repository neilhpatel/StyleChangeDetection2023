By 230 CE, the Sun family had become the second power in the land and Sun Quan had, on 23rd June 229, become Emperor to match his main rivals. Using the waters of the Yangzi to protect from the more powerful Wei to their north while expanding south against the Shanyue peoples, and taking Jiao from the Shi family who had been their allies, to make some effort to close the resource and population gap. However, Wu had struggled to make any headway across the Yangzi and the new Son of Heaven's eyes were turning to more... ambitious schemes.
The fifth-century Hou Han Shu has Wu officer Shen Ying's description of Yizhou in his Lin hai shui tu ji (Records of the waters and lands of Lin hai), translated by Achilles Fang.
I'm not aware the Latter Han had much interest in it with Jiao province including Vietnam the southernmost for serious focus. However following the collapse of the Latter Han and the founding of the kingdoms, the southernmost of the three would briefly turn its eyes on Yizhou.
For the Latter Han and the three kingdoms there was a land known as Yizhou "Barbarian Island" which might have been Taiwan.
How clear is it that Yizhou was Taiwan? I recall reading some speculation that it may actually have been one of the main islands of the Pescadores/Penghu but I cannot for the life of me recall where.
