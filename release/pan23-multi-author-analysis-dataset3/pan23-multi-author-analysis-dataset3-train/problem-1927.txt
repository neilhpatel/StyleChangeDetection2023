I feel like Swiss neutrality is kind of pro-Russia. It feels kind of like a crime of indifference; just think back to Nazi Germany and how we call out people who lived back then and didn't support the Nazis yet decided to do nothing. We mostly just blame them for going along with the Nazis due to their indifference.
Besides if you read this article you will find out that the Swiss gov wasn't really as neutral as they would want you to think during WW2.
Also, one of the main reasons why the Swiss haven't been invaded is because of their country's mountainous topography, not just neutrality. With high tech missiles, drones and jets those mountains don't matter as much as they use to. They still do matter but just no where near as much. It's not like the Swiss will be invaded in modern times though.
How is Switzerland protecting one side as a country ? Economical sanctions have been alligned on what the EU is doing and multiple Billions freezed on Russian accounts. I would love to see what's hidden in some Delaware and isle of Man bank accounts. I'm sure it's not better than what private banks are doing under banking secrecy.
