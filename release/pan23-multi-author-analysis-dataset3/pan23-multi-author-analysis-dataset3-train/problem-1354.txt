Ha. I feel you. I got operated on in November to get a fibroid removed, and what a surprise - doc found two endometriosis bits that he had no idea of before. Pure luck.
Lasered them off and at least now I know, since they will come back, but God.. How are we supposed to find them? The medicine just isn't there yet. But it sucks.
this is a bad idea. it just makes employers see hiring women as risky, even though the majority of women wouldn't need this on top of regular sick leave.
Hiring a women becomes riskier as an employer, not only for pregnancy, but now also for X days a month potentially lost for menstrual leave.
You can hire a male, and only have to pay his mandatory vacation, or hire a female, pay her vacation, possible materinity leave, and now possible menstrual leave.
A huge amount of women would take advantage of this system for an extra day off whenever they want. They should just increase the mandatory vacation time for everyone by 12 days and call it done.
While I congratulate them on trying to increase worker rights and benefits, it also has the unfortunate side effect of making female employees more undesirable in the workplace as workers.
