I wouldn't put it all on Athenian "propaganda". It's pretty clear that Athens, as a large and rich city attracted quite a lot of foreigners, including sophists, rhetors and philosophers. I think it's fair to say that in classical times, the number of people writing and publishing was quite higher in Athens than in Sparta.
An Athenian would have loved to know this question was still being asked in 2,500 years â€” because it shows the remarkable success of Athenian propaganda! The main reason we think of Athens as full of philosophers is because Athenian writing says it was. And the main reason we think Sparta was all brawn and no brain is because Athenian writing says it was.
All our literary sources for what Athens and Sparta were 'like' in the 5th century BCE are Athenian. Thucydides, the great historian of the war, was an Athenian. Aristophanes, a comedic playwright and frequent war-commentator, was Athenian. Xenophon and Plato, who reflect on the war in the following generations, were both Athenians. So too were the myriad of orators whose 'cultural commentary' on Athens and Sparta survives. In fact, almost all surviving literary Greek from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE is Athenian. (By literary, I mean continuous texts, meant for private reading and usually of some lenh; non-literary texts, like inscriptions, survive from across the Greek world).
