Now we have to look where the 144 million inhabitants of Russia are concentrated. For this we can have a look at this graphic:
I addition to what I already stated we also have to consider that soviet politics aimed for an urbanization and centralization. This means that many Russian cities are more heavily populated than they'd be if only climate, agricultural fertility etc. were the deciding factors. So if it wasn't for the influence of the government, the population of Russia probably would be even more concentrated in the fertile and milder regions and not so much in the urban centers.
Actually the Russian SSR was the most urbanised republic of the Soviet Union for the time of it's existence, also its urbanisation rate was very similar to that of Western Europe. Here is the data on urbanisation rate;.
ETA: this of Soviet urbanization according to the 1989 census can be helpful to see what I'm describing. Moscow had almost nine million residents, Leningrad five million, then large cities in non-Russian republics (only nine of the top twenty were in Russia proper). Once you get to cities like Gorky it's around a million and a half people, and they rapidly go down to a million or so people at best. Once you're at Volgograd you're under a million. I'll also add that despite the massive increase in urbanization rates, the USSR and Russia proper still were majority rural until about 1960 or so, so the population being mostly urbanized is a relatively recent phenomenon. Economic changes since the 1990s have only accelerated these processes and made Moscow even bigger economically and in terms of population.
