The cards have been extracted and it was my mistake for trusting the scammer in the first place. I was just trying to find out if the person has legal standing to take me to court in which the general consensus of this thread is that the scammer doesn’t.
Yes, we tried to use other apps like PayPal and Zelle but that failed also. I’m assuming the person is a scammer at this point and it was a stupid mistake on my part. I’m not seeking compensation, I just posted this due to the blackmail attempt.
My advice is that there is nothing they can blackmail you with, and these are empty threats. Your bigger problem is that you are out the money that you spent on gift cards and you are unlikely to see the PS5.
Yeah, I’d even say that any sales pitch that has “PS5” and “send gift cards” in it is definitely a scam. No one who has a legitimate new console to sell is going to dick around with gift cards. Particularly because they are still in demand, no one is going to put up with that hassle if it’s a real offer.
What’s worse, is that once you send scammers anything, they know they have a target they can work with. They will try to hit you up as much as they can before the target gets wise to them. That’s why they’re still trying to get you to pay them something.
