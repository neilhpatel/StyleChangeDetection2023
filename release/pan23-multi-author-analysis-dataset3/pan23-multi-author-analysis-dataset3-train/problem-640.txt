Well, I’ve mostly just been getting followers. Probably 20 in the first week. Not much, but not bad coming from zero.
I try to upload a new reel at least two a week and I started off by following all of the other indie game devs I could find. All of my follows are from other game devs, but I’m okay with that for now since I’m still quite early in development.
I made one a few weeks ago so I can start marketing a game. I’ve yet to buy a checkmark but I barely get any engagement. I get much more on Instagram. Don’t really care about losing my Twitter.
I would love for Twitter to die. I’ve been making fun of it and shitting on it since it became popular. I would love to see it gone.
Sadly I don’t think we’re in that kind of social media space anymore for something so big to just become abandoned. We need a real alternative to Twitter that attracts everyone away from Twitter.
Interesting that you think we need a replacement social media site for one to fall out of favor. More and more people are not participating in social media due to the backlash and risk associated with sharing personal data… whether it be to friends, family, followers, or data gathering advertisers.
