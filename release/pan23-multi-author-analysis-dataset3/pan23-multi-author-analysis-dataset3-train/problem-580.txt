Escrow is something with your loan servicer. The title company shouldn’t have anything to do with it. Now, if payment for property taxes came out of your mortgage escrow that was supposed to be paid at closing, then that is something different, and it invites lots of questions such as how the seller and the buyer agreed in the purchase agreement to handle property tax payments owed in the year of the transaction, and how that was then handled at settlement and closing.
You are correct the amount that was collected to pay the taxes of the year the house was bought came out of the escrow paid at closing that’s why I think the amounts were handled incorrectly in a year I could expect a shortage due to raised taxes or insurance but not starting the escrow account in negative.
To answer the first question the issue is the division of the taxes for 2020 was not calculated to place in escrow and the title company sent the escrow money to the lender the amount of taxes was paid from it and the escrow account started negative that’s the reason of the shortage.
They were adjusted from the start, the previous owner used to pay way less but the problem remains the same our taxes were not calculated correctly since in the documents the amount due in 2020 was never disclosed.
