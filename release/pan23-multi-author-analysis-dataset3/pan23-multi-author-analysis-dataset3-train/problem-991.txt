Since no one else has chimed in, did a quick review of the Nuremberg lit to confirm my recollection was correct, and the answer is pretty much no.
Thus, the veracity of many of his claims there has been debunked as he was speaking for the cameras in an attempt to polish his reputation and that of the party. Unsurprisingly for someone who had propagated bald faced lies from the beginning of the movement, he kept doing so up until the very end.
This was also - give or take - the relative position of the few people in Nazi leadership who had some idea about their own atomic weapon development, which was that with a focus on plutonium, it wasn't likely to be something that might affect the outcome of the war, but it had a good chance if it succeeded of determining the balance of power after it.
Where the atomic bomb came up more often was in the grand view of politics the leadership continued to assess from afar, where most of their interest was in what the development of the bomb would do to US-Soviet relations:
By and large, this led to a general view of atomic weapons by most strategic thinkers for a few years after the war as merely a much more powerful and compact version of the strategic bombing that had already defined World War II. The Nazi leadership certainly subscribed to this, and had no problems comparing the Allied raids carried out by Spaatz and Harris' air forces to their own crimes, far lesser in their minds:
It also amazes me (though I guess it shouldn't), reading these nuremburg comments and comments recorded in a few of Antony Beevor's books just how...clueless and delusional the Nazis and Wermacht were in regards to their crimes and the resulting conduct of the war. No real question here, just an observation about how the worst people often develop the strongest victimhood complexes.
