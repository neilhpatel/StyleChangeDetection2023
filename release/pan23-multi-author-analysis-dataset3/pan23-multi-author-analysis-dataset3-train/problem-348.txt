The answer to that question is basically always "yes." Suing is asking a court to make a determination of fact and award damages as appropriate. The bar is intentionally low because any boundaries you could formally draw would exclude some outliers that should be able to seek restitution. That being the case, pretty much anyone can file a lawsuit for pretty much any reason.
"Pressing charges" is not the same thing as "suing." Pressing charges has to do with violations of criminal law. Suing seeks to recover damages in a civil case.
If you're talking about domain squatting, where someone registers a domain and does more or less nothing with it while holding it as a commodity in hopes of selling it, then you might have a case, if the domain is something that legitimately should belong to you personally. For instance, if the domain name is your company name, and someone else has registered the domain name and put up a parking page, or is displaying nothing but ads there, then you might sue to have the domain name transferred to you.
Title: Can I sue someone who has stolen a domain name from a company illegally, even if that company doesn't wish to pursue charges?
You cannot generally sue on behalf of the company that "should" (in your opinion) be the "rightful" (in your opinion) owners of the domain. They need to act on their own behalf. If they're not interested, and there's no reason why the domain name should clearly be your property, then you can't sue, force them to take it, and then ask them to transfer it to you.
