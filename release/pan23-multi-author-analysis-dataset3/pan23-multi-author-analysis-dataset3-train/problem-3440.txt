Contact a regular medical malpractice attorney - you want them to take the case "on contingency" which means they get paid out of the eventual money you get if you win.
It must not be economically viable (costs of experts and trial, probability of success, damage caps) or some of the med mal attorneys would be interested.
Pro Bono attorneys will not be able to take this case, the reasoning being the absolute expense of medical malpractice cases. Expert witnesses will be needed to explain the standard of care, this usually runs in the tens of thousands of dollars, in addition to the other expenses.
Once you get away from pro Bono, which isnâ€™t necessary here as plaintiffs attorneys work off a percentage of the judgement, you do not pay anything. But, they will only take cases they are likely to win and have a payout that will justify their time. There are also complicated formulas that will require actuarial sciences to determine the value of the case. There are tools plaintiffs attorneys use to do a poor mans version of this, so if there are unfavorable facts (making the case a toss up) or a low value after expenses, they will not take the case.
