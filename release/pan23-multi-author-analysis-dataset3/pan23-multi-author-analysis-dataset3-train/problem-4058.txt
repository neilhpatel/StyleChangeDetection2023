Pack it up boys. This guy knows it all... He was on the field and checked the missiles... Also he heard Putin on the phone, he confirmed it. Jesus this sub is clown fiesta. Nobody still knows what happend. Yea most likely Russian stray missile, but you cant be sure bcs not even Pentagon or Poland is sure.
It’s not very likely that Russia has anti air systems within 150km of this impact site. Belarus and the front line are way out of range which is why it’s likely a Ukrainian missile that was intercepting something.
Not everything is Russian propaganda because you don’t like it, I’m just reporting what the BBC said after speaking to 3 different weapon experts.
BBC reporting independent security experts are saying it’s an S-300 missile. Which considering the range likely means it’s a wayward Ukrainian defence missile.
Yeah I'm not surprised, especially since the initial look at the missile makes it seem like a Ukrainian s300. Seems quite likely to be a very unfortunate accident but we will know soon enough for sure.
