This set of facts makes it a close call, so no one is going to be able to give you a definitive answer. You can argue they waived your responsibility, but they can argue the waiver was conditioned on a new paying tenant.
"Per our agreement and your request I have relinquished the apartment to you, which has ended our lease agreement. Thus, I will no longer be paying rent for this unit.
I think the tenant is still obligated to pay. Giving the keys to the land lord only enables the landlord to find tenants as soon as possible. But does not cancel the contract. But if the tenant can prove the landlord hasnâ€™t tried hard enough to rent the place out then the tenant would have a defense against this.
And with the lease the tenant is responsible for any lost rent. Who would a Judge rule for. Consider tenant responsible for any lost rent. The landlord who did everything right. Or the tenant that does not want to honor the lease.
And one said tenant returned keys. Well for there to even be a chance of a new tenant moving in they would have to return keys. Later they can ask for them back.
Actually what they confirmed was they had a approved renter that planned to move in. That did not happen thru no fault of the LL.
