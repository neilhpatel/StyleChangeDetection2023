He chose to not purchase the coverage that would allow his insurance to help him. If the car owner successfully claims his car was stolen then his insurance will not pay as he's not liable for the actions of a thief. If that's the case the driver's insurance won't cover damages caused by him while driving a stolen car.
\- If the driver has the same insurance as Steve and the owner of the car, would the shared insurance cover the cost of the repairs?
2)there is no “shared insurance” here. If all 3 parties have the same insurance, it doesn’t matter. Steve doesn’t have collision coverage. If the car was stolen (used without permission) then the owners policy will not pay).
6)if the car was stolen then that’s between the owner of the car and the friend who stole it. The owner of the car can report it it he wants. There’s nothing Steve can do to bring the police in to this and even if he could, it doesn’t change what I already said—-it will NOT make the insurance companies pay for Steve’s damages. He will have to sue the driver. It’s a very unfortunate situation but this what can happen if you choose not carry collision and uninsured motorist coverage.
If he only has liability insurance than there is no way his insurance will pay because he chose not to purchase collision insurance. It doesn’t matter what the cameras show or who is at fault. There is no reason to keep calling the police either. If he has the other drivers insurance he can file a claim with them and if they side with their driver then he will have to sue the driver in small claims court.
I know that his own insurance policy will not pay for the damages but, is there any way that the driver's insurance can pay? Essentially this is the flow of what we are confused about:
