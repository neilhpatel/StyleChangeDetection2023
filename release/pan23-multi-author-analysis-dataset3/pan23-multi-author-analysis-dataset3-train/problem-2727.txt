Do you think the artistic depictions may have had any sort of sexual undertones, in a more titillating/voyeuristic sense?
Personally, I don't think they're meant to be sexual or titillating, in comparison with many other paintings. There's certainly interest in this gendered action, but the tone seems to be more "this delicate female, she must be supported and helped" rather than "look how vulnerable she is, she couldn't stop you if you tried anything ..."

. Most of these theories are put forth in medical writings, that are only accessable in PDF format but are easily searchable. It's by no means definitive that this is the reason, but it's certainly a sound theory that is becoming more common as the condition gains more recognition in the medical field. Some doctors still largely dismiss the condition as being "made up", despite possibly being one of the easiest conditions to diagnose, but it's not unexpected when you take into account the ongoing .
It's a form of Dysautonomia, which in basic terms is the disfunction of the autonomic system. The autonomic system is what is responsible for bodily functions that happen automatically - breathing, heart rate, blood flow, body temperature, hydration.
Effectively what happens is the autonomic system doesn't function properly, leading to lower blood pressure, which increases the heart rate in order to pump blood faster, this in turn leads to dizzyness, light-headedness, and fainting. It affects breathing rate, so any slight exertion, even just walking, can lead to breathlessness as the heart pumps faster and faster in an attempt to keep the body alert and upright, this however does not mean the sufferer is unfit, it's just a malfunction of the body.
