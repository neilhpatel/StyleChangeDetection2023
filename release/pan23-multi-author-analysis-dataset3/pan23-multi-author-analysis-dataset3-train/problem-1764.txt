How were you contacted? Are they asking for money? You might want to Google how to contact UA's legal department and contact them for confirmation that it's legit.
What is your product? Under Armour has a Play Up line, and if you're also producing clothing, they may feel that's too close for comfort. If you're producing, say, actual play armor that couldn't be confused for a UA product, that's another thing.
Why did you choose to use Play Armor when Under Armour already exists for the same type of products? If you talked to any attorneys when applying for this trademark they should have told you this was gonna happen.
In order to maintain its trademark Under Armour must police potential infringements. Considering your trademark uses the word armor for athletic apparel of course Under Armour is going to take notice. You can contest that they are dissimilar in court but it sounds like you cant afford to fight that, so yeah you are doomed (good chance you would lose anyways if you could afford to fight it).
