edit: I also want to point out that the mods appropriately (from a historian's point of view) removed a post that maintained that during the Spanish flu (attributed to 1917), "a Rosie is referring to a sick person" and that "posies were put in one's pocket as it was believed to protect you in some way from getting sick." In addition, the post asserted that, "ashes ashes we all fall down.. I'm not sure about that part. I can only guess that maybe the dead were burned." This is great material from a folklorist's point of view - largely because it cannot be substantiated with historical research and is, apparently, a folk explanation (although I would need to see it gathered from several informants). "cannot be substantiated with historical research" - rightly enough to be removed by /r/AskHistorians, but woe to folklorists!
Folklorists regard the plague explanation of "Ring around the Rosie" as a folk etymology (a baseless but popular explanation) or as metafolklore - a folk tradition about folklore. The spread and widespread adoption of the plague explanation is, then, a form of folklore in itself.
So long as we’re mentioning folkloric claims, when I first read the plague explanation it told me “ashes” was a corruption of “achoo,” as in the sneeze noise.
I have heard many times that "ashes" is a corruption /substitution for "achoo"--the sound of a sneeze.
I'm surprised to hear the line is 'ashes ashes' for some, where I grew up in Ireland it was always 'a-tissue, a-tissue (as in the sneezing noise), we all fall down.' I wonder if this difference was encouraged by the origin myth?
