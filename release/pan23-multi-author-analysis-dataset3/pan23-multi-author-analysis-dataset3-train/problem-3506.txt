If this room mate were to continue paying the rent on time, not damage the property, and is cool with all of this, you might be okay. But if those things do NOT happen, you're in a very exposed position, as you are legally obligated to ensure these things are taken care of.
The long and short of it is that the three of you as a unit are obligated to pay the rent, and satisfy any other terms on the lease.
From the landlords perspective, they have an agreement to pay the rental amount for the period in question with the three of you as a unit. You agreed to pay, and the landlord agreed to provide the property for the specified time period. The fact that the inter-personal dynamics between you soured of the course of time is, really, not the landlord's problem. They are continuing to fulfill their obligation in providing the property, and expect you to continue to fulfill yours.
Additionally, your former room mate could bring a civil claim against you for your portion of the rent.
We all three signed the lease to the landlord but I believe the third roommate is going to stay and take up the whole lease himself. Can he later sue me?
Thank you üôèüèΩ we will see what‚Äôs to come. I‚Äôm not going to pay the rent in a place I don‚Äôt live unfortunately. Landlords wouldn‚Äôt work with us but thank tou for your advice.
