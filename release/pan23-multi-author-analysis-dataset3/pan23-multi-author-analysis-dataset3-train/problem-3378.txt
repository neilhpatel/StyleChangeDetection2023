On the note regarding lost subrogation. Is your concern that my attempt can sabotage my insurance providers shot at doing the same with better attorneys?
Yup makes sense. Not that this matters when the tribal court is stacked against “outsiders”. But she has 2 DUIs with most recent one in December 2020 where she was arrested for not only DUI but bypassing the interlock ignitition. This arrest happened by a non-tribal police department. Thank god.. My guess is she lost the drivers license then. Despite this, she wasn’t booked last night by the tribal police for driving without a license or insurance. My guess is they skipped on the breathalyzer test as well. It’s one thing to protect tribal members for minor infractions but it makes you wonder where this enabling ends. I guess tribal members really have zero accountability on the reservation. A truly unsafe place for all “outsiders”.
So I guess the questions comes down to, do they use the immunity defense liberally or allow some tort cases to go through. How do they decide? I guess I’ll pay one of the dozen attorneys licensed by tribal court for their take on this.
You will need a tribal attorney to handle the case for you. Even if you're represented by a tribal attorney, your chances of getting a fair hearing are fairly low - but without a tribal attorney they are non-existent.
