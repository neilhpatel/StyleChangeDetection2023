Workman's Comp is there for this purpose, and so long as your employer cooperates fully and doesn't cause problems, you won't need the lawyer. Get all the recommended treatments, get physical therapy, focus on healing. Double check the paperwork.
It would be worth talking to a Workers Comp attorney, at least a consult and to have a number to call. Call your state bar or do some thorough googling to find a good lawyer.
Yes, you should speak to a lawyer. You’re going to want to find an attorney who specializes in “products liability”.
And as the few actual attorneys have noted above, if you want to sue, workers comp is your exclusive remedy but only against your employer. What that means is while your options against your employer are limited to WC, you have the right to sue anyone else on the planet for your injuries.
OP will have to make the determination of thier employer even has WC coverage. If they do, great, that should take care of the situation (eventually).
If they don't, you'll be looking at a law suit. I'm sure there are lawyers that specialize in these situations in TX.
