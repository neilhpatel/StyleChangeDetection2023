Some passages are verbatim quotes of the earlier manuals, however, what I find fascinating is that other passages have been edited with newer tactics. For example, the later Praecepta Miltiaria describes keeping the pikemen (menuvlatoi) close to the front line of spearmen (hoplites - no tactical relation to the ancient Greek hoplites aside from both having shields) where the Sylloge describes keeping them separate. These slight changes lend credence to the idea that these manuals were actually used and refined through periods of loss, such as in the early 950s soon after the Sylloge was written.
The tenth century saw a revival of Byzantine military manuals, which gives us an insight into how the army commanders thought about warfare. For example, there are a succession of these army manuals starting from about the 950s to the 1000s AD that cover the use of large hollow square formations. In order these are the Sylloge Tactictorum (c. 950 AD) , the Praecepta Militaria (c. 965 AD), the Tactica of Nikephoros Ouranos (c. 1000 AD). \[Infantry versus Cavalry: The Byzantine Response by Eric McGeer\].
I'd like to ask a slightly different question, how would you compare a Byzantine army after 1263 with the ones in service before the fourth crusade? Discussions in replies aren't required to be in-depth so even a short answer will be allowed by the moderators, i guess.
