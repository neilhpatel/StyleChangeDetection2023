>And just as a side note, the fact that Iran's weird religious legal system is so turbid and opaque that Wikipedia people have to do investigative work to establish a simple fact that should be easily verifiable by reading a legal act is pretty fucked up.

"In the Islamic Republic it is illegal to execute a young woman, regardless of her crime, if she is a virgin [â€¦]".
It seems like they can't kill a person who's destined for heaven and all virgin women are destined for heaven despite their "crimes" so they go through the process outlined above.
Not only are these girls raped before they're executed because of a legal requirement, the reason why they can't die virgins in the first place is so they can't go to heaven. They're raped before they're killed for the explicit purpose of sending them to hell after they die.
