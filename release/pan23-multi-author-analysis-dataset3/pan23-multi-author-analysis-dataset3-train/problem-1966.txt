As a non-American you can't just move to America (nor could I just move to Canada). You can be sponsored by a person, you can get a job that sponsors you, you may want to ask for more info at /r/immigration.
ETA: r/USCIS (US Citizen and Immigration Service) also might be able to help when you’re further along the immigration process.
r/California would probably be a good place to start. Their sidebar says to search through their archives if you have moving questions, because it’s probably already been asked and answered.
Once you’ve researched a bit, you can ask specific legal questions here. It’d also help if you added more detail (for example, if you’re asking about visas, specify whether you’re going to California for work or school).
You can live in the US on an educational visa while attending school here, then you have to find employment (or some other way of staying long term) or leave.
Loans for international students are relatively rare, so you/your family would have to be able to demonstrate that you can afford tuition + cost of living while you attend as part of getting the visa.
Marriage or employment sponsorship are your only real options. The jobs/enterprises you list will not help you immigrate, it's mostly going to be positions that require higher education, very specialized training, or both.
