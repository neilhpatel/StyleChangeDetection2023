California defines "under the influence" as "mental or physical abilities are so impaired that he or she is no longer able to drive a vehicle with the caution of a sober person, using ordinary care, under similar circumstances.".
A person is guilty of a weed DUII in California if they operate a vehicle while under the influence of any drug (in this case, cannabis).
And just FYI, the impairing effects of cannabis can last much longer than the "high" lasts, sometimes up to 24 hours.
A person doesn't have to be totally stoned; they just have to be not quite as good of a driver as a sober person.
‘With the caution of a sober person’ is interesting. I wonder how the prosecution would show that when the entire interaction happened at 0 miles per hour. He wasn’t pulled over for erratic driving or a violation. There was nothing on him or in the truck. The primary evidence against him is his admission and whatever the blood test shows. His admission is vague without a way to quantify the amount of THC ingested, so it’s really going to come down to the blood test.
