The OP might be able to move to a new state more easily (and more frequently) than someone who works in the private sector. Can you recommend some states that would be less friendly to grand parents' rights?
I would look towards attorneys who specialize in grandparents rights cases for lists of the most and least friendly states. I'd also be preparing to pay for an experienced family law attorney in the state where you currently reside.
However, as military personnel, I would go straight to your local JAG and notify your Chain of Command.
- Talking to JA: JA can go to commander, and likely will direct you right back to your command team and can brief your commander on what you tell them. Remember: JA is not your lawyer, they are the commander’s legal advisor. You don’t have attorney client privilege with JA.
ETA: you will need to decide whether you want your commander involved (which I would recommend, commanders have a ton of legal authority to solve problems like this including arranging an emergency or humanitarian transfer to another base), and you need to be aware of which actions trigger command involvement. A quick summary:
It’s worth noting that while the military does provide access to lawyers (called Area Defense Counsel or ADC), they can only be used if you are facing military judicial or non judicial disciplinary actions such as a court martial or Article 15. They cannot represent you for civilian issues like this one.
- Talking to chaplain: will never go to commander without your permission, and will provide you counseling and access to other base resources.
- Talking to victims advocate: will never go to commander without your permission, and will still help you get counseling and access to other base resources.
