Am curious what the % of UN refugee claimant inflows is per capita. That I think would be more telling. I’m also curious how many of Canada’s refugee claimants are in Canada as a result of the U.S. having granted them visas - also very telling (since I read somewhere once that a big chunk of Canada’s refugee problem, which is more per capital than the US’s) is due to the U.S. allowing so many people in, especially with tourist visa issuance at U.S. embassy’s abroad, and then they hit the road for Canada once they land at US airports, and that illegal crossings into Canada are because the U.S. can’t control its own southern border.
