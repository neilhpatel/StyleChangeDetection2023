On the other hand, the high Assyrian god "Asur" has entirely different origins. For a start, when you use the proper notation, the word you might see as "Asur" should usually be "Ašur." That mark over the S indicates that it's intended to be pronounced like we would usually say "sh" in English. So rather than Assur like Vedic "Asura" we should read it as Ashur, lile the Assyrian kind "Ashurbanipal." This is confused and muddied by general conventions like the nation of Assyria, the king Essarhadon, or the city of Assur, which are typically written in a way that leads English speakers astray from the original Akkadian. In every case the stem is actually the name of the god "Ašur.".
The last major point to make is that the Assyrians,and thus Ašur, belonged to the Semitic linguistic and cultural family rather than Indo-European. Their myths, language, and religion shared traits with the Akkadians of central Mesopotamia, the Amurrites and later peoples of Babylon, Canaan, Hebrews, and Arabia.
The Assyrians were the earliest attested speakers of the Semitic language family. They spoke and wrote Akkadian, and mingled with (and supplanted) the native Neolithic Mesopotamian populations. Akkadian names begin to appear in Mesopotamia by the 29th century. Semitic is part of the larger Afro-Asiatic branch, and all of the other members of the branch originate in Africa. It is very unlikely that the Semitic group (and therefore Assyria) have anything to do with India or central Asia. Even earlier, about 3000 BCE, are the Kish, speaking an East Semitic and overlapping the region of Sumer. There is no connection to your "worshiper of Asur" in Vedic (and I've not heard this term before myself; are you sure you are interpreting it correctly, and in the right timeline?).
