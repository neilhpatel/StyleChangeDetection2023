I think it's abhorrent to burn a religion's book of worship, but this just isn't an international incident.
It’s also pretty stupid to complain about killings in far-away Muslim majority countries, then burn a Quran in a safe, Christian majority country like Sweden over free speech.
Completely different. Protesting the invasion itself from the US won’t do much. Protest for the government to take more action against Russia and aid Ukraine, and that’ll make a difference.
Loads of black people would find it reasonable to beat up a white person disrespectfully saying the n-word. You think people should be able to say the n-word because free speech?
If you want to make a point about wanting free speech, do it in a country where there isn’t already such a privilege.
Why do westerners think they have absolute freedom of expression? Last thing I heard is that Kanye is fucked after his anti semitic shiet. Saying N-word is not allowed. Be the edgy fuck who wants to provoke people, but don't expect to keep your job or not to be shieted on online. Any person that supports this shiet should deeply look at what he/she stands.
