I think you mean Mongols. Mongolians are the current inhabitants of the country of Mongolia. But otherwise yeah, this is totally spot on about the history of Russian power.
You see, these guys invaded Russia a few hundred years ago, and they "ruled" for a few hundred years. Those quotation marks I have around ruled pretty much tell the story. When most invaders, well, invade, they govern, and incorporate the newly acquired territory to their economy, the invadee might not like it, they might be exploited, but they are still governed are participating in an economy.
The Mongols were nomads uninterested in ruling or economy, so when they invaded Russia (which was a collection of principalities at the time) , the system was straight forward, the population works, the princes extract as much of that product as possible, and they pay it as a tribute to the Mongols, else they just get beheaded.
There's a nice video on Youtube by Kraut that talks about this, I'm just summarizing from memory. In a sense the Mongols are to blame. No, really.
This is not to shift the blame away from current Russian "leadership" , many centuries has passed since then, but it's also an interesting point to view them through and one which might be key for any future shift in leadership structure over there.
It's interesting that Putin hasn't lined up any obvious successor, but I think you are right, hard to see anyone coming after him who could take over the reigns so firmly. It was different under communism, you had a system in place, this is just one man basically.
