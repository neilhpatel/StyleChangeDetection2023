Zhilin had to cross the border illegally as he knew that, as an FSB officer, he would not be allowed to leave the country. He asked for political asylum, but his request was rejected by Kazakh authorities and he was arrested.
No, they have a legitimate case for persecution on political grounds and should all be granted political asylum.
That's the intended purpose of granting people political asylum, saving them from actual political persecution. A military draft doesn't violate any human rights by itself, and I'm not interested in saving Russians whose "political opposition" stems from selfishness and cowardice.
I don't care. If they aren't willing to stand up to their shitty government, they're welcome to go freeze and die in Ukraine instead. We don't want them.
Thing is, they don’t want to. If choice is “killing Ukrainians” or “stand for yourself” — Russian always choice a option that involves killing Ukrainians.
I never said it’s Russophobia to hate them for killing Ukrainians, I said it’s stupid to make the ones who don’t want to kill Ukrainians go back and fight the Ukrainians?! How is this even controversial in the slightest?
