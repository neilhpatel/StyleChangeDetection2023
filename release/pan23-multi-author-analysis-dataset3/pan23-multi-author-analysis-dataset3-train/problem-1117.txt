Russia holds the only major metal working foundry in Ukraine in Mariupol. It is currently non-functioning.
Almost 1/3 of the American population thinks we provide too much aid to Ukraine and less then 20% want us to increase aid to Ukraine. Ukraine currently is calling for almost a 100% increase in aid to be able to win the war by arming an additional 9 BCTs (this estimate also predicts Ukraine having very few losses during the build up which recent American released data indicates Ukraine has losses nearly matching Russia's).
After Ukraine liberates their country, NATO can use the combination of sanctions and the threat of their unused military to force Russia to settle with Ukraine when Russia is ready to admit to itself it has been defeated by the AFU, something that might be harder to do if NATO goes in to solve the war for Ukraine instead.
Fourth the US, UK and Russia all signed the Budapest Memorandum which offered Ukraine security assurances that none of them would attack Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine giving their Soviet nuclear stockpile to Russia. Now if Russia is allowed to just break that treaty and conquer Ukraine (whereas if they didn't sign that treaty Russia likely wouldn't have attacked), what are the chances that other countries would ever voluntarily give up their nuclear arsenal given that NATO will have proven they aren't willing to protect anyone? What are the chances that more countries won't seek out to make nuclear weapons to protect themselves in a new arms race?
Lol Nato isn’t going anywhere since Russia put a dummy nuke in a missile to intimidate UA. There are still nearby countries that haven’t even donated 1% of their annual military budget to UA. Biden doesn’t even need to send another dollar from America if he can rally underperforming Nato countries to start pulling their weight.
