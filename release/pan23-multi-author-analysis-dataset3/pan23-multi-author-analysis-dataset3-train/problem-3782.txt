Yup. If we didn’t have Manchin, we’d have an actual Republican in his seat. And while manchin is a huge problem, he can and has voted with the rest of the democrats, which a republican senator would not ever likely do.
Manchin could really use the cover to vote with the Republicans without changing the outcome for these next 2 years while he's running for reelection in one of the reddest states in the country.
Manchin is very unlikely to be reelected over an actual Republican in 2024. West Virginia is going the way of Florida. West Virginia is probably going to have to be written off for a while.
2024 is another opportunity to replace Manchin. Hopefully Chuck Grassley will retire or be forced to retire due to age and health issues and we can have a chance to replace him with a Democrat. Missouri is another potential pickup (and probably easier than Iowa).
Manchin is replaceable. We just need to aim for other states. West Virginia is going the way of Florida, Kansas, and Wyoming. It's time to let them go for a while. Manchin will be gone after 2024 and replaced by a Republican, and there seems to be nothing Democrats can do to stop it. Whether a Conservative, Moderate, Liberal, Progressive or Leftist Democrat.
Manchin voted against the $15/hr minimum wage even though his voters very much did want that. Manchin's votes make far more sense if you follow the money of his business investments and what business interests he's involved in.
