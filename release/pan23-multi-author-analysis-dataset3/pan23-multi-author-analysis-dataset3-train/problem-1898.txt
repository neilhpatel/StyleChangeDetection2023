Bush was certainly part of a racist system and pushed some racist policies, but I genuinely believe he had little to no racial animosity on a personal level.
That doesn't count for much, and doing better than current republicans is a low bar, but he was still absolutely better in this respect.
The only thing that can save the Republican Party at this point is a full throttle rejection, by both the GOP and voters, of the likes of Trump and anti-Democratic candidates and leaders.
The only reason the GOP has any hold on power is that Trump activated a bunch of low-inclination socially isolated voters. They want full fascism, they want the confederacy to rise, they want to own labor, not create jobs, they want public execution of anyone that disagrees with them.
They were on the sidelines. Trump got them into the game. the GOP can't win without them now, but its gonna come to a point where they can't win with them either.
I don't think the GOP views any of these as "problems" unless they begin to lose elections (like with the mid-terms). Only then is there any "concern", and the only part that bothered them was not winning.
