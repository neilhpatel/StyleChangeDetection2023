>He suggested that these crimes may continue, as Russia has recruited “not human beings, but criminals, neo-Nazis and other trash”, to fight on the front lines, referring to the group of mercenaries and prisoners Moscow has freed to deploy to Ukraine with the Wagner PMC.
Russian conscripts who are previously prisoners who received freedom by agreeing to fight for russia in Ukraine have a high probability of committing crimes against Ukraine’s populations. Russia should be held accountable for their actions because they are releasing convicted criminals in soldier uniforms on the people of Ukraine.
Also Ukraine said they would treat Russian citizens who come as part of the occupying force as combatants and tried accordingly.
Wouldn't mind it, though at some point if Ukraine wants to govern Donetsk they can't just kill everyone there, and the pro Russia side is a sizeable chunk of the population.
I like the potential outcome here, but let's say Donbas surrenders to Ukraine, and barring an imminent security threat, what do you do with all the people there?
It's the height of arrogance and entitlement that these pro Russian people think they could take all of the Donbas away from the majority Ukrainian people and they would be ok with it. There are many displaced residents of the Donbas all around Ukraine and the world, and it didn't just start this year but from 2014.
