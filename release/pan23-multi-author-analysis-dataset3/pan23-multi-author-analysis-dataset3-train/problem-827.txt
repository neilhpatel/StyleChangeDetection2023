You understand the difference though right? This will be remembered here forever, nationwide. It’s the front page of every state and national paper. It is a massive event, because it’s rare. 6 people get shot in America and it’s forgotten in a week when 9 people get shot somewhere else.
The hilarious part about this if I was i saw 6 killed and shooters and instantly assumed it was america and went eh.
In the five minutes it took me to type this, two more people died in the US due to gun violence, so it's clear who here has a problem.
If we're going to base this off of statistics, more people are killed by being beaten to death in the US every year than killed by firearms. 12k give or take.
I'm not sure you are aware there are 20,000 firearm laws in the United States as is and the number of gun deaths and violent altercations is lower than it was in the 90s during the height of an outright ban on pretty much any modern firearm.
Then there's trump zealots. Turned violent because of their borderline psychotic worship of that moron.
This does not include justifiable homicide, IE self defense. Even more, this does not differentiate between civilians and law enforcement related shootings, the higher end being law enforcement.
