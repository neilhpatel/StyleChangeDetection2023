Domestic terrorist Ashley Babbitt had every opportunity to not be shot by police. She disobeyed orders by law enforcement. If she’d complied, she’d probably still be a drain on society today.
Isn’t the whole GQP thing “just comply, then you have nothing to worry about” when it comes to cops?
This is the same as all the conversations about the police lately and their argument could be used against them. “If she had just complied with what the officers were saying (don’t break into the capitol), she wouldn’t have gotten shot”.
Likely only because they don't want to set a precedent that climbing through the broken glass of a locked door to the floor of Congress while government agents tell you to stop with weapons drawn is acceptable.
Same Republican congressperson: “if someone breaks windows and forces there way into a federal building and disobeys orders to stop, then they are a hero. The person paid to defend the building and the congresspersons within it should be put on trial if they shoot and kill this ‘hero’”.
Republican congressperson: “if a bad guy is on my property, then I’m allowed to shoot them dead. This is my castle!”.
