If a year and half goes by, and Biden is still refusing to return classified documents, lying about classified documents that the DOJ knows he has in his possession, and is having them moved to various locations in order to not return them.... Then yea, raid his house.....
Biden found some documents and his lawyers immediately turned him them over to the archives, this happened before the election but they didn't announce it for 2 years (after 6 flipping years having them in storage), which is really bad.
But the fact that he shouldn't have had them between those dates and apparently didn't intend to have them would certainly explain why they were promptly returned when discovered and why Biden then had a search conducted to identify if any further documents remained, and when that search did turn up other documents, promptly returned them.
Given how transparent Biden has been on this whole thing leads me to believe it was likely some clerical issue where an aide may have included marked info and since the archives didnâ€™t have records of anything missing nobody had reason to believe there was anything to return.
