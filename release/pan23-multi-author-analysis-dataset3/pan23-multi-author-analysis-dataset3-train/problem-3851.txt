Can't figure it out. The (a kind of intellectual rebel group involved in the establishment of a democratic republic) seemed very much to be saying "we're defined as Argentinians, regardless of where we came from before that". But then Juan B. Alberdi (who was in that group) sponsored that article of the constitution. His mother died in childbirth and his Spanish father (Basque, in fact) died when he was 12 (apparently from disgust at having to sign something to grant extraordinary powers to the dictator-governor at the time). So at a guess, it's because that guy idolized his daddy.
Though I suppose that strays from the original point, which is that there has been some amount on institutional racism in Argentina based around white European ancestry which this 19th-century guy Alberdi seemed excessively proud of.
Because Argentina is a very racist country where the president recently bragged that Argentina's forefathers came from Europe while Brazilians came from Africa?
I'm not saying there is no racism in Argentina but acting like Argentina is Apartheid South Africa is stupid.
Argentina is certainly more open-borders than the US or Europe, which either build walls or let migrants drown in the sea.
Argentina has an open borders policy, it's not that hard to immigrate here. And more importantly for the case, people born here acquire citizenship automatically.
