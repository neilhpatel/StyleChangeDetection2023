You are all very young and I am not sure you realize the gravity of becoming parents. It’s at minimum an 18 year commitment. They may say now that they would raise a baby not theirs but it sounds like you are all living in a fantasy world still.
And also, the parents of both these boys would be right to insist on DNA tests before allowing thier sons to sign on any birth certificates and commit to raising a child.
The best, least contentious action is to correctly populate the birth certificate with the name of the biological father of the child. This is an obligation the child has, by the way, not you: as mom, the truthful information about your child’s biological father is something you owe to your child, because your child has a legal right to support from both biological parents.
If you and your baby find yourself on hard times, the government will step in to help you, but they will seek recompense from the father. That’s not your debt; it’s his. You cannot disclaim it on behalf of your child, since it’s owed to your child, not you.
No, a child cannot have three legal parents. Who ever you put on the birth certificate has legal rights to the child as their father, custody rights, possible child support claims, etc. For everyone’s sake, you need to do a paternity test at the hospital. (You can push back the birth certificate a day or two.).
