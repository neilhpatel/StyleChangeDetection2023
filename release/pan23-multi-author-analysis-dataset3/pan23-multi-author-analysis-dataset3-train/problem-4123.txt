You will think "well ... that's still a free $1k, so why not?" You will dutifully get $4k from the bank and give it to the random "courier" who visits your house and you won't think anything else of it ...
And when you deposit it the teller will say "We need to wait for a few days to clear the funds" to which you will reply "sure ... let's wait.".
P.S. thank you for your lenhy response I appreciate your general concern and effort put into making a response.
I only have one creditor that is in collections but I haven't heard from them in like 6 months although I got a call from a boss that I had at a company I worked at 2 years ago also today and he said that their lawyer had received a letter stating that a passenger in a vehicle in a accident that I was involved in 2 years ago is trying to sue them and that I may have to give a statement to their lawyer do you think that could be related.
Well I'll be at work all day Friday so if someone does come by or tries to deliver anything I won't be home do you think this person will try to contact me again.
