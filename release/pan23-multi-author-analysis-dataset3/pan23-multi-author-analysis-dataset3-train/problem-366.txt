The irony of course is that people on the Dem side actually DO talk about those problems quite a bit. We're aware of them and we talk about them, and we discuss what could be done to bring jobs and cheaper medication to struggling small communities.
But at the very least, we need to tackle the problem of a minimum wage and what it's really supposed to mean -- that is, to take it back to what it was intended to do when it was first established. That was another important part of the American economic engine. And now we're at the point where we still struggle to get it raised to $15, when the time has long passed when $15/hr was a livable wage, either.
I would be satisfied if we merely taxed them at Reagan-era levels, nevermind Eisenhower-era levels! (But, you know -- apart from other factors, that taxation level on the wealthy was at least part of what drove U.S. growth in the post-war period through the 60s. It was always just a fiction to think that we could do away with that tax revenue and everything would just continue to work as it had up until then.).
Wow. I thought that MAYBE the clip of him talking about uprooting Medicare/SS was going to be kind of out of context or ambiguous. He really left nothing to the imagination. Unreal.
Unpossible. McConnell is like a shark in the ocean. I have a healthy respect for a strong murderer when itâ€™s in its environment.
