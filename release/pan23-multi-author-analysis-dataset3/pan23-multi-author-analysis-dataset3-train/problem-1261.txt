I see what you are saying, thanks! I guess my point is that with office hours I would have had a chance at least. Students struggle in every class, it’s to be expected and that’s why office hours are there in the first place. However, given that a student is struggling and needs help to pass, then there is NO chance that they will pass at all if they cannot get help. The professor has rigged them to fail.
In terms of the handbook, I took the correct steps they were just ignored. The professor violated his code of conduct beyond any doubt, so I don’t really know where to turn.
Title: My professor violated his code of conduct by refusing to hold office hours. My emails to his higher ups were ignored, and now my retroactive withdrawal request was denied. I have to pay to repeat the course which I could have passed with help. What do I do?
