You can't just throw a pillowcase over your head and say, "Look, I'm invisible," anymore. EVERYTHING eventually comes to light. REPUBLICANS are turning young people (and apparently older people) against their party with their actions, or lack thereof.
The younger Republicans are weirdos with seemingly mental disabilities. "I'm a neo-Nazis, Incel, that hates women and women rights. I also hate anyone that doesn't look like me. I also like taking bribes and doing the bidding of my corporate overlords.".
(This is a joke. The GOP are mask off facists and that is substantially more threatening to democracy.).
Good. McConnell and McCarthy were complicit. If either one had a spine January 6th would have NEVER happened.
>Representatives of those receiving the Congressional Gold Medal decline to shake hands with Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy during a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.
I applaud them for not shaking hands with McConnell and McCarthy Neither one of those trump ass kisser should have known not to be there, they and the rest who resisted to publicly denounce trump on January 6th And that py bag McCarthy is speaker of the house next year? He should automatically be disqualified for third in line to the presidency REALLY.
