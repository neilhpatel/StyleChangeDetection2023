Kind of. Yeah. It's been working out fine. Especially if it is religious. How can the government tell you to participate in something that you believe is a sin and has been stated so even before said government existed? And either way, it isn't discrimination when it is fundamentally different.
Dude. I don't care if people get married to the same sex. It doesn't affect me. You're the one who wants to FORCE people to participate in the act. Right now there is a supreme court case about a web designer who doesn't want to type up a website about a husband marrying a husband because he doesn't want to participate in something he disagrees with. Just leave him alone. If he says he doesn't want to participate in something he doesn't like then don't use the government to force him. That is authoritarian. Leave people alone.
How about you guys just leave people alone? Like, don't interfere with who marries who or what. If some pastors(who don't receive money from the government) don't want to marry a couple, then fine. If they want to, then also fine.
