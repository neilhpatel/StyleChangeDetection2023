It shouldn't take this to root out the dross. The problem is there always had been and always will be a percentage of people who use the job ad leverage for personal gain or offending of some kind, it about selecting the right people and early intervention when things go the wrong way. I'm sad to read your leaning thay way, what I would say is sometimes the press love a good story and it doesnt reflect the excellent work 99% of Police do on a daily basis, including bringing the likes of Wayne Cousins and others to account and justice. I do agree there must be change though.
That's not my point, unfortunately Policing had seen a real terms 25% pay cut in the past 20 years meaning private sector wages often far exceed that of constables with far less risk, more incentives and often more family friendly hours.
It depends on context, certainly their are flaws I won't disagree but the vast majority of Police forces seem to have a reasonable handle on it. Its important to still remember it's the good cops investigating the bad cops and you can't simply tarnish an entire sector on the basis of the actions of a few.
There should be more civil watchdog groups, that have the ability to look at records and audit problematic police departments.
