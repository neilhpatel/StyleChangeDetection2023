Do make sure you open an additional savings account or something and deposit your rent with a note stating what month rent its for when you transfer into it (you can still do this now for backrent if you haven't already). This shows that not only did you try and contact people but you also attempted to make payment and were storing payments in good faith.
Given what was stated by your attempts to make payment and lack of a name or address no one can argue bad faith on your part. There may be some bad faith on the condo agents behalf and ethical violations if not other crimes as well. You could report this to the real estate commission, specifically regarding 83.50.
Rules covering when you can withhold rent and defense of such if they go to evict for lack of rent. No requirement for escrow.
Florida has a duty for landlord to disclose their address or the address of an agent on their behalf.
Worst case, it may be a scam, but most scams don't have it listed through a MLS or however your agent saw it. Your agent and their broker should give you some protection.
