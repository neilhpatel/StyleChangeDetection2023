Welp, the shutdowns are supposed to begin tomorrow, as RR services begin to slow down in anticipation of the strike. If the Senate can't pass the days off, then it's just a Congress-supported insufficient offering the workers refused back in October.
I don't understand why Republicans filibustered this provision, thus forcing a 60 vote threshold, and then refused to vote to give people sick days.
Incorrect. The 7 days paid sick leave originated in the House on the 29th and passed with 221 votes with only 3 Republicans voting yes.
An amendment that would have added seven days of paid sick leave to the rail contract failed in a 52 to 43 vote.
Why not ammend the bill forcing the contract to have the sick days? Why even give republicans the chance to vote it down?
You know they gave republicans the chance to vote down the shitty portion while still looking like the good guys right?
You're pretending that Democrats are the only ones with agency here and that Republicans get a pass.

Republicans have been gaming and cheating the political system for a couple of decades now. They're a minority party that gets more representation than they are owed.
