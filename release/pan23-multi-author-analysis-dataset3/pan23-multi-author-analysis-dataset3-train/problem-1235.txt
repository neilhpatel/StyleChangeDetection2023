Afghanistan and Ireland were promoted to the exclusive club of Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2017. This level of membership allows for automatic qualification for certain global tournaments (this particular series was part of once such tournament) and for better access to financial income from the ICC.
As a requirement of Full Membership, each country must have a 'pathway' for women players. At the time, Afghanistan had some sort of pathway, even if it were just on paper or in its infancy. Under the current regime, even pretending to have that sort of program would be difficult. The controversy now arises from the ICC being reluctant to reassess Afghanistan's membership level in light of them not being able to meet the requirements of Full Membership.
However, all this has diddly squat to do with a decision made by a sporting body that is upholding the actual ICC requirements of full member countries.
Anyone except those that just want to hone in on the fact 25 Australians committed war crimes in Afghanistan, yet are strangely silent about the war crimes and human rights abuses of the Taliban.
True - you just pointed out a handful of the 25 million Australians that exist, committed war crimes and bemoaned how they attacked the Taliban in 2001, which 20 years later gave rise to....the Taliban.
It's a binary decision mate. You either agree with the decision made by Cricket Australia, or you don't.
Well if you think cricket Australia is responsible at least you think you're personally responsible as well.
