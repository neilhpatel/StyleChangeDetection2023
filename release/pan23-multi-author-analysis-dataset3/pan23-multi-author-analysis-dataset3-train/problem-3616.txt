Yes, please! The 50 plus years of embargo has accomplished nothing. The Cuban leadership still kowtows to the Russian and Chinese governments. Perhaps a change in US policy will improve the relations between Cuba and the US and make Cuba more amenable to a democratic government.
Cuba is an example of how the US isn't the "good guys" they are just a super power that looks after its own interests.
The point isn't "trade with the U.S", though that in and of itself is absolutely fatal as well for a caribbean nation. The point is that companies with assets in the U.S are severely restricted when it comes to the type of trade they can have with the island, which of course leads to more timid investment, higher prices, shortages, etc. And this also applies to a lot of international banks' behavior. Often it goes beyond what the embargo actually is "supposed" to do, and goes straight into fears that are based off U.S previous actions against companies, some of which had very little legal merit but went a long way in creating intimidation. Not to mention all the other """small""" restrictions the embargo imposes, like with ships' docking ability and so on, that forces certain types of companies to choose betweeen trade with the U.S and Cuba.
I am not insinuating, I am stating that it is the case. Companies with assets on the U.S are affected by the embargo in cuba, even if said companies are not outright based on the U.S.
This is the only restriction that could actually have any impact on non-US companies. For two weeks a ship that has entered Cuba is not supposed to enter the US. Though this has nothing to do with trade, it's about curbing illegal immigration. The US has taken in millions of Ciuban over the years. In reality though this is pretty meaningless because it's basically impossible to enforce against any shipping company.
