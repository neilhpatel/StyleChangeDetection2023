Also even if rates go up it's not that bad... Let's say you pay $3000 to fix the damages yourself. Alternatively, rates go up $500 for 6 years. It's the same thing.
Now the feds being self insured is fine. But let's say this is another private citizen. You guys agree not to rat each other out. Both parties have a bit of damage and agree to pay for your own damages. They turn around and call their insurance anyway. Now you paid for those repairs on the side AND your rates go up.
Rates have not gone up. We also had not had an accident or a ticket in the past 6 years, which we were told is a big reason.
Last year, my wife's car was hit by someone who was not paying attention while switching lanes. We filed through our insurance (progressive).
If you have collision coverage, start with your insurance company. They have a literal army of attorneys that you pay for. Do not sign any settlements until you're sure you're ok. If you don't get satisfaction from your insurance company (again, DO NOT sign any settlements yet), then start looking for your own PI attorney.
Not an insurance professional, but driving for a living for two decades means I've been around the block WRT to claims and shopping for coverage.
Because I don't want to go up against your professional expertise, but it's my understanding that comprehensive and collision are separate coverages on an auto policy, at least in my state (Minnesota). I've never had a comp claim raise my rates, and I've had numerous. Collision OTOH, yeah, it definitely goes up if the insurance company investigators decide to pin any blame on me. Otherwise, I've never experienced a rate increase for a not-at-fault collision.
