Let's also, for the sake of argument, consider the height-of-counterculture year to be 1969, the year of Woodstock, the year of the Stonewall riots, the year of the trial of the Chicago 8 (later 7 when Bobby Seale's case was severed).
Ah-ha you might say. That means the younger group is getting more conservative But the actual circumstances are more complex: quoting from written at the time:
I'm wondering if that also contributes to the perspective that generations around Boomers became more conservative with time?
I think you may be misunderstanding me - I'm not saying that Boomers were especially likely to vote for Reagan, or that conservatism is a peculiarly Boomer trait. The OP proposed a theory that the social base for Reaganite conservatism may have come from anti-establishment youth from the 60's who turned to the right. My answer intended to show (and I think does show) that this supposed conversion is unnecessary to explain the appeal of Reagan even to younger voters, since Reagan was able to win decisively as a conservative in the 60s, in the state most commonly associated with the 60's counterculture. I'm answering the second part of his question, about public perception of the 60s and the role of the loud counter-cultural minority.
None of this rejects the general point that the 1960s Counter Culture was a minority. But it was an influential minority, in that it left its mark on the era. These are two ways in which that minority did change their orientation, and went on to become influential in the different era of the 1980s.
