Seeing Lukashenko's name often reminds me of a brilliant scene early on in Servant of the People. Zelensky is practicing meeting foreign heads of state using body doubles, and immediately stands up each time to greet them. When the Lukashenko double walks in, Zelensky's advisor stops him saying something along the lines of "no no, there's no need to get up for him". Zelensky casually replies "of course".
It's probably not just Zelensky himself. I imagine that a lot of the politicians that would otherwise have fought one another politically now cooperate against the immediate common real enemy.
As it should be. It's a sign of good times when people can squabble over miniscule political advantages and produce boring news.
I wish Ukraine a boring future and nothing worse than a moderate corruption scandal on the news ASAP.
I think you're discounting just how much corruption existed in Ukraine prewar, not that it's all gone now. Since the outbreak of the war a lot of Russia's political pawns are gone, it'll be significantly easier for Zelensky to pull through with his promises in the new political climate.
He will still need to politically maneuver but the war has taken many obstacles out of the way. If he's as dedicated to rebuilding Ukraine as he is to protect it, it may be worth seeking another term to push for the best for Ukraine.
After the war it is probably best for both Zelensky and Ukraine if Zelensky holds his promise of not seeking additional terms. Let someone else hold the reigns of the nation after the conflict and Zelensky can be a symbol of unity for everyone, and keep the unity strong in a difficult post-war period.
I still think he would serve the nation best as a symbol of unity rather than a political actor who would have to politically fight for and against parts of the nation, its systems and its people.
