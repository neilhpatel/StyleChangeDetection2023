Who’s we? These will be a Eurofighter replacement, likely akin to the F-22, that won’t have a production line for a decade. It probably won’t be a mainstay aircraft, and all the partner nations already operate F-35. Japan just ordered like 40 more. Waiting 10 years to buy aircraft that barely exist right now instead of waiting an extra year or so for F-35 just isn’t what’s happening.
There is a reason the F-22 is so ahead of everything else and we still barely produce and use them. They are outdated in 2022.
I don't understand this. Yes, noone can compete in dogfights with the F-22 and we don't export the F-22, but noone is dogfighting with jets.
The F-22 is definitely considered a very good dog fighting jet. Where the hell are you getting your information from?
Are you thinking of the F-35? That is not a good dog fighting jet but it is far more stealthy and is designed for fighting targets well pit of visual range.
it also thins the line between stealth, strike and air superiority by stealthily directing SEAD from above.
they are stealthier, faster, involve a much more modern AR suite than the one used in the 5th, they are meant to be a information bus on the battlefield, connecting surveillance to troops and artillery and helping directing strikes, and each fighter is a "mother duck" to a flock of drones controlled by the pilot and AI.
