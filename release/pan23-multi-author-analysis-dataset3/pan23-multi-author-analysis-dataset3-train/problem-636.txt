Imagine actually believing what you wrote. The only way the situations would be comparable would be if the USA news media was constantly celebrating mass shooting as beautiful things and cheering on the shooters as heroes and directly encouraging viewers to go out and commit more mass shootings. I think you know that's not true.
I understand what you mean. They focus on identity politics to distract us from asking why a lot of us are broke within one of the wealthiest countries in the world. It's a fucked up con but I dont see it as all bad. It means the American elites have to at least think of a good sneaky strategy if they want to distract gullible Americans. China elites just have to tell their citizens to shut their fucking mouths.
The edge that countries like China have over the U.S. is that they have complete control over the media. So when something unethical happens within their country, they can cover that shit up and act like it never happened or play it off as if its not that big a deal.
How so? If our news media is supposed to make propaganda and make the U.S. look good, then somebody needs to be shot.
Americans don't know how to shut the fuck up so when something bad happens it's all over the media most of the time. In China snitches get stitches.
