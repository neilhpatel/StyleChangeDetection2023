American military instalations on Yalu river (radar stations, Signal Intelligence observatory stations, airfields, rockets launch sites etc.) makes nice chunk of PRC including Beijing at the risk as there is less less than 830km from capital of North Korea to Beijing.
There is other problem, PRC have some serious problem with North Korean illegal immigrants. If they annex North Korea they not only got a shitload of socio-economic problems but also massive refugee crisis AND Koreans not gonna accept they are part of China.
I don’t understand it because if n Korea falls and China assumes it’s territory it’s still effectively the same situation right?
Why does China care about the west, South Korea or the USA, sharing a border with China anyways? What does that potentially enable us to do that China is afraid of?
I get the feeling China doesn't actually like them though. China just needs them to exist in order to keep US troops off the Chinese border. Having to handle NK's leash is a huge burden for the Chinese government.
Remember a couple years back, when NK blew up their nuclear weapon test site? Collapsed the mountain it was under, released a bunch of radioactive debris. Didn't get a lot of news attention, partly because the radiation didn't hit SK, it went into China. And supposedly they were really upset about that. Notice how we don't hear much about NK testing nukes these days?
And since 2006 they’ve also had nukes. Likely not very many or very good ones but with nukes that’s not so much consolation.
