What blows my mind is July 1st on that calendar - a party which exactly matches Ford's description, yet which the GOP's questions presupposed did not exist. Weird how the GOP immediately pulled their special prosecutor once she started asking about it..
Exactly. She conducted herself like a good-faith professional and started acknowledging facts which weren't on-script for the GOP. Her basic honesty stood in stark contrast to the sneering disingenuous performance artists who rushed to boot her off stage.
If you remember, the GOP brought in a female outside prosecutor to lead the questioning. But when she started asking about July 1st, the GOP called an audible, pulled her, and discarded their entire pre-game strategy in favor of traditional grandstanding. Weird, eh?
Also it’s just weird. “I use a calendar, and I get very emotional about it because my dad also used a calendar. And as you can see, I have no mention of sexual assault on my calendar, so it couldn’t have happened.”.
He brought a calendar which he stated showed there wasn't a single weekday which matched the accusations thus he couldn't have raped anyone. He also claimed he couldn't drink on a weekday because he had work, then worked out with the guys so where could he possibly have time to drink...... like half the world doesn't do both of those then go out and drink.
Then the calendar he claimed showed there were no matching dates. A calendar only he knew about that he had as much time as he wanted to go over. The prosecutor found a matching date with the same people that both matched what the victim claimed and said on a weekday had brewskis with the boys and listed the names.
Every second of that hearing showed a man who was wholly unqualified to be any kind of judge and republicans did not give a shit because he hates the people they hate.
