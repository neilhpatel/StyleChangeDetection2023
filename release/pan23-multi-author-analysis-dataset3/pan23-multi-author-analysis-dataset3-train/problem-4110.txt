That not at all why healthcare isn’t a thing in the United States. The US spends enough on domestic health to have free healthcare, it’s just the funds are mismanaged and insurance companies make it worse at every turn.
That's actually a lot more comparable to why healthcare sucks in this country than "fund mismanagement". Someone on minimum wage can't afford to live because the cost of living is too damn high.
Yet for some reason its never a problem when they want to cut taxes or increase military spending. No, it's only an issue when we want to provide healthcare.
You’re saying from a patient side as to WHY it’s unaffordable. One doesn’t disprove the other. His wording is more correct as to why it’s foolish the government has nearly a half of its reps fighting against one payer.. they are mismanaging the 914bil/year towards wrongful expenditure.
You’re saying the same thing as the other guy from the patient view. He was talking about government expenditure view which is what the post is about. Government spends more on healthcare expenses than single payer would cost so it’s not a matter of the money not being there.
