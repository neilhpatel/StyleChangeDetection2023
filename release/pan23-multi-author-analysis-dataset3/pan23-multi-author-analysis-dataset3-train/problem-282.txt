There is no legal right to do so and not be disciplined. No one can force you to not make the call however. As for breaks:
>In Colorado, employees shall be entitled to an uninterrupted and duty-free meal period of at least a 30-minute duration when the shift exceeds five consecutive hours of work. Every employer shall authorize and permit a compensated 10-minute rest period for each 4 hours of work.
If you are being given your 30 minute break 10 hours into a 12 hour shift (as your post alleges), that is legal. If you are being given your 30 minute break 11.5 hours into a 12 hour shift (as you are now alleging), that is not, and you can also report that to the DoL.
You are also entitled to a ten minute break for every four hours you work. If you aren't receiving that, you can call the Department of Labor. I would leave out the part about not being allowed to call your daughter.
You can file a complaint with HR if you want, or go above your boss and complain above them, but I would absolutely not expect that to go anywhere and would likely just reflect very poorly on you.
Your employer has no legal obligation to allow you to make personal phone calls while at work. It's shitty, but totally legal to tell you that you can't call your daughter while on the clock and discipline you if you do.
states that you need to be given a 30 minute paid meal break anywhere between one hour after your shift starts and prior to one hour before your shift ends. Giving you a break at two hours before your shift ends appears perfectly legal.
