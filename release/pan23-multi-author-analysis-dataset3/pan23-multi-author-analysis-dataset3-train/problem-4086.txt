Too bad these people don't have the cohones to move there to support Russia's efforts. It's always boomers doing that shit, meanwhile, the generation they claim to be the laziest is heading to Ukraine in droves to fend off the evil Russia is imparting on civilians and soldiers alike.
These people are so anti west that to them, the "west" being right on the Ukraine situation is too much for their pride to bear, and they end up being just contrarians for the sake of it.
Absolutely. And it blows my mind because, modern Russia is just so hardcore far right. Which why at this point I just all tankies "fascists painted red".
He's anti west. That's it. There's a huge amount of people that are anti-western imperialism. Is that unreasonable on its own? No.
Not quite. Chomsky claims that the West has been provoking Russia to invade other countries and believes that Ukraine should make territorial concessions to Russia.
I saw an interview where he argued that Ukraine IS Russia and the only reason it’s it’s own country was the west trying to fuck over the USSR when it collapsed.
So from what I understand he sees 0 version of reality where Ukraine defending itself is anything other than some western new world order shit. Basically he’s what the word tankie was invented for. He’s also anti-Taiwan if I remember the interview correctly.
