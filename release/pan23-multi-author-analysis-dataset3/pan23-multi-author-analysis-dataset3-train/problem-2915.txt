I can’t help but see legislating restrictions on speech as a slippery slope. I know the “fighting words” bit, but it’s not a viable legal defense nowadays. I’d have a hard time agreeing to it myself, and I’m among those who don’t like where it’s at currently, BUT that’s because it’s aimed at the people who I think are “right.” The sad side effect of American politics today is “team” mentality, and it’s really tough not to buy into it. In “themmuns” eyes, I want everyone to get everything for free and nobody has to work and strippers are soliciting actual infants on the sidewalk. In “ussuns” eyes, I want people to appreciate their fellow countrymen and want them to succeed, and I believe each of us are deserving of a life worth living by virtue of being born here.
Maybe it’s just my inner American, because I’m not particularly happy I’m American, but I was raised in the rural USA.
Random story, my family used to have some (junk) land in the southern part of my state. I’d go down there on occasion to help clear brush or whatever and see the old landmarks from where I grew up [slowly being torn down and going out of business.].
Yeah. But should posting a racist meme be illegal? How racist should this meme be before the person should face jail time? What about everyone posting racist memes in r/terribleFacebookmemes ? Should they be jailed? Should Reddit shutdown because that sub exists? Should the CEO of Reddit be in jail because that sub exists?
