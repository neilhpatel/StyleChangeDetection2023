Also germany: Cost of living exploding over the last 10 years (especially housing). Wages stagnating.
All the while wages stagnate or technically decrease. 3% more wage to counter 7% inflation. With a 60k wage, I dont really get bothered by the increse all that much, but anyone with lower wages gets thorougly fucked.
Why not set minimum wage to 0 because people with hedgedonds worth millions they got from their parents don't really need any income?
Unfortunately the sheer greed that is present in most businesses is appalling but as long as the blame can be placed on the "lazy ungrateful workers" that don't want to work 50 hours for a 35 hour pay nothing will change.
I pay people way below market for a 40 hour week with flexible time and then give them so much work they are forced to do unpaid overtime every week while being treated like shit and nobody wants to work here.
If companies would care about having jobs that aren't actually based on giving way too much work out to the employees because having flexible hours means they can force their employees to work unpaid overtime and that are paid well employees would flock there.
It's funny how they cry over labor shortages and then whine over the BAG ruling that working times are mandatory to be tracked because "The employees oh so love that flexibility they have".
I think it is funny the talk about "unpaid overtime" that concept in the US is limited to "hourly" workers and trades. Salaried all work much more than 40/week in high performing roles just as expectation (though not all the Elon expectation of sleep at the office).
