Like, it's a little thing, but it's not a thing we see during red election years, it only happens in mass when Democrats win.
One of the things I look forward to when Democrats have a good election are the flood of stories about "First trans man elected to US state legislature," and "Maryland elects first Black governor," and "First Native American elected as mayor.".
It is what it is. I hope he is good too. If not, oh well. But itâ€™s a stepping stone for other trans men who may have been afraid to run for office.
I mean, sure, that's kind of a risk for any new elected official, trans or not. But I don't think you understand the importance of having marginalized communities represented in government is for those communities. Overall it's a good thing and we'll see what his voting record will look like, as with any other newcomer.
This isn't a conversation about his policies, I'm unfamiliar with them, anyways, so I can't comment on them. This is a conversation on the importance of marginalized communities being represented. Obviously, there can be elected officials acting against the interest of their constituents. But just the fact that this is the first trans representation in government on the federal level is a big deal towards acceptance and normalization of the trans community.
