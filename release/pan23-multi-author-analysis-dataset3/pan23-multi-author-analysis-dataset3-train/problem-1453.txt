While you are technically right, comparing these to Russia or even insinuating that the person you are replying to doesn't know that western nations sponsor terrorism just because he is commenting on this specific ruling just comes off as whataboutism.
Not really, it's a valid term. It's a way of distinguishing a digital perspective. Like if you would reply to someone commenting about a heist of fort knox and say but this convenient store thief is also a criminal. I completely agree with your points but trying to equivalate two crimes that differ completely in severity just to deflect off of the instance in question is whataboutism. And what do we think will happen? Well the court will not rule UK/US ships as terrorist affiliated, right? So no, they will not be able to block any ship, and yes, this is arbitrary, but the line in the sand is drawn and one is above, the other is below.
I'm simply responding as to why you might have been downvoted. I see the similarity, but I do disagree with the equivalence. Therefore I believe the hypothetical can be distinguished from the situation at hand. Take that how you will. For the record I did not downvote you.
Edit: instead of downvoting, would anyone care to explain what I’ve got wrong here? Isn’t the legal system based on precedent?
Doesn’t that kind of set a precedent for them to stop a lot of things that are going on around the world though? Seems like it could turn into a grey area.
Well extraordinary rendition and torture would be considered terrorism, which would make our countries (USA and UK) terrorist states too. So by that precedent, anyone can blockade any US or UK cargo ship and this judge would rule that it’s ok?
Why was the ship allowed in the first place and not stopped by UK's law enforcement if the terrorism stance is valid? Doesn't the government lack of action make it an enabler of the said terrorism too?
