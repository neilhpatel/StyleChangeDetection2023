These institutional features answer your question, at least in part. wrote a paper in 2010 that explored this:
In a parliamentary system, if you were an aspiring head of government, you'd run as an individual in the specific district you represent in the parliament, but becoming head of government (prime minister, in most cases) depends on how you've risen within your party and whether your party gets a majority of seats in parliament. Even more important, your role as head of government could be secured in a parliamentary system even if your party got a relatively low plurality of the popular vote or a low plurality of seats (which of these matters more would depend on the type of electoral system, but that's for another post), since you could always form a coalition with other parties in order to govern.
That sort of follows from their point about leadership traits and gender. It's possible that, even though parliamentary systems may be more favorable to traditionally feminine leadership styles, prominent female heads of government still adopt traditionally masculine leadership styles, which might also contribute to overcoming gender bias in the population.
If these early women politicians showed up as the first elected representative of the congressional district with Berkeley University or some prominent women's college as a major employer, then that would make sense, but the first two women governors showing up in rural, socially conservative regions? That needed more interpreting, and here it is in the answer to a different question(!).
. This book is a great overview of the role of gender stereotypes in elections campagins, I found it quite interesting.
While I concede that there is the possibility being a woman may help, rather than hinder, election chances. It seems incredibly unlikely that gender has no impact (i.e. that the number of votes lost - the number of votes gained = 0).
