"The legislation, which was approved by the House on Wednesday, enacts new contracts providing railroad workers with 24% pay increases over five years from 2020 through 2024, immediate payouts averaging $11,000 upon ratification and an extra paid day off.
Also, it isn't really being highlighted, but the resolution that Congress just voted on gives the largest wage increase to railworkers in \50 years, increased their health coverage, added a day of PTO, and three days to schedule medical care. So while they still need that sick time, they did get some of the things they were fighting for right now, and can still keep fighting for sick time. On top of that, unions across the country now have even more evidence that they need to vote against Republicans across the country.
The article in this post is claiming that they will use this vote now to campaign against the Senators that voted against sick leave (Manchin was the only Democrat).
According to the article it seems like democrats have all but one congress person (manchin) vote in favor of the unions for sick leave. All republicans other than 6 congress people voted no. While yes, they overall donâ€™t care for us so much, we can see based on voting trends of elected officials that one does more than the other.
I doubt he didn't either but, as a voter, it is practically the same. I'm genuinely glad to have a leader who cares about other people again but if you ain't working for us stop wasting our time and get out, we'll buy you a beer if we run into you.
