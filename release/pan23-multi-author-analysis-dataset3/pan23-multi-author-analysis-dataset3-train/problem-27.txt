You can opt to say, "There are no unauthorized tenants here," and leave it at that, or go into more detail and, potentially, risk your unit being scrutinized more heavily for lease violations, including unauthorized tenants.
Violating your lease (which, if you're all on the same lease together, would include any violations committed by any other roommates/leaseholders as well).
If your roommate is fine with subsiding your boyfriend's use of utilities she pays a share for that's cool, but you also have another roommate who doesn't and a a landlord who might not like knowing there's 4 people staying at an apartment he lowered the price on. If he starts thinking, "I should be getting paid full price, for this place." he might try to pursue that.
That's more hours than you're required to work a full time job in a week. That's going to start delving into the territory of him being an occupant and not a guest. There's not going to be a hard and fast rule on this but if it's starting look at your apartment is his primary residence, it could cause some issues.
