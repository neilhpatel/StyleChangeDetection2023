Unfortunately, I think your best bet it going after the inspector. Laws vary per state, but where I live a home sale is as-is and is difficult to prove intentional negligence. The big issue with going after the inspector however is they usually are not liable for much, per their contract. It could be difficult getting anything more back than what you paid the Inspector. I would talk to a lawyer to see if it’s worth moving forward with a lawsuit.
That said, I would recommend having a conversation with a RE lawyer to get their take. IMO, it’s poor workmanship, but likely not negligent.
I’m really sorry to hear about your issues. Unfortunately, there are a lot of flippers out there that focus only on the lipstick and don’t fix what really needs to be fixed first, especially in an older home.
Typically, going after the flipper is an uphill battle. You need to be able to prove that they were intentionally negligent in the updates and that they took efforts to hide the defects. As you can guess, it’s hard to prove. Plus, if it’s an LLC which you’re suing, it will likely end up going bankrupt soon enough and now you’re spending money to win a suit you’ll never collect any money from.
