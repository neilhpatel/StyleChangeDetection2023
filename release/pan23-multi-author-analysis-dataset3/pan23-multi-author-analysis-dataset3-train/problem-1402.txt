In addition to the answers r/Holy_Shit_HeckHounds linked to I want to mention that different people kept time in different ways. Today most of humanity has agreed in one standard, but that wasn't the case back then.
The Romans used to count years since the foundation of Rome using the Julian Calendar. This is the system the Catholic Church later adapted and became the standard we use today.
Long story short. Most civilizations had calendars to keep track of time within a year and a few of them used to count years from one important event but must of them just used their rulers.
The answer is that in the Roman province of Syria during Jesus' time the standard practice was to refer to years by the regnal year of the Roman emperor.
When did this practice of referring to years by the reginal year of the Roman emperor stop? And why did we start using Jesus as a reference point for counting years?
I take it you mean the church adapted the Julian calendar, rather than the Roman year count. The Roman year count is the ahistorical bit here: it's very nearly fictional. The 'AUC' count is essentially a modern fad, not an ancient practice. Scarcely anyone ever used it in antiquity.
