I sat down with the graduate chair and asked her, and she cited the oldest member of the department who had “seen it all”, and he believes that things will swing back, and it’s like, how are you all so out of touch?
This is off topic, but I think the problem with history enrollments is a combination of two things. The former being less important. First, I think professors need to start giving students what they want. It was like pulling teeth to get professors at my old institution to teach a world war 2 class, because nobody researches it, and academics.
High school history teaching is more like being any other type of high school teacher than being a historian, IMO. As in, you’ll be spending at least as much of your time on dealing with parents, discipline, and basic stuff like how to prepare for exams or organize notebooks as you will on history - and that’s more or less just recital of facts and not research. If you like history as a topic and could see yourself teaching, it can be great, but it’s a far crumy from being a professional historian.
Im also completely fine teaching core US history as well, but if everything was to work out in a “fairy tale” world, id like to focus on oppression and the behavior of the oppressed.
I'm late seeing this but, if you want to still teach history at a higher level than you would in a US high school on average, but you feel this way about grad school... Look into getting a masters in curriculum and instruction, then teaching history internationally. Its certainly competitive but it is not nearly as draining and demanding as getting a PhD. PM me if you like. Can tell you more!
