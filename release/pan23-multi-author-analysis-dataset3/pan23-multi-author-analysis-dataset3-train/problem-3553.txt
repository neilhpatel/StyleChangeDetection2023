My point is there was no "ticket splitting", and you used this race as an example and compared it to a hypothetical future where Trump runs as a third party (at least I assume that's what you meant by saying Trump would "split the ticket").
I think you fundamentally misunderstand how ranked choice works. The final round of voting was just between Peltola and Palin, no other candidates, and Peltola won.
Also, from , “In the end, Peltola took just under 55% of the vote. Palin got just over 45%. Palin got a boost once fellow Republican Nick Begich III, who finished third, was eliminated and his 64,392 ballots redistributed during ranked choice tabulation. Nearly two-thirds of his voters chose Palin as their second choice, but 21% didn’t make a second choice – and nearly 12% went for Peltola, who won the two-year term.”.
To an extent, yes. It’s not easy to precisely predict how the vote would have gone without RCV, though. Palin still got close to 2/3 of the RCV voting after the first round, so when faced with an ultimatum of R or D, there’s a chance Palin could have won without RCV, although Peltola is incredibly popular for a D in Alaska.
RCV changes how people decide to vote. With RCV, you don’t have to sacrifice a vote for your preferred candidate like you do with first-to-the-post. There’s a chance Palin could have won without RCV, but given the popularity of Peltola, based on 1st round votes, it would only be a chance and not a sure thing.
Without RCV Palin would’ve lost by even more in all likelihood, since Begich would run a third party race. Look at the 2010 senate match.
