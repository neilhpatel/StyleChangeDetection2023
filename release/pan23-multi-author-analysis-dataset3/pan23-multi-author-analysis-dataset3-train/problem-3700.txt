In 1968, the Soviets began the invasion of Czechoslovakia by seizing the international airport in Prague and then using it to land airborne forces. Last year, the Russians tried similar moves outside of Kyiv, and now we hear rumors that maybe theyâ€™ve got plans along the same lines for Moldova.
Look at a map of Moldova and tell me how Russia is going to get there. How Russia would get any supplies or ammo there.
Exactly. I don't understand how people don't get this. Russia can't get to Moldova. They can't send supplies. I mean, at least the 7000 Moldovan troops can be resupplied with ammo. Russian forces there are effectively already encircled. Russia can't even fly fighter jets over Ukraine, let alone cargo planes.
As it currently stands Russia would have to fly over hostile airspace to get transports into Moldova. (Romania or Ukraine) I am guessing the air defenses that deep into Ukraine are quite substantial and again, as it stands, a currently insurmountable obstacle to a full invasion.
Massive air support can perhaps do that, but Russia has demonstrated to be unable to suppress Ukraine air defenses, which means they would take high losses, with no guarantee of hitting every antiship missile unit.. those are trucks that can be easily hidden.
