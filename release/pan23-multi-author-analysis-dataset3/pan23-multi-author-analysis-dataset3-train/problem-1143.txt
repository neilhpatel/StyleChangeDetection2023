Terrific post, really helps contextualize where these extremists are coming from. I wonder if at some point FoxNews will have to go even harder right to maintain mindshare.
I want to pause for a second and explain how insanely toxic Fox News is to its viewers. This isn't "right leaning" the way MSNBC leans left. Almost every single detail is propagandized. The graphics, the color scheme, the music... all specifically chosen... when a white Christian conservative is on; the color scheme will literally change to calming whites and blues, with the US flag likely making an appearance. The sound is lower, the speech is slower and softer. When a leftist, Democrat, immigrant, minority, BLM etc. clip is playing the color scheme is red, black, the sound changes. Lastly, and most importantly, some portion of every single day is spent painting Democrats as dangerous lunatics bent on destroying the country. Random Tuesday in 1997 with absolutely nothing to report on? Let's find a 'wacko' college professor who is poisoning America's youth with communism. It has been 9628 days of nonstop rage. If you truly believed what you were watching...why WOULDN'T you hate Democrats and try to stop them no matter what it takes.
My Theory: The GOP shot their wad with Fox News and now they are paying the price. For the few folks on Reddit that don't know; Fox News was the brainchild of Roger Ailes who was in the Nixon White House during Watergate and felt Nixon could have survived if there was a right wing 'news' outlet that could get their narrative out, and (quote) 'do the viewer's thinking for them'..
And most importantly, they vote. More so than any 'youth' voting bloc before them. Young voters are pissed and engaged. .
