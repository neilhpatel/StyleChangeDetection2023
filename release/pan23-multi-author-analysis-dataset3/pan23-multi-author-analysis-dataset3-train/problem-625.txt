I agree that some people use those out of context to direct hate but that's not really the argument I am making here. If you look throughout muslim history you'll find the jews living in peace within Muslim lands. After the spanish took back Andalucia they were being persecuted by Christians and were given refuge by the Islamic caliphate. The crusaders did the same and the Jews took protection from Muslims. The notion that islam hates Jews and wants them killed is a comeplete lie made by people of no knowledge.
Again, Israel has always been hated by people. Speak to any Jews and harassment for being pro Israel has been normal on college campuses for 40 years at this point.
For now. Once the relationship becomes serious, the Saudis will have no choice but to encourage internal good will towards Israel. It will be a painful process for a while, but the Quran literally has entire sections of it that are pro Jewish (and other parts that call for their death), so the Saudis can force their clerics to focus on the pro Jewish part of the Quran.
And if you look through Islamic history you'll find numerous instances of Muslims murdering and otherwise persecuting Jews; the yellow star on clothing to mark Jews? Originally an "inovation" from "Muslim lands".
