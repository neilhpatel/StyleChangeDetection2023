Japan's military falling apart or something or surrendering outside the political arena would be part of subjugation, but US occupation of Japan was short term and a pro-American government was quickly created, establishing warm relations and peace.
Japan chose a diplomatic solution to the war, which is to say, acceding to U.S. demands for military control of the Pacific and establishing democratic institutions.
Japan surrendered on the condition of sparing the Emperor among other things, the US wasn't even sure the peace was going to hold until nearly the formal surrender in Tokyo Bay.
Please note especially the part at the start where Japan unconditionally surrenders and also the part at the bottom where they surrender the emperor and his government to whatever MacArthur deems fit.
Japan did not end with a true unconditional surrender, they redefined it in 1945 to give them a way out so they didnâ€™t fight to the absolute end like Germany did.
Italy negotiated a surrender between General Eisenhower and General Badogilo that resulted in the Armistice Cassibile and was signed by the signed by the King of Italy and resulted in the eventual entry of the Italian Navy on the allied side among other things.
