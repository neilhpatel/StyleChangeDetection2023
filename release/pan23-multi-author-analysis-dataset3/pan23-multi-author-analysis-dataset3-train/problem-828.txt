Did he milk the opportunity when it arose? Hell yeah, but he just got ”lucky”. We’ll see if it wins him the election or not.
The only way Sweden got played here is if Erdogan set things up for our NATO application and I think that’s very unlikely, don’t you?
I suspect that the Swedish far-right's decision to burn the Quran had a lot to do with infuriating the Turks in order to undermine Sweden's NATO bid.
Let's be clear: Turkey is using the Quran burning as a cynical excuse to block Sweden's NATO bid, mostly because Sweden wouldn't play ball with Erdogan's effort to get Sweden to hand over Turkish political dissidents in Sweden.
And if they were interested in supporting that, giving Sweden a bunch of demands that would inevitably worsen public opinion of Turkey was a pretty stupid way to go about it.
So reading into this, the Turks are mad because people in Sweden are allowed to freely protest, and these particular protests were ones Turkey didn't agree with.
It wasn't something the Swedish government did, but people just doing things they're allowed to do in a free country.
