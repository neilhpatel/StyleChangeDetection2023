"Well this group that does a ton of good and has the best interest of the people much higher than the other who is trying to literally install fascism, didn't do this one thing that personally impacted me. Guess they're both just as awful.".
Idk. Biden seems to have some political instincts. Perhaps he felt it was easier to justify this key reform to a relatively foolish American public who still fearfully conflate the socialist boogeyman with basic healthcare rights.
What is your advice? In the 10-50 years before Democrats gain a supermajority and Senate capable of nationalizing healthcare, should we just do nothing? "Do nothing" doesn't help the poor. And frankly probably won't help the Democrats gain the votes they need to get a supermajority.
And there was no way for democrats to over rule it? The republicans are amazing at shoving through whatever they want… democrats intentionally don’t do anything then cry about it later.
Their voters will just assume that the bill had pork, or whine that they'd like to vote for a representative who actually looks after them but those evil corrupt perverted Democrats force their hands.
Republican Voters: "Our representatives voted no because that bill had too much pork (glaring absence of pork gets ignored) Once we regain control they'll pass a simple bill without pork".
