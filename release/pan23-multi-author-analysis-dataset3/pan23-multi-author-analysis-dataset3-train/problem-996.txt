There isn’t a will but he did sign a letter stating the stepdaughter as the executor of estate but I’m not sure if that’s helpful. We are in Maryland.
I’m his wife. Just to provide some additional information, the aunt with the POA was his step daughter and he also signed a letter making her the executor of his estate. The biological daughter no one ever knew about until two months before he died, that’s when she showed up and after he died, she opened a probate case stating there are no other living relatives (there are) and that she is the next of kin. The aunt has been told by a lawyer that the other daughter needs to prove that he was her father and told the aunt that she can use the letter that he signed in front of witnesses that he gave her POA and made her executor of his estate. Sorry for the confusion!
She was the executor of his estate and has been paying off his bills but she never opened a case. She does have a letter that he signed making her the executor of his estate but I don’t know if that helps.
If he had no will (was intestate), any letter saying that his stepdaughter is executor of the estate, or stating any wishes about who his heirs are, has no legal meaning. If the letter states that it is his will and if it was signed in the presence of two witnesses who also signed it, well, then you have a will you can move forward with.
Thank you I have no idea if the letter states that this is his will, but he did have two witness who signed it as well (it was done in his hospital room). She is speaking with a lawyer at the moment and right now they are talking about having the bio daughter prove that he’s her father as a first step if they decide to fight back in court. Thank you for your advice I will let her know.
