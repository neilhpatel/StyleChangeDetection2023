Money in joint bank accounts is owned in whole by both parties simultaneously. In most cases, it's a race to the bank and the first person to withdraw it gets it. You should consider opening a bank account in your own name at a different bank or credit union, so your money is safe.
I already have a plan in place to start a new bank account at a different bank, but how can I prevent him from seeing that I withdrew all the money from my old account? He will definitely have a meltdown after that. He gets mailed statements just like I do every month, but does not have the login credentials to get into my account online (I changed it). Is there a way to edit that on my current bank's website? (that account is with Chase for reference).
Thank you so much for the reply, this is really helpful. I am definitely planning on opening a new bank account at a completely different branch, I have a bank and the type of account picked out and I am going there day after tomorrow to set it up (starting a new job soon & need a new account for that anyways).
Immediately (like right after you read this) open a new bank account in your name only at a DIFFERENT bank (not a different branch of the same bank, a completely different bank). This is important because there are many stories of new accounts being opened at the same bank and the bank automatically giving access to the other account holder as well.
