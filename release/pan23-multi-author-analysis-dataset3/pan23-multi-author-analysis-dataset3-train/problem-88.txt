I think my only big concern is when the batteries start to go. The LLVs can and have been maintained forever. But right now those battery banks are expensive. So when it comes to set the budget for maintenance, who is going to be in charge to make that call?
Well if gas prices keep increasing at this rate, you might be right. I'm honestly looking at an EV myself, they are just prohibitively expensive right now. That and I need to get my ancient garage wired up. I currently have just one 15A outlet.
I'm sure they will get more cost effective over time. Just more worried about political meddling by oil paid politicians. Right now they can at least make a compelling argument.
Right but that’s not a reason to have it. The United State Postal System is a corporation wholly-owned by the US Government. Is should be made as efficient as we can make it. And junk mail is horribly wasteful. Should the day come that we no longer need it (and I can’t see that day coming in my lifetime) then we should do away with it.
The postal system is horribly inefficient. Most of what they are delivering is junk mail. If we could just get rid of the junk mail, the postal system could be half its size.
Removing junk mail, while maybe good for you & the environment, is just a loss of revenue to the USPS.
Having lost First Class Mail in 2008, the USPS was dependent on Junk Mail post 2008 Recession. Once Junk Mail tanked in 2008 it was time for a new plan.
If we could simply get rid of all the junk mail that would be a huge step. I don’t know about you but 90% of my mail is junk.
