Get IDs required then reduce hours and services at minority area DMVs as part of "budget cuts' and reduce polling stations in minority areas.
I have no problem with Voter ID, but in NC and other states Republicans have already shown their plan for that.
It's also a stretch that the founding fathers who were very concerned about check and balances, and went into great detail in the federalist paper, would have intended to allow a portion of government to carte blanche overrule elections and operate without any checks or balances.
ISL essentially says that State Constitutions can not limit their legislatures; hopefully you can see the problems with that.
As for ISL, it's nit picking a word 'legislature' to refer to a single portion of a state government in that one section when in other areas it refers to the whole of the state government. A great parallel is in the 1st amendment where only 'Congress' is mentioned but it applies to entire federal government in preventing it from punishing you for your religion, speech, press, etc.
It's a BS theory made up to justify a naked power grab when a political party started losing popular elections.
similar to the way there is no reversal of a rigged presidential election where big tech the fbi and the democrat party have colluded and interfered. Treason be damned.
