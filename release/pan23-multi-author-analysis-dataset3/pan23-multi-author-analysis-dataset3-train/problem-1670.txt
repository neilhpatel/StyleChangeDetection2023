I tried to, for a year. They are all useles, can't even diagnose, all psychiatrist can do is prescribe a single ad and say that he can't help if it not working, and all psychotheurapist can do is suggest praying to the god.
Should have. Also, should have been more than one unit. But, sadly, this war is too valuable for various military complexes to test weapons (and maybe also launder some money in the process), so they will be really careful to not end it anytime soon.
It was scary in first months, when you can't sleep, hearing sirens, and not being sure if it's loud military cars or explosions, if it's allied plane or the enemy one. But it's not anymore. If rockets won't kill me, diseases or poverty will. Does not matter. So do not worry much, because i certainly do not.
I don't think it is sad. It seems kind of reasonable to take that stance. It is one thing to start WWIII with a nuclear power because Russia is going kamikaze against NATO. It seems foolish to start MAD nuclear armageddon over an accident like a missile going off course.
One thing I worry about nukes is "limited yeild" nukes, which the Obama administration got into, including variable output nukes. Of course, putin followed.
