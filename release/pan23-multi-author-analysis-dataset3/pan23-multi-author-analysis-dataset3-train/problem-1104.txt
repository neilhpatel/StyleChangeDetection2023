Would Russia believe independent black hat hackers are capable of a cyber attack causing physical damage? Probably not, and if so what does Russia have the capability to do as a response? Regardless of that answer there's a reason nobody is rushing to set these precedents.
Edit: These are things to think about moving forward, and not that relevant to this story. With Gerasimov now in control we could see more asymmetric warfare(such as cyber attacks) against Ukraine and its allies. There are many unanswered questions about what constitutes an act of war in this domain.
Russia could look to take more action in all of these gray areas including cyber attacks, 2024 elections in many countries, acts of terror outside Ukraine etc.
Ooh, these hackers are stepping into the war now, with a cyber-attack against a country specifically due to that country's involvement with defending Ukraine?
They have been attacking western infrastructure for years and have got away unpunished and now they get all whiny when NATO countries side with Ukraine? Wow, just wow. That regime can't come to an end soon enough.
