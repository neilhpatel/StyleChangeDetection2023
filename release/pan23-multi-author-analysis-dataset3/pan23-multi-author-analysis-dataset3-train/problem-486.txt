That's what I'm wondering, too. As of last night, the Ukrainian MOD was claiming that there were still somewhere around 10k Russian troops on the west bank of the river.
Crossing the river will require alot of Ukrainian forces to even attempt such a move, and then they run into the same supply issues as the Russians faced.
If the Russians bomb the water infrastructure in Kherson or blow up the dam, they make it much harder to hold onto Crimea.
I suspect the Russians left booby traps all over the city, but they won't use haphazard bombing or artillery for fear of wrecking the waterworks or the pipes.
Is anyone else worried that Russia's left either a dirty bomb (which they'll blame on Ukraine) or an actual nuke to blow away a big chunk of Ukraine's army?
At this point it's a war of attrition, the more Ukrainian troops and weapons Russia manages to destroy the the better for them. There's a limit to how much weapons and manpower Ukraine can lose before civil unrest, or economic collapse.
You clearly don't understand the military situation on the ground. War is all about supply lines, and Kherson was completely cut off from the Russians supply lines. They had been ferrying weapons across the river with pontoon rafts, but nowhere near enough supply's to support the forces they needed to hold the region.
