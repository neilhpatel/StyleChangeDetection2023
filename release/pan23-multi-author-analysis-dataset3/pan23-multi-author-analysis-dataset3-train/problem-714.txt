Your attorney was correct in asking that they validate the debt first. That’s always the first step.
As for the the jury trial, he took a shot at refilling hoping they wouldn’t do it, but failed. Honestly, it was probably your best shot at avoiding paying the full amount. Once they’ve taken you to court, you lose a lot of leverage on trying to negotiate.
Final advice, listen to your attorney. Everything you’ve explained is completely normal. If you want to avoid court, you’ll more than likely have to pay the full amount that you owe.
Well, I still doubt that the court is going to impanel a jury over a $1200 debt. Have you received anything that shows that there is a case filed in Superior Court or just the collection agency telling you that?
The main thing is to not agree that you owe the money. Do not admit there was ever a debt. Just say that you don't owe anything and they need to prove it.
Also, if this is only for about $1200, then you aren't looking at some high powered lawyers showing up, more likely just one of their staff. Again, they have to prove that you owe the money and that the time to sue has not expired. The worst that happens is the judge finds for them and you have to pay the $1200. And you can ask the judge to agree to a payment plan if you can't come up with it all at once based on income and expenses.
