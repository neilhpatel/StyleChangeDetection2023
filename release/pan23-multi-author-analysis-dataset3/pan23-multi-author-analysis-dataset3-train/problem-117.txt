If you give them a letter from a therapist they can call to verify the letter is real and that the contents are correct. They won't be able to get more information but no law prevents then from making sure the letter is valid and real.
"If you have any concerns about the validity of the letter, you should NOT contact the mental health professional directly. This could be considered a violation of the patient’s right to privacy.".
"A proper ESA letter will be on a letterhead, with contact information such as phone number and email, along with the therapist’s license number. A landlord cannot ask the doctor anything directly, but you can verify the license number through any state portal.".
Hi thank you for your answer, could you provide any resources that specifically state that? I seem to only see that the landlord, under no circumstances, should contact the therapist.
flipping through the guidelines here: I see a lot of information on what the landlord may ask about, but nothing that says "under no circumstances can the landlord contact the medical provider". In fact, this document recommends that the medical provider provide their contact information.
