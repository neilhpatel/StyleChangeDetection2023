A weaker currency is not necessarily a bad thing - the use of the terms weaker and stronger gives an incorrect impression - weaker does not mean worse, stronger does not mean better.
The Swiss franc is an international reserve currency along with USD, Euro, Yen and GBP. It turbulent times it is seen as a safe currency and so as money flows out of other reserve currencies and into Swiss francs, itâ€™s relative value has gone up, irrespective of their economy. That makes imports super cheap and their exports super expensive, which is very bad for their balance of trade and their economy overall.
The strong franc makes problems of course, especially in the economy that is focused on exports. But it has also positive effects, like when you import resources and goods, you pay less because of the strong currency.
As a Swiss, i can assure you, this would not even be an option if we had joined the EWG in the 90's, that lead to the EU of today. The Swiss Franc as currency was never in debate, nobody would be okay with abandoning the own currency for the Euro.
They are trying to devalue the Swiss Franc because everyone is buying it as it has one of the lowest inflation rates for a stable currency.
Switzerland exports quite a bit of tech products and if the Swiss Franc doesn't devalue like the rest of the currencies, people stop buying swiss Products.
They didn't literally lose 143bn, it's their assets, like foreign currency, that keeps losing value vs the Swiss franc. It's only lost, if they would sell those currencies off for Swiss Francs right now, which pretty sure they won't...
