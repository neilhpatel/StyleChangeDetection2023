Do you have access to the account and is it only your money in it? If you do, remove all your money from it immediately. If your name is on it, but you don’t have access, contact the bank that has the money and either freeze it or make a separate account and transfer the balance. It’s better to have an account at a different institution, but if the money is still there, speed is more important and you can transfer it again later on once the money is safe.
If you have access to an ATM, and cannot open a separate account, find out when the bank says the money posts, and be on standby every day until it does. Immediately withdraw it.
If the money hasn’t been deposited yet, open a separate account at the bank with only your name, link them, check every morning when your bank says transactions post, and transfer all the money out of the joint account and into your own.
You might also consider getting another bank account, at a different bank (maybe even one without a branch where she is) and get future checks you expect deposited there instead (paychecks, tax refund, future stimulus checks, etc). For that matter, consider looking into if you can redirect the survivor benefits (or whatever you're getting that goes into that shared account).
There's also something you can do that might help you avoid this becoming a legal-advice-needed situation in the future, which should save you some headaches.
