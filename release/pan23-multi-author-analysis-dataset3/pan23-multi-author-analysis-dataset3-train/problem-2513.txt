For the record: the famine had less to go either the shortcomings of socialist economics than it did with Stalin stamping out resistance. Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the Urals had been hotbeds of support for the White Army during the Russian civil war and subsequently were hit the hardest by Stalin’s policies. Same for Stalin’s repression of the Orthodox Church, the churches he forcibly shut down and either demolished or turned into storage houses had been vocal critics of the Bolsheviks, it was about tightening his grip on power not atheism.
>Some try to rescue the argument by admitting that Soviet ideology did have atheism as a central tenet and people were oppressed and killed as a result. But they say that a fanatical application of any ideology is irrational and so counter to the (assumed) inherent rationality of atheism, so these were not really atheists by merit of their murderous fanaticism. This is a classic “No True Scotsman” Fallacy – it does not cut much ice when Christians try to claim Crusaders or Conquistadors were “not really Christians” when they killed in the name of Christ and it is equally weak here.
