3) I'm going to do something weird and END my explanation with some backdrop and further examples once we have established the basics.
There are going to be three parts to my answer here, focusing mainly on the French-German distinction of early Nationalism.
"Germany for the Germans" was a true ethnic question that largely formed in response to the French.
"France for the French" as you put it was first, though "the French" was a constructed identity at the time.
You have two type of nationalisms, one civic(Anglo-American and French) and one ethnic (German and French).
For much of the early 19th century, Civic(French) and Ethnic(German) nationalism vied for primacy in the ideological sphere. Best exemplified in the Ottoman Empire which had big conflicts between "Turkish Nationalists" who wanted Turkey to just be Turkey and didn't care if all the other parts of the Ottomans left, and "Ottoman Nationalists" who wanted to create a new Ottoman identity like the French had done. This is a good an intuitive example because the Ethnic Nationalists won, but not immediately so we can show off the distinctions.
