And, anyone arrested and charged by these thugs should have easy appeals/defenses. Which can be good or bad, because any legitimate arrests they may have are also in question.
If he really did reach for a cop's gun, that may be seen as a justification. But did that happen? I've not heard it. That's what I mean when I say I want the other side of the story. The defendants have made no statements that I've heard.
If that was ever true, it hasn't been for years. Just ask Kim Potter. Or Amber Guyger. Or Derek Chauvin. If they're not currently in solitary, I mean.
Well that's what I mean. If some or all made a conscious decision to leave the camera on, did they believe they were doing nothing wrong? If so, why?
I know how it looks. But there are at least 2 sides to every story and we have heard only one. I am interested in what the defense says at trial.
I could give two fucking shits what the defense says at trial. Those cops abused their power of authority and violated a dudes civil rights. Itâ€™s crystal fucking clear as day.
