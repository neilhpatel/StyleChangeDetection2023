Mr. McCarthy has vowed not to back down until he secures the post, raising the prospect of a grueling stretch of votes that could go on for days.
“I’m staying until we win,” Mr. McCarthy told reporters between the second and third votes on Tuesday. “I know the path.”".
"A mutiny waged by ultraconservative lawmakers who for weeks have held fast to their vow to oppose Mr. McCarthy paralyzed the chamber on the first day of Republican rule, delaying the swearing in of hundreds of members of Congress, putting off any legislative work and exposing deep divisions that threatened to make the party’s House majority ungovernable.
Watching McCarthy sacrifice everything, for nothing, is almost as exciting as watching the culmination of years worth of Qultist, Freedumb Caucus, and evangelical Christian grifters put a pause on attacking each other so they could get into power. And now, before they can even take their place as the slimmest majority in the House, they can't even get a procedural hurdle cleared.
