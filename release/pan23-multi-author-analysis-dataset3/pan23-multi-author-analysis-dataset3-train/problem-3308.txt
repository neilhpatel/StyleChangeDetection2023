- Mary Trump described how Donald paid other people to do his homework and take his exams for him in high school and college. How different is this from Santos' totally fabricated high school and college histories?
- I don't know if Santos has a history of corrupting judges, but when Trump was put on trial for dealing cocaine, the judge in the case was Maryanne Trump, his sister, under her married name. Charges against Donald were dismissed.
Actually, looking at the list of accusations, all backed up by evidence against both persons, I wound have to say that Trump takes the prize for breadth of lies.
A lot of Trump's lies are gross exaggerations with grounding in reality, whereas Santos' are entirely made up.
- Both Trump and Santos have lied about their maximum net worth, exaggerating by about a factor of ten in each case.
- Trump and Santos both have histories of charities fraud. Trump used charitable contributions to the Trump Charitable Foundation to pay his legal fines connected with building code violations, and for catering and decorating at his properties. Santos used contributions to his fake animal rescue charity to pay real estate bills and for food.
