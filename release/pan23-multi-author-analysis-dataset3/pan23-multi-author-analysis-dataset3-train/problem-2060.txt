She can hold voted positions (deputy/senator/governor) that give inmunity, what she cannot hold are public service positions (ministers and other public office roles), according to the news.
"She is unlikely to spend any time behind bars, however, given that she holds congressional immunity due to her role as the nationâ€™s deputy leader and head of the Senate.".
Yes. Lots of people hate her here, with good reason. NOT ADVOCATING FOR ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS THOUGH, that shit is dumb af and only hurts our chances to see justice served by proper means.
LMAO for six years after having stolen approximately a billion dollars. Still, she's not going to jail cause she has immunity, at most if everything works out perfectly she's gonna get house arrest but that's gonna take some years cause rules for thee and not for me.
Guy who gets caught defrauding the public with bogus construction work has photos from way back when with Nestor and has commercial ties to them, literally built his mausoleum when he died and their hotels - I sleep.
