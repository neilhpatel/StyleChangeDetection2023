It's very important to remember when judging whether Zelensky is acting in good faith here, that during his election campaign and his pre-war presidency, he was clearly seeking a degree of dialogue and reconciliation with Russia. I absolutely do believe him when he says this is about broken trust. Until Russia show clearly they are backing down, ie by leaving Ukraine, there is basically no reason for him or his government to believe any past good will is restored.
So the only two end results are either Ukraine retakes and somehow holds onto Crimea and other lost territory or Ukraine ceases to exist.
So from their PoV, they need to retake the Eastern territories AND Crimea before they can pursue any peace deal... anything short of that would constitute agreeing to cede land, permanently, to Russia.
If Russia is not willing to abandon all claims to Ukrainian territory, return the kidnapped Ukrainians and then treat Ukraine as a sovereign country with it’s own right to self determination then I don’t see how there can be peace.
I believe this is a not unsubstantial part of why Zelensky and the Ukrainians want ALL of their land back, including Crimea (pre-2014 borders) - as it also means that gaining any land back from Russia after joining NATO is essentially impossible.
