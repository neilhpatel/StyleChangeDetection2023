I mean, it sounds like she just wants you to graduate first, but if you're still planning on continuing your education then I can't see any reason for her concern other than wanting to control you. Her lawyer can't do shit to you as you are an adult who has every right to make your own decisions.
The most she can do is scare you, but in the eyes of the law you are capable of making your own decisions. Good luck.
Thank you . I’m pretty sure they don’t expect me to pay rent which will help a lot. They understand the situation I’m in so I know they’ll give me some wiggle room as I need it.
Thank you, it definitely helps to have options. I’ve talked to some teachers at my current school about a GED and I do think I’ll keep that in mind as a backup.
Thank you so much. In the post I mentioned that it would be better for me academically. I have 100% full intent to graduate out there and possibly graduate early. I’m already in contact with the school and I’m just waiting to send my transcript over. I have no worry of graduating at that school, especially since they require less credits than the one I’m going to right now.
I cannot stress enough how important it is to finish highschool before leaving. You cannot even begin to fathom how much more difficult life will be without a highschool diploma. Your job options are going to be very very limited.
