Nah, underestimate it. Every piece of 'modern' hardware the Chinese put out is less capable than they claim. They have to make significant compromises because they lack the expertise, manufacturing capability, and know how.
This isn't accurate. You've been misled by the wehraboos. The Sherman was arguably the best tank of the war and looking at pure war thunder-ish numbers about penetration or whatever doesn't tell the whole story about ww2 tanks.
The cliche example being the Sherman tank, 50,000 made, not the best gun or armor but good enough to take out most tanks and do its role. Germany having a superior medium tank on paper with the Panther didn't count for much.
Don't underestimate it. Being able to rapidly reverse engineer and produce high end equipment is still a hell of a an advantage. Even if they are lower quality, the logistics and manufacturing ability is still scary. And the more they do it and learn the more they improve their industry and skill set and come up with original and superior designs.
Having a military and industry with "good enough" stuff in superior numbers and the ability to replace/support it is how the US won WW2.
