Thanks for doing this AMA! Do we have any record of how Axis soldiers reacted to facing Sherman tanks on the Eastern Front? Were they confused when American tanks started appearing among Soviet units? Did they have to make any adjustments to their tactics to deal with Shermans versus Soviet-made tanks?
Did the United States make any design adjustments to the Sherman based on its experience in the Eastern Front?
Hi there thanks for this AMA session, I was wondering if American Shermans had any influence on post-war Soviet medium tank designs. As far as I know, the Soviets modified and improved upon the original T-34 to get the T-54s, T-62s and other variations, which are still in service today. I was wondering whether these amazing tanks were influenced by Sherman tanks.
Valentine tanks were actually used very widely in units that had Sherman tanks. The organization of tank brigades with Soviet tanks was repeated with foreign ones: Shermans instead of T-34s and Valentines instead of T-70s. (earlier you also see M3 mediums and M3 lights, but that style of brigade disappears by about 1943). These were Valentines with 2-pounders (II, IV, and VII) in 1943, by 1944 you see them being phased out for Valentines with 6-pounders (IX and X). Valentines were also used by motorcycle recon battalions in addition to "real" tank units. I'm not sure about that specific vehicle, but lots of these units retained their Valentines into 1945 even when "real" tank units were already homogeneous.
A large number of tanks (almost 900 units) were retained after the war, these were either scrapped or turned into railway tugs/prime movers/range targets. Sadly I don't have statistics on what happened to the rest, whether they were written off or returned. Based on the fact that the US sold its surplus M4A2E8 tanks to Canada for a pittance, I don't think they had any interest in getting these tanks back.
