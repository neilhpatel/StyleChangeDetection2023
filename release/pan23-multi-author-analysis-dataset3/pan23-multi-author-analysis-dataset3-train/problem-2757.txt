I like how it’s a number JUST under 5 digits. Like it couldn’t be 10,000 people? Kinda like going into the 99 cent store thinking you’re getting a deal because it’s under a buck. This is obviously bullshit.
That title sounds like bullshit. The prosecutor probably brought it up, and Putin gets to say "yes we will look into how all these good honest Russians were ILLEGALLY sent to the front i have no idea how it happened".
The entire Russian state works like that, and its not a accident, Putin himself created that whole system of corruption and he himself also takes part in it.
My aunt legit told me few months ago that Putin is great and trying his best and it's the freaking oligarchs who's ruining his attempts at making Russia better. But she's also a fan of Solovyov soo...
