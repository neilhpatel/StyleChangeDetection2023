They have not run out. They have simply temporarily stopped using the Shahed kamikaze drones due to them not being designed to withstand the low temperatures in Ukraine right now.
Russian forces appear to be out of Iranian-made drones that have been used in recent weeks to terrorize Ukrainian cities and civilians, Western officials say.
This means that if Russia suddenly has many more Iranian made drones, it's certain they were recently shipped and would essentially confirm Iran did provide those drones after the war started. If there are no more Iranian made drones for the rest of the war, then perhaps Iran was telling the truth.
Given Iran can't be trusted, i expect there to be more drones. But if there are no more drones, I would think they were telling the truth this one time or why else would they stop sending drones to Russia?
Perhaps, but they got a lot of bad press about the drones ending up in Ukraine. They may just feel that they don't need the additional PR hit now, when their bullshit system could fall like a house of cards.
