Sure. What other required vaccinations do you have a successful religious exemption from as part of your military service?
Third, why did you not register any objections to all the other vaccines you were required to have as part of your military service? (The result of which would have them sending you home.).
Perhaps you should provide a link to what you are referencing. I'm looking at the approval letter now, and the paragraphs aren't lettered, and there is no page 12.
Second, precisely what religion have you been a fervent member of that prohibits a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine?
Firstly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines approved for use in the US are "genetic altering material". That's simply false. They cannot "alter genetic material" in the same way eating a steak will not cause me to grow horns or start fathering baby cows.
Fourth, under what legal theory do you think the military gives a shit about your "investigative research"? You are in the military, and therefore have little-to-no grounds to object to being required to receive an appropriate licensed medical treatment.
