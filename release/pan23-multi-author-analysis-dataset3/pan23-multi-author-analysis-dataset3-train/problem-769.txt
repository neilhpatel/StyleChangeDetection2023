Strategic bombing famously if the goal is to demoralize the population into surrender, and only works if the bombing is sustained and constant if the goal is to damage war production capacity.
Attacking civilian populations is a war crime for good reason: it's effective and is a cheap/obvious strategy for anyone who does not care if the enemy population lives or dies. It's for truly evil people.
This is pure terrorism, which benefits Russia in many ways. Strategically, it diverts a lot of Ukrainian resources towards protecting and evacuating civilians from areas where they should be pretty safe, away from the front lines. Russia wants to disrupt Ukraine's advantages on the battlefield (better training, better equipment, higher morale, stronger will to fight) by keeping them spread thinly and reacting to civilian catastrophes.
Because the goal isn't only to demilitarize and absorb Ukraine, it's also to remove ethnic Ukranians and replace them with Russians. The genocide is the primary goal, the military action is just a part of that plan.
