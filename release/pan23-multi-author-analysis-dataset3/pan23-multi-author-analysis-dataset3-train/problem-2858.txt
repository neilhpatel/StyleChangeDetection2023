My friend did they they texted one of their bosses, they have two. Itâ€™s a married couple. My friend gave their notice on January 28th, and said they were giving their two weeks.
Two weeks from January 28 is yesterday. As others have said, given that it's an easily-replaceable position, your friend need not work Valentine's Day. It's not your friend's concern that the bosses didn't hire a replacement. They had the opportunity to, so your friend fulfilled their obligations.
As an alternate for your consideration, if your friend is available, they could ask for a token wage increase they feel would make it worth their while to work the shifts their bosses want. Get this in writing (text is probably fine). They could also request their bosses write and provide to them a reference letter (in advance). The bosses may say no way to either/both of these and that's fine. But if there's a way to resolve this matter in which everyone could benefit, that's always preferable.
Just wanted to float the possibility that the boss has no idea about any of this and the coworkers are lying because they don't want to do extra work.
One other thought. Before your friend goes demanding a wage increase, they may wish to tactfully fact-check the situation. Start by asking the boss if they found someone to cover those shifts or if they still needed them covered.
