Okay, I'll operate under the assumption that you somehow transposed "five years" into "eighteen years" and "nine" into "twenty-two", and I won't question how a nine-year-old is "refusing to speak to you".
What was the situation until your daughter was four? Is that when you and her mother divorced? Were you married at all?
What was the reason for not allowing you any custody and barely four hours a month? Judicial prejudice and "slightly late paperwork" alone would not account for such a massive discrepancy. Especially with a lawyer on your side...
Why do you and your child live so far apart? I'm assuming that either this situation predated you filing for custody, or you left the state, as I don't see any mention of you attempting to prevent your child from being removed from the state you all lived in.
But no court is going to modify an existing order to require the mother to send the child across state lines to a parent who has not seen the child in 5 years. Nor will they order her to bear any associated costs after a 5 year absence. At this point, it is up to you to make being in your child's life a priority and bear all associated costs with reintroduction.
