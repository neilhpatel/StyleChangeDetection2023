You will need to make an appointment at a vehicle center in order to renew in person. You will need the notice or VIN, insurance card, license plate number, proof of ID (driver’s license is easiest—not sure if you have your dad’s), the money, the form filled out (BA-49) and a power of attorney since you’re renewing for your father.
An attorney can prepare one for you. The problem will be that it needs to be signed in front of a notary. So I’m not sure how that will work with your father out of the country. An attorney should be able to say how that’ll work.
How can I get a power of attorney? Do I need to notarize it, right? So I should call a lawyer?Anyway, I will call MVC tomorrow.
"So I’m not sure how that will work with your father out of the country. An attorney should be able to say how that’ll work".
NJ attorney, not your attorney. Don't bother calling the MVC. Send them an email. Their email reps are smarter than you expect.
I have done POA title/reg work a few times for family and elderly friends during COVID. The MVC doesn't care that much. There are NJ limited POA forms available for free online - as long as you specify on the form where it says to do so that it is only to register that specific car with the MVC, frankly you do not need an attorney to draft something like that for you.
