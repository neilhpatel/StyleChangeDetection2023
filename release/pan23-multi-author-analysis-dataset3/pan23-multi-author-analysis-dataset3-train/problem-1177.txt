Russian state TV is also using this visit as an opportunity to make the claim that the US is forcing Ukraine into a war with Russia.
>Russian state television covered the visit extensively, with anchors saying that it was clear that Biden “runs things” in Ukraine, which fits into the Kremlin’s narrative that Zelesnkyy’s government is a stooge of the U.S. administration.
It shows the world that US president is committed to Ukraine and that despite Russia being given advanced notice that a Biden would be in a city that they regularly hit with rockets and missiles, that they- the Russians- could do nothing about it.
Which has backfired because, quoting another commentator, "The fact the US Secret Service allowed Biden into Kyiv for a stupid photo-op is a tacit admission on how restrained Russia is, and in fact, how trusted the Russians' word is.".
p.s. if this somehow did happen, just saying IF it did happen. I had nothing to do with it. and the man was over 60 years old, he was bound to slip somewhere.
