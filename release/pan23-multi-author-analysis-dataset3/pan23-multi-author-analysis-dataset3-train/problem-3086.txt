Any chance Ukraine can use this short truce to join NATO/the EU? Seems pretty perfect to take Russia's offer of "truce so we can regroup and win later" and do their plan but better.
Otherwise we'd just be looking at a return to the 2014-2022 fighting, until Russia feels that it is ready for another attempt.
No, at this point we check Russia's bluff to the bitter end, there's no realistic way of turning back anymore.
And let's not forget, this isn't the first time Russia has pulled this sort of stunt, just look at Moldova and Georgia as an example, they aren't going to stop. What do you think happens to Belarus if they suddenly also decide to move towards warmer relations with the West? And other countries like China is keeping a close watch on the conflict as well, as they too also have dreams of imperialist expansions to neighbouring territories, and in fact have done so in recent memory, just look at Tibet. And we know they're really eyeing up Taiwan right now.
Even if we were to instead take the suggestion from some people to just let Russia keep the areas they currently hold, that too is a strategy that will embolden, but also gives Russia more land, resources and people to grow stronger.
