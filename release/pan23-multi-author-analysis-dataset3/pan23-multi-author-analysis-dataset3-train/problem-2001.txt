That's also a great way to go to the hospital, the morgue, and/or to get arrested and go to prison. Firearms are not for business transactions gone south.
Your friend needs to sue this person in small claims court. It's unlikely that the police will get involved (unless you show up at the person's house).
The police is the best thing to do, my only real question I suppose would be how likely they are to help, but it is what it is.
Police could help only if you have proof to back your version of the story, if you have i would try reaching out to them. Without adequate proof i’m not sure what i would do tbh.
The proof we have is very telling it was him. But we do not have straight caught red handed proof and that’s what worry’s me. I mean I truly believe it was this guy but it could just be a huge coincidence ya know.
Exactly my thinking, I’m the type to avoid any kind of conflict of possible, my biggest rule of carrying is if I have the option to avoid an altercation I do so and avoid any problems, simple example I’m in a drive through at McDonald’s the line scoots you I didn’t notice for a min lady behind me lays on the horn. I pay no attention to it and don’t even look at her. I wanted to completely avoid conflict and did so.
