No. It’s not an oversimplification. Businesses are at the mercy of the consumers. Period. People CHOOSE to spend their money with shit companies. Saying otherwise is bullshit. No one needs to shop at Walmart. If you have no money, shop at thrift stores and overstock stores. Cut out processed food & meat. Buy cheap, nonprocessed foods like dry beans, dry rice, discounted fresh produce, dry pasta, canned tomatoes, bulk cheese, etc. It is a myth that poor people can’t afford healthy food. Stop spreading bullshit. And before you say it, I am well aware of food desserts. I have lived in food deserts for most of my adult life. Most folks are just lazy & apathetic. People want everything handed to them.
Ah, there's the "people want everything handed to them" voice. I was wondering when you would show up. I find no conversation is complete without your particularly bitter flavor of self-righteousness.
I agree with this. This World Cup proved to FiFA that they really can do whatever they like and not only will countries still participate in the event, fans will watch and attend. It's not a good omen of the future conduct of the World Cup.
I'm talking about the World Cup. A few thousand workers died during construction of the stadium. Qatar is also a human rights nightmare. And yet, all of those people attended. All of those companies worked there.
