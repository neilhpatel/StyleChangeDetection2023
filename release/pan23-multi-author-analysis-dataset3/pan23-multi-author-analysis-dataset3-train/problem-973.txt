Her poll numbers in Arizona are abysmal among Democrats who mostly seem to hate her there, and even among all votes she is underwater and well below a majority or even plurality of support. If she ran as an Independent spoiler she might peel away some Independents, but most Republicans wouldn't vote for her (they prefer genuinely racist MAGA types who aren't bisexual) and Democrats would overwhelmingly vote for the Dem Senate candidate from their primaries. It's possible she would even split the GOP vote more than the Dem one. LOL.
I'll take that bet lol. Who would vote for her? Not Republicans. Not democrats. There's no reason for her to spend all that time and energy campaigning again. I guarantee she has a job lined up 2 years in advance.
No other current Democrat compares. Not even Biden or Manchin. She started out to the left of the Democrat party and slowly decided that because Republicans had so much control, bipartisanship was the real goal. Now the Dems have power, she doesn't want them to act like Republicans did, because she's outrageously naive and perhaps just not a smart person. She thinks cooperation will work.
She would need to maintain connections, that's all. Idk if she will be able to. She has become something of a conservative darling. I don't think we've seen the last of her shifts.
