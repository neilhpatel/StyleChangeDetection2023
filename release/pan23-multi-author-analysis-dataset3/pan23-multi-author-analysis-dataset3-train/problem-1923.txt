Massachusetts is a triple damage state. Meaning, you are entitled to three times the replacement value of trees that are illegally cut down by non property owners. (Note... replacement cost means replacing the exact same size/age/type of tree.) This could amount to a LOT of money.
Depending on what you are looking for, this could be as simple as calling a wellness check and the police to get her to back off. Or, as serious as getting a lawyer who specializes in tree law and a consulting arborist and sueing her for quite a bit of money.
Trees can be surprisingly valuable and you could have a reason to sue her for the value of the trees, as that would be illegal since it is your property.
If you're able to get in writing that she trespassed and had the trees cut down then you would also have a stronger case.
If she trespassed on your property and destroyed your trees & bushes then you very likely have a case.
Call around and find a lawyer that deals with this. You may need to hire an arborist to determine the value of the trees and a surveyor to establish that the trees removed were on your property.
To add to this to find out the company she hired tell her that you are thinking of removing a few more trees and want to use the same company she hired before.
