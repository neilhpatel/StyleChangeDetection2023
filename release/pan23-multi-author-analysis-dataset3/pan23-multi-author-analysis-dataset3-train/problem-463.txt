Coffee mug from the police station scene in the same film. After all, everybody knows how much dads love their coffee mugs. !
And ya know what? If you can do that with even 50% of the certainty of a crime as we have certainty of Trump committing, but committed by Joe Biden in regards to The Laptop That Definitely Exists, or whatever nonsense you heard about Ukraine from ^checks ^notes... The guy who leaked shoe polish out of his head after scheduling a major press conference at a landscaping company... Then yeah, I will support your desire to hold an impeachment. And you can refer your findings to the DoD. And if he did commit a major crime? Then he should go to fucking prison despite being president.
Uhhh... Sounds like a waste of time, but you go ahead and get that laptop that definitely exists from Tucker Carlson and you go ahead and see what's definitely for realsies on that thing and then trace the provenance of that item, which definitely totally exists because some very important and trustworthy people like Rudy have said so, and you prove that it was definitely Hunter's and not just some bullshit. And then from there you go ahead and take the president's son's supposed actions detailed in this device, which definitely totally exists I promise bigly and you can't see it but I promise it is real, and you go ahead and prove that Joe was involved in whatever it is that supposedly is in this thing that definitely really exists.
It is the same attitude that gets people to worship billionaires and excuse anything they do. They think that maybe someday they might be that rich and if that's the case, they want to do all that shit too.
