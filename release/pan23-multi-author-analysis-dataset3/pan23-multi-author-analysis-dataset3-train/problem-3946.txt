I assume you intend to mean "give 50k dollars to 240 immigrants " instead of investing 12m into infrastructure that could recruit future Americans into quickly adjusting to residential status amd becoming contributing taxpayers.
$12 million is definitely a good start for investing in infrastructure to help these people find a legitimate path to citizenship and it’s a much better idea than rounding people up and shipping them elsewhere, especially since DeSantis has overlooked the one fatal flaw of his plan.
I agree that we need to do better with immigration reform but people like DeSantis are asking all the wrong questions and trying to solve the problem with all the wrong answers.
The majority of Florida’s border is oceanfront and not even the Coast Guard can stop all the migrants who sail across the Gulf from Mexico or up the Atlantic from Cuba or Haiti or countless other countries. He could spend $12 million to round them up today but what’s he doing with tomorrow’s batch of new immigrants?
