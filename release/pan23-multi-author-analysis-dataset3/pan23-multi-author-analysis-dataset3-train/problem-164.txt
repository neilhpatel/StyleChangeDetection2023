If only China’s Zero-COVID policy wasn’t impacting the rest of the world. Many of the “supply chain” disruptions we read about every day are because of factories in China being locked down under this policy and product not getting built or shipped.
The problem is China’s economy is so massive and integrated into the rest of the world that supply chains are going to be fucked as long as they keep doing this.
That’s true in the short run, but if supply chains keep being interrupted business will look and invest elsewhere, which is bad for china in the long run.
But I still feel for the Chinese citizens who have to deal with these extreme measures. COVID is here to stay unfortunately. Just mask up and social distance, get vaccinations when possible, spread is greatly minimized with just that.
Yes, that's what I said, Vaccination prevents death not infection, but since people still feel sick, they will come to the hospital anyway. the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system in the short term is still there.
