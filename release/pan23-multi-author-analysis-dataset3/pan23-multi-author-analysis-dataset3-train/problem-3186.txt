It won't go a sheriff sale, it will a partition order and house will get listed. He will end up paying for half the attorney cost. Girlfriend can buy house, but she would have to complete with other offers and will likely in up paying more. I think the attorney cost will be less than you thing, you and should in for a consultation to see.
If you truly cannot afford one - they might be more reasonably priced than you think - consider asking an attorney if they will work for you on contingency. The contingency here is the sale of the property and receipt of your half of the asset value. If you can present your case to an attorney and they have reasonable belief that they can help you, they will likely be willing to work under contract for a % of the asset value. For example, if the house is worth $100K, and you are due $50K, they may be willing to work for 5% of your share ($2500).
It's a great point that there may not be a lot of equity available here - I didn't consider that when posting my comment. Perhaps it's one of the reasons OP's brother is digging his heels in?
It sounds like your brother is determined to play hardball, which is a shame on his end and has unfortunate implications for your relationship, but is not the end of the world for you either financially or legally speaking.
In order to come out of this in a favorable position, you are going to need to hire an attorney - there's just no good way around it. Without an attorney, as another commenter said, "he who has the most time and money will win" - and it sounds like that's not you in this case.
Most good attorneys in the real estate space are comfortable with flexible payment / contingency arrangements since real estate often involves large amounts of equity tied up in property - you should be able to find someone who can help you.
