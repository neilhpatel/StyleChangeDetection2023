Many providers and systems have a policy that, unless you actively treating a person, you cannot use your access to look at their records, even if you are otherwise entitled to view their records (such as for yourself or a family member). You must go through the same process as everyone else. You can be disciplined simply for a policy violation.
They can refer you to HHS for investigation of a potential HIPAA violation. The outcome may turn on exactly how the records are categorized. You probably will need to hire an attorney that specializes in professional defense if you are referred to HHS.
She will need an attorney if and only if HHS pursues some kind of action against her. Without looking at the state and local laws, etc. that’s not something that can be determined. When we start talking about patient rights but provider discretion, it’s not clear that there one obviates the other.
If the information was posted on a portal that the parent had access to, then the violation is on the treatment facility - not the parent who read it.
Once that information hits the portal that the mother has access to it was a HIPPA violation if, and it’s not clear that it, as an abuse allegation, should have been protected.
Here’s some legal advice for the mother; if a doctor says you cannot have access to a file due to hipaa don’t find another way to access it UNLESS YOUR CHILD SAYS IT IS OKAY.
If you want access to your daughter's health files, you SPEAK TO HER about it, explain your reasons, if she agrees, she signs the release and you have access to the information.
