Yeah, we've been gifted the gutting of the Russian military for pennies on the dollar. We're getting to test logistical and weapons systems as well as tactics in drone warfare. At least for drones, we're also building the muscle for doing extremely rapid weapons development and procurement outside the normally stultifying pentagon processes. It's like a war game to prep us for an eventual conflict with China.
2025-2027 is what’s being predicted when China will invade Taiwan. They are making preparations at an alarming rate and in 4-5 yrs they will be ready. It’s scary to think about.
That trade was the best we could do. No American left behind is in our dna. Sucks we couldn’t get the other guy out but this we clear geopolitical on Russias part by capture Brittany. We had to get her out by any means.
I agree. We are trying to deplete the Russian military so they can’t launch an invasion like this in the near future. It’s a war of attrition at this point and Russia is losing tons of equipment. They can’t product computer chips either so all those new aged tanks and rocket systems can’t be replaced. A drawn out war is bad for Russia and that’s what we’re doing. Sending enough aid to keep Ukraine fighting but not enough to win in the near term.
In the meantime supplying Ukraine with equipment, weapons and training helps them defend themselves.
No. I can understand the hesitancy to escalate the conflict because of the potential for nuclear conflict, but I'm in favor of giving Ukraine whatever they need or want to defend themselves.
If you wish to balance it, then please clarify: do you think Russia is justified in its military invasion and attempted annexation of Ukraine?
