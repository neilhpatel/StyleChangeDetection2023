Remind management that a) no minimum temp is in the lease and b) you expect 24 hours notice before entry unless there is an emergency. Entering to check the thermostat is not an emergency.
70 is excessive. 60 is plenty. You don’t even need to heat to 70 when you are there, it is what you desire. The should be a minimum temp in your lease (ours is 55) but anything above that is not necessary.
My lease doesn’t list a minimum temperature but I don’t mind keeping it on 55-60 to prevent damages. I didn’t realize it could cause damage so after being informed of this I won’t turn it off during the winter.
The lease says that the landlord must give 24 hours notice to enter the unit but the landlord told me he won’t be doing that to check the thermostat.
If the lease says 24h notice and also has nothing about a minimum temperature then if he comes in without your consent, legally he is breaking the lease. It is not an emergency. Be careful what you say because if you hum-haw when talking to him, he might try to say that you guys discussed it and you agreed to it.
