No, the majority of Fentanyl precursors are coming from China into Mexico and being pressed into pill form there. Once in pill form, the cartels are handling transport and distribution here in the states.
The price of a Fentanyl pill coming across the border has dropped to as low as .50 - .75 cents apiece due to availability. They are flooding the states. You’re naive if you think unsecured borders aren’t an issue. Placing shipping containers there is a silly symbolic gesture at best, but there clearly is a massive problem.
Ducey contributes to problems with global shipping by tying up shipping containers. Border patrol plans to put captured migrants inside the containers for safe keeping.
Shipping containers are just structural frames with weak sheet steel panels as filler. People have tried to bury them to use as root cellars etc and they collapse from the weight of the soil alone.
EDIT ---- even more, you work for the Veteran's Administration. Get your house in order before you start your career in border propaganda.
