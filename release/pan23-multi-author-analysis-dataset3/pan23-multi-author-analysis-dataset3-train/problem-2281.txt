Supposedly meaning, he makes empty promises lies so on so forth just to be on his wife’s good side. I don’t know how that translates to legal terms.
They’re both us citizens. She’s just lost as what to do, who to go to so she can rectify the document and take out his brothers name.
She lives in NY, where the whole family lives including the fathers brother. So the kids aren’t owners either? What do the kids get if the father grantor both pass away?
To answer your question "What do the kids get if the father grantor both pass away?" depends on the terms of the trust agreement. The trust I read yesterday provides that once the primary beneficiary dies, the trust is split into thirds, one for each of two sons and the current wife. The share for the wife then goes in trust to the two boys when she passes. The beauty of a trust is it provides for control of how assets are passed after your death. A trust provides certain creditor protection and certainly can protect a beneficiary from themselves.
So, ultimately you will need to see what the trust agreement says and what assets the trust is funded with but a trust is an excellent vehicle because it provides some protection for the beneficiaries from certain outside creditors.
Beneficiary = This is the person that receives the benefit of the trust income and or principal (also known as corpus). There can be multiple beneficiaries and there can be contingent beneficiaries too. Each class of beneficiary has certain rights as defined by the trust agreement.
Trustee = the person or persons responsible for carrying out the terms of the trust agreement. The trustee(s) have a fiduciary responsibility to follow the terms of the trust. Failure to do so usually ends badly for them.
