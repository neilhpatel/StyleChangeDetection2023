So it is unlikely that they are doing anything wrong. I assume you have a case plan/family plan of what they are wanting you to do in order to get your children back, since they have been on custody for an extended time.
You replied to a bot. But either way, your mental health history is likely part of the problem as well as being looked at as unprotective since it seems like you knew the abuse was happening.
That just isn't how the law works. You are misunderstanding something. If you are not a part of the case then they may have already terminated your parental rights. Because the state doesn't take a kid from just one parent. Both parents have their rights limited because the state takes them. So if your have zero standing in the case they may have already terminated your rights since you didn't want to be involved in the case when it happened.
Why were the children removed? Why were you not able to protect them? What was the custody order? Have you been to court? What did they say?
We are saying the same thing. What happened here isn't usual. And it was probably illegal but I am no CPS/family court law expert so I was hoping someone here would be able to suggest what can be done when CPS has overstepped their boundaries.
