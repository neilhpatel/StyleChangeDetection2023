They also generally don't get a pass on things like fraud (except maybe as part of a drug sting or something related).

Your claims are far fetched. If you approach authorities with these claims, they will likely assume you to be delusional. Get in front of that assumption by first seeking an evaluation with a mental health professional. If given a clean bill of mental health, your account will likely be taken more seriously.
