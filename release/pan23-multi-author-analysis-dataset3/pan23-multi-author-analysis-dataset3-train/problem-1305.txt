Until a judge tells him that he must list the house he doesn’t have to agree to do it. As for sleepovers, there is no inherent right for a child to spend the night at another house or to have friends stay the night at their house, he is welcome to establish such a rule when the kids are with him and could ask the court to do the same for when they are with you, though I doubt the court would approve that.
Absent a court order no, but I will note that at least in the states I practice orders saying no overnights with a significant other who you are not married to is a common part of a custody order.
Sure she can, she has no obligation to let you see her child. If your new SO has custody of the child then unless their custody order says something about it she probably can’t do anything, but if she is the one with custody she doesn’t have to let the kid be around you.
And his baby‘s mom is talking about going to court and getting an order to keep their son away from me because she says that his dad is getting a terrible example for their son And not putting their child needs in front of everything else but that is just because we have had a lot going on in the last couple weeks it won’t always be like this. She can’t keep him away from me just because she doesn’t like the situation right?
