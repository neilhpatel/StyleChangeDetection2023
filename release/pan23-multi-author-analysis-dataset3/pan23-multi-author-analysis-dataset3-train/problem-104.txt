So two things I would start off with in answering this question. The first is simply that I don't have knowledge or awareness of every Socialist country that has or currently exists, so make no claims that what I speak of for some applies to others, even if some of this reflects general trends. Second is that the premise is somewhat off, since, as I'll cover below, there was not uniform, blanket prohibition, and what was and wasn't allowed varied greatly.
But while we may see strong rhetoric steeped in the language of class struggle, if we rewind, the origins of Soviet anti-pornography laws are fairly mundane, and is quite un-Soviet in genesis. Keep in mind that up through the mid-century, suppression of pornographic material was completely the norm, and while laws of course varied in specifics, the Soviets reflected a global norm, and more importantly, there laws exists in large part because of that.
So, is it fair to summarize it as that the Soviets weren't banning pornography for any specific reason, it was just that everyone banned it and in this they were more similar to the West than different at least on this one issue?
If those standards existed past Soviet collapse, was there some formal standard of what was considered pornographic in post Soviet USSR? Was it actually enforced?
