An I missing something here? This sounds like a lie , or bluster, just more abuse from the parent. A subpoena is an order from a court. The average person can't get a subpoena on another person's phone records just by random request. It needs to be part of some sort of civil lawsuit or criminal case. The mother can't just subpoena phone records out of thin air because she wants to! What court is she asking for this subpoena? And for what reason? From op's post there are no ongoing court cases.
In other words, there has to be a CASE and a very good reason for asking for a subpoena of phone records, because those records contain evidence of something one side is trying to prove.NAL.
Gonna assume the reason she would give to subpoena the phone records is that i am a missing person in possible danger.
You can contact your cell phone provider and ask about their procedure if they receive a subpoena for your records.
Before a person [your cell phone provider] subject to a subpoena is required to hand over the information requested they can file a motion to quash the subpoena. Oftentimes a cell phone provider will inform the customer of a subpoena and give the customer an opportunity to file such a motion to quash the subpoena.
