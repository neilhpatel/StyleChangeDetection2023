If you are legally married you are legally married, you don’t get married again in the US. You file taxes as married. It may or may not speed it up depending on how long she has been a resident (I’m assuming she already had her green card and it’s not because you filed for her) because to apply under the 3 year rule she’d have to be a permanent resident and married to a citizen for 3 years so if, for example, she’s already been a resident for three years before marrying you it would be faster to just follow the normal process (5 years of being a permanent resident).
Re. your edit: trust me, there's more. Look at the instructions and the document checklist (both on that page) and you'll see there's more proof to submit when filing on the basis of marriage to a US citizen (specifically the part where it talks about documents referring to you and your spouse).
No problem and good luck! (I will add that even though some people go with a lawyer for this, it's definitely something you can file and complete on your own in most cases).
So since she already had her GC the 3 years would start from date of marriage so, presuming she fulfills , she'd be eligible in Feb 2023 (she can file 90 days ahead of time). Bear in mind there's more evidence to submit under the 3 year rule than the 5 year rule since you also have to prove you two are in a bona fide marriage. You really should go to VisaJourney forums like the other poster recommended as they have a lot of resources, guides, and a very active community going through the same things you are.
You may want to post on r/immigration Another good place to ask these kinds of questions is the forums at . They are full of people who have been there and done that.
If you are legally married in some other country, the US will almost always recognize it. You don't need to be remarried in the US. In fact, you may be unable to be married in the US because you are already married.
