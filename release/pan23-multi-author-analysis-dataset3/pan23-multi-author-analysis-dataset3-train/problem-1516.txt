This is an interesting and complicated subject, and if actually sued, I'd strongly recommend that you get a lawyer. Even if it's a small claims suit for the replacement cost of a chicken, it's still worth at least getting a consult before you respond.
It might be a good idea to review your municipal code to see if you're actually allowed to let your dog run off-leash on your property. Not every city in Ontario allows that, and you could come out of this with a ticket for not containing your dog.
City bylaws don't state anything about dogs on personal property other than if someone else's dog is on your property you can shoot it? Which seems extreme but doesn't help my case. Can they sue if we offer to reimburse the cost of the chicken? Which would be a whole other shitshow because I'm pretty sure her original 5 chickens were given to her by a friend and the one my dog ...well ya, was a hatchling from the original 5. It's a very strange Case. It's tricky because like I said most precidents are for the opposite scenario, this doesn't seem to be a common problem. Which is why I'm seeking help. So I should contact a small claims lawyer if she sues? Other than that don't worry?
