A big o’l circle jerk here but I’m with OP and everyone else. It’s always the top sub in my personal feed when I wake up in the morning and there’s always something new and interesting. But the quality of the responses really blows my mind. I’m a history lover but never studied it. So when I read the responses with sources and citations, it’s just a great feeling that I may as well be in the lecture theatre listening to the pros. Thank you.
Wanted to extend my thanks also. It gives me not just entertainment and knowledge, but, a little more faith in humanity. This subreddit is awesome, thank you.
I love that this sub always makes the list in r/askreddit when someone asks which subs are overmoderated.
I'm a run-of-the-mill average idiot here and I love this sub cause it's always so excellent in getting quality commenters. I wish I was smart enough to contribute on something, but when someone asks random pop culture 90's history, I'll be right here!
Lol I read that post as well but I'm always so conditioned to not comment that I forgot to participate hahaha thanks again for keeping this place in tip-top shape guys.
