She's a Messianic Jew. That whole sect is just a shitty marketing ploy to pretend Jews endorse Jesus. They try to claim they are faithful Jews who just believe Jesus is the Messiah.
So basically she admits Jesus was a Jew and she just stands by Jesus being what Jews say he isn't - The messiah.
So yes, 99.9% of Jews fundamentally disagree with the portrayal of/notion that Jesus as messiah, but that's more a function of their belief system than an explicit belief in itself.
While I understand what you're getting at, no component of the Jewish faith or teachings reject Jesus as the Messiah: the teachings and scripture are older than Jesus. Remember, Jesus was a Jew.
Yes they do the Jewish belief is that the Messiah is someone who is yet to be born. That invalidates Jesus Christ being the Messiah.
If you mean the Old Testament you are correct it predates Christ and yes Christ was Jewish. Rabbinic Judaism in which all present day forms of Judaism are based around categorically rejects Christ as Messiah.
