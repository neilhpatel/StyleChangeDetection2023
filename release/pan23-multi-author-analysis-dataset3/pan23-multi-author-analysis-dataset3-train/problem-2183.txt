Because of how he lost. First he inserts himself into a district he hasn't lived in where popular progressive Democrat Mondaire Jones has a seat. Mondaire Jones is then forced to compete in a district he never has lived in or competed in and loses. Then in the primary against another candidate to his left he amplifies the "crime is out of control" narratives amplifying messaging that is damaging his party in the state. And then just refuse to campaign on the ground in your district and give up a district Biden won by 10 points to the Republicans.
Because the guy holding the purse strings moved into his district and took all the institutional backing with him. You think the DCCC is gonna back the guy trying to primary its own chair even if it was his district before?
We can celebrate democrats being successful but Maloney is a culmination of everything wrong with the party. A comfortable wealthy white guy who felt entitled to a safe seat to wield power and influence for his own gain without any consideration of the people he represented. The DCCC deserved so much better.
His district deserved better. And he's an excellent example of why I never donate to the national fundraising committees, DCCC, DSCC etc. I donate to individuals.
