The last time the UN was significantly present, Haiti saw a cholera epidemic that killed tens of thousands of its citizens. During the 80s, the UN promised to secure elections - which resulted in a blood bath in 1988. Even after elections succeeded the year after, Aristide - the new President - was overthrown in 91, precipitating US President Bill Clinton's promise to return him to office. Which he did, in 1994, with limited international support.
The UN can't fix Haiti, because the UN peacekeeping forces will have zero lasting value. Outside of Port au Prince, pit toilets are still used everywhere and power is an occasional thing. The reasons how and why are irrelevant at this juncture (blame France or pre-WWI US or Canada or Nepal), but Haiti lacks the means to economically stand on its own, and the UN has done a terrible job at restoring literally any fundamental infrastructure as any money that comes in gets gobbled up by corrupt NGOs.
Like anything else, it's pretty complicated. The Bush administration did nothing in 2004 to prevent Aristide's ouster, the UN did nothing in 91 to prevent Aristide's first ouster, the US cut deals with some genuinely awful people to restore Aristide to power in 94. Anyone who views the issues in Haiti from the very ethnocentric Western right/left axis is going to be in for a hard time understanding what is actually going on, because failed nations do not neatly fall into our ideological boxes.
This decision is pretty unpopular with a lot of Haitians on the ground despite political support, but Canada's hands are kind of tied as the only alternative - which would be (and look) much worse - is doing nothing.
