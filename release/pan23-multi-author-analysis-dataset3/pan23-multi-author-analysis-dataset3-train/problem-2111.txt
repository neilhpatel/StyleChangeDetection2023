theÂ bullshit asymmetry principle, is an internetÂ adageÂ that emphasizes the effort of debunking misinformation, in comparison to the relative ease of creating it in the first place. It states that "The amount of energy needed to refuteÂ bullshitÂ is anÂ order of magnitudeÂ bigger than that needed to produce it."ðŸ—¨.
so how can you say there is no misuse. If Ukraine can get 100% accountability, then wheres the billions if not trillions back from Afghanistan and Iraq? Wheres their accountability? Anyone remember the briefcases full of cash on Karzais front door? I did three tours and damaged my mind and body, i want my money back then, especially from the war profiteers.
Ukraine deserves aid just based upon principle alone but theres no way that this report is truthful.
Can anyone explain to me why oversight and transparency with American funds sent to Ukraine is a bad thing, or why it was rejected? Thanks in advance!
I'm happy to hear they haven't found any misuse of American funds, I hope there will be transparency on how the funds are being used.
I'm interested in your view, because it appears to be contrary to everything we've been told over the past decade.
Hi could you please explain how it's just a Russian talking point? I have seen countless articles from trusted American news sites like CNN, CNBC, ABC, NBC, etc over the last 12 years talking about how corrupt the Ukrainian government is and how they've misused funds in the past.
Corruption takes many forms, they may have been stealing money from there budgets, selling information, using power to help friends or family etc... Lots of ways to be corrupt without stealing some of the most scrutinized funding in Ukraine.
