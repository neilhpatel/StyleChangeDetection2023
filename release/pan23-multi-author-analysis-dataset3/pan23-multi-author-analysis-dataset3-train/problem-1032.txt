With that in mind, you saying that someone stinks and has poor kitchen hygiene is likely not assault.
Apparently, in Michigan, private citizens can file and attest misdemeanor arrest warrants. They have to be accepted by a judge or magistrate though, and if are, are automatically transferred to a prosecuting state attorney. So in one sense, yes, they can "press charges" in the sense of lodge a complaint, but in the other, cannot, because they cannot prosecute them themselves or hire a private attorney to do so either.
friendly reminder that private persons cannot "press charges," prosecutors decide whether or not to do that.
Peronally I always find this anecdote annoying that people throw in every time they see the word “press charges,” as it has been mentioned is not true in many cases. And even in states where people can’t go to a judicial official and request charges, we know what they mean by pressing charges (though I do agree that in a legal advice forum it is good to use proper terminology).
