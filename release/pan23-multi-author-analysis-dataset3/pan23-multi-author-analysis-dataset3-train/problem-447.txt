That is not to say Rabinowitch's book should not be used, however I suggest never basing an understanding of a subject on one book alone.
I wonder why you are focused specifically on Rabinowitch's book on the Revolution when there is a lot of other books regarding it. I highly recommend A People's Tragedy by Orlando Figes, as he set out to describe a different opinion on the revolution than most. Even Stephen Kotkin's recent books on Stalin, Stalin: Paradoxes of Power does a great job explaining the nuances of the Revolution.
And what do you think about his older Prelude to the Revolution and more recent The Bolsheviks in Power?
Considering "The Bolsheviks come to power" by Alexander Rabinowitch was written in 1976, before the soviet archives were opened, is it still worth reading for someone looking for an introduction to the revolution?

I assume he means that as feudal relations have been eliminated, the previous way of doing things for these professions have been eliminated by the development of capitalism, and with it the honour previously associated with these professions.
