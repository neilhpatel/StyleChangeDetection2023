The title is kind of garbage, but when a candidate that almost became the governor of AZ is perpetuating a conspiracy about why she lost, itâ€™s newsworthy.
The journalists at CBS News are intentionally elevating this state governor's race loser's conspiracy theory of "fake voters" into the living rooms across America. By elevating it, they are legitimizing it, and that is irresponsible on their part. They are not ignorant of what they are doing, yet they still do it, either for a cynical grab at advertising revenue, or because there is a quiet support of the "conspiracy theory" in the employees or owners of CBS News..
That makes the "news" outlets pushing the "fraudulent election" narrative complicit in any potential insurrection, or politically motivated violence that follows.
Reporting on the "open refusal to accept election results" is what's driving the trend, and it is what is helping the followers of anti-Democracy candidates foment another potential insurrection.
When the candidate is a known election denier who said before the election they only way they lose the election would be due to cheating and the only way the election isn't rigged is if they win it's not news that they then denied the election they fairly lost. It's like saying it's a news story that rain makes things wet.
