As a final note, thought Korea was not politically colonized by a Western nation, it was not isolated from the West's sphere of influence. From the late Choson dynasty and through the period of Japanese Colonization, Western (mostly American) missionaries were extremely active on the Peninsula. Though these missionaries were theoretically unpolitical, the presence of these Western missionaries simultaneously acted as a means through which Western cultural imperialism existed in Korea and as a strain on the relationship between Japan and the West (but again, in particular the US). Without digressing too much from the original question, the Western missionary presence in Korea strained tensions between the West and Japan because the missionaries actively critiqued the brutal treatment of the Koreans by the Japanese government, particularly in regards to the 1919 March 1st Independence Movement.
We could go deeper after Japan officially annexed Korea in 1910 and how it was exploited primarily for food for Japan and what that relationship looked like- especially Korean resistance- but in sum, European powers never colonised Korea because Japan never gave them that chance. Russia had imperial ambitions for Korea, but that was effectively ended with the Russo-Japanese war in 1905.
Japan's emergence as a colonial power following the Meiji Restoration was partly in response to Western powers imperialism. Japan organised a national bureaucratic government and a national economy following the Meiji Restoration and from the earliest stages the "Korea question" was at the forefront of Japanese officials' minds. Keep in mind that the only attempted invasion of the Japanese homeland was by the Mongols and was launched from the Korean peninsula. The Japanese were well aware of this and of the strategic importance of Korea.
Thank you for your response, another reply to this comment focused on the Qing-China perspective on Korea and this deals with the Japanese!
