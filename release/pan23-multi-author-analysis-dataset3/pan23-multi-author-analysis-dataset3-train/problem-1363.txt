The consent form templates I looked at mention agreeing to use of contraceptive, but nothing about what happens if the woman gets pregnant. If that happens, are you just able to sue for breach of contract, and have no other legal recourse?
Such a contract is likely unenforceable to begin with. Also, women get pregnant all the time while still using contraception, so even if it were enforceable (which I seriously doubt) you would still have to show that she intentionally stopped using contraception and breached the contract, which would be nearly impossible without her active cooperation. A pregnancy alone is not proof that she stopped taking contraception. AND even in the incredibly, incredibly unlikely case that this was an enforceable contract AND you could show that she breached it, you STILL would have nothing to sue for except to recoup the consideration provided to her in exchange for her agreement to perform. Which, in this case, is really really close to prostitution because it would be consideration in exchange for performing certain behavior surrounding sex acts, and I'm not sure you would WANT to bring that to the court's attention. Or the world's attention, since such a case would be likely to pique some media interest.
If you want to be sure contraception is used every single time, the only way to do that is to take on that burden yourself and use your own form of contraception before you engage in an act that could otherwise result in the creation of a child.
