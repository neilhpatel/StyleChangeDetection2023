There are a number of consequences of this tension. One is that it's fairly common for people to think high schools are based on factories because their high school experience felt impersonal or assembly-line-ish. (.) Another example happened in this thread and helps us understand why there are 200+ removed comments to your question. Dozens and dozens of people are chiming in with a single sentence to say, "I wanted to be a marine biologist because I saw Free Willy", or "my parents were huge fans of the Costeaus", or variations on "my school had a big recycling program and we were taught about saving the ocean." In other words, a lot of well-intentioned people are seeking to answer your question by giving you what they think is the cause of the effect you and your partner observed.
One of the challenges in the field of education history or the history of childhood is the weight of people's lived experiences. For many topics in history, our exposure is second-hand, mostly through popular culture, literature, or other media. But childhood? Every adult was once a kid. Education and school? Most of us experienced formal education in one form or another so we think we understand the system and how it came to be. As such, when it comes to helping people think about the history of childhood or education, there's a bit of a headwind.
Would you happen to have any context on the history of "field trips" in American education? I have a hypothesis that maybe at some point children had more exposure to places like aquariums through school that they might not have had access to before? Especially for kids that come from families that would not have had the income to take the children themselves. Any merit there you think?
