I can’t help with the translation of the text, because my German is not good enough, but I can still help with explaining its meaning. The Lutheran church has a collected body of hymn tunes called chorale melodies, and Lutheran organists have a long tradition of playing preludes on them and accompanying the congregation in various ways. The most famous of these organists was J. S. Bach, who left behind a body of work that includes several collections of chorale preludes, including the Orgelbüchlein, which are rather charming and worth a listen.
The site bach-cantatas.com is an excellent resource for information about chorale melodies and their provenance, by the way.
These preludes treat the chorale melodies in several ways, including ornamenting them with trills and other decorations, playing them in canon, or setting them in different voices (eg. in the alto rather than the soprano). There is adventurous use of harmony in some cases. The note that you have found seems to be an instruction to the to the organist in question that he should not treat the chorale tunes in elaborate ways such as these, particularly when leading the congregation. As an organist myself, I can agree that a congregation does often need a simple accompaniment, but that does not stop me admiring the work of the likes of Bach.
"Therefore, may the organist never forget that he is entrusted with a holy duty, and is therefore obliged to muster everything to further the religious edification of the believers. Page 40".
