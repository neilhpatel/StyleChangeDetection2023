Since anything relating to trans youth and medical treatment almost inevitably brings out the "kids are being castrated" and "90% of trans kids desist and will regret transition" concern trolling in defense of terrible legislation like this:
The recent surge of attacks on gender affirming care for trans youth have been , the , and the , and are out of line with the medical recommendations of the , the and , the , the , the , and the .
What kind of safeguards do you think should exist for minors who perhaps wrongfully identify as trans, when perhaps they may identify as something else in the future? Or perhaps a better rephrasing, what are the medical channels that exist to ensure the minor is 100% trans before they have the ability to access appropriate care?
The goal should \never\ be that no minor gets care before doctors are 100% sure they're trans (because part of what "trans healthcare" looks like for minors is to allow them to properly explore their feelings before proceeding with more permanent treatment. That's another thing that makes these bills so menacing- they're sold as preventing things that generally don't happen anyway but they're usually written so that they also criminalize things like therapy to help a kid understand their sense of self.
