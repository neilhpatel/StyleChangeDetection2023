Well no, someone who's "evil" is presumably causing harm to others, so I'd want that to be stopped, and for other people to know that there are consequences for causing harms.
And I guess it is fair to be as evil and deranged as one wants to be without ever facing a single inconvenience in your view. Ok then. Tip your fedora and feel euphoric about it.
No. And that means that all other targets are at best a "maybe", cause once we pass 1.5 several amplifying feedback loops will be triggered and we have yet no idea how severe the results will be. Once that threshold is past, there is the possibility that even if humans stopped all emissions immediately, climate change would just keep going until all current ecosystems are destroyed.
Sure you can (and at least I used the key words probably and chance rather than talking in absolutes), about as much as you can quote "models" as saying that no level of warming will bring about the extinction of the human race. Period.
I understand your line of thinking and I don't blame you for it, but personally I would much rather be in control of the sacrifices that we collectively make as a species, rather than leaving it up to the environment while humanity is left with awful and more awful choices.
So all the people who don't meaningfully contribute to climate change in their day to day lives, especially those in the third world where they may not contribute at all due to lack of meaningful carbon emission, deserve to die because a few corrupt corporate dickheads ruined the world for everyone? Is that really the stance you are taking? Because I hate to break it to you, the people who are actually responsible for the climate going to shit are going to be fine for a long time before a lot of innocent people bear the brunt of their consequences.
