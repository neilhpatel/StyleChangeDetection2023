The courts can't force you to agree to anything, but family law courts have the legal authority to issue custody and visitation schedules by court order, and to enforce those orders through remedies like contempt of court or by getting law enforcement involved. In extreme cases, people who absolutely refuse to cooperate with the courts can sometimes lose custody entirely, on the basis that their uncooperative approach so seriously impairs the child's or the other parent's rights that removing the child from their care is necessary.
You don't have the option of refusing the court's authority to resolve the issue, and if you want to resolve it out of court but your co-parent wants to litigate, litigation is how things will proceed.
When the court enters an order for custody/visitation/support, you can't just say "I disagree" and opt out.
The court will enter an order for child support and custody with or without your participation. If you do not want to participate, you will lose agency entirely.
