There's also no guarantee that a person from one state knows the caste hierarchy of another state. There's also no guarantee that a person's surname is the one that has always been in their family. In some parts of India, some castes have been threatened by ruling powers and have has different surnames for decades.
Which doesn't really make any sense since the vast, vast majority of Indian immigrants to the USA are 'higher caste'. There are likely no 'lower-caste' people to discriminate against.
I think this mean caste discrimination is being enforced by some immigrants behind the scenes so to speak. This is like organized crime that prey on "their own" immigrant communities, knowing the people are vulnerable and afraid to seek assistance.
And I'm guessing this comes from other perhaps more established immigrants who don't want "their community" to "look bad".
My problem with this is if this is a issue then we should look at the immigrates first since if we're taking in people who have those views that's a problem and those people should be kicked out.
Yeah no, taking in people that views don't line up with ours is how you get problems, because said people won't assimilate well into the country and keep their bad views which just creates more of them.
What? The US has freedom of religion and the majority of people don't care about what religion someone is, that's the views of Americans.
