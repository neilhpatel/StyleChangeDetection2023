The Allies famously cracked the Enigma and Lorenz ciphers. Most people know about Bletchley Park, about Alan Turing, about the Bomba. Hollywood movies have been made about the code cracking effort.
I could go on and on and on, but the point is: these stories about the information war are very famous, and really the opposite of "rarely acknowledged.".
That’s the point. The Kremlin is struggling financially to support the war and support the state in the midst of a recession and while their oil/gas revenue has taken hits. If they actually made the payments it would compromise their ability to wage war.
The funny thing is there was actually an element of “truth” to Russian claims about hitting the HIMARS. Ukraine had created a bunch of fake HIMARS out of wood and would move them around a lot. Russia actually did destroy several of these and often would waste multi million dollar missiles on dummy HIMARS. The Russians legitimately thought they were destroying the HIMARS and reported it as such even though they were just wasting valuable rockets.
They colocated an ammunition dump with the barracks and one of the HIMARS rockets hit that. The building is just gone.
