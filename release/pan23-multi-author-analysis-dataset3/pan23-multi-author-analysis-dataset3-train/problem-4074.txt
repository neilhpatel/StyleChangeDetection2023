If it was even 10% that would mean collapse of our healthcare system. Even 1% frankly, in addition to covid. We're already on the brink as it is. People aren't going in to work at 10%, 1% maybe for a little bit until it seemed pointless, but again, we've already depleted our resources enough that the margins are razor thin.
Doesn't make a difference. That wouldn't be the issue if this had human to human transmission. The way the virus binds in birds lungs is different than it does in mammals lungs. A lot of people wouldn't be effected by avian flu as it currently stands, we have a natural mechanism to not catch it. If it mutates to infect mammals easier that means that mechanism is gone, much like covid with ACE2 binding.
Not necessarily. Covid didn't become less deadly when it infected us. It became exponentially more deadly. As far as we know it doesn't even kill other animals in large amounts.
There is a vaccine. And a medication to treat it. But it would still be really bad. And flu viruses mutate constantly so it would require constant vigilance and uptake of boosters and etc. Like our current pandemic but FOR REALS FOR REALS cause people couldn't ignore the fallout of this one. (Also young people would be the main ones dying so suddenly people would be clutching their pearls a lot more).
There are a lot of people who look at other people dying as an opportunity. It's hard to interpret some of the responses to Covid in any other way. If anything, a higher death rate might make things worse.
The more people infected, the greater the economic damage and the longer it will last. It can be built right into a mathematical equation.
All together, that tells the world to contain the spread as much as possible and to find a vaccine as fast as possible. The more effectively that you do those two things, the less the economic damage in total.
