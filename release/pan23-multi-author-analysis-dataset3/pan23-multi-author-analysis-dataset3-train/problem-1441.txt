It basically would require another $150 billion/year in new taxes, which roughly works out to an additional $3,750 in taxes for every single Californian.
I would too, but there's no way our state would vote to approve it. California as a state is pretty center-left because it's mostly made up of center-left people. They'll never vote for a conservative Republican (in the near future at least), but they also tend to vote against real liberal ideas.
However, he does represent the party and voters generally. Most Dems and voters generally are moderate and not progressive, even in California. It might be a blue state, but it has heavy conservative and moderate leanings too. He still seems to be effective at tackling climate change and keeping the economy churning at least. I would definitely classify him as neoliberal based on the description in this article but he's effective and represents his state's general leanings.
And anyway, this strategy of "compromising" with Republicans is basically the centerpiece of neo-liberal ideology, so that's probably also a big reason why people say that about him that he's neoliberal.
Also I forgot to mention that "wE hAvE tO cOmPrOmIsE" doesn't really work as an excuse for vetoing bills that already passed through the legislature, including expansions in student financial aid, paid family leave, drug rehab, a mandate for police to receive training in ethics and interpersonal communication etc., all of which had bipartisan support.
I kind of think no matter what I had actually written in you would have responded the same way, that it was somehow justified because cOmPrOmIsEEEeeee.
