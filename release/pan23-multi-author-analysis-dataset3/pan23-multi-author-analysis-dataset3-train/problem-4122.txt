This is critically important to call out. It’s not about how someone looks. It’s about how someone thinks.
This is a really thought provoking notion. Even though I’m a complete non-historian, this definitely seems intuitive based on what we have all seen and learned about society and ourselves- letting a problem fester and boil over until it gets out of hand is never a good approach. Making some small, incremental changes to the existing system should not be a big ask but could go a long way toward reducing loss of life.
They’re not wrong for wanting to do so; such measures have worked well in other Western nations and the epidemic of mass gun violence in the U.S. using AR-15 type rifles is absolutely horrific.
Unfortunately in this country, the problem is we already have an abundance of guns, so bans will do little to nothing unless they also plan to take people's existing guns away.
Now, to be clear: I don’t think we can do much about the gun problem- 400,000,000 guns is 400,000,000 guns, and even halving that number wouldn’t do much to functionally address how easy it is to get a gun. And I furthermore don’t think we need to do anything about alcohol. There are 350,000,000 people in this country. Some.
