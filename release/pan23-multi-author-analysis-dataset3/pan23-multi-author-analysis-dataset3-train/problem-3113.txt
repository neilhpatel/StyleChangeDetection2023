For most states, including WA, home daycare care ratios are handled differently. Centers are supposed to go by the youngest child in the group with a set ratio like that. Family/home daycare has a specific set of max capacity&ratios, determined by the mix of differently aged children.
As a former daycare provider, I would try to accommodate, but expecting you to blend foods is too much. I would require them to bring rtf food, either made themselves or formula. Specialized diets should be on the parent, not the provider.
In the end, if you cannot accommodate, then you can't. Can always do a trial & if it doesn't work out, give notice. I would accommodate say...a breastfeeding mom to stop in on lunch break, but if it caused chaos & confusion, I would dissallow due to disruption. So mom or someone mom appoints could stop in to do the noon ube feed if it was something you can't to. But I would rather expect the parent to do the AM tube feed, just like I would expect them to give AM meds or a baby their am bottle before dropping them off into my care. Hugs & good luck!
Since he is eating orally(or even if he wasn't), his feeds can likely be done a the same time while he is sitting a the table eating with everyone else.
Sounds like they were doing it for supplemental nutrition and not due to a swallowing problem. There are now nutrition products under the classification of "real food blends" which are a babyfood consistency that can be used for tube feeding in certain cases (flavors are chicken and rice, beef and potato, salmon and kale, etc). If the doctor OKs making your own then it should be fine as long as the consistency is correct, but this all seems too much for a small inhome daycare. If she really wanted to try she should ask for the doctor to set up a teaching with a nurse to train her on how to do it.
