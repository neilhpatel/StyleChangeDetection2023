Very true. But there is a difference between things happening and things being fully sanctioned by law. There is (spotty, difficult) recourse for domestic violence in a lot of places. I say this as someone whose friend had her husband locked up for domestic violence.
Yes, every culture has flaws, we should all work to grow and improve â€” but not all cultures are equal. Some have a bright future and some are so awful that the dustbin of history is the best place for them. It seems to me Russia will need to discard a significant portion of its culture if it has any hope of a better tomorrow.
The original statement was that Russian culture was rotten TO THE CORE, as in toss the whole apple out. It's not like I love Russia, or even know that much about it, I just know that their citizens are still people and on the whole are probably not ALL entirely evil all the way through every day.
So when people call Russian culture rotten, it's not all of it, but it is a considerable, dominant chunk of it that affects in a general way the Russian society.
The Russian leaders - Putin and the rest of the filth - are a direct product of Russian culture and Russian society. They do not and can not exist in a void, and are deeply connected to Russian culture.
