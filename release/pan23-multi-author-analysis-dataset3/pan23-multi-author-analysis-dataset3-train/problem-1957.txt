I'm so sorry for your loss. Your best bet is to contact a malpractice attorney. It's not "foul play" because that implies a willful intent to kill instead of a medically related negligence.
The problem is that he died an attended death in a hospital and likely a doctor signed the death certificate, so in a statutory sense, they certified the likely cause of death (in their opinion), so they consider an autopsy unnecessary.
If you are convinced that your father needs an autopsy with toxicology to establish “foul play”, negligent or an accidental death, you would need the help of an attorney. Also, you would need the witness to be willing and able to corroborate your suspicion.
Consulting with a medical malpractice attorney who will be able to obtain your father’s medical records can still help you even if an autopsy/toxicology was not performed. These days most medical health documentation is done through electronic medical records.
It would be helpful if you could answer questions about his age, pre-existing medical conditions and what out-patient surgery he was scheduled to have. Why do you say you are “getting the run around”?
