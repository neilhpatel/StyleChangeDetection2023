Thank you so much. Yes I am so vulnerable right now and it is mind boggling to think there are people out there who take advantage of that. Also I would like to note that on Reddit in general there seem to be lots of mean people but here in this sub I have seen nothing but the best side of people. luckily my family knows the funeral home and they have been really great as well. They were basically talking me out of things to help keep the cost down! Again thank you for the help and for being so great to me.
Thanks very much for the great advice. Yeah I just found out about two seconds ago that my son, trying to do me a favor, called one of the companies and was talking about making a payment to them… Hopefully he didn’t screw me over by doing this but I’m assuming since he is a completely different person than me not living with us I should be OK… lol Bless his heart for trying to help though.
OK will do. Thank you for all this great information. Yes you are right, I am in a pretty weird state of mind right now but I have to say, people like you and everyone else here are helping not only with good advice but also just with making me feel like I’m not alone on the planet. Thank you so much.
I'm glad I could help. Not all attorneys will want thousands of dollars, so it is always worth your while to at least talk to someone and see. Good luck.
