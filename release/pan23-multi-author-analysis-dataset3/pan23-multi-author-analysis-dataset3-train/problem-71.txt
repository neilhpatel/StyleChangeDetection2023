I don't need a loan lol. It's an emotional reason for not wanting to live here, and I'm about $20k short of paying off the mortgage outright if needed. I'm ok with losing money. I just don't want to live here for my mental health. But of course I want to lose the least amount of money as possible and close this chapter of life and move on.
Yes. What is the definition of a principal residence? If you have multiple houses I believe the definition falls on the number of days that you live in each house, and only one can be your principal residence.
What you’re talking about might work if you had a summer house and could say “in the year I spent x time in my principal residence and y (y<X) time in my summer home.”.
Renting a partial property is worth far less than renting exclusive use of a property. My house that may be worth $2,000 per month as a house might be worth half that if I hold back a bedroom.
But in this case you will have moved out of it and made it a rental property. Which means it will have distinctly not been your principal residence for a year.
You’d likely lose more in your scheme (that still probably doesn’t work) than you would in simply refinancing the property to the kind of loan you might actually need.
