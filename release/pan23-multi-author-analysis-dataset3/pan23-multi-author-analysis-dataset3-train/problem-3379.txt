I have this question do. What exactly can this guy get for Russia at this point? There is no secret cache of weapons, Russia has been buying all they could and they essentially ran out. This guy has been in US custody long enough that he has likely spilled many of his secrets to get better prison perks.
Exactly! This guy has been in US custody for too long to be considered completely safe. I guess I just can't imagine there isn't an arm's dealer in the war Russia hasn't contacted.
From what I heard the US didn't have much leverage in this case and Russia could pressure them for whoever they wanted in exchange. But that's besides the point, since I have trouble believing there's been no one trafficking arms with Bout in prison.
IMO there's a very small chance that he goes back into arms smuggling. Russia is likely not interested in selling its remaining weapons, and they don't really need any help getting their weapons transported to the theater of war, since it's right at their doorstep.
That's a good point, I hadn't even considered that yet. Russia is well-known for using social media as a weapon, so this was likely all planned from the start.
Bout is infamous for doing the latter. What makes him special is that he's a smuggler. Practically anybody can be a middleman and buy weapons on behalf of their country. But he was special because he could sell Soviet weapons to places that have arms embargos by hiding the arms alongside his legitimate legal cargo.
