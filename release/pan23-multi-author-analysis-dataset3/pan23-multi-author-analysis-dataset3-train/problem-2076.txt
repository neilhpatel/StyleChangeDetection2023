I agree. It's a little like the kid getting angry at the strict parent saying no, after their more lenient parent had said yes.
Are you 100% sure of that? If so, fight to the death with the biggest nuclear power in the world. By fight, I mean, let the Ukrainians fight to the death?? 150k and counting.
It's possible Putin is using NATO (nuclear weapons in his doorstep) as a pretext to complete, one sided aggression.
It would be highly paternalistic to say "No, we know better than you and we think you should surrender to the Russians, despite your willingness to fight, because we're scared that Russia might nuke Ukraine." Doing this and stopping support to Ukraine would only prolong suffering and drag out.
Germany is one of two countries that has committed a billion dollar Patriot system to Ukraine, and one of three countries that are sending IFVs to Ukraine. Their reluctance to send German tanks (don't believe PiS propaganda that they are blocking tank re-exports) is similar to the Americans' reluctance to send US Abrams, and at least the Germans have the excuse of deep seated cultural hesitancy and 10x less tanks than the US has.
