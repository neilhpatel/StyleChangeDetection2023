Who cares what he says? He's claimed he would never invade, then he did. He claimed he was fighting against Nazis, and he isn't. He claimed he's fighting against Satan, the US, NATO, etc... but the reality is still that this is just a failed invasion of a neighbor that could end any time Putin decides to end it.
Naturally, that isn’t what Putin is claiming on the surface - he’s claiming some sort of deep-seated plot on the part of the West to destroy Russia, one that predates his own invasion (and in fact made it necessary). He’s attempting to reverse cause and effect.
It makes perfect sense, in a way. Russia has declared parts of Ukraine to in fact be Russia. The West hopes to aid Ukraine in taking those parts back. Therefore, the West seeks to help Ukraine “dismember” Russia.
If Putin Khan means Ukraine taking back what Russia "annexed", then yeah, the West is certainly seeking the dismemberment of Russia.
Putin logic: Putin has to win + Putin has to do things that are likely to lead to civil war to win (mobilization etc) = therefore the west is dismembering Russia by making Putin do reckless things to win.
edit: one thing that is certain, the world needs a gameplan for tracking Russian nukes because Putin is right, the wheels are likely to come off the wacky Russian clowncar.
