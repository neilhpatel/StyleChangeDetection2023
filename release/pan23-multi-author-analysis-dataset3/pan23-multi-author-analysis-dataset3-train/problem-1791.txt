He views moving in with you as attaining a large cash asset for himself. That’s not a good view point considering you own it. I would seriously reconsider letting him move in at all.
It sounds like his family is WAY too up in his business and is twisting his ear. He’s got no legal leg to stand on.
It’s still rent, and you can offer him a lease agreement for a year. But you don’t get rental payments back when you leave an apartment- it’s absurd for him to think he gets equity in the house you own- if he is renting from you.
If the two of you were paying rent on a house owned by a landlord, and you split up, he wouldn't own a fraction of the landlord's property.
Make him sign a rental agreement/lease so that if you break up he can't sue you for part of the equity. And honestly, a breakup seems likely, since he is already planning for it. He's not putting half the down payment, it's not his credit on the line, he is a renter.
He pays rent to you, the landlord, who can use the money as they please. If you choose to put money he pays towards mortgage cool. If you wanna front the whole payment yourself and save what he is paying cool.
