Yes companies can do it. They can hire you as an independent contractor. You would fill out a W-8BEN, which is a tax form establishing that you are a tax citizen of X country (in this case, Bangladesh). This will then determine how your income is taxed in the US. There is a tax treaty between the US and Bangladesh which will lay out the withholding.
We have been approached by various firms. Some say you have a dedicated worker in that foreign country, but most say you send the work that needs to be done and they do it and you really dont have any interaction. But, ultimately, the agency takes on the burden of administration and other aspects of the employment.
While it is not overly difficult, there are some additional administrative burdens on the company. Its not uncommon to have remote workers in my industry, but generally agencies are used.
I dont know how the agency finds the foreign individuals, but yes they generally take on the burden of hiring and handling the employees.
Title: I have been told that as a non-US national living outside the US, it is illegal for US companies to hire me as a remote employee. Is this true?
