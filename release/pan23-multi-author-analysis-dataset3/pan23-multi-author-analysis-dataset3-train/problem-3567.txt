That means, depending on the model you go with, you could get a brand new induction or electric stove for as little as just a couple hundred dollars.
Do they plan to replace anyone who has a gas stove already or is that another 600 out of my pocket that I just spent to replace my last oven to this one.
My wife and I recently moved from a house with a gas stove (and furnace, dryer, water heater, fireplace) and we now have a brand new induction stove in our new home. Takes a bit of getting used to, but we already love it. Can't believe how quickly it can boil a pot of water, etc.
