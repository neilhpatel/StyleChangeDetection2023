Woof. The home inspector would have just been inspecting the home, not usually the entire property. And the surveyor is measuring property lines and acreage, not if there is a dump on the property. They don't usually walk the property. If you missed it, it's possible they did too.
However, other questions come to mind. Like where did the tires come from? Who is dumping them? If you can find the party responsible, you may have a different angle.
The disclaimer is a different thing. It allows sellers to list any latent defects in the property, but it allows the seller to make "no representations or warranties as to the condition of the real property or any improvements." Which is essentially saying "this is what I'm telling you is wrong, but you assume full responsibility of everything even if it's not disclosed.".
For the most part. Depending on how deep. 50 to 100 tires doesn't sound bad, I've dealt with a 400 plus pile that two people cleaned up in a few hours. Bugs, yuck water, wires, will be the worst issue. Gloves and clothes you don't mind getting dirty are a plus.
