If this unit is not in town boundaries, they many not have permits at all. My county doesn't issue permits at all. You simply do what you want, and if you screw it up and burn down your home, well, if you didn't pay your membership fee to the volunteer fire department, they will probably show up to make sure the fire doesn't spread, but may not even fight the fire at your home.
Many small towns and rural areas don't require any permits, so it is very possible to do all this work without a permit. Where I live, I can do ANYTHING to an owner occupied unit, and only certain things need a permit if I hire it out.
Where I live you technically need a permit to change a faucet, you need a permit to paint a ceiling if you use a ladder to do so.
I understand that states and towns vary widely, but I find it hard to believe that there is anywhere in the country that you can do plumbing work and tear a room down to the studs, and not require a permit.
If no permits have been pulled, I would contact code enforcement and verify that the work being done does not require a permit.
You know if permits are required to conduct this work? Obtaining permits can take weeks along with getting on the contractorâ€™s schedule. Home improvement contractors are extremely busy.
