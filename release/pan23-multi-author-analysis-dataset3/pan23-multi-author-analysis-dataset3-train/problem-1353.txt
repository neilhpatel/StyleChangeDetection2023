Like the reason he won is because the worst of the worst senior citizens from every other state moved down there. It explains why every other state is getting bluer.
I like how a lot of state Republican parties are looking at how DeSantis is able to win over senior citizens and Cubans in bright red Florida as if he is somehow a compelling candidate to swing states.
If it wasn't for the outdated election system and the decades of GOP de-democratification of state election systems, the GOP would be luck y to win a Congressional house once every 10 years.
Any Dem should win based on issues that most of us support, for example, not overthrowing fair elections, rec cannabis, equality, healthcare for all, expanded voting access to increase voter turnout. Everything the maga party does is horrible and most of us don't want that.
That is unfortunate so many people don't understand who/what they vote for bc maga party doesn't support anything most of us want. They depend on this stupidity you mention that decides elections.
