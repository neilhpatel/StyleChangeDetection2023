im sure they are worried about polonium tea. But even if they werent taking someones bribe and not delivering means that next time they might not be able to get as many bribes. and they really like bribes.
Are they really bribing you that much? Isn't there a US Billionaire out there with deeper pockets? My lord.
I mean the war is one thing, which is a huge deal in itself. But they are known for consistently cheating in the Olympics every single time.
Even forgetting about the hundred or so players who were proven to have cheated during the Sochi Olympicsâ€¦.
That said it's been obvious for years that Russia's slap on the wrist from the IOC was ineffective and the result of corruption. How that didn't result in a completely new governance structure is beyond me. It damages the entire enterprise economically just so some assholes can get bribes.
We often compare things to abstract perfection. But that's not right--you need to compare to the next reasonable alternative. Maybe here that means watching a show that was actually produced by Harvey Weinstein 2.0? Hard to say, anyway.
Hmm, it's a mixed bag. These athletes have poured the best physical years of their lives into it, often for shit pay and no reward. They're aware of the cheating and corruption and bullshit much more than I am as a random occasional spectator. If they're alright putting up with the shitty system, I figure I can be too.
