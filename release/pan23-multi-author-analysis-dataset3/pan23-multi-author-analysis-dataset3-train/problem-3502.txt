When your military doctrine involves being able to fight 2 different wars in 2 different parts of the world at the same time, you're gonna need a lot of equipment in storage.
With the US military's logistical behemoth.. it's not a question of 'Can we support this firebase in the middle of enemy territory?' It's 'Do we put a McDonalds or Burger King on our new FOB?'.
The Abrams is not a tank that exists in a void, it is a complete weapons system. That includes multiple M-88A2 recovery vehicles for each unit/division of tanks, Fuel delivery vehicles to keep up with the RAVENOUS appetite of the machines (Probably HEMTTs, as Ukraine has some already and is familiar) depot facility tooling, spares, and maintenance/operational training.
The US would not supply the ones that have the specialized Depleted Uranium armor. They would get the export 'FMS' armor. And they'd 'downgrade' the weapons stabilization, electronics, and electro-optical systems to exportable units or off the shelf units from other countries.
