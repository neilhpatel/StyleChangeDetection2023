Wow. I had no idea, I just go to the drive through testing place and it’s free so I assumed it was that way everywhere. I guess just do the right thing and get vaccinated, it’s free and then you don’t ever have to worry about it again.
Anyone who claims this is the reason they aren't vaccinated is full of shit, anyway. They aren't vaccinated because they don't want to be vaccinated. Because they've decided they know science better than scientists, because YouTube conspiracy theorists are more credible than PhD virologists and epidemiologists, or because their political leanings are more important to them than their health or the health of those around them.
But getting a shot or going to CVS for a swab? No. Those are neither unreasonable or insurmountable.
A COVID test done by a medical provider is a medical test. It is not equivalent to "sharing biometric data with a third party" or "giving their name to a third party" because you used some sketchy app. If this "consumer" thinks this is unreasonable, do they avoid all medical care for this reason?
Private companies are making decisions for the vast majority of their customers and their employees that they choose not to do business with those who refuse not only a vaccine but a simple test. They are entitled to do so. Those who refuse a vaccine or test are entitled to stay home where they can't put anyone else in danger.
