You can't deport her. That's a federal action, and since she's already got her green card, it'll be difficult for the government to kick her out.
If you're bound and determined to see her deported, then file the police report. I think you have three years from the offense. But filling it is the only way to get anything done that might affect her immigration status.
And yes, they may well ask you why you waited. That's something you'll have to figure out yourself. But it's not that uncommon for people to wait to file on things like that.
Edit: to answer the question, she can be deported if she commits certain crimes. See for more info. But you need to file a police report, and she needs to be charged and convicted of the crime.
After you report the crime, it's up to the police whether anything happens and on what schedule. The process is out of your hands at that point. He may be charged immediately, charged after an investigation, or not charged at all.
If she is charged and convicted, then she may or may not face deportation proceedings. That part's up to the government as well.
