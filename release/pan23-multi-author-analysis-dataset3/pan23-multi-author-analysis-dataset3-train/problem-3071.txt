they don't know what they're talking about. in another comment they referred me to portugal - who still confiscate and arrest people for moving drugs. possession is decriminalised, and that has seen notable effect, but trafficking is wholly illegal.
The funny thing is that they now have enough cocaine to anihilate the illegal market, keep users safe, and put billions into the government's pockets.
Well, if drugs were legalized and regulated (which controls quality, purity, and eliminates the black market while bringing in tax revenue to pay for programs) they wouldn't have this problem. I have had this talk with my dad a million times. Legality doesn't stop people from doing drugs. Some, sure, but most will get it if they want it. When you make it legal, you give them a safer and better kind of access while eliminating the black market and creating tax revenue to support things like addiction and crisis outreach / rehabilitation. And educating people about the real dangers. But it eliminates deaths from laced product, which is another big win imo.
