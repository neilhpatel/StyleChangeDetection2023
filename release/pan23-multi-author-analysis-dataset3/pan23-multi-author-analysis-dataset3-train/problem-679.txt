Digital versions of STM books can be very costly to produce (they have to be accessable and getting typesetters to handle complex layouts for maths and things properly is tricky).
If everyone was willing to accept pdf only, no physical print books, costs could go down quite a bit. That's not the case though (which I'm sure sounds mad to a lot of people here - who I'm sure are quite happy with a pdf version).
I can see us abandoning physical for a portion of our list in the next 5 to 10 years, but it will be a long time before everything goes digital.
There's also the question of authors still wanting their books in print (which is quite a significant cost).
Many of these publishers have standing orders with university libraries where the books are bought sight-unseen. This is particularly the case with some of the major European academic publishers like Brill, De Gruyter, etc (at least in the humanities). So that means that university libraries have these books shipped to them the moment they're available for sale.
The question you are really asking is, should there exist books that are only sale-able to universities? And the answer is probably "yes" (because scholarship is not always for the general public) but the long-term answer is "things are probably going to change in the next half-century" (because there are now alternative modes for delivering hyper-specific information other than putting it into a big, expensive bound book). Already universities that have begun cutting back on their scholarly purchases, which is starting to put constraints on the venues available to scholars.
