"[by 1916 Russia] annihilated nearly two thirds of Austria-Hungaryâ€™s eastern-front army: 600,000 enemy dead and wounded, 400,000 captured. A shattered Austrian chief of staff warned that 'peace must be made in not too long a space, or we shall be fatally weakened, if not destroyed.'".
I think it is more nuanced than that. In Stephen Kotkin's "Stalin: Paradoxes of Power" he cites some interesting statistics on Russian involvement in WWI:
The "defeat" was more internal- 1917 revolution had occurred in Russia with support from Germany, again from Kotkin:
And one last point to remember: the Germans and their allies may have been defeated in 1941-1945, but it's not like invaders of Russia are always defeated. The German invasion of Russia in 1914-1918 resulted in Russian defeat, a massively one-sided peace treaty, and German control of massive swathes of the Russian Empire. The fact they lost those gains so quickly had to do with their defeat in Western Europe.
I'll also point out that while exceptionally cold weather is a feature of Russian winters (and the winters of 1812 and 1941 were colder than usual on top of that), the exceptional cold tends to be cold snaps and passing conditions, rather than a constant. A continental winter of 0 to -10 C is nothing to sniff at, but it feels very different than - 40 C, which at longest tends to last a week or two.
The 588th Night Bomber Regiment, aka the "Night Witches" was an all-female Soviet air unit that is probably the most well-known Soviet female detachment these days, but I will shamelessly also plug Kazakh sniper and Hero of the Soviet Union .
On the subject of Kazakh female war heroes, Moldagulova is almost always mentioned in tandem with , a machine-gunner who was also given the posthumous title of the Hero of Soviet Union (the first Kazakh woman to receive it).
