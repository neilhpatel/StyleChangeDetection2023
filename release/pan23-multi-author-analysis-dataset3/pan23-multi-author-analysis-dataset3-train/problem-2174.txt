You think the delay was benign and not indicative of a pending rejection? Still no answer from FFL as to reason of delay.
Not family, just some nutjob who threatened to kill me, came at me, and had to see a gun to back off, then started playing victim - ugh... went no contest on 2 misdemeanors.
Well it forbids you, seemingly, from PURCHASING one. Which I apparently did after the FFL delay expired without answer from Oregon State Police who may or may not have forbid it - I dunno - feels like it's on them.So yeah I got my shotty...
Digging more into this while going over it with you seems to support that. I found "relationship requirements" and though the charges are listed as "qualifying misdemeanors" without a direct reference to the relationship factors; it seems (hopefully) safe to assume I'm in the clear and those qualifying MUST have the relationship factor to affect my 2A... I think.
That's not quite right. Oregon does classify certain domestic misdemeanors (using or threatening force or a deadly weapon) as disqualifying you from possessing firearms, but it's not subject to a 4 year limitation.
Oregon law doesn't make possession unlawful for misdemeanor convictions except for when those misdemeanors are related to domestic violence.
These laws don't specifically relate to firearm purchases--they are regarding possession in general, which includes purchase.
