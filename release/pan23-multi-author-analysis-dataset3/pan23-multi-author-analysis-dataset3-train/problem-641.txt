This really isn't a legal question, but you're going to want to report the extent of the damage and request professional remediation or that water will cause mold/mildew.
>If after a casualty loss the rental premises are as a practical matter totally unusable for residential purposes and if the casualty loss is not caused by the negligence or fault of the tenant, a member of the tenantâ€™s family, or a guest or invitee of the tenant, either the landlord or the tenant may terminate the lease by giving written notice to the other any time before repairs are completed. If the lease is terminated, the tenant is entitled only to a pro rata refund of rent from the date the tenant moves out and to a refund of any security deposit otherwise required by law.
At this point all I want is to be let out of our lease early (it expires March 24th) and maybe reimbursed for our apartment being unlivable for at least this one week. Is that reasonable?
This test is a balancing test, and it's about reasonableness. What is wrong with the kitchen would determine what's liveable. And landlords are going to get leeway they wouldn't otherwise get right now, because the MASSIVE shortage of skilled trades to repair damage across the state.
