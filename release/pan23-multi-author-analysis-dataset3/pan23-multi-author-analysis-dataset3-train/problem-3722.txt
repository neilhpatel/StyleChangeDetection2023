There is no indication from your post that you would qualify for an annulment after the cruise. You would probably have to get a divorce, and deal with things like the disposition of assets, and spousal support, etc.
You should expect that if you do this, your only option would be to end the marriage via a divorce with all the associated costs and process. Divorces are almost never quick, even when both parties agree, and many states have substantial waiting periods. Until that process is complete, you will be considered legally married, and that could have a variety of implications for you.
You could get legally married, but if you are in the US, it's doubtful you would have any grounds for annulment. If you want to post your location, someone can likely speak more to that. Edit: this would not qualify for an annulment in NJ, your only option would be divorce.
No, but you likely won't qualify for an annulment and the divorce process will be far more complicated than you think it will be. It's not a great idea in the long run.
