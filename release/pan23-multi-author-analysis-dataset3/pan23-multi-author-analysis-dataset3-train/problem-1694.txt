t was a typical Wednesday evening when John sat down to read the latest issue of his favorite comic book series. As he turned the pages, his eyes were drawn to a strange panel that featured a nuclear missile with the name "Satan" emblazoned on its side.
John's search for information about the Satan missile led him down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and shadowy government secrets. He spent countless hours combing through obscure websites and forums, trying to find any clues that might lead him closer to the truth.
Finally, after months of tireless investigation, John was able to trace the message back to its source. It led him to a small, nondescript office building on the outskirts of town, where he found himself standing in front of a plain metal door with a handwritten sign that read "John Smith.".
True. Last year I took two long(ish) breaks but had trouble waiting in between. So, this year I decided to just take as many Fridays off as I could. Got a bunch of three day weekends out of it but I think the burnout is even worse. IDK.
