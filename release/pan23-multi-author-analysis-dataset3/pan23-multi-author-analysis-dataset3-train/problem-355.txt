Not practical reasons, but theological ones too. Despite what today's cynical worldview may entail, people in the Middle Ages, even popes and kings, were deeply spiritual people who, while capable of contradiction or even self-delusion (looking at you, Crusades), ultimately cared a lot about the well being of their soul. So, while there are practical reasons for this case, there are also religious reasons behind it.
TL;DR: The Church, despite coming from the same stock as the nobles, often formed its own block with its own goals, and often clashed with the nobles. Consent was a way for the Church to take control away from the marriage customs of the post-Roman aristocracy. The reasons for this were also theological: sacraments require your consent, you can't become a Christian by force, just like you can't marry by force.
Also, by 1400 AD there are many laws decreeing that marriages need to be public affairs, and one has to wonder how often did people marry in secret. It seems that the idea of marriage as a social tool and not a romantic bond was already a challenge for many, although this would probably happen much more often in cities, where more anonymity was possible. This became such a problem, apparently, that King James I of Aragon decreed exile (for those citizens of towns in his kingdom, not for everyone) who married without their parents consent in 1219. The Church, though, always defended that marriage was valid if the couple consented, even in secret.
What practical reasons might the Church have had for maintaining the legitimacy of secret marriages? My understanding is that the Church was as political as any secular group, so why would they be at odds with say, noble classes that might want to undo secretive ‘illegitimate’ marriages between their children?
