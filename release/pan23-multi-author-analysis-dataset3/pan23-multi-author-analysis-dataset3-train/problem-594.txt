Edit: lots of people are incorrectly stating that itâ€™s only the Ukrainian military fighting Russia. .

They might not have won the whole war but there would 100% definitely be more Jews now than there are had they been armed and able to even put up an armed resistance to escape. They were disarmed for a specific reason after all. It's a lot harder to oppress armed peoples.
They aren't fighting back with mere small arms. They have Javelin missiles that destroy tanks. And anti aircraft weapons. They are getting new tanks as well. The point being, the arms they are fighting with would be illegal for American citizens to own.
