Well, since it would involve changing the government, it can never happen and we should instead plug our ears and cry about how things are bad.
The solution is to try to change this in as many districts as possible, not to pretend the problem doesn't exist.
Those examples don't in any way invalidate my point though, because we're talking about Democratic voters as a whole, not those in specific cherry picked places. Yes, there are individual states and districts that are more than happy to nominate and elect progressives; nobody with a brain would deny that. But the party as a whole, nationwide, doesn't work that way. Where her district is more than willing to elect someone like AOC, good luck with a candidate like her in huge swathes of the rest of the country.
If the Democrats nominated strongly progressive candidates in every congressional district in the country they'd get crushed, because those candidates don't play in a huge number of otherwise winnable districts. The party as a whole is nowhere near as progressive as you and I would prefer, but reality is what it is.
Yeah, but progressive policies poll really really well across both parties. It's more a problem of media and messaging. Face it, we the people, are getting screwed by corporate money controlling politics. The average citizen overwhelmingly supports super progressive policies if you phrase them in non-partisan terms.
