The normal response here is that medical malpractice cases are very fact-specific, and so they are beyond our capabilities here. You'd need to talk to a medical malpractice attorney; find one by checking the NY State Bar.
You can consult with a malpractice attorney for confirmation of this, but you are being very litigious here.
You don’t need to understand how the process of suing works, because you don’t have any damages and no viable malpractice case.
It doesn’t appear you have any damages so you wouldn’t have anything to sue for however a Medical Malpractice lawyer could give you more information. FYI- Often times UTIs clear up on their own especially if you didn’t have symptoms antibiotics might not have been needed.
If you weren't having urinary symptoms, you didn't have a UTI. The hospital was right. Whoever else you talked to was wrong. Not to mention even if you did have a UTI they didn't treat, it wouldn't be malpractice unless you had real consequences.
Imagine trying to sue the people who were there risking their lives helping you, during a pandemic, for no reason. Way to thank them, right? You have no damages...
