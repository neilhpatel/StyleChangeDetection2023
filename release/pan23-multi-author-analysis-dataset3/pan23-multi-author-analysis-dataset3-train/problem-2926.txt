I disagree. It is her full legal name. She is a staunchly anti-immigrant child of immigrants - a hypocrite of the highest order. Calling her that would mock her hypocrisy, not her race.
I think your conflating the "Racism doesnt exist" line. What she is actually saying is Melting pot vs Salad. She's a second generation immigrant and a POC. She is saying that rather than being defined as "an Indian immigrant" she wants to be an American. She also removed the confederate flag from the state capitol.
I think her time at the UN was great. She had an iron fist and helped reign in the out of control funding we give to some foreign countries. She's the least whacko person from the Trump administration.
Moving the embassy to Jerusalem is a complicated situation. Alot of folks support it and alot of people don't. Before you criticize the move, you should read Some history on the Israel/Palestine conflict. Don't believe what the celebrities tell you. They don't have foreign policy experience.
I understand your trepidation towards her. But I think she's the most palatable republican in the past few years. She's POC, an immigrant, raised in a religion that wasn't Christianity. She's the most compelling candidate that could actually gain support from the center and democrats.
But she's actually a strong candidate. She situates herself dead center while also appealing to the nut bars of the gop. This isnt something that DeSantis and Trump can do.
