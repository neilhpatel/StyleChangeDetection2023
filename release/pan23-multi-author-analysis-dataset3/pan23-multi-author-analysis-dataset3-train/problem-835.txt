Ok, but that's not the discussion, is it? I'm just surprised that conservatives would admit that they're behind on other countries regarding non binary sexes.
ya, considering how serious and stupid the arguments about who counts as a a tru swiss person get, I'm surprised they even considered a non binary gender question at all.
In Switzerland (assuming German), are sex and gender used interchangeably or for two different things? Languages don’t all have equivalents in verbiage and structure….
So, sex and gender are the same word? Are there any hard equivalents to gender and sex, in English, or is this a matter of “hey, we don’t have another word, so we have to use this to signify the English equivalent of sex”?
If gender and sex meant the same thing, then there wouldn't even be 2 different words for it. Read some school books jeeze.
I'm not a native speaker. Do I miss something out? Gender is how you identify yourself in society, so it makes sense that some people want more than 2 options.
If it brings that many problems and the govt wants to make things easier, why even ask people their gender (especially if you need to choose out of given options)? Just ask their sex. Why did people start asking gender, if all they want to know is one's assigned in documents sex?
Then why does it matter what gender you are? Just give sex boxes. Why add a gender option, if gender is how YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF, not your sex. Not like there are 2 options possible, so why even ask such information (especially via boxes)? Just ask their sex.
