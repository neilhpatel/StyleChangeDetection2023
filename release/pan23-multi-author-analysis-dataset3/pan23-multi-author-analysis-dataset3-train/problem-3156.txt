They got new engines… in the 1960’s. They are really outdated and every contract to replace them has blown up for various reasons. They are becoming quite expensive to operate as few civilian planes still use the same cores, making parts super expensive. Also they use about 40% more fuel than an updated engine would, adding to operational cost.
Also the Russian fighting doctrine is different from ours, so isn’t as focused on air strenh alone. We basically won’t fight unless we own the air first.
They opened the attack with strikes on known SAM sites, and known locations of the Ukrainian Air Force. This forced both to disperse, so the Ukrainian air defenses weren’t in great shape for the first week. But the thing is they were tipped off about the incoming attack so most of their stuff survived and they were able to keep at least some air defense active. While the sorties rate was pretty low for Ukraine, they were able to keep their airspace at least contested so Russia couldn’t operate with impunity.
And what prevented them from doing it when they actually had more aircraft, more pilots and Ukraine was less capable of defending? They can plan for whatever they want. Doesn't mean it's gonna actually do anything. Succesfully at least.
I mean, you can fly pretty much anything that can carry bombs in uncontested airspace. Doesn't matter how old, it'll do fine. In Ukraine a B-52 would be shot down in 2 seconds.
