What is the wording of your vacation benefit? Is it specifically outlined that vacation is selected by the employee or can it be selected by the employer?
Yes, employers can dictate when you take vacation time as long as they give it in 1-week increments unless mutually agreed to be shorter. It’s common in some industries.
So you took 9 days off and got paid for them, but then worked unpaid overtime to make it up. You’ll essentially get paid those days twice - vacation pay that they already gave you and the overtime you can claim.
There are two options here: either you took those 2 weeks as vacation, and they must pay you for your overtime at a rate of 1 1/2 times your salary for the overtime you did (per s. 22 of the Act) or you didn't take that time as vacation, and you are entitled to the remainder of your vacation.
So in this case they told me a few weeks before their vacation that they were leaving and said they wanted me to work extra hours "here and there" to make up for me being paid during their 2 week absence. In the weeks leading up to their vacation I worked 17hrs of overtime. In the weeks following I worked over 45hrs. One of the days they were on vacation was a statutory holiday, so I only had 9 days of paid days to make up for. Hopefully that all made sense, I know it is a bit confusing.
