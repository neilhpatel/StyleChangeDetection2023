Canadian elections are run at a pittance relative to US elections. There are strict campaign donation and election spending laws that are regularly protected. They’re also less predictable and run for a fraction of the time. All in all, makes Canada less susceptible to foreign financial interference.
The problem rather is the Chinese state exerting influence over candidate selection and promotion to ex-pat Chinese communities.
I think it is a mistake to think that China would like to support particular candidates to pursue a greater political narrative.
This problem impacts both parties as China will attempt to buy over anyone amenable to their cause and your partisan bullshit on this issue is itself subversion.
It also distracts from evidence that we have that the Chinese are very much attempting to influence all parties. In the last election we had disturbing allegations of electoral interference against conservative candidates, including who proposed a registry to track foreign influence in election campaigns. O’Toole also alleged interference which initially seemed like sour grapes until CSIS confirmed that there were indeed significant attempts to influence certain ridings.
Focusing solely on perceived enemies and false equivalencies (conservative MP’s ≠ QAnon nutters) not only suggests your personal bias (hence my disengagement), but is used by bad state actors to foment civil strife as a secondary goal.
I don’t like these QAnon nutters either, and it’s been widely suggested that these folks are being unwittingly influenced by foreign actors - but if you let your personal bias blind you to how widespread this is, it hurts the country.
