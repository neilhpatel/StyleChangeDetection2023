"The Shahi Imam of Ahemdabadâ€™s Jama Masjid Shabbir Ahmed Siddiqui in Gujarat made controversial remarks on December 4 saying those who give election tickets to Muslim women are against Islam and weakening the religion.".
Ah yeah, you might be right. At the same time women were also doing the best they could too, protecting the home when alone as well caring for children.

It already happened. I'm not saying woman ARE subservient, I'm pointing out the fact that there's a lot of shit in religions that people don't know about and use contradicting claims as an excuse to be shitty to people. Your missing the point of my comment.
