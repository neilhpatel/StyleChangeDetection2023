I really like this comment, but unfortunately I can't believe we are going to have another 20 year runway. American democracy is in dire shape. I'm pretty sure voting now or 2024 are what we have left.
That will lead to more GOP power consolidation and more people rationally deciding their vote doesn't matter. Until we mirror Russia, and our elections are a sham played out only for the ruling GOP to maintain a veil of legitimacy.
Republicans have shown what they do when they have the power to change voting rules and keep themselves in power. Look to Wisconsin, North Carolina, the same fight in Georgia playing out again. They will find a way for roughly 50% of democratic voters to get 1/3rd or less of the representation.
According to AP, only 12 percent of all midterm voters were under 30, (21% were 30-44; 30% were 45-64; and 28% were 65 and over. Those 12 percent helped the Democrats, no doubt about it, as races are  often won at the margins. But “major impact of young voters”? Meh. You GenX guys you got to do better at the next election Really Get your act together!
