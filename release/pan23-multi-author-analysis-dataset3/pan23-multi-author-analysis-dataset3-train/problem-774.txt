The countries that are part of NATO will certainly play politics requiring diplomacy to get issues resolved. Despite that, NATO is much stronger now than it was just a year ago, so NO, it’s not a joke. Also, EU (and likely NATO as well) wouldn’t allow Sweden or Finland to fall to Russia, even without NATO membership.
Why? Country’s leaderships change all the time and can go the wrong way. The US was almost there as well. Turkey is a key strategic ally that while we can all say fuck you Erdogan, they are a massive military presence that is better as part of NATO than not.
So does every NATO country have to agree to let Sweden in or can the rest of the countries just say fuck off turkey and get them in without turkeys support?
Türkiye is drawing a dangerous line between them and Sweden but I expect most of NATO would be on the side of Sweden. If Türkiye doesn't ratify, it falls on NATO to find a solution and I don't think Türkiye and their corrupt demands are part any the solution. Türkiye can't demand Sweden overrule their independent justice system, yet it has. Türkiye can't demand Sweden dictate how Sweden citizens express themselves, yet it has. Türkiye is corrupt and has no place in NATO - the institution would be destroyed by such corruption.
