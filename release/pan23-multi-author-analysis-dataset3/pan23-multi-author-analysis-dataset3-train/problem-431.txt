At The Hague? Didn’t seem like it. She also took issue when a Pakistani “Muslim” was interviewing her. There’s no way to revise the fact that she was complicit, and the Burmese who are now asking for help, were actively supporting the genocide.
As opposed to her publicly defending their genocidal acts, as she in fact did, which resulted in the junta... falsely imprisoning her (so far) anyway. Brilliant strategy, there.
Looks like she got immolated either way. Publicly sucking the genocidaires' asses and making excuses for them turned out not to save her, so she might as well have done the "grandly performative act.".
? ??...if you're talking about her initial jailing, I actually don't really know the context—hopefully you or someone else can provide a quick 5¢ version.
I would say that she failed to stand up for her values and disappointed pretty much everyone including I expect herself....but doing so would have been a grandly performative act of self-immolation, & likely not much else.
Boy, that all sounds vague & spurious. Before I look into it: anybody think ASSK was criminally handing out joyrides in helicopters to the detriment of the nation?
