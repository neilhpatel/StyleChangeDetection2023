I could see the west pushing for a compromise deal to end the Ukraine war. Ukraine gives up some occupied territory for Russia's withdrawal. Plus closer NATO/Ukraine military support and ties to deter a future Russian invasion. _(That last part is necessary because Russia can't be counted on to honor any agreement)_.
In addition, repatriating some of the occupied territory could be a major headache for Ukraine. They'd have to deal with a more pro-Russian population messing with their politics, and possibly security. Letting Russia keep some, not all, of it could be a hard to swallow but necessary face saving move for Russia to end the war. That'd be preferable to years more war, and possibly a military power struggle inside a nuclear capable Russia.
There is also currently no war between Russia and other countries that they made peace with once upon a time. Putin attacking Japan is somewhat unlikely, as it doesn't advance any of his strategic or ideological goals the way that attacking Ukraine does.
How much did America coerce Japan to do that... Japan doesn't exactly have great history between Ukraine as Ukraine sold Russian weapons, tanks, battleship, missile technogoly to countries like China, and North Korea which currently terrorizing Japan. Not to mention that, Japan is located right next to Russia and have some ongoing problems and projects.
But besides that, enough people also have bad image towards Russia and have strong belief that they need to be on "the winning side" for whatever wars to get on top of the food chain.
