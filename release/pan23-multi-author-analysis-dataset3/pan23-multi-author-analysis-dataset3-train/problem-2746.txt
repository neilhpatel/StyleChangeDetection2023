"Mr. E.V. Lambert of Homeleigh, The Burrows, Oswestly, has presented us with a poser. We do not know which gender they are, but we can soon find out.".
Add to that. They’re going after Scottish trans teenagers and adults who want easier/cheaper access to a certificate that exists which means they can get a pension, get married, and be buried as their gender and name after 6 years of consultation over the law. That’s what the whole row has been over what gender people will be buried under and if this paperwork needs doctors nod even when transition hasn’t happened.
Get a referal from your physician to a gender clinic (this is supposed to happen immediatly but many primary care doctors will "lose track" or "forgot to file it sorry hun" or "have you considered just doing drag on the weekends?).
be asked dozens of extremely probing questions, many about how you masturbate because the people trained to do this sre going off an archaic model of being transgender that buffolo bill was based on, and answer/lie to their satisfaction because if you do not meet ehsts in their out of date notebook, they will mark you as not counting, restarting this.
and after all this, you can finally, finally be issued a gender recognition certificate, get horomones and most importantly do things you need government papers for such as get married or adopt.
