To what end? Do you honestly think that Republicans will change their behavior because the Democrats follow the rules? This clearly is not the case, as evidenced by...we have already been following the rules, and they have not been.
Playing their game might not work, but it has been crystal clear that turning the other cheek doesn't work either.
Playing their game in this scenario won’t work. Don’t lend credence to this behavior, let them pout and complain, but don’t stoop to their level, not in terms of complying with committees. State elections? Fuck with them and use their tricks but do not degrade the little checks and balances the federal government has left.
Playing their game is even worse, you might as well be asking for a revolution at that point seeing as the federal government will cease to have any power.
Do you really want our entire government to act to stifle progress for the foreseeable future due to political games, instead of just half of it?
I may sound a little harsh or condescending here because I see this thought process a lot, and I think it is half-considered. It ties in with the general view of "criminals" in our country.
