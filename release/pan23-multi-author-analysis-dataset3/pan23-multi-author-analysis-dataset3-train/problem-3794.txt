Isn't the point of a 'part' that it's any measurement? As long as all the parts are equal, the ratios will be the same - with the exception of the lime and sugar... but I highly doubt there was any kind of widespread definitive standard.
Not if you have a constant measurement included ie 1 lime and spoonful of sugar. A barrel of 3 to 1 rum + 1 lime and a spoonful of sugar would taste completely different to a cup of 3 to 1 rum + 1 lime and a spoonful of sugar. Also scurvy prevention efficacy would be different, so I would guess someone onboard would have an opinion on effective ratios. Presumably there would be records of how much of a valuable commodity like rum, lime and sugar would be on board / stolen / sold, so it would be possible to work out a ratio for a given ship / voyage.
In terms of where they got rum, they would plunder it from merchant ships (one of the largest trade products out of the Caribbean thanks to the sugar plantations) or stock up on it when they made port in the Caribbean.
1. The individual pirates that we know of were quite infamous. These were namely pirate captains such as Edward Teach (Blackbeard), Charles Vane, Jack Rackham, Edward Low, Kidd, Hornigold, etc. They were famous for being either prolific, cruel, flashy, or all of the above. Teach became known as Blackbeard because he grew out a very long, black beard, which was against male social conventions of the time. He was known to put candles in his beard to make himself terrifying during battle. Jack Rackham was known as Calico Jack because of his preference for expensive, fancy clothes. These pirates generally were so well known and prolific that their exploits were reported in newspapers regularly so people would know where they had been.
I know that, because these people were criminals, many names of pirates were never recorded. Only certain famous individuals/crews were remembered. But not everyone who set sail under their own flag would become Blackbeard or Calico Jack.
