This extends beyond third grade to any student. So a student who is LGBTQ+ must be “outed” to parents that are no supportive and possibly abusive.
So you want minors that identify as lgbtq to be kept from school because their parents are not accepting? You may want to rephrase that post my friend.
Read last part of the quote: in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE STANDARDS.
What constitutes "age-appropriate", and what are the standards that are being applied? Does it seem likely that schools will err on the side of never saying anything that could be construed as pro-LGBTQ so that they won't get sued?
Technically speaking, under the letter of the law, Florida's Don't Say Gay law bans gendered restrooms from schools, teachers from wearing wedding rings, etc., but so far, the law has only affected queer people.
If you had bothered to read the law, you'd realize that acknowledging the reality that trans and gay people exist is illegal in public schools in Florida.
If you think it's age inappropriate to discuss the existence of gay and trans people, then you certainly agree that it's inappropriate for any child to have married parents, or to expose your children to gender-segregated restrooms.
This is bizarre enough, but the claim that acknowledging the existence of gay people, acknowledging the existence of marriage, and acknowledging the existence of gender is somehow "talking to kids about sex" is even stranger.
Obviously, everyone agrees that acknowledging the existence of gay and trans people is appropriate for all ages. The law has nothing to do with sex, you just haven't read the law yet.
