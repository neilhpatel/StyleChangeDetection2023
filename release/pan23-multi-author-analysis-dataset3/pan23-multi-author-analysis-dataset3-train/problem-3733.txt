I'm not Israeli but from what I've seen, the Israeli system isn't ideal either. They have a parliamentary system with a ton of parties and you need to hit a minimum threshold to get seats in the Knesset.
Actually if you look at the popular vote in the recent election, it's pretty 50/50 if you look at it from a pro Bibi/Anti Bibi POV. Granted the anti Bibi coalition involves everyone from some center right to far left to anti Zionist Arab parties. So not the most stable coalition itself. But it does go to show that the country isn't as black and white as "OMG ALL ISRAELIS SUPPORT FAR RIGHT POLITICS".
That's why you don't negotiate with terrorists, you kill them, which is what this hard right Israeli government promises.
Israel votes left, Israel attempts peace/negotiates with a terrorist government, it blows up in their face spectacularly, Israelis vote right. Palestinians suffer. Repeat.
And say whatever you want. The Jews are absolutely right, if they lay down their arms, they would be slaughtered.
