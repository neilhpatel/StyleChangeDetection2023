I believe either way they're correct. If there is a religious reason to get vaccinations or if it was prescribed the employer wouldn't be able to discriminate against them.
Refusing to be vaccinated, apart from medical reason, is pretty moronic so not wanting to hire a science denying conspiracy nutjob sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Also requiring proof of vaccination would make it much harder for people to lie and get away with it.
Related questions might be "if you lie about being vaccinated, could you be fired", and I think that depends on the new OSHA rule. It would almost certainly be a retaliatory firing because you followed an OSHA safety practice.
Are you asking about current anti-discrimination laws, or about this weeks' new OSHA-based vaccination mandate ?
It's a limited and interesting question about whether an employer who is not covered by the OSHA rule could require an employee to provide a County health department record showing the absence of a specific vaccine as a condition of employment. I think they probably could, regardless of the wisdom of such a policy.
