>At the same time, Vucic said he was grateful to Russia for its support of Serbia regarding Kosovo, citing it as the reason why Serbia cannot support economic sanctions against Moscow.
Wow... Russia must have refused to stop their recruitment efforts and the Serbian government has figured out any relationship with them would be Russia exploiting Serbia for their benefit.
Here is the thing. If the Belarusian army was convinced Russia wouldn't interfere, they would totally overthrow Lukashenko. The only thing stopping him is that he is one of Putin's useful idiots that will do anything he says with what little power he has. Main reason Belarus' army isn't involved actively in the war is because the army has straight up refused to engage by Lukashenko's orders and Russia isn't looking to fight in Belarus if they don't have to right now.
The point isn't about "fear" in the context of this discussion, the point is about Russia exerting greater influence than just in Russia and Belarus (and, I guess, regions they occupy such as in Ukraine or Georgia).
But I mean, there are simpler examples of Russia's presence and influence worldwide, such as their notorious interference in other countries' political and mediatic systems.
Not only have I not said this in my own comment (and saying I have is a straight-up lie), the person which you responded to originally also never said this that I can read.
The fact SA has approved this means that Russia still exerts some sort of geopolitical pull, no matter how restrained it may be.
No, his and Russia's influence are still very significant. You act as if all russia supporters elsewhere have been stomped out, when it's far from it.
