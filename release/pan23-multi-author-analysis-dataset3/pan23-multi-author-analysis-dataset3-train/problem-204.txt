This is a totally different situation than it is in the US. Foreign terrorists enter crowed places and start shooting. That’s not your impulsive hillbilly getting access to a gun in Walmart.
We’re getting of topic here. Question was: does it make sense to arm Israeli civilians to defend themselves against terrorists. And can you compare that with the situation in the US?
When I’m sitting in a Thalys train to Paris, and a Muslim terrorist comes out of the toilet with an AK47 and 300 rounds, I’m glad the guys sitting next to me are USMC’s on holiday who jump him and take him out. But I will not always be that lucky. Chances are small this will ever happen again. But in Israel, chances are very real. I would like to be armed too there.
But your statement is interesting. I think the big difference with old colonial claims and the situation in Israel is the fact that Israel is still in charge and wants to protect its own civilians.
Israel is in a rather unique position with regards to safety, but I am not sure that more guns help.
In Israël’s case, I can understand the reasoning in arming civilians. And everyone had a 4 years military training as well. So they should be able to handle weapons safely.
