This is a great answer. As someone who works on the vocabulary and materials of metalsmithing in the medieval period, however, my hackles get raised at statements like this:
You'll see in Smith's work that historians are beginning to challenge the notion that medieval people didn't understand the mechanics of their work. The issue is, their mechanics operated under a completely different cosmology. So while in our empirical understanding, urine is compositionally urine no matter what the hair color of the person who expelled it, medieval workers would have absolutely seen the red hair as causal because of where 'red' fit into their cosmology. And not just their cosmology as medieval people, but their cosmology specifically as workers who dealt directly with material phenomena. Smith has another article on this issue discussing why it mattered for some early modern artisans to use the blood of red lizards in a recipe, rather than any other lizard.
Over the course of this book, Theophilus recommends a number of different abrasive tools and substances depending on the desired result and material. These include soft ground stone mixed with spit and applied using wood or leather, sandstone applied with water, whetstones, crushed potsherds, and crushed tiles and charcoal. One of the great things about Theophilus is that, although he's primarily concerned with precious metal objects for use in the liturgy, he also remarks on ironworking, tinworking, and founding. So we can extrapolate from his knowledge of tools and materials out to other kinds of smithery.
Natural stones have been used for thousands of years to sharpen metal implements, and I imagine there would have been crossover between artisans/tool-makers and smiths making weapons.
