I think this is what most are mischaracterizing as the media making this a “both sides” issue. When Trump does something wrong, MSM calls him out but the right-wing media ecosystem moves to astroturf/redirect/bury the story. When Biden does something wrong, EVERYONE calls him out because there’s no equivalency to the right wing mediasphere on the left.
But even though this is still “wrong,” I don’t think you’ll find many on the left who defend Biden tooth and nail the way the right circled the wagons and defended Trump despite a multitude of transgressions.
I think there's a reasonable chance this story was intended to hurt Biden because he's insisting on seeking re-election and there are those within the Democratic establishment that don't want him to run again.
I think Biden is doing great so far in his presidency, and I believe this was an honest mistake in his case, but if Trump going to jail means Biden needs to go too, so be it. Sorry, Joe. Should have been more careful.
Pisses me off so much that this article needs to exist. Talk about dropping the friggin ball! /facepalm.
