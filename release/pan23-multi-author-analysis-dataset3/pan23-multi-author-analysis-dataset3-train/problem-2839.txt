There is an annotated student Bible put together called the New Revised Standard Version that is what is used in most universities when studying New Testament literature. It was actually translated by a committee of about 30 of the most prominent scholars of the 1980s and includes the canonical texts for both Protestant and catholic denominations. Also worth mentioning, is if you get a college edition, it’ll actually have notes in it that will point out areas where there are discrepancies (such as what I pointed out above.) So I always recommend that version for anyone who wants to take a more historical approach to the New Testament.
The other is that the Biblical books _are_ historical sources. The implication of your comment is that we can’t know about “the real man” from the Biblical books, but they form a significant part of the source material for the historians who study him and are part of the source for the well written and long comment above.
Ehrman doesn’t list everything Jesus like said or didn’t say, however he (and many other historians) have pieced together many things they believe the historical Jesus probably did say. You can see many of them in his books, Jesus Interrupted and Misquoting Jesus.
When I first read the Gospels for myself, to see what they actually said, instead of just knowing what the scholars and Christian hypocrites said, I was stunned.
