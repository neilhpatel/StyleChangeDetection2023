I believe this is exactly what happened. We are trying to get the plan back on track. A payment plan was in place when 2020 tax return was filed, so wouldn’t the debt not be considered grounds for cancellation of the plan? Seems like a catch 22 to me.
We need to know if his passport is revoked. Does anyone know how to check if a US passport has been revoked?
Is there a way we can check if his passport is ok? We checked global entry and that seems to be ok, but I’m not 100% sure if your passport can be revoked but global entry can be active. Logically the two should display the same status but reality is a different animal.
But he has been paying on time. That’s the mind boggling thing here. The previous debt (that was under the payment plan) seems to have been the trigger for cancelling the payment plan once the 2020 return was filed.
He would need to be up to date on all tax obligations so if he failed to file a 2020 tax return or the was any tax due that he didn't pay on time for 2020, the agreement would be voided.
