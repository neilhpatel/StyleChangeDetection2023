Technically, yeah. The West is largely responsible for total, historical CO2 emissions (by virtue of being richest and first to have the new technology). So, technically yes.
That's true. By that point it's just "fucking cold as shit" and that's that. I hate going inside afterwards because my glasses fog up. And breathing in the warm air seems like it's burning the inside of your nose for a few minutes.
Jet streams (which do shift, they've not static), warm or cold fronts in other areas. Warm and cold fronts push each other around. And it can depend on if the cold/warm air is wet or dry.
But to be fair, -62 C isn't insane for Siberia. Their average is already -50 C. This just happens to be the coldest in 20 years, which is a short period in terms of weather.
No, but also no one would say a 100F/38C day is only 10% warmer than a 50F/10C day. It may be scientifically correct, but too unintuitive for normal conversation.
Similar in the other direction with these heat domes, with high pressure areas basically trapped by a squiggly polar vortex. The BC/WA 45C heatwave, West-Europe's 40C heatwaves or the extremely warm NYE.
