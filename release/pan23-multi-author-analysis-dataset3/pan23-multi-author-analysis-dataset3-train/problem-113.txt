Because the point of protesting abroad isn't to influence your home nation, but the nation you're protesting in. When there's a protest for HK in America it isn't about changing HK/China's govt, it's about pressuring the American govt to in turn pressure their govt.
That doesn't work when every nation on earth willing to apply restrictions, embargos, and tariffs on Russia already has.
No country in the world has the ability to invade and successfully occupy Russia over the long term. Also no country in the world WANTS to invade Russia for any reason. The only useful thing in Russia is the natural resources and even then no one needs to invade for those but rather they just need to wait until Russia is desperate and buy them for pennies on the dollar. Even if we ignore nukes no one has any reason to want to invade Russia.
The international response would be nothing-- because Russia would launch nukes if anyone invades. It'd be game over so why the hell would China do that?
Funny thing is I very much did assume China would just kind of walk in and take Russia after this mess. I mean, it could still happen, but I expected it.
