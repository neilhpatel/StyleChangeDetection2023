There is discrimination, and there is illegal discrimination. Discrimination is the mere practice of treating you differently than your peers. Illegal discrimination is when they treat you differently because of a few legally protected reasons - for example because of your sex, national origin, race or ethnicity. On what basis do you think you face illegal discrimination?
If there's no reason, then it isn't illegal discrimination. If they are holding you back because or your race or religion that would be illegal discrimination.
It depends on the basis for which you feel you are being discriminated against. Your university should have an office of diversity and probably has a mandate to investigate all complaints of civil rights violations, if that is what you are claiming. Unfortunately if you think professors are doing this to you because they just don’t like you then you probably don’t have many options outside the university’s own appellate systems, and you definitely need an attorney. At that point (if it’s not a civil rights claim) I should think it would be a torts practitioner. You xan also check for a legal aid office and see if they have a free legal advice clinic for general civil matters etc.
