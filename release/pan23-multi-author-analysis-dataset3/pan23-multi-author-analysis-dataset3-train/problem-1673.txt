It is a fight the GOP wants. They will keep hammering that the IRS is only going after the little guy and this money will only make it worse for the little guy. The IRS is not popular already. This fits the GOP narrative that the Democrats just want to tax all your money. While the fact that Biden and the democrats have already done things to get tax money from the wealthy to fund good programs for the people will be lost in the simple message of TAX BAD that the GOP will be hammering.
It galls me to hear Jim Jordan or Matt Gaetz talk about how we are "spending money we don't have" when they are trying to directly hobble the governments revenue by making it easy for the rich to evade taxes and hide their assets.
The IRS goes after the poor because it doesn't have the resources to go after the rich, who can afford armies of accountants and lawyers.
Because an IRS that cannot afford to pursue wealthy people with expensive lawyers will only be able to pursue poor people without.
Ultimately, the super-wealthy pay Republicans too much money in return for preventing the IRS from ever having full resources to go after them.
That's another purpose in announcing it now to tell prospective employees and the IRS that these jobs are not guaranteed.
They can kill it in next year's budget bill and if that's the case would the IRS even use the additional money in this year's bill?
