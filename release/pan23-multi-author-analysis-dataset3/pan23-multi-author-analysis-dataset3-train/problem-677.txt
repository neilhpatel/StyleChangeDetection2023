Funny, as the FBI in 2008 released declassified documents showing a vastly deep network of material support for the 9/11 hijackers from people within the Saudi government/intel agencies/related networks. And quite a lot more has come out. US presidents have their head up the ass of the corrupt Saudi officials, no way they'd allow anything that explosive to come out. Also the "no way Saudis would have anything to do with al-Qaeda" is not accurate, just look at the insane funding for al-Qaeda/AQ linked militias in the Syrian conflict as well as before 9/11.
While official Saudi government money did not fund Al Qaeda, much of the funding for that organization did come from the Saudi Kingdom and an overwhelming majority of the hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi subjects/citizens. To say that Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with it was wrong too. Osama bin Laden himself was from Saudi Arabia and his personal fortune came from Saudi oil too.
Saudi Arabia makes hundreds of billions off oil a year; the windfall from the spike in oil prices caused by the war already netted them far more than they're giving here. (Norway OTOH ).
