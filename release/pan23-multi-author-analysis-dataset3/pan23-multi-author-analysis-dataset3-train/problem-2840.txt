You're comparing the broad mainstream conservative electorate with a small, insignificant demographic who hold next to no power in the Democratic Party and more often than not don't vote at all.
"MAGA Republicans" may make up a minority of the American electorate, but they actually show up to vote.
Republican voters, by and large, do not see you as a fellow American if you do not believe as they do, support who they do or speak as they do. If you aren’t constantly reenforcing their worldview back to them, you are actively, intentionally and maliciously trying to undermine their country in their minds. Again, this is their country, not all of ours, to them only they are the real Americans.
They have been fed a steady diet of mental slop where liberals just hate the country and want it to burn. They believe conspiracy theories because they make the lies make sense, and they accept the violent consequences of these ramblings because they have been taught that it is the only option left.
To these Republicans if you are not one of them you are an enemy of the nation and the people. People need to get this through their heads.
This won’t improve if economic conditions get better, the price of gas is unrelated to this delusion, they will move on to the next thing to glare at, real or imagined. The only way to put an end to this insanity is for the rest of the nation, the other 70%, to vote them out of any and all power, which will force their hand to try and seize power through violent means and then you crush the movement once and for all.
