If they believe their use is authorized, the "right" way to handle it would be a DMCA counter-notice, not a lawsuit. That's a cheap and easy solution for them, as it would free up YouTube to make their own choice to either remove or reinstate the content, and if they (or you) disagree, then you would work it out with each other or take one another to court at that point.
Putting a voiceover over something does not inherently make it fair use, and that argument is eye-rollingly stupid.
If you've already made your position plain, and they've already made their position plain, then you might consider letting the issue lie. It's not your job to convince them that you're right. Sometimes it can be useful, but if it's not useful, it's just wasted words.
Youtube has a system to assert copyright ownership aside from a DMCA takedown, which would redirect some of the monetization back to you, as well. That may be a viable option if they file a counternotice and Youtube reinstates their content, if you would prefer not to spend further money yourself on suing them to enforce your rights. Or you can sue, or you can let it lie, or they may not file that notice.
They CAN still sue you, and you will need to show up for court, but they will be laughed out of the courtroom.
They can certainly sue you (if they're in the US, especially). But they're not likely to win. They also would need to get jurisdiction over you, which they don't have if they're not suing in whatever province you're in.
