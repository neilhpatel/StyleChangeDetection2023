The United States is no longer interested, nothing will be done, Israel will set off the match, and oil will get much more expensive.
It was useless when Obama signed it. Just kicked the can down the road and assumed the religious totalitarians would choose economy over nukes or conquest in ten years.

I do not believe the intention of the deal was ever to secure a nuclear free Iran for any serious extended amount of time.
National security is not the Ayatollah's goal. The entire Iranian Revolution was based on the idea of ridding Western influence over the entire Middle East.
They were not in compliance of the deal. I presume that the governments of the time just couldn't fathom a man like Donald J Trump, who would accelerate the issue could become leader of the free world so were happy to kick the can down the road.
