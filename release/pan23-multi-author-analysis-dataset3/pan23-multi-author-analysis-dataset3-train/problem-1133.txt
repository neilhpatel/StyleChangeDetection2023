Your relationship issues are likely irrelevant and/or mutually exclusive of your tenancy there -- that is to say that it doesn't matter if you're together or not, you're a tenant, and you're entitled to advance notice to vacate followed by an eviction from your landlord, assuming you have no written lease entitling you to continue living there.
In NY, your landlord needs to give you one month's 90 days notice of their intent to terminate your tenancy (due to the lenh of time you've lived there).
You have the right to live there until the tenancy ends, and the tenancy hasn't been terminated yet - that happens once you are notified by the landlord that you need to leave.
If you both want to keep living there, the landlord ultimately has the option to decide who they'd rather have as a tenant. They could also decide they don't want EITHER of you living there as a solo tenant and make you both leave.
To terminate a month-to-month tenancy the landlord would have to give you at least 30 days notice, and it should end at the end of a month. That said, you can move out faster assuming everyone is okay with that.
