If robbery carries a 5 to 25 years sentence, and person A was found with the stolen property in their possession gets 5 years, and person B was found with the property along with the bloody knife from a homicide that happened during the robbery and grainy video evidence of the person who did the killing being the one taking the property, where it's likely they are the one who did it, but some room for minor doubt about murder, and they get 20 years- I'm kind of OK with that concept.
The problem is with the sentencing guidelines. With such a wide range of possible sentence, the probation office looked at the the factors involved and suggested about 5 years would be typical. The govt argued it should be longer because of the death that had occurred and the judge agreed with the govt. The govt was arguing a different way to calculate the guidelines and calculated 290+ months using the robbery guidelines. So the judge was taking factors related to the murder into account, but the sentence didn't go beyond what is allowed by law for the convicted crime.
The whole point here is that the acquitted portions of the alleged crime shouldn’t factor into the sentence for the convicted portion of the alleged crime.
“In courtrooms across America, defendants get additional prison time for crimes that juries found they didn’t commit.”.
"Sentencing a defendant for what’s called “acquitted conduct” has gone on for years, based on a Supreme Court decision from the late 1990s. And the justices have turned down numerous appeals asking them to declare that the Constitution forbids it.".
