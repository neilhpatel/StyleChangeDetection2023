I've respected Corbyn for some of his views in the past, but his views on Russia's invasion of Ukraine were just typical tankie bullshit calling for the west to stop arming Ukraine. If he got his way, Ukraine would be overrun right now by Russia. As far as I'm concerned he's toxic to Labour and they can do without him.
Anti-war, but not anti-invasion. Not anti-annexation. Not anti-ethnic-cleansing. Which all will happen if Ukraine is not given the means to defend itself.
If the West didn't arm Ukraine, the war was over year ago on viable conditions. Arming Ukraine won't change the outcome of the war, it is only multiplying deaths. So Corbyn is a smart guy, at least much smarter than an average MSM-bullshit eating redditor.
Tbf Corbyn was a bit shit and some of his opinions are dodgy but this insistence on him being unelectable doesn’t really take into account the whole picture. It’s like saying democratically elected socialist governments are predispositioned to having coup attempts without mentioning the CIA.
He was a toxic mess after 2018, after being attacked relentlessly for years by the press, enabled by the right wing of his own party who, let’s remember, actively wanted the Labour Party to lose in 2017.
It would be a massive problem for Labour because the would be picked apart by the press as basically still being run by Corbyn in all but name and the swing voters they need to win over (that Corbyn couldn't) would be probably be deterred.
I imagine (going on his political career), Corbyn refused to play ball and was happy to cause problems to the Labour party going forwards.
I'm not saying if he would or wouldn't, or that the tories were better (who honestly have made a mess of everything). But if you can't convince people to vote for you then you won't be PM and he couldn't convince many traditional labour and swing voters to vote for him.
