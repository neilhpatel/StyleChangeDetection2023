Greeks, Armeniens, Assyrians, basically any group that threatened their vision of a homogeneous Islamic nation state. Little Asia is a one big tragedy.
The Greek genocide[4][5][6][7][8][9][A 1] (Greek: Γενοκτονία των Ελλήνων, Genoktonia ton Ellinon), which included the Pontic genocide, was the systematic killing of the Christian Ottoman Greek population of Anatolia which was carried out mainly during World War I and its aftermath (1914–1922) on the basis of their religion and ethnicity.[15] It was perpetrated by the government of the Ottoman Empire led by the Three Pashas and by the Government of the Grand National Assembly led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,[1] against the indigenous Greek population of the Empire. The genocide included massacres, forced deportations involving death marches through the Syrian Desert,[16] expulsions, summary executions, and the destruction of Eastern Orthodox cultural, historical, and religious monuments.[17] Several hundred thousand Ottoman Greeks died during this period.[18] Most of the refugees and survivors fled to Greece (adding over a quarter to the prior population of Greece).[19] Some, especially those in Eastern provinces, took refuge in the neighbouring Russian Empire.
I know the history, and surely you do too. The 1923 population exchange agreement followed the Greek Genocide of 1914-1922 by the hands of the Turks:
Turkey and Greece did that with population exchange agreement, which was requested by the Greeks. It was right after the Greek invasion of western Turkey.
Turkey are right now invading both Syria and Iraq. They recently attacked Arminia and are now threatening their supposed NATO ally Greece. Is there a single neighbor Erdogan doesn't pose a threat to?
Only scary thing about this is Erdogan, who will do just about anything if he felt like he could gather some popular support over it.
We've been attacking each other low key for a while now. Usually nothing life threatening, taking down each others flags from contested islets etc. Our boat service guys even leave favourite drinks for the boat service guys on the other side to grab eventually.
