My name is Ilya Yashin, a Russian opposition politician, whom the Kremlin has kept in prison since the middle of last summer. I’ve been sentenced to 8.5 years of incarceration, because I publicly spoke out against the war in Ukraine. But today I want to say a few words in defense of my nation.
I want to appeal to the wisdom of the international community. Do not demean the Russians, as that kind of rhetoric will only strenhen Putin’s power. By shifting the blame for war crimes from the Kremlin junta onto my fellow citizens, you are easing the Putin regime’s moral and political burden. You are giving him a chance to hide from the just accusations of people who have in essence become a human shield in this situation. I see that as a serious mistake.
I'm afraid you are missing the point. If any free state did a 180⁰ turn and invaded a neighbour, the people of said state wouldn't have it. Instead ask yourself if you would come to Russia and speak out. Of course, you have no idea how many people would come with you. That's always a problem. And what would it change, you might ask yourself. They will just throw me in jail. Besides, it is not your country, let someone else do it. And so on and so forth.
