Generally, in a joint legal custody arrangement, either parent may make emergency medical decisions for the child, but cannot make non-emergency decisions without consulting the other parent. However, a single, non-harmful violation like this is not likely to be worth going to court over. If he has repeatedly made similar decisions without consulting you, or starts doing so in the future, you can consult with your attorney about going back to court to clarify or enforce the order.
It would be a good idea to review this with your lawyer and potentially seek enforcement of the support order, if your co-parent is systematically excluding you from parenting decisions you feel you should be involved in or may not be providing accurate information about your child's health.
1. Is this a one-off, or is it part of a broader pattern of making unilateral choices without your involvement or information?
It's not 100% clear what will come of that, and if this were a one-off I'd suggest you might not have a lot of options, but if there's a documented pattern then often family law judges will either clarify or intervene to enforce the existing order.
