You mentioned taking gift money is a bad idea so I am trying to see if I should refuse the money in all cases.
Ah totally makes sense. To summarize, taking money is minor factor, and in order to ensure my claim, I would need to get lawyers to write a prenuptial agreement.
You can a lawyer draft an agreement that covers what happens to this house if split both before and after marriage - essentially a pre-nuptial agreement.
A prenuptial agreement is just that, an agreement. You need an attorney, she needs an attorney, she has to agree the house is only going to be yours. And this has to be signed well in advance of the wedding. You might also look into a trust, speak to an attorney.
Absolutely. Washinon is a community property state. But even if it wasn't, during a marriage, community assets are being used to pay for the house and maintain it, the mortgage, the repairs. You'd need to somehow fund the house entirely outside of marital assets which is nearly impossible without an inheritance or trust or something. Taking her money now isn't a good idea, but it's minor. It's the getting marriage part that changes everything.
