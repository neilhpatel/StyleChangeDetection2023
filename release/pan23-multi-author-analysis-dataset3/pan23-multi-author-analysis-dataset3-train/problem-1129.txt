There are currently multiple "live" word marks on the USPTO database for the word "Cryptex" owned by different people. One is for "Downloadable computer software for encryption", another is "Entertainment services in the nature of escape rooms, live action games attractions". The trademark in question is for "DECORATIVE COMBINATION SECURITY AND STORAGE BOXES". If someone wanted to call something "Cryptex" that isn't a "decorative combination security and storage box" but rather the title of a video game referring to the same origin (the word from the Da Vinci Code) would he be able to enforce the trademark against that?
Can he do this without actually offering a product? In this scenario if I were the person who had the trademark, what's stopping me from taking out a trademark on the term for every purpose ever so I am the only one who can use the word?
Title: Is a trademark on a term coined by a novelist for an object invented in that novel enforceable if the person who owns the trademark is an unrelated third party?
