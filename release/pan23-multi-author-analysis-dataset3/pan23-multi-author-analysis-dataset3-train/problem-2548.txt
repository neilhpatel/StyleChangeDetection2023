Their goal, I'm sure, is to "drive the poor people out of the state". Of course, their heads are too far up their asses to recognize that many of those same people can't afford to move.
There are people who can't afford food. If we give them money to buy food, then they no longer have this problem. If they choose to not buy food, or to buy bad food, then it's not our fault.
A little limited guidance seems beneficial, but "reasonable restrictions that can maximize the amount of assistance provided per dollar spent while being minimally restrictive on the recipients of that assistance" is a really fine line. The best option seems to be to put minimal restrictions, and trust the individual to know what they need.
I'm not saying that the restrictions in this bill are reasonable. I think they're horrible, and a vindictive attempt at punishing poor people for the crime of being poor.
The program is already built with restrictions. It already can't be used for non-food groceries, alcohol or tobacco, prepared hot foods, medicines, live animals, or pet food. Why do we accept those restrictions and refuse to acknowledge that there may exist other reasonable restrictions that can maximize the amount of assistance provided per dollar spent while being minimally restrictive on the recipients of that assistance?
My point stands: I think it's pretty obvious that the program is designed to provide meaningful assistance, and that reasonable restrictions on the use of those funds in order to ensure that the assistance is meaningful are reasonable.
