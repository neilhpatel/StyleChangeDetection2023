The law allows an “authorized representative” to interact with the body shop in your stead. So Geico may have had the authority to authorize the work. You will have to check your insurance contract.
My guess would be that your insurance policy will be the most relevant thing in this situation. The legalities of who is liable for which violation of which law is not likely to be something you'll need to argue about because you have an insurance agreement.
I'm not a lawyer, but this doesn't seem like something that would require a Personal Injury lawyer since the OP was not in the vehicle nor did they suffer any personal injury, just vehicle damage. Also highly unlikely that a PIL would take up this case on commission-only. The difference between the $750 deductible and a $200-300 wheel/tire replacement wouldn't make sense for paying out of pocket for a lawyer to get involved.
Especially considering the Personal-injury lawyer might prefer to go against an actual defendant who caused the vehicle damage and their insurance company, rather than this spat which is essentially a "he said she said they said" dispute between the OP, Geico and the repair shop.
