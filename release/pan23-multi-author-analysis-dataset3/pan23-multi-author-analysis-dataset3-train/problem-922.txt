Please be honest here, are you part of a Chinese propaganda machine? Or are you saying Taiwan specifically should shrink its borders because these islands aren't mainland? And what are your thoughts on all the other countries that claim territory far from the mainland?
It is up to indigenous populations to determine whether they conform or rebel. To single Taiwan out in a world dominated by multinational imperialism is just strange to me.
The term Taiwan is a geographical and not a political. It only includes the main island. Although in media the whole whole territory controlled by the ROC government is referred to as Taiwan doesn't mean it's correct. It's like calling UK England or calling Scottish people English. What media calls Taiwan includes two provinces: Taiwan and Fujian, which includes Taiwan. The Kinmenese don't identify themselves as Fujianese and not Taiwanese. It won't change who rules over them or where their government sits. You don't call every American Washinonian do you?
Taiwan might actually be hoping that to happen, since these islands, geographically not belonging to Taiwan, are more of a burden to Taiwan and stopping it from declaring an independent state. You can't call your country Republic of Taiwan when not all your territory is on Taiwan, can you? It would be as if the UKs official name would only be Great Britain. Therefore the communists haven't took these islands in the past and won't take them as long as they aren't intending to seize Taiwan.
When did I single out Taiwan? Sorry that the ocean decided to be there to seperate Taiwan from the other island.
What you mean by Taiwan refers to two seperate Provinces: Taiwan and Fujian( including) Kinmen. It isn't my idea, but the current administrative situation.
