He should go to the deposition. Part of the conditions of the insurance is that he cooperate in the defense of claims including, among other things, going to depositions.
If the insurance covered him at the time of the accident, it likely will be providing his defense and paying out any judgement (as long as your husband wasn't doing anything grossly negligent).
While I cannot promise you anything. I would recommend you not worry about your personal liability here. From what you've shared, I would expect this to be a pain the butt while the trial goes on, but it won't derail your lives. Even if the claimant ends up getting a settlement, the insurance company will almost surely be covering that (or maybe the company depending on deductibles and language of their policy). Your husband shouldn't be expected to pay anything on his own.
If you are not working with the insurance company who covered that work truck (and your husband) at the time - you need to contact them immediately. Also the company themselves. I'd guess that they're all already named in the suit, though.
