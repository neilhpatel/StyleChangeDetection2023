It's funny to see Republicans clutching their pearls over lack of decorum and respect for the political process, after years of them turning the system into a reality TV show and advocating for burning the system down if it won't serve them.
If she were telling the truth it makes Republicans look even worse: a drunk Democratic caucus is more functional and unified than a sober Republican conference.
Everyone was expecting a shitshow when Republicans took over and that'll probably be true no matter who comes up on top. It's just nice that Republicans, for once, get to experience the same grandstanding assholery that grinds government to a halt every time the Democrats were in charge for the past decade or so.
Heard somewhere that some Republican'ts are grumbling about Democrats not helping them out. My thought is, sure...why not go out of the way to help out a louse like Qevin, who before this nonsense, already gave the worst 9.1% of his caucus a promise that they could totally launch sham investigations and hold show trials for any Democrat in government and any one that simply agrees with them? Let 'em humiliate themselves and cry that nobody bailed them out...which will no doubt wind up sounding a lot like, "Democrats stopped 'the people's' business from being done!".
It's why I've got trouble saying Cheeto Hate-ler doesn't know anything. He's "perfect"-ly good at doing bad things. And under oWn TeH LiBz rules, I guess you've always gotta be looking out for things that might trip up a future corrupt and/or evil Republican monarch.
