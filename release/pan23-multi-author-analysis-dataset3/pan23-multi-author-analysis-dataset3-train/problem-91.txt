If you get caught, you will be prosecuted for illegally being in possession of unprescribed Rx drugs at a minimum. Nobody is going to buy the "research" story. If you want to do research, get a degree in the appropriate academic field and go work in a lab.
For any practical argument you have about it for being academic or research you need to either be part of an official lab. Not playing in your garage. It’s not technically illegal. It’s going to be treated as you’re in possession of those drugs.
Could I be considered in possession of unprescribed drugs if I made them myself. Is it even considered a prescription drug if it didn't come from a pharmacy?
I appreciate your concern but I was not asking whether or not it was a good idea or not. I wanted to scope out any legal repercussions so I could make an informed decision on my own.
Sorry I did not make that clear. Buying a prescription drug is not my only way of obtaining a known good, I was exploring potential avenues which that was one of them. Having a known good is extremely helpful to my project but if I can't obtain one legally then I just have to do without one. If possible I would appreciate a bit more detail on what makes it illegal such as specific statutes or case law.
Sorry if the title was misleading. I wanted to make it clear I wasn't making it for profit or any potentially more illegal category. I have no delusions that I have any added protections just because it's "academic". Is synthesis illegal as well or just possession (I realize you can't have one without the other but I want to do look at the specific laws and it helps to know where to look).
