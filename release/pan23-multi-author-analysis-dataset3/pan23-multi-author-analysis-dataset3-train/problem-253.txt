First cited reference. Meaning that the OED when confronted with the choice of citing Shakespeare or a contemporary writer who also used the word in question, they tended to pick Shakespeare.
It’s known that for the period in which Shakespeare’s works were published, the OED has a predilection for preferring Shakespeare as the author cited to show a word in that particular usage. The same is true of Chaucer, earlier in the language. That will lead to a preponderance of Shakespeare listed as the first cited reference.
Question: if Shakespeare was indeed the first known reference for those words, how does OED's preference play a role? Wouldn't they be pretty much forced to quote him as such?
"New words of the period, if used by Shakespeare, would have been more likely to be found in his writing than in that of other authors who were less closely trawled by the lexicographers, and hence Shakespeare rather than anyone else will have been recorded by OED as their first user.".
Right. It’s a question of selection bias. It’s not, “hey, this word is in Shakespeare, so who cares if it’s in George Chapman’s works too,” but “we’re carefully combing Shakespeare and glancing at Chapman” and “hey, this word isn’t in Shakespeare, see if Chapman used it.” But that selection bias likely comes from emulating Johnson’s “best authors.”.
