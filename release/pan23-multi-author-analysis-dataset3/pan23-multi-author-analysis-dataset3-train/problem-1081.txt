They burned that bridge the second their gambit of holding europe hostage over gas failed. Now China is going to become their main buyer and will have russia by the balls economically.
If they were able to have the US by the balls economically for decades, then they certainly can take advantage of Russia.
As much as I hate Xi Jinping's politics, it is a brilliant political move. If they can grow their influence in Russia by making it a vassal state, then, they can expand their influence -militarily- into Europe. Especially if Ukraine fails to take back Crimea, they could ask to station some troops over there, giving them a Warm-water port in the Black Sea and allowing them to project power further westward. Not to mention, they could move more Chinese people over into Russia to fight their own overpopulation problem.
Also, China no longer has an overpopulation problem. At least not with young people. The population is falling and they’re facing an impending demographic crisis. Unless they’re planning to send their elderly to siberia or something….
It’s not even a little brilliant. It’s a foolish move. Real life isn’t age of empires or total war.
