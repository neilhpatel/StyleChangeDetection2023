This is an extremely common catchall in a job description. Yes of course they can ask you to do this that are unrelated to your normal job. Absent a contract or union protection to the contrary they can fire you if you don't do it (assuming what they are asking you to do is not a crime).
Barring an employment contract or some other legal agreement (like a union contract), your employer can change your job duties to whatever, whenever they want (within reason).
Barring an employment contract that specifically lays out your duties, an employer can change your responsibilities (within reason) at any time.
Assuming your not under contract for a specific job and the tasks requested are legal then yes, your employer can request you complete task outside your “job description” while on the clock.
"Other duties as assigned" is an extremely common clause in a job description, and I've literally never had a job where it wasn't included in the agreement or contract.
Yes, it is legal to assign an employee to tasks that aren't directly related to their job title. You can refuse to do it, they can discipline or terminate your employment.
