It's even dumber. Within the past few elections, the GOP has closed tons of polling locations in AZ, most of which were in Maricopa County.
They were also given an option of immediately dropping their ballot in a lockbox to be counted at the main center but all the lies a lot of these people believe made them say no and jam things up for longer.
"Election officials proceeded to close 320 voting sites across 13 of Arizona's 15 counties, according to the report by the Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights. Most of those were in Maricopa County, where there were 171 fewer polling locations in 2018 compared to 2012, a reduction of about 25%, the report found.".
Here’s a thought. If we are worried now about long lines at the ballot box, why not let everyone vote at home like Oregon? No waiting, everyone has plenty of time to vote, and you can either mail in or drop off your ballot. If you don’t get your ballot, they can reproduce one for you at the elections office any time before election day so there is very little risk of broken printers disenfranchising voters.
A lot of states have "sore loser laws" that would prevent him from being on the ballot for a different party after losing another party's primary, though more's the pity in this case.
We can’t fix the long line issues, as we have (almost entirely conservative) parties who act to make access to voting more difficult, who make zero effort to discourage folks like the ones in AZ who were armed ‘guarding’ ballot boxes, and the nonsense they want to spread that we need to restrict voting.
