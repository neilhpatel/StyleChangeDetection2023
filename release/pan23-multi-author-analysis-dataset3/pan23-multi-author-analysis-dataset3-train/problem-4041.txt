One thing I've noticed while watching Benjam√≠n, the "Bald & Bankrupt" youtuber, is how little Russia outside the main cities has moved on from the Soviet era, while other eastern block nations (My wife is Polish) are showing signs of prosperity even in the most rural places.
We had enough of Russia breaking into small countries in the 50's here in Europe: in fact, most of my country's issues stem from these assholes occupying Eastern Europe for the better half of the last century.
100 years ago Russia could hide a lot of what they are doing right now and also spread a lot of lies about Ukraine that Ukraine would have trouble fighting as a smaller country with less resources.
Russia literally needs to steal land and forcfully abduct millions of people in order to survive with the territory they have now, otherwise they will balkanize in 50 years or less, they are a dying country.
Im not including Ukraine in that statement, Ukraine has exactly 2 choices, fight, or die. There is no concept of peace with Russia, Russia cannot be trusted, they have broken every agreement there has ever come to be in regards to security in Ukraine. The opportunity for "negotiation" ended in September after Putin declared annexation of territory. This is a 17th century war, with 21st century technology and politics.
