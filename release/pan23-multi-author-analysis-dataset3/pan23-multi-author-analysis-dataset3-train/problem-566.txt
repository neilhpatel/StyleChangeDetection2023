but Finland for example did and it was one of the most stupid decision they could've made back then.
The Ottawa treaty was a beautiful idea, but once a country like Russia does not agree to it, none of the neighbouring countries should've not done it either.
Mines are probably the most effective defensive weapon a country can have, and I'm saying it again, but it's absolutely insane that they were given up on as a DEFENSIVE weapon.
If you lay down defensive mines on your own territory that are marked, it's absolutely fine as a defensive measure if yet again done as responsively as possible.
Easy way to prevent your enemy from using disarming AT mines is to protect those mine with AP mines and other means.
And yes, there are areas where mines are effective that way, but the impact wouldn't be that massive. AP mines won't really work on a highway unless you blow it up first, and even on a highway, trucks will be moving in a column, just a bit faster. And speed doesn't matter that much. And again, no one is preventing you from using the same tactic on the enemy territory, when you have to abandon an area or have a chance to scout ahead.
As such moves are way more effective when layed quickly where enemies don't expect them (for example securing a strategic target that you just took over in a foreign territory).

Yeah well... It is not a very good mine if you can just swipe it off the road with a foot. I think I heard something about other mines having anti-tamper system? Totally not a mine expert, but that would make sense.
