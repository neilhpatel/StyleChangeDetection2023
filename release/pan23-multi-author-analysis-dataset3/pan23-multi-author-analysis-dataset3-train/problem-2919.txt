In many situations, the roads or parking lots (on private property) just do not conform enough to the wording of the statutes (traffic laws) the police would enforce.
Most traffic regulations created by your state DOT can not be enforced on private property, but (in some instances) a few can, such as DUI or reckless driving.
I'm not a lawyer but I believe the reason is because the city itself doesn't put any of the signs or fire lanes in to private parking lots so they don't have the right to enforce them (probably varies state to state). I don't know about Washinon but here if we put up signs that clearly state violaters of parking rules will be towed, then you can call and have it towed. If you don't have those signs it can cause you to be responsible for the tow cost. To be clear again that may be different in Washinon and I'm not a lawyer.
I do think if you are legally allowed to call a tow truck you should just do it. It is disruptive but I'm sure others who live there are just as irritated by the parking in the fire lane. It's also a danger and if you don't remove them, knowing they have been blocking the lane, and a fire happens it could become your negligence that prevents a fire truck from putting out the fire in a timely manner. If anyone gets hurt that could potentially come back to you. If not legally it would morally bother me personally as I would feel some responsibility for not taking action in your shoes.
