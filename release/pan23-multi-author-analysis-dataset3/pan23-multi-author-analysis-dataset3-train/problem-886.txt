I used to think (still do actually) that Assad was a fucking asshole to put himself before his country and let it get destroyed rather than step down.
Then along comes Putin who is not only destroying Ukraine but his country along with it and doesn't give a fuck either way.
As far as when the Ukraine war ends, it's really just one option: Putin dies. So long as Putin lives he will not step down, so long as he rules he will not accept defeat in Ukraine, since he's incapable of winning in Ukraine - the war will only end when he dies.
Putin is losing and becoming weaker every day and in every way while NATO has never been stronger; from a strictly strategic U.S./NATO military point-of-view, the continuation of this war is tenable and even preferable. I would even go so far as to say that this may be in part why the U.S./NATO has not given Ukraine certain weapons/technology that would significantly improve their offensive combat capabilities.
I would echo what you said though about the real benefits of this designation as for now it seems to amount to nothing more than official international name-calling.
The question we have to ask, what are the real benefits of this designation. Direct intervention from NATO is impossible as nobody wants to open up an entire WW3; equally, Russia will never concede or extradite their war criminals for independent trial to the Hague, or anywhere else. Do I see a way out of this conflict? I can't say that I do.
Just the audacity of recruiting violent criminals into armed combat and naming his corps after one of the proto-ideologues of racial purity should have raised any number of red flags immediately.
