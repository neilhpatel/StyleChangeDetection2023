The gay wedding cake issue came down to the state authorities mishandling the case, not the underlying issues related to the cake.
Not really, because a gay wedding cake probably doesn't differ at all from a straight wedding cake, so it's not an issue of putting any sort of content on the cake that would qualify as speech that's objectionable to the baker. At least with a website, you can tell by looking at it that it's for a gay couple if there are photos of the couple.
No, and they're not compelling anybody. The website designer in the case you're talking about hasn't been compelled to make a website for a gay couple because she doesn't offer wedding websites as a service. She could continue doing that and nobody will ever force her to make a wedding website for a gay couple.
Should the government compel someone to create a website for a gay couple when it goes against the website designers religious beliefs? Creating something is speech in itself. So compelling someone to create something is compelling someone to speech.
