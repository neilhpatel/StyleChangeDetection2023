When running for president Romney was persistent at labeling Russia our biggest geopolitical foe. In addition to the fact that it helps contrast himself with MAGA republicans he seems to be in favor of anything that takes Russia down a peg.
I’m curious which Republicans voted in favor of Ukraine. I suspect that Collins, Murkowski, Romney and Toomey are among them, as they they sometimes have a conscience, but I’m not sure about the rest.
If the United States prioritizes its economy, sure, that can improve, but at the cost of the independence of a country with tens and tens of millions of people, and if Ukraine falls to Russia, Russia will enforce its laws, including the ability to illegalize political rivals and a ban on any positive depiction of homosexuality, upon Ukrainians. Basically, if Ukraine falls, Putin will presumably be ruler until he dies and Ukrainian homosexuals won't be legally allowed to express their homosexuality. Moreover, if the Russian military can conquer Ukraine easily enough, Putin will potentially decide he wants even more countries to be under Russian control, and the cycle of Russian invasions will repeat itself.
I don't see that quote anywhere in the article. The closest thing I could find is that his statement that he "justifies" his lack of support for Ukraine by prioritizing the United States economy.
Even if he's being sincere, Paul's decision to oppose economic support for Ukraine is callous; I know the U.S. economy is not in ideal shape, but at least the U.S. isn't being invaded by a country known for shunning homosexuality and illegalizing political rivals.
