Overall by being welcoming to the conversation and sharing personal experiences, additionally listen to them. Essentially humanizing your beliefs to a community that has been told dems are evil. Maybe I got lucky though and my family is awesome, but it helped not being on the offense every time with the family regarding politics.
It’s also going to take time as people establish themselves in Texas. I say this from personal experience, as I influenced my wife’s family to slowly turn Blue. They went from a moderate conservative to left liberals over the course of 5 years. I have a feeling the same will happen in Texas but give it time.
Texas is a big state. After a couple of photogenic mothers die because they didn't get an abortion to save their lives, things will change.
When you put the decision making process in the hands of lawyers rather than doctors, all sorts of terrible outcomes will happen that wouldn't normally have happened.
Before anyone starts telling me about how abortion is legal when it's to save the life of the mother let me inform you that the mother's life has to be in danger first. This means that you can have a complication where the fetus will not survive but it's still marginally alive and the mother has to wait until sepsis or some other life threatening condition sets in before she qualifies to get an abortion.
