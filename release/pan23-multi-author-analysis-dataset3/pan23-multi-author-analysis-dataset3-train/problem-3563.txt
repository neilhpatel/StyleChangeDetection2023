I unfortunately grew up around people who think being anything other than cis, straight, and white is a sin and I’ve learned that no matter who they are, the fact that they act and choose to express who they are in hateful, bigoted ways is a reflection only on the ugliness inside of them. It has nothing to do with anyone besides themselves, you are amazing and beautiful and don’t ever feel like you need to change who you are to fit into some bigots box. There are SO many of us fighting for a more accepting, inclusive society. I promise the good outweighs the bad, the bad are just really loud and obnoxious. Right now it’s hard to focus on anything but the pain but I promise there are so many people filled with love in this world.
First off I am so sorry you’re hurting and I’m sending you a ton of internet hugs🤍 it’s okay to not be okay right now, I’m not. But we can be not okay together. Second It’s fucked and it’s insanely unfair that even in LGBTQ+ spaces were not allowed to exist. I am so sorry again that you’re hurting, this shouldn’t be, like we deserve better.
I'm sorry you have to go through this, but you're not alone. It's ignorant people who are to be blamed,some using religion to mask their insecurities.
