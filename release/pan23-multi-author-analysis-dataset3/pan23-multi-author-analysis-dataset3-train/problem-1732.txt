Common Good Constitutionalism is built on the Natural Law Theory that all people are invited with a set of rights imbued by God, Nature or Reason; and as such those rights can't be created only discovered through conflict and evolution. Only it takes it a step further by assuming that all laws are created with the purpose of achieving the greater moral good.
By this formulating laws like, "The Fugitive Slave Act" was not an evil law. It was a necessary law for the greater good (protecting the property of slave owners), which was "necessary" because men were "stealing" property and transporting it across state lines.
In their formulation there are no such things as unjust, evil, or immoral laws... Only immoral men implementing laws unjustly.
The basic idea behind the natural law theory dictum that there are no unjust laws is that promulgation by an authority (e.g. democratically elected legislature or an absolute monarch) is a necessary but insufficient condition for legislation/decrees to be genuine binding law. If the “law” passed/decreed fails to stand up to the light of justice, it fails to be a binding law. So, a natural law theorist would probably just say that the Fugitive Slave Act isn’t binding law because of the inherent injustice of slavery.
The real problem here is that the view seems to allow a judge to simply disregard a law if they think it unjust. That would be fine if the judge’s opinion was a reliable indicator of whether something was actually just. However, Vermeule and his ilk clearly have a stunted and deficient understanding of justice, and they’re the ones who are pushing to let judges exercising this discretion.
