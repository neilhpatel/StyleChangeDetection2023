Smoke shells were definitely used in massive quantities during the First World War, and smoke screens often played a vital role in the success of many attacks. However smoke by itself did not provide enough of a tactical advantage to breakout of the deadlock that was the trench system of the Western front.
Firstly deployment of smoke often reveals the location of where an attack will take place which would give the opposite side fair warning as to where they should fire their shells next. It also had the tendency to blind counter battery fire which was essential to knocking out machine gun posts and enemy batteries in the rear and on the flanks so that an attack could proceed.
The main function of the creeping barrage was not to obscure the attacking troops, but to force the defender to stay in their dugouts, or at least at the bottom of their trenches and foxholes, unable to fire at the attacks. The barrage was not a thin curtain of fire, but initially covered the portion of no man's land where the enemy might have outposts and at least as far as the first enemy trench line. For example, in the Battle of the Somme, British creeping barrages were typically about 400 yards deep; since the German lines were usually within 350 yards of the British lines, this kept the German first trench line under fire until the final lifting of the barrage past them, just before the attackers would reach their line.
As the attackers reached the first line and, hopefully, captured it, the barrage would stop an enemy counterattack from their 2nd trench line (both it and the ground between it and the first line should be covered by the barrage).
It provided a valuable moment for infantry to rush forward across open ground and engage in combat at a closer distance, and it also was used to disorient enemy fire, but was not without its disadvantages as well.
