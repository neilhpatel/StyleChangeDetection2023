Yeah I have to assume that wasn't all of the equipment. They would have been in their suits but there must be lights and maybe tools somewhere. The xdeep backplate set seems pretty standard. But it's too hard to tell what's up with the old Cressi bcd. I just hope they did a buddy check because their alternate air sources are on opposite sides. GUE divers shaking in their boots.
Oh agreed. Guessing they paid them off to avoid permit and ID questions. Which investigation would have led to whatever they were actually doing down there. And poor greedy cops never made the connection of suspicious behavior because diving is diving to them and Anything goes as far as they're concerned.
It's also possible the cops were just ignorant of diving/amber hunting which isn't quite the same as dumb/thoughtless. I know nothing about those things. If I found some homies stranded in the middle of a lake at night the conversation would probably be "Are you ok? Good what were you guys doing? Oh amber hunting. That sounds cool, how does it work? That's awesome, did you have any luck finding some? Oh, that sucks. At least you're ok though. Wait, why at night? Oh, I guess I didn't consider that time of day doesn't matter down there.".
Yes. But the law must authorise the detention in accordance with the ECHR. If there is nothing that continues to authorise the detention, then they must be released.
I agree. If there is a gap in the law then the legislature probably should fix it. But then back to my original point, it is not the local police's fault in that case.
I am not defending any country which wishes to sabotage another. But we must also not go down to their level. If there is a gap in the law, we should address it. I hope the national police can figure out what happened.
