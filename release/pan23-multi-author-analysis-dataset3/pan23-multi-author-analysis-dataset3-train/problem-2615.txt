But considering how unpopular they are, and how every one of their accusations turns out to be an admission; I have to wonder if there is significant amounts of voter fraud, fudging the numbers, and other such just plain out cheating to keep them in power at this point.
Add that to their screaming about voter fraud, and everything they are screaming about their enemies doing they are actively doing, and well it seems like them doing voter fraud is something we need to look into and make sure that in addition to all their legal cheating, there isn't also blatant fraud happening also.
If you are assuming there are others like this, you wouldn't be wrong, although googling for them is kind of tough, since "Republican election fraud" yields tons of stories about Republicans screaming about non-existent voter fraud.
And then Republicans run around with absurd lies about being the "party of the working class" when they're literally the most corrupt criminal fucks in the country. Party of the working class my ass. It's insane GOP voters turn out to spite "coastal elites" when their entire party brass is full of elite rich dipshits.
The gerrymandering are holding the GOP in power in so many elections these last election cycles, its insane. Otherwise congress would be blue and not split.
