While The Alcoholic Republic by Rorabough is probably the best source for the question in the OP, I'd recommend reading Okrent's Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition to learn more about the Temperance big tent.
Source: William Rorabaugh's The Alcoholic Republic, probably still the best single work on early republic drinking patterns.
I'll start by translating Burn's stat into something a little easier to work with. Per research by William Rorabaugh, Americans age 15+ around 1830 drank about 7 gallons of pure alcohol (as in, if you extracted the literal alcohol from the booze and added it all up) per capita per year. That's about 3.5 times what Americans consume per capita today, so yeah, that's a lot. An estimated 4.3 of those 7 gallons was consumed via distilled liquor (mostly whiskey by then but sometimes rum), plus another 2.7 via cider. Wine and beer were minor drinks then, lucky to get 0.1 gallons apiece.
The per-capita consumption of alcohol ...going as low as 1.8 gallons per person in 1845. After this the trend reversed and consumption began going back up, but yes, that trend is accurate.
