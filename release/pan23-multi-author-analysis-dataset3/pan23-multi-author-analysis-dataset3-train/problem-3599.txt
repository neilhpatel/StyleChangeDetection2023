according to this paper it wasn't so much "debunked" as much as it was just "too controversial" after 6 celebrated seasons of archaeology because geologists kept giving dates that didn't match "the story of history.".
Same. I think about it all the time. If anatomically identical humans have been walking around since about 300,000+ years ago I find it hard to believe there weren't at least simple societies and technologies. They could have even been iron age level technology and there would be no traces left, considering decomposition.
That's still very interesting! Even if they never evolved past late Stone age tech, the fact they could have had complex socities is fascinating to me.
I find it highly likely that there were stone age complex civilizations that we have little or know evidence of long, long before 6000 years ago. I don't find that much of a stretch at all. There was a huge city somewhere near the Mississippi before European contact that likely was significantly larger and more economically complex than London at the same time. But they didn't work metal, so evidence of the city was difficult to find.
Mine tailings are pretty obvious for a VERY long time. Additionally, while iron artifacts would almost certainly rust away in 200,000 years, they would easily leave imprints, casts, molds, etc that would leave evidence just like fossils.
Any iron age civilization would leave pretty significant evidence unless they only rarely worked meteoric iron. In that case, i would say they're not a true iron age civilization.
A similar city with similar tech 100k years ago would leave almost no physical evidence visible today. Possibly the best evidence would be genetic in the form of domesticated plants and animals.
