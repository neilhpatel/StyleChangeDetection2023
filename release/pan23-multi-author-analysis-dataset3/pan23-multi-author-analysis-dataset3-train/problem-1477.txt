It can't be underscored enough that the only character in that series that did not fall entirely victim to Hirst's agenda was Anne Boleyn, and the only reason that happened was because Natalie Dormer felt such a strong connection to the historical Anne. She had done enough of her own research (long before she was cast in the role) that she was equipped to present persuasive arguments to Hirst and the other show runners on issues of everything from Anne remaining a brunette (Dormer herself is actually blonde, and the show runners cast her as Anne on the basis of having the character be blonde as well) to showing a more humane side of Anne rather than the trope of Anne being a stone cold bitch. The interview Susan Bordo conducted with Dormer for her chapter on The Tudors in The Creation of Anne Boleyn is illuminating. Dormer, freed from Showtime's tether as the show was long over, speaks pretty frankly about how she had to "fight for Anne" almost every step of the way, because Hirst's vision of Anne was so contrary to what Dormer felt made Anne a compelling character. While she's still respectful of Hirst overall, the subtext of her interview really paints a picture of what the Anne character almost was, and it's not a pretty sight.
And the shade that Starkey throws at Omaha... That's pure Starkey egotism right there, and one of the reasons I've never liked him as a TV historian/presenter. I think Beevor has a better approach while still essentially saying the same thing as Starkey, that histo-tainment has to serve a purpose, otherwise why not just change the name from The Tudors to The Desperate Housewives of 16th-century England and call it a day?
It's interesting that Starkey feels the need to say: " "The series [ie, The Tudors] was made with the original intention of dumbing it down so that even an audience in Omaha could understand it.".
