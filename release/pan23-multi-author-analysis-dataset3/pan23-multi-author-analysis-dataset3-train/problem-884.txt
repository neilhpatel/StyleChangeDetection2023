He wasn’t re-elected this election. He’d previously won multiple terms, but he was term limited this election and a Dem won against an election denier Republican.
He of course wasn't perfect, and I still think he isn't someone I'd vote for ever given that during his whole tenure he was kept in check by a democratic state super majority. His covid response was flawed in that he let the counties decide on their own for mandates which led to a lot of confusion within the state. At every chance he had he vetoed legislation that would help Baltimore, the African American community, the red line for the metro, etc. Additionally, while he never voted for Trump he couldn't bring himself to vote for Hilary or Biden, instead choosing to vote for Reagan.
And he announced he voted for Reagan instead of Biden because he still couldn’t actually do the right thing for the country.
Reminder that hogan voted for a dead guy (Reagan) cuz he didn’t have the balls to vote against trump. He only seems moderate cuz MD’s legislature is very blue and vetoes stuff. Plus Bmore hates him. Coming from a Marylander.
