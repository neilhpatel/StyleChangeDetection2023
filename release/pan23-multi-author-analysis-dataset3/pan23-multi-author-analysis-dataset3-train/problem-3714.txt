It was a really good book. It sticks in my memory too. Thinking about it brings me back to where I was when I read it. Peter Benchley was a talented writer!
Fun fact; I donâ€™t remember if it was the making of the movie or the marketing for the book, but at some point in production, someone (I think it was a candidate for the role of director) was rejected when they got super hyped up talking about the project only to refer to the beast as a whale instead of a shark.
Both. Industrial fishing practices are probably the majority, but people have also gone on large-scale shark hunting parties out of concerns for public safety.
You should also consider how big of an impact commercial fishing boats unintentionally catching sharks alongside their actual targets.
But there's no correlation between making a movie about sharks killing people out at sea since thats the misconception at that time.
I suspect Spielberg knew that people would want to kill sharks, just that he never considered the impact that would have.
