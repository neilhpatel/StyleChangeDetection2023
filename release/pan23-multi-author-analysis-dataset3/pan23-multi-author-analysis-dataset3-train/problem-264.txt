This is what happens when your party chooses to ignore the few sane voices within your group and instead opt to embrace the voice of 1 man who is pushing conspiracies and lies about stolen elections. It baffles me that they made the decision to have large chunk of their candidates push such a bogus narrative that will obviously push fence voters into the arms of democrats. This election should have been a slam dunk for Republicans thanks to Biden's low approval rating, gas prices, and high inflation but instead they payed the price for betting in Trumpism to pull them to a "red wave".
Yes, typically in an average midterm election there is a large loss of seats from the sitting presidentâ€™s party, and currently the president is unpopular, plus the biggest voter concern according to exit polls was inflation/the economy which should have hurt Biden even further. This sort of lack of any sort of midterm backlash in spite of it being a perfect political climate for republicans was genuinely unthinkable in American politics and is a HUGE fucking repudiation.
And of course, judicial confirmations, leading committees, and at least a chance, however small, of actually passing meaningful legislation even if the Dems lose the House (which it is looking like they probably will, but not definitive yet) because any Republican Majority in the House so far looks to be slim.
You have to take into consideration the trends historically of the sitting presidents party losing many seat and the fact that if thw gop didn't gerrymander every state they could we wouldn't be talking about who would take the house, because the democrats would have easily taken it if not for gerrymandering. Republicans stack the odds in thier favor and still lose. They're a dying party and we are witnessing the beginnings of that.
