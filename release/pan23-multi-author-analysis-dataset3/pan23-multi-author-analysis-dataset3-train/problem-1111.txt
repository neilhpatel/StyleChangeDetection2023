Except it's the reading of the article that leads to the head scratching. As you quoted, the article says Biden should be more clear explaining the tough-on-China policies to look strong to voters while avoiding making public statements that would antagonize China and make any objectives harder to achieve.
It does not take a world-class diplomatic mind to understand why Biden would avoid giving a forthright account of his tough-on-China policies in a speech to Congress. There is a limit to the rhetorical provocations China will tolerate while maintaining even a tenuous working relationship.”.
“Biden’s China strategy would probably make for good politics if Americans understood it. Yet it has mostly existed in a space outside politics — in a world of policy memoranda and formal strategy documents and distant events like the Munich Security Conference. As it is, a sizable majority of the country disapproves of how he is handling relations with China: 58 percent in a new AP-NORC poll.
“An important job for Democrats will be clarifying their own policies with a message that makes sense to regular people.”.
It’s a tough subject to be speak succinctly on and understandably so as the article lays out. I, too, Im curious as to how they’ll package the message.
