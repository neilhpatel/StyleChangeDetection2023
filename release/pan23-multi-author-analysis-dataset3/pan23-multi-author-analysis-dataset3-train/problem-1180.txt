For example, in my city it is prohibited from allowing your pet cat to wander off your property. In that case, Cats "breaking out" of the neighbours property would be the issue, not OPs dog.
But you bet that if my dog got hurt by any of the cats I would track that BSTD down and sue him off the neighborhood. Luckily, it was never hurt and lived a long and happy life. All dogs go to heaven, they say; what they don't tell you is that most cats go to hell.
Ok, so... by that argument, it's ok if someone's cats get in my yard, but it's ALSO ok if my dog gets into someone else's yard. I should have asked years ago, it would have made dog-owning a lot simpler for me if I didn't have to teach my dog to recognize and respect property limits (including doors and gates because I didn't want it to flee outside every time I opened the front gate).
It was quicker to just let the dog deal with the problem and then dump the cat with the rest of the trash.
