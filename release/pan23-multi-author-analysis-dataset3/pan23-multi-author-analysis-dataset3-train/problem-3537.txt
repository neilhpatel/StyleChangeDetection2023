I don't think you understand. They are angry at their commanders for not doing a better job of annihilating Ukraine. The majority of Russians still support the war because they have been conditioned to believe that questioning their leadership is a good way to get in trouble since before any of them were born. It took 10 years for Americans to force their govt out of Vietnam, don't expect Russian citizenry to have a material effect for some time to come.
I couldn't give a number, but a Russian citizen who works for me (who does not support the war) believes it's a majority still given the conversations he has with folks back home.
It's going to be a while before a grass roots movement scares the Kremlin. It won't be 10 years if for no other reason than Russia will run out of actual soldiers well before then, but a while nonetheless.
A little bit of everything you said and that Russia recruits people from the occupied regions, which Russian military doesn't count as losses (same with Wagner). As far as I can say, Wagner/Donbas/Russian military either don't share their losses with each other or just that it's not reported as one number by the military.
