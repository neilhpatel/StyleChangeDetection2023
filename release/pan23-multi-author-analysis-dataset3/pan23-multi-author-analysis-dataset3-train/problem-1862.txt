Beyond that this matter might be complicated. And, in fact, mom might be entitled to use the life insurance to replace what dad might have paid toward the costs of raising you. Are there other trusted adults in your life to discuss this with?
You need to work with your trusted adults. And if there is not something playing out that everyone agrees to, consider involving an attorney.
Life insurance is demonstrably different than dad's estate. Life insurance pays to a named beneficiary outside the estate.
Life insurance does not go to the estate. This means, importantly: (1) people who aren't named (like his wife) can't challenge that you got the payout; (2) creditors cannot touch the money; and (3) you don't need to deal with the court stuff to get the money.
When a person dies, all of their stuff (bank accounts, houses, personal property, cars, etc.) all goes into their "estate." The will (or court) appoints an "executor" to determine who gets what from the estate. The executor must abide by the terms of the will. Usually creditors will get the first bite at the assets in the estate.
