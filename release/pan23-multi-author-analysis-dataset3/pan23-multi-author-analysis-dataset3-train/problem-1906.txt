Out of curiosity what makes me a tenant versus a resident? Is there even a distinction between the 2? For example, is a child would clearly be a resident. But once that child turns 18, is he now legally a tenant?
So even though there is no lease. IE, I didn't sign anything, that makes me a tenant and not a resident? I'm just curious because if there is no lease, then what are the terms exactly? What would be the cause for eviction, just because "i don't love you any more"?
Is there no distinction that the tenant and landlord have been sleeping together for 14 years, 5 of which in this house? Is there no distinction that the tenant has been paying the utilities?
Most tenants pay utilities in some fashion. Many are required to put utilities in their own names. It certainly indicates that you are a tenant, but it gives you no more claim to the ownership property than any other tenant who agrees to put utilities in their name as part of a lease or rental agreement.
Again, many tenants pay utilities in their own names. Even some that live with their landlord. Unless they have some sort of valid “rent to own” type agreement, that does not come close to giving them a claim to any sort of ownership over the property. You may be able to claw some other money back from the house, but the question of ownership over the property is fairly cut and dry.
