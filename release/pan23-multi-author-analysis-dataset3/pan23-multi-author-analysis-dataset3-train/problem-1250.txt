Nothing will happen with those records. Rich donors run the United States, and dems will not prosecute a rich person as they will no longer receive money from rich people, who run elections.
They'll tank his election chances by making it clear he is a traitor and he will receive 0 punishment and 0 negative consequences whatsoever because the US exists to make rich people richer and serves no other purpose.
I'm sure they'll whip up the votes for the investigatory committees on their perceived political enemies in preparation for 2024 presidential elections, but past that I don't see them doing much in these two years. Especially so if they lose the Senate outright.
Like that would be the straw, the fact he's not really a billionaire. I can seriously seeing this as a real deal breaker for his unwashed mob.
Probably not particularly effectively considering how narrow their majority is. The presumptive Speaker of the House currently lacks the votes to actually attain that position from his own party currently.
