Bear hunting in Canada is a money maker. Whether or not the culling is necessary, they will make excuses to do so. They had to outlaw grizzly bear hunting because their population got to dangerously low numbers due to poor oversight.
Guard regiment bearskins are byproducts of legal culls of black bears, in areas where they're overpopulated. No one goes "oh Privates Smith, Jones, Ahmed, and Fulante need hats, go kill a few bears.".
Yes. There are some fungus-derived "leathers" being created nowadays, but even so, most "vegan leather" is just pleather under a new name which means it's going to start shedding microplastics after about five or six years of use. As opposed to real leather, which has a lifespan of decades and is biodegradable.
Not all leather is biodegradable. They have to use a specific tanning chemistry to allow leather to biodegrade.
Google says 90% of leather is made using a chromium tanning process, and chromium tanned leather is not recyclable or biodegradable. It also causes heavy metal pollution, which I'm not sure is the case for.
Also, a major part of the problem is in fashion causing items to be thrown away before they are fully worn.
Why do we have to assume pleather is just thrown away while leather is responsibly disposed of? I get that there's a micrplastics issue, but that is not the case for all vegan leathers. It's not like leather is a necessary thing in most of the places it is used, so it's not really an either-or scenario. It's not like pleather is the only place plastic is used, either.
