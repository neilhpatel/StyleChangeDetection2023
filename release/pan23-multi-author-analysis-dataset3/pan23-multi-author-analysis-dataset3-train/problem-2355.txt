You, as a co-owner of the property, could begin legal proceedings to force a sale of the property. This is expensive and would probably eat up any equity in the home, so it should be a last option.
I'd really advise against having your name attached to a mortgage for a house you don't own and where you have no control over whether the debt gets paid.
If he doesn't make enough money to pull off the refinance he probably doesn't make up enough money to reliably pay the mortgage. If you're on that mortgage and he doesn't pay it he will be screwing you from beyond the grave of your relationship.
In this scenario you would also not be paying for the mortgage anymore. He would refinance to just him on the deed and mortgage. This could operate in either direction. But the person staying would need to be able to pay for the mortgage and get financing.
If he wants to be the tenant, he just needs to pay whatever the rent is. Yes, he is both renter and half-owner, so he is partially paying himself.
If you and he each own half the house, figure out what the rental price for the place should be and rent it out at that rate. Subtract the costs for maintenance, insurance, property taxes, mortgage, etc from the rent, and then divide the "profit" between you.
