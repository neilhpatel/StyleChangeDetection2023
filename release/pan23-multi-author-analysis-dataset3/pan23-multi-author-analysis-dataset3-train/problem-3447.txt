Talk to a local real estate attorney. Many will give you a brief consultation for free, and since you have a recent title search I doubt it would take more than an hour or two for them to do a more detailed review.
I wouldn't ignore the HOA unless you are 100% certain that you are not a member. In many states, HOAs have the ability to penalize you (including charging double-digit interest and late fees), then record a lien, and eventually start foreclosure proceedings.
My knowledge of Michigan law is limited, but an HOA is typically created by recording a declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions. Once recorded, the CC&Rs run with the land - meaning you would become part of the HOA by virtue of owning that property.
An HOA is merely a corporate entity that exists to own and maintain common property. If there is a shared road to be maintained by all the owners, itâ€™s possible that an HOA was created to own the road (rather than each owner owning a percentage of it).
Bylaws just explain how the corporation operates. How many board members there are, how long they serve, what constitutes a quorum for meetings.
