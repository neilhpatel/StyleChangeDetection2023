This situation is very common. You could try telling the new school you don't have any credits to transfer and see if they will forego the need for the transcript. If that doesn't work I would escalate it with th ags office to try and get them to drop it...but be careful you don't accept or admit to the debt in the process. You are probably beyond the statute of limitations for collections but that doesn't mean they still can't still refuse to give you the transcript.
The statute of limitations has passed, so they cannot come after you via the legal system for that debt, but that doesn't mean they have to give you your transcript when you still owe them money. I think you are going to have to negotiate with them and see what they will be willing to take in return for releasing your transcripts.
So, as I'm understanding this, you registered for classes, didn't withdraw before the drop/add date and therefore owed tuition, but did withdraw by the midterm drop date, so got Ws on your transcript rather than Fs.
