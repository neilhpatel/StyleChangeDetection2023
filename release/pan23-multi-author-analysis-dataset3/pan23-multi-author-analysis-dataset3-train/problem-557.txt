The lease says absolutely nothing about extra fees possibly being added or convenience fees. It mentions the one trash valet fee, and a cable fee. I agreed to that. There’s nothing about an additional trash fee and sewage fee that I occasionally get charged.
They only accept online payments as of a couple of months ago. They were doing cash, money order, and check payments either in person or using a drop off box but they’ve stopped accepting it at all and said we can only pay online.
Either way, if the eCheck option is permanently disabled, can you bring a check (or money order if you want it out of your account sooner) to the office or mail it to a payment address? I suggest my resident use the bill pay option through their bank, to have their bank mail a check monthly right to the payment address to arrive on time.
If the only "no fee" option is a paper check, then set up your bank to mail them checks. That's free from your bank and is no different than dropping off a paper check by hand.
Better yet, use your bank's free bill pay service to send them a check. It's self documenting, proves you paid (who, what, when, where).
If they've already been paid additional rent and they won't return it, then you have a credit and don't need to pay next months full rent in order to even it out.
