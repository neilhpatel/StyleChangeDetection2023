There was an MP who was an open critic of legalising and decriminalising cannabis, whose husband owned is the managing director of one of the largest producers of medicinal cannabis in the country.
Fellow Canadian, blows my mind that cannabis is still illegal in the UK (penalty up to 5 years in prison for possession), while we can just walk into any of the dozens of legal stores in our cities and buy it.
Are there seriously still people in the UK who are arguing things like "legalizing this addictive substance will result in mass unemployment and utter apocalypse on our roads because everyone will be stoned like they were in the scientifically accurate film, Reefer Madness?".
Ty for this. I've read brief accounts of the Japanese prison system on other places on reddit but this one was very informative.
Note to self don't break any laws if I visit Japan. It is unfortunate though. Long ago I quit cigarettes by switching to vaping which while still not great is a huge improvement. Sadly last I checked literally all types of e-cigs are banned entirely. If they don't allow nicotine gum I'd probably fail and use actual tobacco. Honestly that would outweigh any positives for visiting and im a huge japanophile.
I've been to Japan several times to visit a friend who became a permanent resident and have some insight. He told me there's obviously the debaucherous salary men that drink hard after hitting a massive sales goal, or just for the hell of it for "team building", but most have self restraint and won't go past 2 or 3 beers during a nomihoudai (all you can drink) session, which is still a deal.
