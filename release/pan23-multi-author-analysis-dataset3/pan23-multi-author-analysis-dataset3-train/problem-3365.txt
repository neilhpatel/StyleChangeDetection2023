'coordinated' doesn't mean 'done in secret'. Personally I think shutting down trading a specific stock is clearly more manipulative, but I wouldn't argue this isn't a coordinated effort if it came down to it.
Is a broker required to make a best effort attempt to ensure fairness in accessibility of stocks, or are they allowed to descdiminate against certain shares?
This comment seems to be centered on if robinhood's terms allow this, what I am more curious about is if the SEC/etc consider it acceptable if a brokerage "arbitrarily" blocks certain stocks from being bough, comoared to blocking trades for also selling?
You can argue about the ethics of hedge funds short squeezing all you want, but if Robin Hood has reason to believe its being used as a means of this kind of market manipulation, thereâ€™s arguably responsibilities from fiduciary duties that come into play. If stock indexes believe that the platform enables these kinds of pump and dumps, it may revoke their ability to trade, which could impact ALL the apps users.
Not really. This is actually quiet similar looking to pump and dumps that boiler room firms used to do in the 80s, especially given that more and more it appears to be being fueled and led by a few very savvy investors.
