Follow-up question: Is there any truth to the origins of the names of Greenland and Iceland being deliberately misleading to attract settlers/discourage raiders?
Greenland, however, is said in both Eíriks saga rauða and Grænlendinga saga (the two sagas about Vinland, derived from independent oral traditions in Greenland) to have been named deliberately by Erik the Red. "því að hann kvað menn það mjög mundu fýsa þangað ef landið héti vel.".
This fits well with the traditional narrative of broader literary activity in Iceland, which is to say that new literary production falls off a cliff until the Reformation, and that includes the annal-keeping practice I'm not.. entirely persuaded by that argument, I think it assumes that only "bad" sagas were being copied in that time, but as far as it goes for the question of Greenland, it's fairly straightforward to claim that the annal-writing tradition is practically defunct by the time any larger upwelling of emigration may have occurred.
(Added): I'd also like to add that Icelandic annals that mention the skirmish between the Skraelings and the Greenland Norse is one of the most important contemporary texts for the western part of Scandinavian history (Iceland and Norway) in the 13th and 14th century, so its source value is not so perhaps to be underestimated as a mere hearsay, though I generally agree to /u/sagathain's excellent post above.
