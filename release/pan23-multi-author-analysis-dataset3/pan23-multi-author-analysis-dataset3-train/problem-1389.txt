I voted against it because I don't want gun owner's licenses doled out by the police. Create a DMV for guns for all I care, but this is such a dumb way to do it.
So why wouldn't the people that buy the guns then resell them to criminals not do the same with ammo? You're logic does not hold up at all. Being a consumable makes no difference. Drugs are consumable and criminals have no problems getting them...
You view the ability of police to arrest people for breaking laws as being the same as them being the ultimate arbiters of if someone can even exercise their rights in the first place?
If the police officers are in charge of issuing the permit and can decide not to issue one (even to a qualified person), then it is arbitrary. The SCOTUS recently ruled against such types of things. Gun control does work, but laws need to apply to everyone equally. Having a qualified person able to be denied is simply not right. A person either meets the requirements or doesn't. We should not be comfortable with unequal application of the rules. This should be the case even if we have COMPLETE confidence in the people making those decisions.
