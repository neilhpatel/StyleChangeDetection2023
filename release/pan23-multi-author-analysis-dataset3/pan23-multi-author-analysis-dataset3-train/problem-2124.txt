South Africa and South Korea had questionable matches (and Brazil 2014, Bosnia was stolen a goal thanks to one blind linesman) but this is blatant.
Funnily enough Spain were also victim to foul refereeing in 2002 vs South Korea. I don't remember Spain involved in match fixing in the past 10/15 years, I could be wrong if you have info? I think what you are describing is more like a Champion's curse where the defending champs have a woeful campaign in the next tournament. France win in 1998, poor in 2002. Spain win in 2010, poor in 2014. Germany win in 2014 and poor in 2018.
I acknowledge this is fake, but for the sake of conversation, would you rather a team takes a bribe and knows they'll lose, OR would you rather the ref would take a bribe, so one team would just be cheated in plain site (South Korea vs Italy 2002 world cup, funnily enough that ref was Ecuadorian).
But yes, let's all worry about how them being accused of bribing a team to lose in the World Cup could be damaging their reputation.

They are going to try and bribe every team and on top of it all, I believe people will sadly die during the world cup, I'll be surprised if it doesn't end up as a tragedy.
