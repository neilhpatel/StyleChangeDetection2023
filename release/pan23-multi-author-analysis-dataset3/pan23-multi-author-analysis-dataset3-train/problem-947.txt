Yeah, according to BBC, it's a separate one, not an aftershock. I've never heard something like this before (2 independent earthquakes near each other).
Gods not real… Earthquakes are usually caused when underground rock suddenly breaks and there is rapid motion along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake.
Hey, what if… now bear with me… what IF God doesn’t really give a shit about the burning of some book and he cares waaaay more about the unification of mankind and actual peace on earth. 🤯.
PS. Maybe we should change the name of hıyars because calling some Istanbulites that name is actually an insult to the vegetable.
As a conclusion, I demand that from now on you change the Turkish language and call Fransa Frrrr[an]ce, Almanya Deutschland, İspanya España and Çin 中国. No ? That's what I thought. I hope you have a nice day in Turkey despite what's going on and I'm not just talking about the earthquake.
My heart goes out to the poor people of Turkey 🙏 I can only imagine the terror of 2 separate large quakes! Hopefully we can get help there soon.
