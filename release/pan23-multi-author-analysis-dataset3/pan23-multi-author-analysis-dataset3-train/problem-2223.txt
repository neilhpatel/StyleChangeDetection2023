Have several Stalingrad style defeats due to "leader" interfering with the generals and making stupid decisions.
And that's why no one is invading Russia, which makes their whole initial argument for the invasion laughably stupid, even if the rest of the insane things had been true.
The only thing Russia has accomplished since that invaded Ukraine is show the US that the Russian military’s conventional capabilities are not a legitimate threat.
All this war has proved for Russia is that a relatively rag tag conglomeration of mostly former Soviet equipment and training in the Ukrainian military, plus a trickle of Western aid since 2014 and then a huge infusion in 2022, is all it took to halt and ultimately reverse a significant thrust of Russia's military.
Realistically Ukraine’s losing similar numbers because theres no way they’re not taking heavy casualties to retake territory with dug in Russians coupled with the enormous artillery duels across multiple fronts wherein Russia was expending upwards of 10 000 shells/day during the early days of the war.
