98% an accident, but the response will be critical. Otherwise a missile will hit downtown Lublin or a supply depot in Rzesz√≥w and Russia will be like ‚Äúoops sowwy ü•∫‚Äù all over again.
EDIT: I am aware this was likely a Ukrainian S300 which failed to intercept a Russian target. The loss of life remains as tragic as any other in this war, though it is Ukraine‚Äôs right to defend its territory.
I would hope that an expeditious deployment of high grade western anti-air systems, from Patriot to C-RAM comes of this. Ukraine should not need to even consider defending itself with 1970s soviet junk that might as well be a bow and arrow compared to what we have.
Their goal is to make Ukraine part of Russia, bringing NATO into the war would be counterproductive to say the least.
The distinct impression I've had for a while is that Russia is trying to avoid further NATO involvement. Sure, their in-house propaganda says that NATO is fighting a proxy war with Ukraine but they probably know that they'd be in even worse shape if they drew NATO into the war.
Either way, accident or not, NATO has to make good on their earlier promise of punishing Russian transgressions on NATO soil, or it would weaken the alliance in the long term. Look at the CSTO crisis for how serious of an issue credibility is for a defensive alliance.
Putin isn't fucked, because a NATO response is always going to be somewhat proportional. No, that doesn't mean killing 2 random Russian citizens, but rather putting as much of a hurt on Putin as he did on Poland. Taking away some of his toys (valuable military hardware) in a missile strike or two would set an example.
I do believe this to be an accident, but there's also the (slim) possibility he's testing NATO's resolve and trying to insert a wedge in the alliance. In that case it would be even more important to call the bluff, and not allow the alliance to fracture over a weak response.
