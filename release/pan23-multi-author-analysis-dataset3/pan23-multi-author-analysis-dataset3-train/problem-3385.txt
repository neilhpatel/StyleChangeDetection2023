Putin wouldn't have been scared of Trumps reaction in an invasion, but he wouldn't have needed to invade if Trump was still President.
Trump was destabilizing the West and NATO, and Putin didnt have to risk anything. Trump was talked into abandoning US allies in Syria by a foreign leader, and tried to order the withdrawl of all US personel in the Middle East. If he won a second term I dont think there would have been any urgency or need for a Russian a invasion, Putin could just let Trump achieve his objectives for him.
You are talking about what Putin is doing now, not what he would be doing if Trump was still President. Things would have played out differently, and the outlook and opportunities Trump would create for Russia would be far broader than just Ukraine.
He isn't pulling troops for the Finnish border (which isn't even part of NATO yet) because he doesn't care about NATO, he is pulling troops because he needs them to hold up his failed invasion of Ukraine.
Putin did not invade Ukraine because Trump didn't win, therefore his only option was forced to invade Ukraine to weaken NATO. He invaded Ukraine because he WANTED Ukraine.
This is not a leader who is concerned about NATO and wants to hurt NATO by invading Ukraine. There is no 13D battle chess here. He wants Ukraine for his own reasons, and NATO bashing is just blabbing. Ukraine would have been invaded regadless of who was in the WH. (The only thing changed would have been the intelligence provided. The current american administration probably gave Ukraine a very good fighting chance.).
