I explicitly asked if I would be exposed to any liability here due to negligence and they said no. I have a report from an arborist saying the tree is not a hazard, and I offered to split the cost with my neighbors. I’ve taken reasonable measures to resolve the matter, but my neighbors are being unreasonable.
Good question. I can't find a record of another dispute they settled between residents. Typically they meet when a resident requests they remove a tree that might damage municipal property or utilities.
Better yet, if the neighbor trims the tree and ends up killing it, you can sue THEM for property damage and cost of removal.
Secondly, it usually falls that you can trim anything over your property, unless it would fatally maim or injure the tree. If you just had the trunk and the whole tree leaned over, they might not legally be able to just chop it in half.
This would of course be a boundary tree and I would think both parties responsible for removal, but I don’t live in NY.
Can you even decline to remove the tree if the village tree board rules in the favor of your neighbor?
My assumption is that you cannot decline to remove the tree. That code enforcement would fine you and then proceed with removing the tree and bill you for it.
