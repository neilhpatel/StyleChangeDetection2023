The lack of organisation is terrible: for the immigrants, for the host countries, for the host countries citizens, for the perception of immigrants to those citizens.
I don’t understand Europe’s approach to immigration laws. I know it’s a contentious issue, that’s fair, but there should at least have an agreement on how to even start processing all those new arrivals - instead they just keep going there and form slums. Coordinated all throughout the EU, too.
What EU should do in long run, is make effort to better the conditions, rights and safety of the people in their own countries. There should be legal ways available for people to migrate, instead of using human trafficIng.
Immigration is fine, but the people who migrate need to learn and adapt to the society they live in. That means learning the language, building relationships with locals and accepting the host nations values.
The UK tried an open door policy in the 00's and it built up a lot of resentment in the native population, it didn't help people complaining were immediately labelled as racist (some/many were, but it shut down discussion on the integration issues).
The enclave allows them to operate as they would in their home country and that makes it obvious they hold different values which annoys the locals.
