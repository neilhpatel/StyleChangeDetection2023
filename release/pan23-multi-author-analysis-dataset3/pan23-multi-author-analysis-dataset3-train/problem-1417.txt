But what if something happens to both Coke and Pepsi at the same time? We can make the same deal with another beverage company. Or we can do it with food companies overall. Or we can do it with every company in every industry. This is what the S&P 500 represents. You can buy SPY to invest in all 500 of the largest US stocks at once. You can buy VTI to invest in all US stocks. You can invest in VT to invest in all stocks on Earth. That way if you work in the travel industry during COVID, you'll still own plenty of Zoom and Peloton stock to keep you afloat. Then when the pandemic ends and people stop wanting Zoom and Peloton stuff, you'll be covered then too.
It's like how the 50 states in the US combined to form the United States. All the countries in Europe formed the EU. Or maybe you want to be in ASEAN. You can also be in the United Nations. Lots of democracies form international organizations that create rules that individual voters in each country can't violate. The Paris Climate Accords are a good example. Lots of Americans (Republicans) don't like them, but they have to live with it.
Then going to the Republicans isn't going to help them. They want actual slaves. The only thing that will help is replacing the corporate Democrats with actual progressives.
