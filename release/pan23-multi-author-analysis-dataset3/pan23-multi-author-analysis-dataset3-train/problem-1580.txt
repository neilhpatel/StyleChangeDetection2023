Edit: just assuming the reason was my panic attack cause thatâ€™s the only thing out of the ordinary that happened.
It sounds like their interpretation of your behavior during your panic attack suggests a threat or liability to them.
Even if it is a disability for other purposes, your anxiety doesn't give you any special rights to have the money mailed, direct-deposited, or paid using an escrow method that would be less personally stressful.
A lot of employers switch into CYA mode when there's a chance that there will be a disability or retaliation claim. They shut down any electronic connection to your banking, and won't take your phone calls except through their executives, HR, or attorneys.
The unhappy legal fact is that if you suffer a panic attack at work but have never been through a disability accommodation process with your employer, they can probably dismiss you for cause or for no cause, because their accommodation requirement isn't triggered by your disability itself, but rather by your request for accommodation.
If you did have a disability accommodation with your employer, then your dismissal might be a fact-specific dispute.
