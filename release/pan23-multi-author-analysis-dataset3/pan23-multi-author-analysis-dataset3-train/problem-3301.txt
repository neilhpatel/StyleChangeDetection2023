DARPA: "We've actually been working on it, give us a year and a trillion dollars. Oh, and it'll be able to shoot nukes down in terminal trajectory. We figure if we need the aircraft carrier-carrier aircraft, we'd better make it overkill.".
Land, air, or sea, the US is basically it's own entity in the top two or three spots. Hell, the USMC is the Navy's fighting force, and man to man, they're roughly equivalent to Russia's special forces, except there are a fuck ton more of them, especially after the Russian experience pinata debacles at the start of the war.
Also Russian navy is intentionally build for defense of their waters (no real aircraft carriers etcâ€¦) while the US one carrier group has the potential to dwarf their navy and I donâ€™t know how many the US has now but itâ€™s a lot ðŸ˜….
They can legally park their warship in international waters (12 miles from the US coast), but the US can just park a few of their warships there too, with all weapons trained on the Russian ship. The 'hypersonic' missiles would barely get airborne before the entire Russian ship was turned into scrap metal.
I thought these hypersonic missles were so fast they could destroy Washinon from the Russian mainland in like an instant?
Why do the launchers need to be so close to the target to be effective? Sounds like a shitty design.
