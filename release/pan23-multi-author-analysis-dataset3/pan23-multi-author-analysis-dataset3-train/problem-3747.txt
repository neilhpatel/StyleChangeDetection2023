IANAL. The three most common ways for a house title to be held among multiple people are: Joint tenancy, Tenancy in common, and Tenants by entirety.
With Tenancy in common, your father can leave (if he has a will), his share of the property to you (or someone else including your uncle) and that person will now share ownership with your uncle.
If you want it under your sole control, you would then need to arrange for your uncle to give you his share, or buy it from him at reasonable value; perhaps by mortgaging your half and paying the mortgage (if you can qualify for one).
Generally speaking, even if the house is a joint tenancy with right of survivorship now, either party can choose to sever that joint tenancy by deeding their interest to the property to a third party (or in some states, even to themselves). This would serve to sever the joint tenancy and convert it to a tenancy in common. The other joint tenant does not need to approve or even be aware of this transaction.
It depends how the deed is written it matters if it is joint tenants with rights of survivorship vs. joint tenants in common. In short if it is in commons you would be before your uncle in the inheritance if it is rights of survivorship your uncle is first in line.
