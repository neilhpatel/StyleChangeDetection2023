I get everyone is kinda butt hurt about her interview but wasn’t this grand jury just about deciding if they should proceed with an indictment and an entirely different, criminal, grand jury would actually review everything they saw and make a charging decision?
I agree in a normal case, but I think context is important here. This case is about something the entire nation/world witnessed live, then for 2 years almost daily on all forms of media. Doubt there is any jury pool to taint.
GA has two types of Grand Jury. Special Grand Jury which this chick was the foreman for, and regular Grand Jury. Special GJs last longer, but don’t have indictment authority. Regular GJ which is going on now, only last for 2 months, and they have indictment powers. The next jury after the indictment isn’t really accounted for because it hasn’t been selected yet. That will follow after indictment, and arraignment.
um, except this kind of shit isn’t supposed to influence the Grand Jury, and why they are specifically instructed to not watch stuff about their case in the media and not take into account anything NOT presented in court.
It won’t affect the case against Trump & Co as the special grand jury doesn’t issue indictments, only recommendations which the DA has to then decide.
The interview was unnecessary. She’s basking in the attention and probably has intentions for a book deal. That’s a given and most people would be surprised to learn if the opposite was true. Always hilarious what people will Stevie about on Reddit.
