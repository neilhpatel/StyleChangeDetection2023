Are you kidding me my dude? There's only one kind of Neo-Nazis, the ones that are actual Neo-Nazis. White supremacy? Conspiracy theories about the Jews? They like to talk about cleansing minorities and any kind of irregularity? Yeah, those Nazis, Vanilla ISIS.
Edit 2: if you're confused by my "ambiguity" there should be nothing ambiguous about Nazis. Nazism is as toxic of an ideology as what ISIS follows, and should be purged from our civilization like we're doing to ISIS. Nazis are vanilla ISIS.
And if you're downvoting me because you're a Nazi and I hurt your feelings, try not being hateful bastards.
Looks like people are downvoting you not because nazis, but because you’re not being very specific. Every country in the world has a subset group of neonazi, are you calling for military raid in every country? By whom?
Do you want Canada to invade the US to clear out its neonazi problem? Do you want England to invade France to get rid of its nazi problem? How about Italy? Do you want Japan to invade them to get rid of their nazi problem? And how about Japan? Who will invade them?
And are you also aware that “cleansing of nazis in Ukraine” was putin’s excuse to mount a full scale invasion in an attempt to take land?
There is a Kremlin narrative that people in Ukraine are nazis which supports their war propaganda and imperialistic goal.
