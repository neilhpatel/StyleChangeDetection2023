Americans think they are so special and that they are the only country with Chinese spy balloons in their air space, when clearly there are also Chinese spy balloons in Chinese air space.
What are the odds that it’s a fake “American Spy balloon” that the Chinese sent up just so they can shoot down and say “hahahahaha, USA hypocrites, we shoot down their shitty balloon too”.
Then I realised that an American spy balloon will probably also have 'made in China' stamped on many of its components...
My guess is the Pentagon has intentionally been conflating the Chinese balloons with these UAPs... So that when they started shooting them down people would just confusing them with more Chinese balloons.
The Chinese are not engaging a balloon, they are engaging the same type of objects the US airforce and Russians have been engaging.
The thing is the US Navy has been reporting these strange objects for 20 years but never did anything about them except to observe. Then in the last 5 years the number of them has exploded.
