How about " Pete provides thoughtful and intelligent response to one of the ignorant GOP lunatics who hates that he is a better human being ".
Pete is one of the greatest politicians in existence right now, he is constantly being invited on Fox News, set up with “gotcha” style questions and he calmly makes them looks like morons every time. This headline made me feel like my man lost his composure. When really, he just responded like the boss he is.
He doesn’t have the established history like Sanders to show whether he really means what he says when speaking publicly, but if you’re willing to turn your back on seemingly honest and progressive politicians over a single bill, you aren’t likely to ever find a politician you can feel good about supporting.
For crying out loud, can we stop it with these sensationalist headlines? I’m being totally serious too, btw.
Being the secretary of transportation, he got put in a pickle that was difficult to escape. Yes, he could have stood his ground and refused to support the bill as it was proposed, but the Biden Admin should have never gotten involved in those negotiations in the first place.
