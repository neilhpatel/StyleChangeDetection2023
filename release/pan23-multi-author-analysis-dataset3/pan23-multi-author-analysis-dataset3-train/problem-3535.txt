Yeah, I'm realizing that to get the most out of the sub I need to dig around it more. I think what's been happening is I was relying too much on the algorithm to push threads to my front page. Basically everything that comes to my front page is old enough to have like two deleted answers but not old enough to have quality answers yet. It's like Reddit is boosting threads that are volitile or something. Anyway, I had hoped I could just subscribe and see interesting questions come through from time to time. Apparently that's not the case, you have to comb the sub more actively. Which is cool, just not what I'd expected.
There's probably just not enough historians out there with the time to answer. Can I buy some of you beers to spend less time with your families and more time answering random questions on the internet?
I hear that, it makes sense. I guess I'm just frustrated by all the interesting questions with no visible answers.
If you're frustrated by the interesting question with no visible answers, I suggest adjusting how you use the subreddit. Filter by "top from past month" instead of "hot". Subscribe to the newsletter message. Bookmark the sub instead of actually subscribing to it. All of these are other ways of interacting with reddit in general and this sub in particular that prevents the experience you are describing.
