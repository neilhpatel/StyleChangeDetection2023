BMW was testing this in car engines wayyyy back when I was a little VW nut. I'm not an engineer but I think the project didnt work because the infrastructure to install hydrogen pumps...everywhere was too much.
Part of the problem with hydrogen as a straight fuel is that the infrastructure to contain it is a problem. Gaseous hydrogen is extremely difficult to keep contained, it just sort of oozes through most kinds of seals used to hold it in. Plus, gaseous hydrogen isn't very power dense relative to liquid hydrogen, but if you try to handle liquid hydrogen, you have all sorts of new problems relating to dealing with a cryogenic fluid.
Even assuming cryogenic liquid storage (which wouldn't likely be cost effective) you'd end up with reduced range, because liquid hydrogen has lower energy content by volume than Jet-A....at least with all else being equal. Because on modern jets gross vehicle weight has a big impact on fuel consumption. With high pressure compressed gas the energy storags that's probably less than half the range.
Hydrogen is really good at leaking past seals and o-rings that would easily contain other gases. In some situations you kind of assume that some slight leaking is inevitable, Therefore areas running hydrogen lines need to be ventilated in such a way that an explosive mixture is very unlikely.
Mixing with air in confined spaces results in high explosion potential, even compared with gasoline. Jet-A in contrast does not evaporate much and doesn't tend to easily form explosive mixtures. Lighting a match and then dropping it in a small dish of jet-A will usually just put out the match unless it's Qatar in the middle of summer.
