That said, our symptoms are relatively mild. We both had about 3 days of fever, most of which pretty mild. We had some Ibuprofen at home to help with it. Now I think we have passed the peak, and it's just a lot of coughing. If the vaccine is to help reduce the impact I think it surely worked in our case.
My point was to tell you that Sinovac is an effective vaccine. Other countries have used it just fine.
China just didn't do a good job getting people vaccinated. It looks like they have switched tactics and are now making a vaccine push.
I wonder what an anti vaccine person think about this? Very curious.. as many anti vaxxers think it’s just a flu.. will they even count dead people from Covid being real?
It’s true that for most people it’s just a flu. Ironically, I have seen some of the discourse of anti-vaxxers reproduced in China’s public opinion in the weeks leading up to anti-lockdown protests even though Chinese people were not attributing the pandemic to some sorts of authoritarian conspiracy, nor were they against vaccination. In this anti-lockdown discourse, the figures of rising case number were placed into serious question and it was believed that some indecent PCR companies were secretly making up a hoax to prop up zero-covid policy for their business interests.
This is probably a bit exaggerated. People in China generally use Western medicine just like people in other modern societies. There is a debate about the effectiveness of China’s traditional medicine but there is never such a thing for Western medicine. In fact, as cases have been rising insanely, drugs like ibuprofen are sold out everywhere. The stubbornness is exclusive to anti-covid vaccine since China has gone to great lenhs to bond Chinese vaccines with nationalism.
