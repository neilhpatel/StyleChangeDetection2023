The innocent blood of children is being shed in the hands of the Saudi regime, as the number of executions of minors has seen a slight increase in the past six years. The thought of children being subjected to the horrors of torture and denied a fair trial before facing the death penalty is beyond unacceptable and reprehensible.
They execute protestors and minors under torture who never hurt or killed anyone without fair or public trails. They also execute activists and whistle blowers, and people who voice their disagreements. They even killed and handed death sentences for people who refused to leave their homes for Neom project.
I don't get how you compare US death penalty of ruthless murders after appeals and public trails to that shithole. Also if you compare them by % of population , it's 20 times that of the US. It's just another level.
2- You're probably missing a lot of details of the true picture and geopolitics of countries in the middleeast which turned them into the shitholes they are today.
