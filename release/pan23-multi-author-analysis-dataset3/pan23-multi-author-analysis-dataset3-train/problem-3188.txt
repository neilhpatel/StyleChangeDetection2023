Pence is refusing to testify because he was acting as the President of the Senate, and thus protected by the debate clause.
>“We have a separation of powers under the Constitution of the United States, and I believe it would establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House.”.
The “executive privilege” claim was doomed from the start: a special counsel, multiple civil convictions for related participants, and public interest all weigh against Trump’s declaration. It’s established law all the way back to Chief Justice Marshall that the President [sitting or not] is subject to federal criminal process and that executive privilege is never absolute. So… I hope Pence shreds Trump because the truth is probably worse than anything we could concoct in our imagination.
You would think Pence would have a chip on his shoulder given that Trump’s Jan 6th protesters were going to kill him if they found him. Hang Pence chants, etc.
