First, borders being hard delineations, aside from something explicitly agreed upon between polities or very obvious landmarks or terrain features such as rivers, are a rather modern concept. The lands 'owned' by a polity in the past were largely based around either explicit landmarks or features that were owned, and population centers (and their hinterlands, usually). This doesn't really reflect well, often, with the modern basis of drawing maps since they aren't clear borders or even necessarily territory. This is why, in many maps of ancient or classical polities, they often have round or 'fuzzy' borders - because they didn't really have borders as we think of.
In the case of a map like that, though, I'd suspect that the person merely wanted to portray some form of contiguous boundary that made sense to us, and so they drew it like that - other maps will often, instead, draw a gradient boundary in such situations (though the Romans did control the population centers). You will find that in that area, largely where the trade routes are, it isn't quite sand dunes and the like, but more a mixture of desert, steppe, and oases. The only thing that would have been of interest to the Romans would have been the population centers, roads, and possibly trade routes.
It's not particularly different outside of the red zone (unless you go into the deeper desert further east-by-north-east), but we don't even have an official reason as to why Rome annexed the Kingdom in the first place, let alone why they didn't conquer further.
But then basically my original question could be rephrased as: Why didn't Rome assert control over those population centres in the non-red zone but DID assert control over the ones in the red zone? Usually there's an answer there for other places like "Well, the Danube was very defensible." And that's the kind of answer I'm looking for here too.
