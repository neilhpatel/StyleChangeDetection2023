I would like the discount but if I can’t get the discount I would at least like to warn people of this dealership’s practices. Especially, finding out another acquaintance had this same experience a week before I ordered my car. This is why the full page ad. I don’t feel this dealership should be able to continue this practice if offering something in the beginning only to take it off the table after you wanted months for your new car.
You are also correct I could wait until my car is built, and if no discount, I could walk away and go to another dealership and wait another 5 + months for another vehicle to be made. Under normal circumstances, I would, but unfortunately I can't wait another 5+ months to get my car.
We have simply ordered the vehicle, we have not agreed on a price yet. We did pick this dealership solely based on the fact that the sales person told us they accept the F&F discount. In light of what we found out yesterday I feel like we were tricked by the sales person. If they would have told us they no longer accepted the discount we wouldn’t have even picked that dealership.
Accepting the discount or not doesn't really matter unless you've agreed on a price (in writing) and they're trying to renege.
