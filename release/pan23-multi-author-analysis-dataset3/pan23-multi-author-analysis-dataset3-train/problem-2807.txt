Well we pay underinsured motorist, and as far as I understand the rental reimbursement is covered by that when is a phantom car.
Assuming it is covered if I pay out of pocket they should reimburse me after they decide if it is something that falls under the underinsured motorist?
Do you pay for "rental reimbursement coverage" or some similar name as part of your automobile insurance? If not the insurance company has no obligation to pay for your rental. If you do, they may not pay until they decide this is a covered loss and you would be out of pocket until reimbursement.
Don’t feel bad about not knowing, hopefully you can get enough advice here on what steps to take to minimize the impact on your life. You aren’t in an uncommon position, the first time you deal with stuff like this it’s overwhelming. But your insurance agent and claims adjuster deal with this stuff daily and can tell you what you are owed based on the contract you signed.
