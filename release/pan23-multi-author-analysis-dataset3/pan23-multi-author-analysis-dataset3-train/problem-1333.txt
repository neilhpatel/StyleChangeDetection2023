I’m a middle aged white male, they will never have my vote. Not saying they won’t get others, but I refuse to even acknowledge people who are “conservative” at this point.
I never said Republicans don't attack progressives, they do. But thats to be expected as they attack all Democrats.
So the Democratic party didn't put their thumb on the scales during the last 2 primaries to push neo-liberal candidates over the populist progressive candidates?
You realize everytime Dems get a majority there's magically just enough Dems against the party platform that it won't pass so party leadership never brings it to a vote?
The Democratic Party has a lot more conservative active voters than people want to admit, and when they're motivated, we get landslides.
How are people supposed to know if they need to primary their incumbent if they never know how they'll vote on the stuff they want?
Because once the general happens I have to vote against Republicans, which often means voting for someone I don't want.
I could not vote, or vote 3rd party, but that result would be worse than voting for a Dem I don't think should win. They're just the least worst option.
