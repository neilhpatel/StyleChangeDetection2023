For Federal violations resolved through the C.V.B., you're functionally paying them to drop the charges, and they will never appear on a background check or be reported to the DMV. It would be bribery if it wasn't the government's idea.
US District Courts periodically publish "collateral forfeiture schedules" and Google always seems to find the ones where that's a $5/MPH over the limit fine, but I found one from just a few years ago in the Central District of California that said:
If the "no appearance required" box is checked, then there's almost certainly directions for paying a "collateral forfeiture" amount to the Central Violations Bureau in lieu of appearing in court to contest the ticket.
But otherwise, the violation stays filed away at the Central Violations Bureau and your money goes to the Treasury and the DMV is none the wiser.
In most state courts, when you pay a fine you're pleading guilty and will have the offense on your criminal record (if it's a crime) and reported to the DMV.
So just pay the fine and it wonâ€™t show up on my driving records either ? Sounds like a good deal actually.
