As egg prices went up and their delivered supply remained at the same level they earned record profits.
Listen, I don’t expect to have MBA level financial discussions on Reddit and it’s the fun to just say corpo-bad but that editorial you linked doesn’t tell you the causal factor behind Cal-Maine’s performance.
Why doesn’t it feel that way? We’re in an inflationary period and the purchasing power of a dollar is less than it was. E.g. your number of dollars stayed the same (or you got an increase to match inflation) and now you can buy less with the same (or lamentably the same amount despite “higher” income).
This isn’t the same as printing money like the federal government did for the past 3 years, which did contribute to higher inflation. This won’t help inflation, but it won’t necessarily make it worse, either, since they took in more money than anticipated.
Ironically would raise inflation rates in all likelihood, because as you say the real problem doesn’t come from the supply side right now. It’s a demand problem. Specifically the demand for all the money in our wallets.
