Is this her own house and she doesn't rent out anything else? Because it sounds like she's asking you to break the law on her behalf. Also, lease clauses that force a tenant to pay a set amount for breaking a lease early are illegal in California.
Correct, but that may be less than a day, due to the requirement to mitigate. California landlords absolutely cannot collect rent until the end of the lease they have failed to mitigate properly. This is not unique to California either. Any lease requirement for a certain amount to terminate, for example two months, is illegal on its face due to mitigation requirements.
In either case, let’s say a landlord needs two months to turn an apartment, even if there is someone waiting to move in, then that is pretty clearly permitted.
So not only is the landlord entitled to the totality of the remaining rent, but they also can seek any other amount to compensate due to tenant’s failure to perform.
The law as stated is that the landlord can recover the worth of the unpaid rent—it’s literally (a)(1).
