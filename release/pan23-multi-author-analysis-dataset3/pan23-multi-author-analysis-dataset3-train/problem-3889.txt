I'm from Canada and we also had DARE. I remember being told that when I got just a little older there were going to be people constantly offering me free drugs just to get me hooked.
I only had to hang outside corner stores trying to convince adults to buy smokes for me for about 5 or 6 years before I turned 18. I have a hunch that public sentiment has shifted enough by now that it's even more difficult to convince someone these days. If I had to do that every time I wanted to buy a pack, for literally the rest of my life, I probably would've quit by now.
For what it's worth, I'm a 40yo, 25+ year heavy smoker (weed and cigarettes) who's lived my whole life in CA. I've been at 2+ packs and about an 1/8-1/4 oz per-day consistently for more than 15 years. When I saw New Zealand pioneering this idea I thought it was fucking brilliant.
edit: Yes, it may not be a perfect solution or even work all that well. And yes, people are going to find ways to get what they want through illegal channels if necessary. Maybe I'm optimistic, but I just don't see a huge black market for getting kids hooked on smoking. That's a much more realistic goal when you're doing it legally, in plain sight with no shame (i.e. "big tobacco," marketing to children with flavors, etc.), not so much when you're already paying $13/pack for product that you want to resell under the table.
25+ year smoker who still smokes, lives in CA, and fully supports this plan. I think the fact that we already have more money than we know what to do with might work in our favor here. I agree with you 100%, just pointing out that CA might be the ideal state to pilot this idea.
