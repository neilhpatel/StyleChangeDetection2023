Probably we know LESS about the actual person that was Alexander the Great than Julius Caesar might have.
The question still remains if Caesar knew the "real" Alexander any better through those sources, but he probably had to wade through a lot less sources than we did.
Needless to say, Caesar is unlikely to have been in a much better position to critique these aspects of histories of Alexander than we are today. I tend to believe that the events of Alexander's conquests should be regarded as much murkier than they are commonly reported, but given his position in the western canon, the bordering-on-repulsive exaltation of him as a virtuous hero, and the diminutive interest in the Achaemenid Empire, this is unlikely to happen any time soon.
Alexander falls into the unfortunate category of characters who were semi-mythical probably within their own lifetime, and who therefore quickly become veiled off to inquiry and understanding; this is really a factor that matters much more than the space of time between events and writings. Judging the sources we have is a tricky task, given how poorly we understand the Achaemenid Empire at the time, and I am personally inclined to doubt the accuracy of Alexander's military accomplishments and the odds he faced as they are presented. The stage seems to have been set for a political crisis and internal power struggles crippling Dareios right around the time of Alexander's invasion, yet these seem oddly absent until after Alexander's victory at Gaugamela, with accounts of Alexander tactically manipulating and personally humiliating Dareios (who was an accomplished military man while Alexander was still an infant!) dominating the accounts of their clashes.
