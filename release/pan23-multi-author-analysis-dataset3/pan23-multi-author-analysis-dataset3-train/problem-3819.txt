In the end though, if this is causing you so much stress, just pull your kids out and get it off your mind, I doubt there is any way this ends in a solution that makes you happy.
You're arguing that they're creating risk by not allowing you to buckle your child but there are reasonable alternatives that are available to you, which is likely to not give you much of a case to pursue.
If it's not possible for you to turn around and buckle your child from the driver's seat your options are to follow their instructions, ignore their instructions and risk the repercussions, or see if they will compromise -- for example, letting you park and go it to pick up your child.
This is a common situation in many schools. Schools are often reluctant to have their employees secure the care seat because of liability concerns. And with 120 kids to pick up, if each parent spends 60 seconds to gets out of their car and buckle up their child you are extending the pick up line by 2 hours -- and you can pretty much guarantee parents are going to riot about that. So it's a tough situation for the school.
