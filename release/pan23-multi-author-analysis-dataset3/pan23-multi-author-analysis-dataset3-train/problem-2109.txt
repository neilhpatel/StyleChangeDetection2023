To start off with, we need to understand why Machiavelli viewed Roman history the way that he did and what he was trying to do with it. Machiavelli, like historians for the previous 1500+ years and, perhaps to a somewhat lesser extent, the next 500 was absolutely fascinated by the rise of Rome - how did a small city in the middle of Italy, towards the fringes of the civilised world, once ruled by Etruscan kings and endowed with a modest hinterland inhabited by poor yet hardy warrior-peasants, come to be mistress of the Mediterranean, an achievement that no one had ever managed before? Machiavelli, like the ancient historians Polybius (a Greek general captured in the Punic wars), Sallust (a late Republican Roman historian) and Livy (writing in the reign of Augustus) before him, whom he was completely versed in and were his main primary sources for ancient history, saw three main things as being key to Rome's success. The first being the nature of the Republican Roman constitution from the overthrow of the last kings in 509 BC down to the reforms of the Gracchi in 133 BC, which Machiavelli, like Polybius, saw as the perfect balance of the three classical forms of government outlined by Aristotle - monarchy, aristocracy and democracy - that effectively cancelled out their flaws and prevented them from becoming their perversions (tyranny, oligarchy and anarchy). The second was a certain measure of good luck. The third, and most important, was the civic virtue of the ancient Romans - histories of Rome like Livy's Ab Urbe Condita were full of examples of heroic Romans from the first four centuries of the Republic's existence who selflessly served the state in politics, administration and warfare, as opposed to seeking fame, enrichment or lasting power, and were willing to make sacrifices or do acts generally perceived to be dishonourable or immoral (the quintessential example being Brutus, the founder of the Republic, killing his traitorous sons) for the collective good of the Roman people. This civic virtue was above all manifested in the republican institutions, designed to prevent any individual from becoming too powerful, and in Rome's citizen-army (similar to those of Sparta and Athens, but more generous in admitting people not exclusively from Rome itself), which created a direct link between service to the state in war and being an active citizen.
I think that misunderstanding comes from how a lot of people focus exclusively on "The Prince" (1513), which has contributed more than anything else to Machiavelli's posthumous reputation both as the founding father of the Western tradition of realpolitik (further developed/ put into practice by Cardinal Richelieu, Thomas Hobbes, Frederick the Great, Maurice de Talleyrand, Karl von Clausewitz, Otto von Bismarck, Henry Kissinger etc) and, closely aligned with that more celebrated reputation as an essentially amoral figure who believed in the pursuit and preservation of power as an end in itself - in Tudor and Stuart England, Machiavelli was widely seen as a Satanic figure, not least because his first name (Niccolo) made a pun with "Old Nick", an archaic English synonym for the devil. Yet if you look at the whole corpus of Machiavelli's writings, including the "Discourses on Livy" (1517) and the "Florentine Histories" (1526) its clear that "The Prince" was just something Machiavelli wrote to be readmitted to public life after the briefly revived Florentine republic of 1494 to 1512, that he'd been a mainstay of the administration of, fell to the Holy League and the de facto autocracy of the Medici family that had dominated Florence from the 1430s to the 1490s was restored. In these other works of his, it is clear that Machiavelli was a republican in the neo-Roman tradition, and that while he still endorsed means-to-end thinking in those works, he believed that that end should not be the pursuit of power and its preservation for individuals but the pursuit of the public good and the liberty and sovereignty of the republican city state.
Yet for all its influence, Machiavelli's approach to Roman history is based on an approach and agenda profoundly different to those of modern academic historians. Machiavelli, like other renaissance humanists, believed that the purpose of history was not to understand the past for its own sake, but to find moral and political lessons for the present day. In the Italy of his own day, gripped in the midst of the great renaissance European superpower conflict known as the Italian wars (1494 - 1559), Machiavelli saw the old city republics of high and late medieval Italy being humiliated or utterly crushed due to, as he saw it, corruption and decadence, the growth of tyranny and oligarchy, over-reliance on untrustworthy foreign mercenaries (the condottieri) willing to pledge their services to the highest bidder and the meddling of the papacy and foreign powers (France and the Hapsburg Empire in particular, whom he called "the barbarians"). Comparing that to the earlier history of the Italian states in the twelfth to mid-fifteenth centuries, that had successfully fought for their independence, expanded their hinterlands and preserved civic liberty and republican governance, Machiavelli would have identified parallels between that and Roman history. And so through his works - not just "the Prince" but also "Discourses on Livy" (his most important work in my view, and the truest expression of his political and ethical views), "The Art of War" and "The History of Florence", he wanted to impart these lessons in hope that his contemporaries could rescue Italy from its current situation. "The Prince" and "The Discourses on Livy" definitely stand as landmarks in renaissance history-writing and political theory in the eyes of modern historians, but their arguments would definitely not meet modern standards of historical scholarship. For more on Machiavelli's approach to history writing, I'd highly recommend you read "Machiavelli and Guicciardini" by Felix Gilbert.
u/reproachableknight gave a fantastic response in regard to Machiavelliâ€™s views and how they were shaped by the historicism of Renaissance Italy. I would like to supplement this with some perspective on the time period that Machiavelli was addressing and how modern views differ may from his own.
"Italy in the Age of the Renaissance, 1300 - 1550" (2004) by John Najemy should provide you with all the necessary background about Machiavelli's Italy - its a multi-author book that covers all the key themes necessary to understanding Machiavelli in context. John Watts' "The Making of Polities, 1300 - 1500" is also well worth a read for considering the developments in the Italian city states leading up to Machiavelli's time. Both of these books are, however very academic - I can't think off the top of my head of any surveys more aimed at the general reader. You might also be interested in Quentin Skinner's "Machiavelli" in the Oxford Past Masters series - Skinner has been one of the leading proponents of what's known as the Cambridge School, an approach to intellectual history that's all about looking at great writers in their wider political and intellectual contexts.
