OP, I too have a "diploma" in the sense that I "graduated" a weird homeschooling experience my parents muddled their way through. A GED is not going to improve your situation; if you graduated in the state of MD, your mom can literally type up a diploma and present it to you, and this is legally considered to be a diploma (kids who go to private school in MD are in the same boat, as far as the state not issuing diplomas, and their prospects certainly aren't damaged as a result). I joined the military with one, went to college with it, and have had gainful employment for the last 20yrs with it.
With regards to taking college classes, if you're going to community college, you will still be placed into classes according to your tested abilities. I had to take remedial math and eventually worked my way to math for computer science after a major deficit in that area. Unlike major colleges and universities, community college is much more willing to work with a lack of transcripts, and transferring to a regular university (usually 20-25 credits required) is not difficult as long as you maintain your grades.
If your community college is like mine, they've dealt with people with missing transcripts, or people who didn't graduate at all but aged out of the system without getting a GED. You probably won't be able to get into the Ivy League with your transcript, but even if the community college has to throw out your transcript altogether, they can give you placement tests and start you in the right classes.
And then, once you have a college degree - even an Associate's - from somewhere, you'll pretty much never be asked for your high school transcript again.
In terms of why you are contemplating sueing you seem well-spoken enough and more mature than typical high schoolers applying to college. I think a well written application essay would make you a good applicant.
