I'm beginning to think that political people who don't go through the normal vetting process to handle classified information aren't treating it as carefully as people who might lose their job for mishandling it.
You're not wrong - they said as much when Trump's mishandling became public, that forgotten documents and such is pretty common in transition periods, and they have standard systems and procedures for rectifying the issue when it does. It's a complete non-issue so long as people report and cooperate when documents are found.
Pence is as "guilty" as Biden in that regard, which is to say, not really at all. Trump is the outlier because instead of notifying the FBI and returning the documents, he took them intentionally, lied about having them, claimed he was allowed to have them, made wild claims about having declassified them in nonsensical ways, pretended they were planted, etc, and dragged out the process for two years and ultimately had to have them _taken_ back by the FBI rather than returning them himself, and even then he's still obstructing the investigation into his mishandling by manipulating openly corrupt judges and then some.
You're still the one pushing "both sides" rhetoric. If you're claiming that all cases are equally bad when they very obviously aren't, you're just playing defense for the side that is clearly much, much worse by downplaying it as something they all do, when no, they aren't all doing the thing being criticized beyond the barest surface level glance at the problem (as in, you're ignoring that the issue isn't the mishandling of documents, but the reaction to the procedures for fixing the situation).
