Imagine being upset that several countries get to discuss what's fair for the group and coming to agreement in a democratic order, instead of a single country bullying weaker countries into submission.
You mean a collection of countries from around the world who have worked together diplomatically to establish a set order of rules that each have agreed to follow in order to prevent conflicts and increase mutual prosperity?
Diplomacy is a negotiation, and these laws and treaties were not written by a single nation, or a small collection of regional nations, but by many nations found around the globe over time to ensure peace and prosperity.
Trade relations are built of mutual respect and an adherence to agreed upon rules for mutual peace and prosperity.
Which rules do you think benefit the US and its Allies in particular that don't benefit other nations? Not using Child slaves? Not making lead based toys? Not selling contaminated or diseased meat? Sanctioning countries that commit war crimes from the international market?
If you just want to keep trying to equate China making trade agreements in Africa and Latin America to literal war crimes being committed, feel free.
