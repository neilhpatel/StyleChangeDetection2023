Correct, the US knows better than anyone because in 2014, under Obama, we authorized sending money and expertise to Ukraine to help them form a more stable military that will enable the west to send them weapons without those weapons being stolen and redirected to Russia or other terrorists.
Russia lost this war simply by waiting so long after the initial invasion before going after kyiv. The two years before the attack on kyiv in 2022 is when Ukraine made the most progress militarily.
EDIT: Im not saying that it's not feasible for the USA to send fighter jets to Ukraine. It's absolutely doable, but my point is that because of so many factors, they will go through a long process first.
Ukraine's defense system can't even stop missiles from hitting civilian towns, how can you expect them to protect the F-16s that are resting at the air bases?

Honest question here: what prevents Russia from bombing all existing airfields within the first year of the war? Is Ukraine shooting a bunch of missiles down? Why wouldnâ€™t they just focus on this goal to get complete air superiority?
