Heat seeking weapons don't give any warning. You might be able to spot the missile launch, but will have no warning prior to that, and only seconds if you spot the launch.
Radar based weapons will give a warning in STT mode this is the one you know from movies, etc. In STT mode the launch radar is basically behaving like a spotlight aimed right at the target, and the targets RWR (radar warning receiver) will notice that and warn the pilot(s). Older radar based weapons like the Sparrow need constant illumination of the target.
Laser guided weapons like starstreak can be detected before launch, but the detectors aren't fitted on most aircraft. That's partly because Laser guided anti-aor is rare, and partly because the detectors are kind of bulky.
However, modern radar based weapons can also be guided in TWS (track while scan). In this mode, the search radar is still scanning the sky for other targets, so the targeted aircraft won't see a change in behaviour and doesn't know it's been locked. The aircraft's RWR will know that there's a radar searching in the area which it will relay to the pilot, but the pilot will have to make a judgement call as to whether they're under attack or not. They'll only get a warning when the inbound missile goes 'pitbull' - which means it's turned on its own radar for terminal guidance. That only happens when the missile is close to its target, so the defending pilot won't get much warning.
Since all the infos on air combat I know come from games and movies, does the aircraft pilot know when they’re “locked on” and ready to be fired on before being fired on? That would surely be a strong message….
