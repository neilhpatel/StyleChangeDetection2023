Brittney Griner was sentenced to 9 years in a Russian prison for carrying less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage.
For instance, ex-WNBA player Brittney Griner got sentenced in Russia for NINE YEARS of imprisonment for posessing a tiny tiny amount of canabis oil (less than a gram (sic!) of hashish oil in her luggage).
Not necessarily a "large pile of dope". Not at all. Russia, after all, is a fascist state where legal logic is subordinated to political pressure and corruption. Anything can happen there given particular circumstances.
“Being sufficiently aware that the movement of narcotic drugs is not allowed… no later than February 17, 2022 at an unspecified location under unspecified circumstances from an unidentified person \[Ms Griner\] bought two cartridges for personal use, which contained 0.252 grams and 0.45 grams of hash oil, totaling 0.702 grams,” the prosecutor said during the trial, TASS reported.
