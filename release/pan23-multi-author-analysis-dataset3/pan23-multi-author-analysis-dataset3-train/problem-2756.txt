A typical 3-year Bachelors student will graduate with about £45k of debt , on which they will be charged above-inflation rates of interest (RPI + 3% typically).
It's worth noting that a Bachelors will be just under £28k in fees (fees are capped at £9250 a year), but that you will probably spend about the same again on living expenses over the 3 years.
Heavily depends as some may pay a bit more at £11k per year while others well over £30k per year, but yes international students pay more (average 2.5x). I assumed the original comment was referring to tuition cost for the average student.
might have changed, but when I went in 2013-2016 it was £9k a year for the Bachelors (3 years) and then if I stayed at the same uni £4k for the 4th year Masters, if I wanted to do Masters elsewhere then it'd be closer to £6.5k. I opted to not do Masters at all.
Finally anyone who has been in the UK education system and/or lived in the UK for long enough (3 consecutive years before the start of your course) or is eligible under the rules will be paying up to the £9250 yearly limit for tuition, no matter if they hold British citizenship or not.
