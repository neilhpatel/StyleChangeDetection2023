edit: reading further into it, i shouldnt have commented based on assumptions i dont know anything about, they did have a deal.
with the difference being that germany has settled their debts in treaties and such, i think japan never aknowledged their crimes?
I feel like Japan can learn from Germany on how to deal with its shameful WW2 actions. Stuff like banning organizations like Nippon Kaigi, removing the names of war criminals from Yasukuni Shrine, banning Imperial Japan symbols, etc.. The Germans have done all of this. Japan hasn't.
The Japanese did pay monetary compensation. But the problem is that the Japanese don't treat their actions in WW2 the same way the Germans have done. Here is on example.
No German political figure will hesitate to condemn the German actions in WW2. Japan dances around this issue instead of using simple, direct language condemning Japan's actions in WW2 over and over again.
I see no reason to dictate to Japan on what to do, but they are aware every time they push the "WWII was like this" button, China/Korea(s) will react the way they been reacting.
I think that since the end of WW2, Korea's actions in constantly demanding money and apologies, and then not accepting them as enough, has been a large factor in the rise of the Japanese right. Or at least has really shaped the right wing we see now. The conspiracy theories and the attempts at reshaping facts of the comfort women situation in Korea by the Japanese right really seemed to kick off and become more main stream at the time Korea started to agitate and bring up the issue again.
