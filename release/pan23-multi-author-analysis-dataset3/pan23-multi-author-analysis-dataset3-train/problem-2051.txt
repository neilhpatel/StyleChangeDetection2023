Getting married is a very serious legal arrangement. It has many implications for most area of your life. You should absolutely not do it as a convenience arrangement as it takes about 5 minutes to get married and may take you 5 years to get un-married.
Marry whoever you want, but don’t do it as a favor or you’ll regret it, possibly for the rest of your life.
You have to ask yourself, if he was a US resident would he marry you and would you marry him. Because that is the situation after the marriage.
If he uses “means-tested public benefits” include food stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Social Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the State Child Health Insurance Program then you can be charged. So if you break up after marriage, and he has a medical issue where he has to go on Medicaid, you are responsible and medical costs can be expensive.
THIS OBLIGATION DOES NOT END WITH DIVORCE. So if you marry him and get divorced six months later, you still are financially responsible for him. If he entered with a visa that expired, then marriage is one of the few ways he can get his unlawful presence forgiven.
Also, you have to maintain your ex spouse at 125% above the federal poverty line. The current federal poverty line for a single household is $12,490, and 125% of that is $15,612.50.
