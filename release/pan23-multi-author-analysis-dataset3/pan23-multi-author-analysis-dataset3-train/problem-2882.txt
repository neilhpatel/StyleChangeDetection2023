I mean it's definitely fair in certain contexts. In a public context like where he was documented using Anthony Devolder, I can see someone not wanting to use their real name.
The issue is that this comes into question now that he has been caught lying about almost literally everything else. I mean, you don't give people a reason to question your name, and they won't question it. When you are using different names, claiming education and personal backgrounds that are verifiably false, that's when it becomes a legitimate issue of "Ok, who the hell are you really?".
So yeah. The paywall isn’t some insurmountable barrier. We as a society have just shifted our informational/media priorities. Not a judgement on what we choose to do with our money (I pay for and enjoy streaming entertainment too, along with WaPo), just pointing out that paywalls aren’t some insurmountable barrier.
Not really, it’s just about what people value. WaPo is good journalism, and digitally it costs $40/year, or $3.33 a month.
WaPo is also cheaper for a subscription than my local newspaper. The complete opposite of how it used to be in print times.
