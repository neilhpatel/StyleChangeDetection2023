$14.73/hr isn't a whole lot of money without healthcare or paid sick days for an intensely physical job that lasts a few months and requires extensive travel on your own dime.
The unwritten agreement for many years was the farmers could hire undocumented workers who would move from farm to farm as needed for the season. At the end of the season, these workers could be suddenly caught and transported back to Mexico on the government tab, where they could spend the rest of the year with family back home. The farmer could then complain about "illegals taking American jobs" and vote republican as a way of virtue signaling.
These same Texan ranchers and farmers will surely vote for sensible immigration reform as well as social programs to entice these hard workers to come to our country to work, right?
The drummed up outrage is so Texans keep hating 'illegals' so they never allow them to become citizens, where they would be paid min-wage and benefits.
Can't believe how stupid we are to not be busting our asses getting them citizenship, turning them into taxpaying low labor workers (and a few high wage ones in there I'm sure too).
But you know who will? Those 20,000 or so immigrants that are flooding El Paso, TX right now trying to get in. We literally have a solution to a huge problem in America sitting on our doorstep, begging us to come in.
Send them all to a football stadium (you can use high school stadiums here, they are HUGE). Give them a 3 day class in what it means to be an American, make them take a pledge or whatever, and send them to work.
We \NEED\ them. We \NEED\ immigrants. We were FOUNDED on immigrants. We became great because of those immigrants.
