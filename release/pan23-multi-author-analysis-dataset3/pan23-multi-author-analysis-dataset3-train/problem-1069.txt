They really think it came from pragamatuc short term political decisions and not militant labor organizing/ mass movements. A delusional view of history.
These are all issues and I support addressing all of these on a federal level but you and I both know is the reality is that these will currently not be passed with the way congress is structured. We don’t have any power to institute these but this labor union does have the power to fight for its workers. Unfortunately that power is being ripped away by both democrats and republicans in congress to protect the interests of large businesses and because of political cowardice.
2. Good then we’re not forcing a shitty deal down the throats of labor or maybe it actually would force republicans to vote for the better provisions. Either way it’s a win. By putting pressure on GOP to end rail strike you actually can force the concessions of more sick days instead of simply giving in. But the reality is democrats care more about short term political aspirations than workers which is what bring a me to point 3.
Because Republicans don’t even pretend to be the party for the unions, while Democrats make it their goal to pretend to be.
Anyone trying to bash on the Democrats for this is ignoring decades of anti-union action by the GOP.
while the republicans are the enemy of the workers , the democrats are definitely their fake friends that backstab them when possible. this is what neoliberals do. wallstreet wouldnt let anyone become president that hasnt proven his loyalty to the 0,1 percent.
