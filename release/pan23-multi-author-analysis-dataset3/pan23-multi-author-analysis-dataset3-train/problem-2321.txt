I am very skeptical of this “Russians don’t teach about Chernobyl” thing that’s been floating around on Reddit. Chernobyl is definitely a part of East-European pop culture. The soldiers either did not know that they were in Chernobyl or they were from very poor eastern regions where no knowledge of Chernobyl is only one of many education gaps (that are not caused by censorship).
I have not. I grew up in Eastern Europe, consuming the same media available to any Russian and I knew about Chernobyl before any movie was made about it.
I went to school in Ukraine in the 00s and it was taught to us. I guess mileages vary. Not surprised about the blackout as it was happening though. The Soviet handling of the disaster was terrible. However, what I do not buy is this idea that, for most Russians, the term “Chernobyl” does not ring any bells.
I can't say whether Russians teach about Chernobyl or not. But as a Bulgarian (and when it comes to political issues pre-1989, we're kind of a mini-Russia) let me tell you what I know:
1. There was a complete media/information eclipse in 1986. People were out on May 1st rallies when the radioactive cloud was passing right above, ate veggies irrigated by radioactive rain and knew nothing of it, all the while the political elite, as it later turned out, ate food specially delivered from Russian regions unaffected by the disaster.
