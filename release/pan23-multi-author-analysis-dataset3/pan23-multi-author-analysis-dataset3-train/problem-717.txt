Just the mere fact that your dad didn’t have a will and his beneficiaries are all out of wack indicates that it would be a good idea to speak to an attorney. That way you can deal with everything through the court and Have the court determine you and your sister are his heirs.
Since he had no will and was not married, State law determines who the heirs are. Under most state laws, you and your sister are his legal heirs and have legal priority to petition for that appointment. His girlfriend has no inheritance rights. Anything he told her or even stuff he wrote in a note or letter has no legal meaning.
When someone dies without a will, they are said to be "intestate." In PA, estates are handled by the Orphans Court in the county where the deceased lived.
When your father died, everything he owned became the property of something called Estate of Dad’s Name. Someone must be appointed to be in charge of the estate. Until that happens, no one can take, sell, give away, or throw away any of the estate property. The estate property does not include anything with a named beneficiary. That goes directly to the beneficiary.
The girlfriend’s threat of a lawyer is a bluff. The only thing to tell her is that all claims for money owed by your Dad need to be submitted in writing to the estate. I would suggest not talking to her at all until you have talked to an attorney.
Attorney here, not yours, probably not licensed in your state, not giving legal advice. Just trying to help with a few things.
