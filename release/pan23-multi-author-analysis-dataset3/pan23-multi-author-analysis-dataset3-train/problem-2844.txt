This gets overlooked a lot. The American revolution was led by intelligent people, many of whom had extensive government experience. It was as much a revolution, as it was a civil war between two internal governments, since America had its own because of how far it was from the King.
I guess my point is that it’s unsurprising to me that the learned gentry are vital for turning a revolution into new statehood.
Part of why the American revolution was as successful as it was came down to the proponents really giving very intense thought into how a constitutional government should run.
Yeah, our first attempt at a constitution, the Articles of Confederation, failed outright, and our second attempt was only temporarily successful, in that it staved off civil war for 80ish years.
And, even then, the original articles of confederation failed miserably. America’s first draft was a mistake. It took another round of thought and wrangling to produce a working constitution… and even that was seriously flawed.
