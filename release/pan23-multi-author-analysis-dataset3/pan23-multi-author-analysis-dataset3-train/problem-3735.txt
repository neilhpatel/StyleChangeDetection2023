It's good to know that timing is a concern and thanks for the advice for getting a real estate lawyer.
You need a real estate attorney in ND. If the junk has no value why would you want to seize it? Does the uncle have the means to purchase the property and if so, will your wife sell?
If your wife feels no ties to this land, what's the downside to just selling it to the uncle? If he can't afford to purchase it outright, an option would be a formalized owner-financed land mortgage.
Even were you all to call the county code enforcement department, and they determined the land was in violation, then what? If the county cleaned-up the land, the land owner gets stuck with the bill plus fines and other fees. About all you'd get out of this is a legal mandate to come into compliance on a short timetable, when it's your responsibility, as the owners of the land, to keep the land use in compliance in the first place.
Your first order of business should be to review land listings in the area since that costs nothing more than your time, to get an idea of the value of this land, and go from there.
