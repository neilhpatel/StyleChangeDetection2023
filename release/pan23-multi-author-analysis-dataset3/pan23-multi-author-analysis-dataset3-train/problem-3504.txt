If there is a date of the 5th for votes to be in and they are counted several days later how do you know if they were turned in by the deadline? You don’t and there are multiple ways for that to be abused.
You bring up multiple points here. I’m aware if what Gerrymandering is. Now this happens on both sides of the partisan spectrum. Both sides use underhanded tactics to win that have nothing to do with winning on merit of ideas. (Don’t conflate that with me supporting it) if it was done fairly it would simply be done by county where there are clear geographic lines. Democrats seek to leverage that same tactic for themselves.
You have more ways to vote now even for weeks up until the election. Seems to me the ability to vote has been expanded.
They have been when they voted against improving voter rights recently. All these republicans votes that deny Americans progress should be blasted in the media all the time. But they don’t, and it’s unfortunate the money that could do it is being given to republicans to make sure it doesn’t.
