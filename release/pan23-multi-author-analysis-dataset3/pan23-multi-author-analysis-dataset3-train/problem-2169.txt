I tried to find some points to put the power plant firing in context - I figure if I have a question about the news then others might too. I typed up a couple paragraphs but ended up not posting most of it. The Wall Street Journal has done a few good English-language reports on what's going on there, but it's still hard to keep even a few basic things straight, such as "who's the lead Ukrainian worker in charge at the actual site of the plant?" or "how many IAEA inspectors are present?".
Yes. I haven't really seen anyone seriously think that Russia will stop. They're continuing to disregard reality, and are feeling a lot more comfortable with tens of thousands more bodies ready for the meat grinder. They still maintain artillery superiority in some areas, they shored up all the holes in their defenses with fresh mobiks, and their generals are dreaming of converting all that into new medals and promotions.
That's a BIG deal. The settlement is right smack in the middle of the major Svatove - Kreminna highway which has been Ukrainian target for months.
The Armed forces of Ukraine have already come close to Kreminna, Literally a few kilometers from the city!
⚡️Rusnya whines that the Armed Forces of Ukraine went on the attack in the Kreminna-Svatove district of Luhansk region.
Russia may be withdrawing troops from positions closer to the front line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast to reduce the impact of Ukrainian strikes.
⚡️ISW: Russian military movements in Zaporizhzhia Oblast suggest that it can't defend critical areas amidst increasing Ukrainian strikes.
“The Ukrainian military said some Russian troops are withdrawing from their positions in Zaporizhzhia. CNN has not been able to verify the claims.”.
