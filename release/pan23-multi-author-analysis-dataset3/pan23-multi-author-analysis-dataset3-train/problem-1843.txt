Not a lawyer but I am a professor. This is not really a legal issue, but rather one that should be taken up with your schools office of disability (or equivalent, the name varies from school to school).
As said above- this is not a legal question, but instead one for the administration and your Disability Office. Respectfully (because I do empathize) if your illness is making it difficult/impossible for you to do your work even with reasonable accommodations you may be better off looking into a temporary medical leave. Alternatively, you could ask your professor if there is any additional coursework you could do to help offset this score.
Extended time means the window of time from when the test/assignment is started until you have to finish that assignment. The key part being that the window of time start ticking down when you begin the quiz.
But the seven hour window to attempt the quiz is not analogous. Both you and a standard student starting at the top of hour 6, in other words, would be required to finish before the seven hour point expired.
