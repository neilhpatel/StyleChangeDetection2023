. Also, newer generation reactors are safer and more efficient. Itâ€™s the bureaucracy that makes it expensive. The oil industry has been lobbying and campaigning against nuclear for decades.
It takes 5-10 to approve a nuclear reactor construction before and building is completed. It should not take this long considering how safe the newer designs are. So much energy can be produced that nuclear power is than any other power source in the long run. If you want to go the environmental protection route, solar produces more chemicals and lithium batteries needed for renewables also gave great environmental . Realistically, we need nuclear and renewables to work together for our energy needs.
In any event, nuclear is an opportunity cost; it actively harms decarbonization given the same investment in wind or solar would offset more CO2 and also not destroy more parts of nature to mine the finitie resources. Yes, FINITE, yet you people want to invest hundreds of billions into an infrastrucutre that will be completely worthless once the fuel source is gone.
Lower cost saves more carbon per dollar. Faster deployment saves more carbon per year. Nuclear power costs about 5 times more than onshore wind power per kWh. Nuclear takes 5 to 17 years longer between planning and operation and produces on average 23 times the emissions per unit electricity generated.
Also does not help that the necessary mining for the finite resources required for nuclear energy turns more of nature into dead craters. But yeah, keep trying to greenwash nuclear power.
MAJOR LOL! Is that why no private entity will EVER touch nuclear energy unless the taxpayers pay for the construction, the externalities, for building the stuff back and taking care of the waste?
