I'm an old US MLRS/HIMARS soldier/officer. If the report is correct that 6 rockets were fired and 4 hit, 200-400 KIA/WIA would be very possible in a building. From the initial information, it sounds like the place was a staging area or barracks. If it was also true ammo was stored nearby well then lord knows how many could have been KIA/WIA.
4. Spread out your troops and ammo as much as possible to prevent mass cassualties and secondary explosions.
They're getting taken out by drones that spot them, artillery, drop grenades on them, and drop anti tank grenades that destroy their limited supply tanks.
You don't see or hear too much anymore of Russia sending out air support. Ukraine has had control of the air and downed many aircraft.
And striking airfields housing fighters who are bombing and launching missiles at ukraine. Again. In the middle of an active conflict is terrorism.
They also claim that. And let me be clear. Sending a raid on the black sea fleet which has been striking ukraine DURING an active conflict is terrorism.
