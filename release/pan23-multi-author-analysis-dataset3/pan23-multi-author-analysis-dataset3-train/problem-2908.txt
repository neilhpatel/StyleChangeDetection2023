Turkey requires the same things from others, we all know relationship in between Turkey and France, US etc. They don't need to support, but they also don't need to act like an enemy just because we are fighting against a terrorist organization. Its a joke because West also recognize Pkk as a terrorist organization.
Finland wanna be in the same military alliance with Turkey while having arm embargoes against it. Is that really weird that Turkey asks Finland to lift these embargoes?
I don't agree with Turkey's demands that have nothing to do with Sweden and Finland, but this one is reasonable. You want to be in the same military alliance as them, so it makes sense not having an arms embargo on them.
What is your view on other NATO members having arms embargos on Turkey? France, the Czech Republic, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany and USA at least have some sort of embargos on Turkey. Why do you think it is reasonable for a country in a defensive alliance to blindly support offensive acts of other members?
