Something similar happened to us. The pipes inside were oof cast iron and apparently there was some corrosion inside that the snake pulled loos, essentially trapping it within the pipe. They did not try to charge us for the snake, it remained in the line for a few days while they got camera equipment out to look and assess the pipes. We ended up having to replace the interior pipe and I believe they eventually got their snake back. Unfortunately you may be looking at replacing the corroded pipes.
The plumber abandoning his snake will DEFINITELY cause clogging and potentially damage to the pipes. That's called negligence. He's a plumber, if he couldn't fix it, he should have offered to call someone qualified to do so.
I live in FL. A good plumber will scope the line first before snaking to see what the blockage is and to determine best course of action WITH HOMEOWNER ( Example) My Sewer Lateral was clogged about a year ago. The county came out and scoped the line and found a low spot/belly that had been collecting debris and grease for years. Due to the low spot, they knew snaking wasn't my best option and would likely cause damage or not clear it out completely. So they called in another tech to use a pressurized sewer line jet to "blow" the blockage out. No damage, blockage was cleared and I saw it all on video.).
I agree with the other people suggesting getting other plumbers to come out and give their evaluation however, it may be hard to find a competitor who is willing to do this ( No contractor wants to get drug into the drama and time resulting from litigation). Try to find someone from out of the area if you start to have problems finding someone local. Or, you could always try the local municipality if your on municipal Sewer. Where I live, those guys and gals go above and beyond.
