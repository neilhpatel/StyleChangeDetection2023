The USSR was functioning, to a point; the revolution gave smart people a rise to prominence, but Stalin stamped down on free thought and drove out dissenters... to western nations. My theory is that 60 years of brain drain have left Russia with a coddled corrupt population, who remember the greatness of the USSR without any of the necessary skills or ideals to make their lives better.
I meant Yeltsin's, but as I understand; the turmoil and conflict caused between Gorbachev and Yeltsin's systems of government lead to the end; creating the environment of chaos that Putin rose up into. The stability that Putin has presided over has given Russia the confidence to expand outwards against some lost dream of regaining Russian legacy.
The trump Faction in America is loyal to Putin (for whatever reason) and everything they do advances Putin's purposes. Inciting and fermenting discord and division, weakening the general economy, creating discord among and within NATO allies.
Why take NATO when you can simply sponsor promote and get fascists elected that will disintegrate NATO from within and you can then impose your foreign policy and play back the progress democracies had in the last century and return to the old ways of redrawing borders with military. Ukraine is defending Europe, NATO and democracy all around the world.
But that still does not make the defense of Ukraine the same as defending the whole of Europe or the world or something from Russian aggression.
There is a lot of truth to the notion that Ukraine is defending the rest of Europe, as well as the rest of the world. Russia is the clear aggressor here, and they have no intention of stopping where they are.
