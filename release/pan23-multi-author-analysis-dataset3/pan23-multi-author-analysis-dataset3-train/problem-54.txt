Oh, you're right... the world is currently in a very complicated situation. While banning russian competitors enrages some of the general public (and spreading the "west is russophobic" propaganda), allowing russian competitors means Putin can take profit from these competitions as well.
Also, as far as i know, participation of russians in big competitions, sports or not, is very profitable for Russia as well (so it ends up profiting more violence in Ukraine).
I'd say any non participation of Russia in competition has much more positive effect for Putin. It enrages general public and unites against the west. Even though I don't care for sports I have a feeling of being slightly annoyed by this. I can imagine how general sports fan sees this.
Well I am this Ivan. Now try to understand - I speak fluent english but my family - don't. My education and work experience isn't being recognized outside my country. I have two children to support and feed. Imagine me moving from owning a property, having a respectable job to somwhere where my children won't be even able to communicate with other people? Also despite not agreeing with the general direction of my government - I did not vote for Putin, I still respect the fact that people like Vlads happily voted him into his presidency and I see a good reason why (because Vlads have it much easier life to live). I absolutely believe that war could and should have been avoided, war is a terrible tragedy yet and nobody sane (even soldiers, and generals) would rather not fight. Yet no matter what my views are - I have to obey the laws, I have to pay taxes just as anyone in US who voted for the government that lost an election.
Even within the context of elections, the result of losing an election and a law you disagree with being passed isn't to just give up and accept obeying the law, but to fight to change it.
