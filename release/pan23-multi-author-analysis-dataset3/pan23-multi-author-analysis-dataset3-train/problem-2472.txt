They're thinking "cost of feeding and housing a person for the rest of their natural lives" vs. "$2 bullet". They could care less about the higher legal standards and appeals process we require because the government voluntarily killing people is a hell of a thing.
If they could, they'd remove all of those protections. Guilty conviction? Line em up against the wall on the way out of the courtroom. The justice system is completely fair and never gets things wrong, unless they're on the wrong side of it.
When conservatives are "pro capital punishment", the fact that a death sentence typically costs taxpayers more than a life sentence isn't a relevant argument to them.
If you’re a conservative and pro-death penalty, you believe that government can not do anything correctly except deciding when putting people to death.
There’s a reason the death penalty has been used less and less over time. It’s barbaric, a waste of money, and unpopular, particularly when people are reminded executions are actually taking place.
It's not bad enough that it's proven ineffective, but suggesting televised executions is definitively barbaric. No humane purpose, it's suffering as entertainment.
