I would end up having to quit my job because i would never out a minor. I grew up in a Mormon family that was very transphopic and anti gay i saw first hand how cruel and mean families can be.
Thatâ€™d probably just mean that the entire set of homophobic parents willing to abuse their kid on the inkling of gay allegations would start in as opposed to one or two.
They're basically saying that teachers have to report a kid even if a parent could be hostile and perhaps hurt a kid for coming out as LGBTQIA+ (which most certainly happen).
I quit. I am glad I quit. I actually wrote an article for it. There were a host of reasons I quit, but if I were asked to do this to another student, I'd never wish for that. Things like this are making me glad I got out when I did.
This unfortunately won't stop because Republicans want to kill LGBTQIA+ kids. They delight in it. Republicans would rather have a dead kid than a queer kid.
The Republican Party is worse than the Westboro Baptist Church. They are literally trying to create more kids dying or being homeless, kicked out for being queer. This is unconscionable.
