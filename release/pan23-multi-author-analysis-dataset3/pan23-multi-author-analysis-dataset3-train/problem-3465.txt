If the employer is paying you under the table, or if he is not carrying workman's compensation insurance (unlikely but possible) then this may turn into a situation where you are forced to sue your employer to get the compensation that you deserve. You will have absolutely no trouble finding an attorney to take this case on for free and they will collect a portion of your settlement as their pay.
Any hospital/doctors visits or whatever care you've had so far, make sure to tell them that this was a workplace injury. Which it was. Your employer is required to have Workman's compensation insurance which covers injuries which may happen to employees while they're working. You want to identify this as a workplace injury at the hospital or doctor so that paperwork will reflect it that way.
When you seek care, be sure to tell them that this is a workplace injury. You should be covered under workers comp.
This has to be workers Comp. He’s taking advantage of you because you’re young. Also he’s also committing insurance fraud. He should be paying into workers Comp for things exactly like this.
