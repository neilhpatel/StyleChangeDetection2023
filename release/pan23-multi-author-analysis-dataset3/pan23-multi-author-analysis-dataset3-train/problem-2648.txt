There is a comment in this thread suggesting that the exchange between the 2 (Xi's complaint and Trudeau's sanctimonious response) is a media beat-up. I think this is correct. However, Trudeau's choice of words were unhelpful and risks Chinese opting to 'punish' a relative weak representative of their 'enemy'. Recall they have been doing this with Australia for the past 2 years.
I have no issue with Trudeau 'calling out' Xi over his attitudes to other countries and even over his attitudes to groups in his own country, though the latter is kind of hard to pull off (as per 'The mote in god's eye' etc).
It's interesting how many "Canadians" are coming out to say that Trudeau did something wrong while mere moments ago they were complaining that Trudeau was nothing but a Chinese puppet.
how about winne the pooh get his dirty little fingers out of Canadian elections, and while he's at it, get rid of the god damn police out of other countries to impose your chinese rule on citizens who have left.
