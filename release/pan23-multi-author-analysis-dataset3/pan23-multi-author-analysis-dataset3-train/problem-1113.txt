i see — are our options basically move out and forefit the security deposit, last month lease or pay the extra $300 per month?
so figuratively speaking he could even raise our rent by $2000 and we would still need to rent pay it if we wanted the 4th person?
It is not necessary for the rental agreement to explicitly state that adding tenants will result in a rent increase. It is also not necessary for the rental agreement to explicitly state that subletting is only allowed with landlord permission; that's the default in MA if subletting is not addressed by the lease.
It is completely ordinary, normal, and standard to only permit the specific residents who sign the lease to reside in a rental property.
$300 extra rent to add a fourth tenant to an apartment in Our Fair City is very reasonable. Your co-tenant should apply, sign the lease, and agree in writing to its terms.
It's probably (you should check) against your lease to move additional people in. He can evict you for breaking the lease, or you can mutually agree to dissolve your current lease and sign a new one with a higher rent.
You can sign the amended lease with the added resident and higher rent, or vacate. Your original lease should also have a statement about what will be owed/refunded based on how the lease is ultimately terminated. If it ends up saying you will owe money for terminating early you can attempt to negotiate (but i’m not sure if this situation is extenuating).
