As far as a priest dealing one-on-one with a desperate parishioner or penitent...for the most part, that's a late medieval thing and very limited in terms of who had/sought access. Confession once a year, usually on Palm Sunday, was a canonical (religious law) obligation for all Christians of both sexes from 1215 on, but we generally think that wasn't fully adopted until 1400 or so. And even then, confession was almost always done in the open, sure, one-on-one with the priest, but with everyone else in your village in line behind you, trying to overhear the good gossip.
That's fascinating, and I do suppose that most of these people would have sought out friends and family over a priest or preacher who was never around.
Terrifying. Did the church have any role in attempting to help the depressed and suicidal, or teachings for priests / religious authorities who were dealing with suicidal members of their congregation?
I wonder (though I haven't done any serious research on the question) if the condemnation of suicide was partially to discourage (or control, depending on how you want to look at it) people from extreme devotional activities. After the official adoption of Christianity by Emperor Theodosius (r. 379-395), well, martyrs are kind of out of the question if there's no hostile, hegemonic state to pursecute them. So we see an uptick in extreme monasticism, because there's still the baked in idea from the the first few centuries CE that willful extreme physical suffering denotes devotion to God. But extreme demonstrations of faith have to be carefully discouraged in most instances. Its one thing to have one guy running around the desert, fighting demons and eating locusts, but if everyone does it, society kind of collapses.
