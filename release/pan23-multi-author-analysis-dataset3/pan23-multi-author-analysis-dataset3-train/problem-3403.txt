Already on it - one step further, I'm going to get him chipped with a GPS tracker/identifier when possible, because he's an outdoor cat, and he has an active social life with his other cat friends in the neighborhood.
The only thing a GPS transmitter would do besides a record of where your cat goes is confirm the cat is in their custody, maybe. GPS transmitters are still a decent size, it will be pretty obvious on your cat. And this person would see it and remove it long before they got back home.
Are you willing to pay for that, and devote the time if going pro se? Otherwise you risk having to do so to get your cat back or say goodbye if you continue letting it wander outside OP.
GPS for your car works because the GPS satellites are sending the signal, receiving, not transmitting. Transmitting requires enormously more power, that means a big battery for lasting hours, and noticeable, and removable.
In most of the country, small claims cannot order the other person to give back your cat, what is called a replevin action. Small claims can only award money.
