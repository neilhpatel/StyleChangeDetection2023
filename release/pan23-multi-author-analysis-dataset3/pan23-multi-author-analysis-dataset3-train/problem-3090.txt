They are also calling it 'alarming' how many young people are voting. Saying student loan forgiveness and climate change action were 'bribes', they were 'brainwashed'...no, they were just policies people actually wanted, that's how politics is supposed to work.
Then their solution is women need to be married, and young people are too immature to vote correctly(aka for them), no self reflection.
Sounds to me like in addition to raising the voting age it's time to take the vote back from unmarried women. Only married women may vote, but it may only be done so with the approval of their husbands, of course.
Ah, yes, if these women were married, they'd be voting the way their husbands tell them to! And then the Republicans wouldn't have to deal with all those nasty problems involved in the democratic election process, like "the will of the people" or whatever. Just the way they like it.
I mean it kinda is. Who wants to get married and have a kid when the right is successfully baking up terrible new ways to make life paycheck to paycheck?
