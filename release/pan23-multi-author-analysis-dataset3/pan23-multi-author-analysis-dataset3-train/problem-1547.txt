"Under Revolutionary law, young girls who were sentenced to death could not be executed if they were still virgins. Thus, they were "married off" to Revolutionary Guards and prison officials in temporary marriages and then raped before their execution, to prevent them going to heaven. The Mullahs believed that these women were ungodly and did not deserve paradise in the next life and that if they were deprived of their virginity, it would ensure that they went to hell. Therefore, on the night prior to execution, the condemned girl was injected with a tranquilliser and then raped by her guard(s). After the execution, the religious judge at the prison would write out a marriage certificate and send it to the victim's family along with a box of sweets.".
Here's the thing. Nobody's able to buy a home, a shelter, by giving up Maccas. Homelessness is a terrifying prospect and a terrible reality for too many.
And the worst thing is that people who would thrive at a top level out of capacity for ruthlessness make up at least a half of any given society.
We also want the gulf countries' money. There is no emotion at the top tiers of business and politics. Good people do not become top businessmen and politicians. Emotion and sentiment are fir the little people who matter so little in the grand scale of things that an emotion made on decision doesn't decide the fate of thousands or millions.
