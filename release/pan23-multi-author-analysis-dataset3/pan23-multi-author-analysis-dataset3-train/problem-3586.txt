And sure, we know that not every Russian supports the actions of their government. But if those same Russians stay in Russia and keep going on with their lives doing nothing at all to try and make a difference then quite honestly they are not at all doing something different from Z-patriots.
They are not infant thoughts and ScroungerYT is absolutely correct. People do bear responsibility for the actions of their government whether they like it or not.
You aren’t responsible for the actions of your government. We see y’all being dragged off the streets and forced to go fight and die in the winter cold in a war that you have nothing to do with. We also know that there is a lot of propaganda in Russia and that many of you aren’t getting the true story of what is happening.
They've gone through that "self sufficient" bullshit before, in USSR times, conveniently forgetting that NOT everything behind the Iron Curtain was Russia.
The irony of you saying this while casting 500 years of Russian history under several entirely unrelated regimes as a single vague "uncivilized" society.
