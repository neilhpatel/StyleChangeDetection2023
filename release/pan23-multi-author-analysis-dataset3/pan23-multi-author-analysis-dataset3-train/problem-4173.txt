I understand it is not illegal to ask. Just wondering, is it legal for them to say they will sue her in court and not only ask for the bill but their lawyers fees? Or to send her to debt collectors. We have 4 letters to that affect and they read as very threatening. Does that count under them asking? We don't know how all this works.
There hasn't been any communication (us or them) by any way except for letters. They have mailed my wife 4 different letters. Each time she sent a letter back saying it isn't her responsibility and to stop contacting her about this. Just 2 lines.
They are claiming she's responsible as his only family member but I have seen from posts above that it does not apply to siblings. If the nursing home sues her we will consult a lawyer then.
So they would need to sue to establish that. PA has filial responsibility laws but they do not appear to apply here.
If the nursing home does try to push this, you'll likely need a Pennsylvania lawyer familiar with their filial responsibility law. Nursing homes have been very aggressive in trying to pursue people under that law because of recent favorable case law/court rulings. It might be worth the peace of mind to do that legwork now so that you have one or more contacts in mind if you do need to fight the nursing home.
