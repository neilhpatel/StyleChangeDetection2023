Former garbage man here, not from Canada so what I say might not apply at all. Usually, recycling is collected in another truck which is not contaminated by normal trash, but the recycling bins need to be checked everytime, because some things will virtually pollute an entire bin, depending on what the local recycling plant can handle. Styrofoam, for example, was something that, as soon as it was seen in the recycling bin, lead to the whole bin being left there and being collected by the trash truck.
So, if you saw the same truck take the two bins, it either means there's no recycling plant in your area, that the bin was polluted by something you are not aware of (it can be something as dumb as greasy paper), or that the employees don't care.
Additionally, our recycling is so ‘dirty’, a combo of people being lazy and throwing non-recyclable items in or being filled with food residue and the like, that it has been rejected in large amounts and, you guessed it, it thrown into the ‘normal’ trash pile. So, the emphasis is placed on us (consumers) to recycle and to ‘do our part’ while our attempts are mostly fruitless because of the system in place.
Recycling is largely a way to make individuals feel guilty/responsible for an issue that only governments and large firms can actually change.
I'm also worried people will misinterpret what you said as "Politicians and corporations need to fix the problems they created" with out understanding politicians will never do that unless we incentivize or outright force them to.
At this point, when it's clear corporations and governments aren't going to do what's needed to be done, the responsibility is on as as individuals to act as a collective to force their hand. It's really that simple. If we're unwilling or unable to do that we're fucked.
