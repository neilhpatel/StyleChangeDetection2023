They did the fake breakup thing, but since then the female celebrity (I probably should have given them fake names for clarity) has been hinting during interviews and radio shows that their status is "complicated", insinuating some sort of sexual relationship, with the guy being unwilling to commit. He is actually a really sweet guy, and thought she was actually his friend, so she would hang out with him with his gf, my relative. My relative did get suspicious when she caught her trying to take his leather jacket home with her. But she said other than that prior to this she was always really friendly, and acted like she was just acting for the tabloids to boost her profile.
Apparently she's also done something similar before to an ex, she made a joke in an interview about sort of stalking her at the time boyfriend (who is not famous). So she's definitely nuts. I'm not sure how far she would take it. On top of her celebrity, she's also from a very wealthy family, so I don't think she's concerned about money either as they would just bail her out.
I'm 100% sure if she said she wanted to go to the police he would support her. She's just not sure what she would tell the police and whether a crime has been committed.
She and him could tell the police exactly what you've written out here. It's illegal to access someone's computer without permission. It's also illegal to "intentionally distribute the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person" without their consent and with the intention of causing emotional distress.
Your family member can go to the police but if the male celebrity isn't willing to corroborate her story and report what I'm assuming is the unlawful access of his laptop, she may be out of luck.
