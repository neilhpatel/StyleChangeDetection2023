Of the bad options they have test-firing the missiles towards the gap between Hokkaido and Honshu is probably the least dangerous option.
Because the straight between Honshu and Hokkaido is the only direction they can fire a missile long distance without the missile flying over land, especially over South Korea, China, or Russia.
With all the military material they are sending to Russia and the constant missle launches, my hope is that North Korea will actually have no weapons to fight with if they decide to invade South Korea.
In what scenario does NK use a nuke on anyone where they wouldn't also be glassing Seoul with conventional weapons before themselves getting glassed? It's not just the human toll on the level of a city or several, it's potentially dragging China into a world war. Nobody wants this, least of all NK.
The nuke is probably real, but the threat is posturing, for whom I don't really know. They'd have to be really high off their own supply to do the math and find a situation where this works out in their favor.
They haven't attacked in decades for a reason, and nobody has fired on them for many reasons, reasons that won't change even if they manage to develop several nukes.
Sure, but they're already in that position is my point. Pre-nuke NK is like if Iraq in 2003 were for some insane reason bordering NYC and had hundreds of artillery batteries pointed toward Manhattan.
