I work at in a god damn school... i worry about this shit all.the time. it hurts my soul that the teachers have a bookshelf near each door in the case someone gets in, they push it in front...... I just feel like these idiots need to learn the hard way if they don't listen to reason/suggestions from actual professionals/people who know schools. but feeling I guess. those teachers better leave or just not come to work.
stress does crazy shit to people. the flip side is that a teacher reaches for the weapon when a kid (albeit one with behavior challenges) has enough, takes them out, and claims self defense or what. no cameras or nothing in classrooms. none of it is good.
OK. Unless the adults are constantly terrifying them with those I don't see how that is the case. That shit fades into the background pretty quickly.
If children have started believing that it means adults have gone out of their way to actively deceive them.
I am pretty sure it is most don't think about it. Unless of course like I said adults are going out of their way to deceive or traumatize the kids to make them think they happen more than they do and that they are at significant risk.
Why do you want people that are overworked, underpaid, and constantly stressed to have a deadly weapon while in the presence of children that actively cause more stress??
