I never got disappointed with the answers in this subreddit Thank you so for such an answer with the quality I'm looking for.
Last time from another answer I bought the book "Joan of Arc: Her story", and this time I would buy the " Taylor, C. Joan of Arc: La Pucelle " one.
Taylor, C. Joan of Arc: La Pucelle, Manchester University Press, 2006 (This really is the best source if you’re interested in the trials of Joan. Taylor presents useful, accessible translation of all the major documents from both trials, and a very helpful covering analysis and introduction. Indispensable for anyone with an interest in Joan.).
Taylor gives us another case of convenient memory lapses in the form of the Dominican Martin Ladvenu, who “somehow forgot in 1450 \[when he was interrogated\] that he had heard Joan’s confession and given her communion on the day she died, and attacked Cauchon \[in his testimony\] for putting Joan in a lay prison; two years later \[at a subsequent deposition\] he could not remember who had been responsible for incarcerating her under these circumstances, but did remember that he had heard her confession; by 1456, he was able to give a lively account of her final hours!”.
