If a president resigns in the first term, there is nothing prohibiting that person from running again. If a president resigns in the second term (as Nixon did) that person could not run again: begins with the following: "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice...".
So if the President resigns, then the present understanding of that passage is that the impeachment trial does not take place, and therefore the possible sentence of disqualifying from future elected office is not possible.
The question being addressed here asked about a president who resigned before the Senate voted to remove the president (and/or before House impeachment). Removal from office following action from the Senate would have different ramifications - none of which have been tested since this has never occurred.
> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States [...].
If a president resigns before the congress impeachment and/or senate conviction, could they run again in a future election? And if they did would the proceedings pick back up where they left off?
