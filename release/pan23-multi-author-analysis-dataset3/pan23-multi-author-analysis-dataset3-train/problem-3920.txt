Typically when a company is bought-out, the aquiring company must also take over any remaining liability of the subsidiary. The existing company owes you the remaining rental property until your lease is up so my guess is that the new company must honor it.
Is it not if tenant wanted to be out of lease, landlord would have hold tenant responsible for rent for rest of the term of lease. So cash for keys should be rent for all remaining term of lease?
Okay, but just for security reasons, do the new owners have to respect the lease agreement? Until March 2022?
Yes, they have to honor the lease until March 2022. They also have to return your security deposit if your old landlord did not do so.
In many states and countries, tenants have a lot less rights during foreclosure and there is usually a diffenence between foreclosure and a landlord selling the house "of his own free will". So that's why you are getting lots of conflicting information.
Sorry, you're getting conflicting information because California is much more tenant friendly than other states.
