The legal system can't fix your husband's perspective. You did the right thing in replenishing the trust, and that likely abates the issue. The legal system likely has no further interest in how you and your husband manage your personal finances so long as you, as the trustee, manage the trust appropriately - which I would guess includes not giving your husband access a second time, given how this has gone.
Talk to a lawyer. It may be possible to shift the balance of marital assets to restore the money you had to borrow to replenish the accounts, or it may not be.
If it's in trust, then your husband is simply wrong. You have obligations to your kids under the terms of that trust, and there's no "should" about it.
If you and your husband can't come to a compromise on this, a couple's counselor may be able to help you mediate. If this is an irreparable rift between you, speak to a divorce lawyer.
You really need to spend an hour or two with a divorce/family law attorney. You have to protect yourself and kids. Facing the cold hard reality is the only way to possibly save your marriage also, IMO. I’d probably have the papers filled out, signed, and ready to file in a make or break situation like this.
