China's claimed defense spending numbers aren't remotely accurate. And given the age of their forces, they put a much higher percentage of their budget into acquisitions than the US or allies who have older systems that require more maintenance. There's more nuance to this than is often acknowledged. Plus, understand that the likely point of conflict is taiwan. Because of the proximity to China and the other responsibilities the US maintains, the mission of the US & its allies is to be able to fight and win on the opponents home turf while managing extended supply lines & maintaining deterrent forces in other theaters. That mission requires more forces than simply blockading or seizing taiwan & defending their amphibious & expeditionary forces from US & allied intervention.
The main problem facing the US defense budget though is the generational replacements of the key parts of the nuclear triad which will suck $ from everything else & not contribute much to any real regional conflict. For example, replacing the Ohio SSBNs with Columbia's is going to eat most of the US Navy's shipbuilding budget in an era when the PLAN is adding several Tier 1 surface combatants each year (Luyang III & Renhai).
"At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.".
