Prior to 1917 the debt was handled in a way we would call common sense. Congress passed laws to do something and they authorized the debt to enact those laws.
the appropriations process is the "authorized by law" part though.... and they have to do it every year.
The Republicans have a point. Our spending is not sustainable, and it's not well-managed. Why should politicians get to raise taxes before they put a good budget in place? Shouldn't increased taxes come after a clear plan to more responsible spending?
If the democrats pushed a balanced budget, it would force the republicans to own the national debt issue when they try to cut taxes.
Also, Republicans do a lot more deficit spending than Democrats, therefore the debt that is being paid comes more from Republicans, and also are things that were approved years ago.
The republicans led congress (the branch that is in charge of the budget) when we had a balanced budget under Clinton. You canâ€™t just point the finger at the other side and say that because of them we need to keep putting our country into deeper and deeper debt.
