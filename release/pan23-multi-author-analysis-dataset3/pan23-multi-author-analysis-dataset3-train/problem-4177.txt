I live in Saint Petersburg Florida. I could call a shop to see if they can access the cars computer. I know the battery died so could it have been reset or is it permanent data that can be accessed?
The car would start to over heat sometimes if left running for more then 20-30 minutes and I did tell them that the first time I dropped my car off. I had to take in a second time because they did not blend paint correctly in the front bumper. When I took it in for the second time they apparently had a change in management and that information wasn’t passed along. The car has always been like that and I drove it daily never had issues. I’m just speculating they left it on unintended and it overheated, no reason for a body/paint shop to leave a car running for long periods of time when they’re just painting.
If a car overheats just from sitting 20-30 minutes(honestly that isn't that long) than thos motor had pretty major issues, at least enough issues to make the shop not responsible. No way you are going to find judgement in your favor in courts of law. It sucks and may e if you can get the scans saying it was excessively driven, but seems like motor was already 8n desperate need of maintenance.
