I figure I will use the attorney who helped me establish that my trustee paperwork superceded the probate my sister initially filed. I was just trying to see if it was possible to simply oppose it without having to have a lawyer. We have proof of the asset distribution so far including my sister because everything has gone through the account I set up on behalf of the trust. The major reason the attorney is doing this for is to make us pay their fees which I assume they initially told my sister could be done after probate. So I am guessing they have not been paid by her at all since I know her husband bought a brand new truck immediately afterwards she got her share from the sale of the house.
We don't need to open probate. It was a living trust done by my father before he passed and we are all equal trustees. There's no money to pay there just assets which need to be sold off and divided so we would have to pay for the lawyer ourselves I believe.
The trust could sell assets, borrow funds to pay the retainer, or make an agreement with the attorney that they will be paid out of future sales of trust assets.
If so, you could/should be able to use Trust assets to defend against any litigation that threatens you as Trustee or threatens your ability to fulfil the terms of the Trust.
