I don't know why they would considering we have been and continue to support Pakistan militarily since they committed genocide in Bangladesh. If it's actually true and India supports Russia's war in Ukraine then that's indefensible, but that's not necessarily true and all signs point to neutrality. Still though, historically India has every right to be wary of United States foreign policy in south Asia.
The U.S. is not and has never been an adversary of India. India decided on its own to side with an adversary of the United States, however. You are mistaking the cart for the horse, and exaggerating how important India is in the process.
The reality is that India has been a supporter and ally of the Soviet Union and the Russian rump state that was left when it collapsed.
While India claimed a policy of non-alignment, they were very friendly with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, esp. after Stalin died. The U.S. to my knowledge never took any real action against India beyond treating it like a semi-significant country that was more alligned with the Soviet sphere than Western Europe and United States.
“Today’s world” even shows the US building stronger and stronger relations with India despite India’s “support” of Russia, again, especially in the military sector. The US government is capable of understanding geopolitics. We random redditors don’t know everything going on behind the scenes.
