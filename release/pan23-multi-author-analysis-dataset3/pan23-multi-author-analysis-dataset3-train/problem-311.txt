The military will need a large number of bodies in the army though and operational needs will come first. So the people with the most useful skillsets will get the air force and almost everyone else is going to the army.
The thing is everyone is going to want to get into the air force because they know its less likely they'll be involved in ground engagements. That is true today even outside of a draft.
Its entirely possible a segment of that 9 million might not be fighting if they have been given a choice. This is the problem with drafts. Its an attempt to strip people of their right to choose and force them to fight against their will.
The alternative is to ask the people who want to fight to fight and not try and force the ones who don't. If your country is actually worth anything you'll have enough people volunteer. If you can't get enough people to volunteer the country is probably not worth saving anyway.
If a country is worth fighting for people will choose to fight for it if you have to force them then the country isn't that great.
