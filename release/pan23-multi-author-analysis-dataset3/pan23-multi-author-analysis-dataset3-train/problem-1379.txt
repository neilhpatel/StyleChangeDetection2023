Throwing trash into their yard and leaving their bikes in the road (on a dead-end street) are definitely nuisances, but are not likely to be something police would spend much energy stopping (nor would it be appropriate to call the police for something like this), and your parents don't have any financial loss that would make a lawsuit worthwhile. The person whose car was damaged could file a claim with their insurance, or potentially file a small claims suit against the neighbors if they refuse to pay for the damage.
The legal system is probably not the appropriate venue for resolving most of these issues. Assuming they don't have an HOA, and there are no applicable local ordinances, they're allowed to put their swing set and grass clippings anywhere they want on their property, and they're allowed to look at your parents' house. Your parents may want to consider installing curtains or a privacy fence if they are concerned about their neighbors looking in their windows.
The first step would be to talk to the neighbors and bring these issues to their attention. Are they aware of their children leaving trash in your mother's yard and damaging other people's property?
They also have been dumping their grass clippings into the corner of my parent’s fence and their fence, making it smell AWFUL in my parent’s yard.
Mind you, they have TWO backyards. One with a privacy fence that’s like a HUGE back patio connected to the house, and then just a small lenh outside of that fence with enough space to put the thing literally anywhere else.
Right! More than anything, what about the kids staring into the house and backyard? I’m talking they are RIGHT there just watching my parents and my sister throughout the night.
