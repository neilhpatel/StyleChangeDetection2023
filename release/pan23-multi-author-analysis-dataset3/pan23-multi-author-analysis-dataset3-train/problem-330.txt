Don't know your contract but I assume it's too much work and not worth fighting even if it does have loopholes. Your best option is to start looking for another place asap. If you're lucky you might be able to get out with only a month or so of that garbage situation. Consider asking your schools counselors about recommend places to rent, most schools have a list or a bulletin of people that need roommates or houses with room available. While you're there they might even have a list of "bad" rentals you can recommend they add your current landlord to.
Any rules in your lease apply to you, not to the landlord, and not to other people not on your lease.
If it's a generic open ended lease on that house, that would make it a little tricky to use on your end, but also tricky for the landlord since the lease is agreed as a whole to the house.
If so, you can at least request provisions to lock and secure areas of the house designated to you. If they refuse, I would be curious to see how you could approach that as a means of challenging the lease.
NaL but dealt with landlord squabbles on property assignments in my prior leases.. Does your lease cover a specific section of the house that is agreed upon to you (i.e. bedroom, bathroom, shared living spaces, etc.)? Or is it open ended and generic to the house as a whole?
