She's making a power play. "He goes or I go." Management can choose that she goes, or you go, or no one goes.
Otherwise, it's kind of a job requirement to get along with your boss in many jobs. You chose to have some kind of outside relationship with the boss leading to a "falling out," leading to this, and there's nothing illegal about it.
Generally, no, unless you're in a union or unless you want to claim this is discrimination based on your sex, race, age, etc.
No, that would require the harassment to not be based on a mutual dislike, but on your religion or race or gender, things like that. It's legal to treat people poorly. It's illegal to treat people poorly because of protected class characteristics. The Tennessee Human Rights Act makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the basis of race, creed, disability, color, religion, sex, age or national origin. The Tennessee Disability Act makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the basis of physical, mental or visual disability.
Because that's how at-will employment works. Nothing you describe is illegal. They could fire you, her, both of you, or neither of you, for these reasons or for no reasons. There's nothing for an attorney to do here outside of any discrimination based on protected-class status (which you don't describe). If you are fired file for unemployment asap and appeal if denied.
