Good news is you won't be tied to your future ex husband. Unfortunately you probably won't get alimony. File for divorce and let your lawyer handle it. Most if not all lawyers do not represent them selfs.
Talk to a divorce lawyer, and go from there. Your husband should do the same (he should not self-represent), but what he does is no longer your business.
After such a short marriage, where you've both kept separate lives, a divorce _should_ be straightforwards. Spousal support is unlikely, both because the marriage was so short and because it appears you haven't lost much, if any, of your ability to earn a living by being out of the market, though you might have to find a new way to finance your schooling if you were relying on having someone else bringing in food and mortgage/rent money.
Additional support or additional marital assets as "punishment" for infidelity is mostly not done any more, and trying to pursue an at-fault divorce may ultimately cost you more than the no-fault route.
