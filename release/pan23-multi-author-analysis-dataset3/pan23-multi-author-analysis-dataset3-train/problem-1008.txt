It depends on the type of ticket written. PA does "fix-it" tickets for some types of automobile related citations meaning that if you get the issue fixed before your court date you can show the judge/magistrate that it is fixed and they'll dismiss the ticket. Generally, that is for stuff like broken lights/windows and such. I don't know if it also applies to registration and/or inspections. Chances are it doesn't. BUT that also doesn't mean the magistrate can't dismiss the ticket still as long as you show that you've corrected the issues or have other mitigating circumstance. It's certainly worth a shot and the only thing you've got to lose is a partial day of work.
Absolutely he can. Fixing the issues doesn't guarantee the magistrate will agree and reduce or throw out the tickets but, like I said, it's always worth a shot.
Unless the officer wrote what we call around here a “fix-it ticket” he’s probably going to wind up having to pay.(but not a lawyer and not familiar with Pennsylvania vehicle inspection laws.).
