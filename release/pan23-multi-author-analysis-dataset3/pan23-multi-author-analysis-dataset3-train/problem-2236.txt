Roberts totally ignored the elephant in the room. First you have a justice whose wife was involved in the plot to overthrow the executive branch and multiple justices that lied during their confirmation hearings. The fact that he's ignoring the ethical failings of the current Supreme Court shows that we need to have oversight of the Court, they won't do it themselves.
Or maybe, if court justices had term limits, they wouldn't serve on the court long enough to achieve perceived biases/corruption that warrant hostilities. How the founding fathers thought a lifelong appointment on the judicial branch was incorruptible is obviously flawed thinking. Hate to think it was intentional.
It doesn't make any sense. The winner of one election gets to appoint a member of the judicial branch that imposes his own perceived judgment on the context of our laws for roughly 20-30 some odd years. Whether they want to admit it or not, we have had republican and democratic judges since the very beginnings of the court. Whether or not they have to worry about elections, doesn't mean they weren't chosen (to some degree) for their political beliefs lol.
"If you don't like politicians removing your right to have your vote counted, vote out that politician using your vote that no longer counts." - GOP SCOTUS logic.
