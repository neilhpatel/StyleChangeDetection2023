But what he’s doing here is (1) calling their bluff, and (2) playing “good cop” which is what France’s role almost always is with Russia and China. He’s basically telling China - “You want to end the war? Great. So do we. Go tell Russia to stop attacking Ukraine, and the war will be over and you will have helped the West.” Everyone knows China can’t do that, so… calling the bluff. It’s a smart strategy, and closer to what Ukraine itself is doing, because it’s a win/win. Either China doesn’t stop Russia, in which case China been called out for their hypocrisy on the world stage, or somehow they achieve the impossible and get Russia to pull out of Ukraine, pay reparations etc.
China jumped on the Russian bandwagon thinking they were going to be global disrupters by use of force and coercion to regain global power status identical to US. It’s back firing. Now they are trying to save face and pretend they are in control. When really they never were and just thought Russia would hold up its end of the bargain.
I don’t think they have a grip on the leash as much as they want you to think. Plus no way Russia is trading being US bitch to being chinas. They want to be the one who wags the stick too.
Also Russia could get by, maybe not as long, with the help of India, Iran, North Korea, some African nations. Some South American countries.
