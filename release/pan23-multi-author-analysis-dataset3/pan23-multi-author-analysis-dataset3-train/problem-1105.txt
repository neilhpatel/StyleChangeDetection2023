you could in theory withhold consent for the x-rays, but then they won't do any treatment at all because, again, standard of care and good practice.
Of course a patient can decline to consent to an x-ray. However, if the office cleans your teeth then you become a patient of record and the dentist could be at risk for the types of issues discussed above.
NAL. Also not a dentist but I work at a state dental association and get this question all the time. If you look up information on x-rays/radiographs, you will find the scientific explanation for why x-rays are a critical diagnostic tool dentists need to look for damage and disease that isn't visible during a clinical exam.
If there was something a dentist would have been able to detect with an x-ray and they don't do it, that fact could be used as evidence against them in a malpractice case or the review any complaint filed with a state licensing board. You won't find that in the statutes but those decisions are why dentists and their staff say its required by law.
Whether the law actually requires X-rays or not, dentists are certainly entitled to their position they won't treat you without them.
