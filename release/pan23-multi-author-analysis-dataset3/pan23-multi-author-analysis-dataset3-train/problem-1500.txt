Biden didn't have to recommend Congress intervene. If the strike was bad for the economy then force the owner class hand not the workers. Why is it that the workers wreck to economy when they want basic rights but the greedy oligarchs are good for the economy?
Instead of pointing the finger at the workers for shutting down the economy... Maybe ask the capitalists in charge why the fuck saving the economy isn't worth a few sick days. This is on them, not the union, not the working class.
That's the point of a strike: a demonstration of the importance of the workers. If rail workers are so incredibly important that them all deciding to quit would shatter the economy then maybe, just maybe, they deserve the sick leave they are asking for? Perhaps the business interest should be brought to heel for once instead of the labor interest?
BULLSHIT! The deal includes 1 personal day. ONE. And 0 sick leave. The amendment adding sick leave was immediately rejected by the senate.
The union has rejected deals for 3 years now for not including sick leave. The pay raise is not what they have been asking for.
