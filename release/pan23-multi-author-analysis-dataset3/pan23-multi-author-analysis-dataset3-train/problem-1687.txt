Ask her for a copy of the documents and take them to your own estate lawyer. Don't sign unless your lawyer says it is in your best interest to do so.
Don't sign anything without getting an independent legal opinion on how that signed document would expose you legally.
I'm surprised that your step mother needs your signatures for this lawsuit, she's your father's next of kin as his legal spouse. What I would be most concerned about is having any bequest that might be coming to me consumed by legal expenses in what is likely to be an unsuccessful claim.
IANAL. Princess Cruises is a wholly owned subsidiary of Carnival Corporation & plc, which is incorporated in Bermuda and headquartered in Santa Clarita, CA. Suing Princess is not going to be easy or cheap. When your father and stepmother bought their cruise tickets, they agreed to to the which nominates the Federal Court for the District of Los Angeles as the venue for lawsuits related to death. There are all sorts of conditions regarding excursions and liability. Basically, the passage contract tries to limit the cruise line's liability and to make it as difficult and expensive as possible to sue them.
As others have noted, she needs a lawyer that specifically deals with cruise lines, because this crosses US and Grand Cayman law, as well as possibly wherever the cruise contract states claims will be heard.
