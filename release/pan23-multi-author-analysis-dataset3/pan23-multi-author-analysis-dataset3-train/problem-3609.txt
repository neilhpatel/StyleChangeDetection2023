But, unless the DNC is actually willing to enforce such a ban, it will absolutely be used as a weapon against progressives playing by the rules by the corporatists in the party who just want to enrich themselves while maintaining the status quo.
Super PACs shouldnt be a thing period, but as long as they are its nigh suicidal (in reference fo election chances) to not use them when your opposition is, youre kneecapping yourself from the word go.
And even with the massive amount of grass roots support he had, it still wasnt enough for him to beat easily the worst candidate (insofar as public perception not actual qualifications) the democrats could have put forward. And why was that? Because the system is rigged, the media constantly downplayed Bernie when they weren't actively blacking him out.
Whats the difference between Bernie and the vast majority of politicians? Bernie is passionate, Bernie has fire. Bernie told people the truth, that the system is rigged, and not by some nebulous other, but the billionaire class.
Bernie has made a career out of turning being a hypocrite into a virtue. People need to start realizing they're being played. The irony is it's dark money from Russia through these Super PACs that has led to this cult following.
