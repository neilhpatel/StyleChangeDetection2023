Signing something with someone who broke the agreement where they guaranteed your independence in exchange for transfering your nuclear weapons to them?
No, I can't imagine they will honour whatever agreement you make with them this time, either. Think the only solution where Russia won't attack Ukraine again will be Ukraine joining NATO.
I think our conversation could have stop here, since Russia won't even consider attacking Ukraine without their nuclear arsenal.
My point is the invasion of Ukraine is a more terroristic event than destroying some power infrastructure.
Of course not, but answer this question: what capabilities has Russia used in Ukraine to destroy power infrastructure?
Your answer will be "conventional weapons", and thus Russia's nuclear capabilities cannot be rationally considered to be the "terrorist capabilities" that they are using in Ukraine.
Russia's terrorist capabilities aren't their nukes, because the second they use one against a non-nuclear country (all the ones in Eastern Europe), they become a pariah state worse than North Korea.
