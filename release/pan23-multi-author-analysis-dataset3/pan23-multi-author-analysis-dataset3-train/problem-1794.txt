That link helped a lot, thanks. It's probable that he has at least 10 units, the house I moved out of had 5 and he does own other rentals. I didn't receive an inspection list, it was all very informal and done through Cozy.
Even if I had never agreed to pay this "cleaning fee"? Or even if I didn't leave behind any mess or damages beyond normal wear and tear? Is this only the case because there was no lease or is this normal?
Whether there was a lease or not isn't particularly relevant. Most laws, not all, about renting supercede lease contracts.
Georgia seems unique in its requirement to have inspections done if the landlord owns 10 or more units. If your landlord meets this requirement, then it sounds like you should have received an inspection list to sign when you moved in.
Did you take photos of the room before and after you moved in and out? He can charge a cleaning fee to get the room back to the same level of cleanliness as when it was first rented.
On the topic of cleanliness being ordinary wear and tear... It's normally a question of how "badly" it needed to be cleaned and how dirty it was when you moved in. If you had photos before and after, then you'd have proof.
