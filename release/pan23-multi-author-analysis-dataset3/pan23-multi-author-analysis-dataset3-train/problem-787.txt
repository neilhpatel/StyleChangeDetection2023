Yes, I did park and do business somewhere else besides Bank of America. And no, I did not go there at all. However, I should not have been towed due to the first two violations I listed in my post.
There was no sign saying “for customers only” from the entrance which I entered from, nor was there any sort of marking on the parking spot I parked in. The only sign was on the other end of the parking lot, which I obviously didn’t see. This is illegal under Vehicle Code 22953.
AB 2210 was an assembly bill that amended several portions of the Vehicle Code. You can't cite AB 2210 to a court as if it's a statute; it's not. You need to figure out which statute or statutes you're claiming were violated and see what remedies are provided.
Everyone who's towed thinks they are towed illegally. Most are not. This is meaningless and a small claims judge will not care. You can't act on anyone's behalf but your own.
You can ask for any amount you want. Towing companies get threats to sue them all the time. They are unlikely just to give you money, especially money over the amount you paid. So if you threaten to go to small claims, make sure you are really ready to do that. There is no guarantee you will win as getting the security footage from the bank will be difficult, even assuming they retain it for any period of time. More likely this comes down to your word vs. a security guard's.
