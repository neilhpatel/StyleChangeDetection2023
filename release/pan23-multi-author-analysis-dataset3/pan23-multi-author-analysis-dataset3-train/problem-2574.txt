It's shocking how easy it is to manipulate the masses with simple gambits like this. It makes me sad how fucking stupid and ignorant the average person is.
Please understand that I don't agree with any of this, but that's essentially what this idiot is saying.
Tl;Dr - The deep state orchestrated the entire thing and those Maga goons are morons who don't know any better.
Translation: "I believe that the MAGA movement is comprised of easily led idiots who are victims of a nefarious government plot. There was no real violence on Jan 6th. It was just people exercising their rights to protest... but any actual violence was because the government convinced stupid people to do stupid things.".
Aw gesch. If your family loves you then they won’t want you to die. Can’t you help them to understand that the odds of you being forced to join the war and kill or be killed are not good, and in either case you wouldn’t be the same?
There is a huge difference between thinking the war is wrong and not wanting to be forced to fight and die in it. I’ve heard several stories of insanely pro-putin Russian who fled and brazenly started fights and spouted their propaganda in other countries. They ran scared when they were going to be forced to fight but are very pro putin or anti Ukraine. So don’t think they’re all here freedom loving friends.
