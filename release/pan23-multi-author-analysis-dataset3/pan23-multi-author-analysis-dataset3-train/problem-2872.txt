Every. Fucking. Russian. Who does nothing to actually stop the war, overthrow totalitarian government, fight even for THEIR OWN COUNTRY'S FUTURE.
But that's not for us to worry about. Our work is simple, see russian occupant - shoot this fuck on sight. Rince and repeat, until the last one of these raping, looting, torturing sons of bitches are removes from our land.
putin is too easy to put the blame on, but the reality is much more harsh. It's not putin who gives and executes the exact orders, it's not putin who is cheering up on the news of the dead ukrainian children in the comments, it's not putin who says nothing about this war, or even in some verbal or text form condemns it - but still fucking keeps funding it and support russian war machine with their actions.
There is a Russian propaganda wing claiming Russia is innocent and isn’t killing any civilians and that this is all justified since Russia will eventually win the war and their goal is a war of attrition.
The reason this is especially egregious is because humanity has already moved on to consider killing civilians a war crime that they shouldn't do, and Russia is gleefully doing it currently.
Russia can’t be allowed to define what is and what is not a reasonable response, when they themselves are so unreasonable, deliberately targeting civilians.
