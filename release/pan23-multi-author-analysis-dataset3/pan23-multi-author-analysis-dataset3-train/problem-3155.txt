Funny because someone else said the same line verbatim, like a bot or something. There was no peace in the region during the 80's after he left. It was one of the most horrible periods in the region.
I like Carter, but don't lie to people. Israel has been condemned by the UN more than North Korea and 90% of Egyptians still think homosexuality should be illegal.
What noticeable accomplishment? Egypt today is one of the most dangerous countries in the world and Israel literally bulldozes Palestinian homes every single year against UN orders and has one of the most horrible right-wing fascist governments, same with Egypt.
Neither Egypt or Israel is a safe place to live today, the treaty was meaningless in the long term as both countries have become worse over the years and far more oppressive.
What a legacy Carter left behind Not only did he negotiate peace between Israel and Egypt which helped bring lasting stability to the region, but his work on human rights has been far-reaching. Not to mention his efforts to promote renewable energy and global health initiatives. Definitely a leader worth remembering.
