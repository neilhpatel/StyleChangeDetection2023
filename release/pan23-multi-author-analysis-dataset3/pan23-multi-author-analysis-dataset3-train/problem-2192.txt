The driver was a Palestinian permanent resident of East Jerusalem, meaning that he held an Israeli ID and could, if he so chose, become an Israeli citizen. He was not an Israeli.
Look up the Israeli settlement program. Would you trust someone who was already illegally occupying those land and the United Nations did nothing about it?
Because they couldn’t trust the rest of the world to back them when the government changed hands. Not to mention it did t help that far-right Israelis kept agitating things and baiting the Palestinians into rioting to help blow up the talks.
Regardless, if you really think a two state solution is what will end the bloodline between Israelis and Palestinians, you’re wrong and you really should learn more about this conflict.
I don't think peace was ever really on the table on the Palestinian side. The factions demanding the complete destruction of Israel have always prevented any compromise solution.
The 2000 Camp David Summit was a summit meeting at Camp David between United States president Bill Clinton, Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat. No deal.
