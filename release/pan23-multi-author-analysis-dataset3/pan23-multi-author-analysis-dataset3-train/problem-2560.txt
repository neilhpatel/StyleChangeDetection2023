Your best option right now is to go back to your house so you can keep her from stealing things or trying to illegally cash your checks or illegally open your mail. Ignore her threats, she can't take anything without suing you. Don't agree to give her anything and don't sign anything. It would be a good idea to consult a lawyer now to see what your options are. If she sues and you don't have a lawyer yet, find an experienced lawyer to represent you and make sure you appear in court so she can't get a default judgement.
And, of course, it should go without saying that you should seek the advice of an actual lawyer in your area.
You should return to your house and serve her a 30 day notice to begin formally evicting her. You should take all of your important documents and possessions and store them safely somewhere else.
Any accounts on which you have added her, remove her. You may also just move your account somewhere else so she can't try to get into it. Human error is real.
That state doesn't recognize common law marriage so the only way she's getting half of anything is if you're secretly married to her or something.
