They could, however, let me go if they realize I don't have enough work to do though, right? Just not ask for pay to be returned?
However, it worries me if they try to come for me because I can't afford an attorney. Working as a temp, I still get paid pretty poorly. But I hope it won't come to that, because my bosses are aware that how much work I can do is contingent on what they actually assign me, and they seem to expect me to be free at any given work hour.
If you are paid to work from 8:30-5 and you are ready and available to work from 8:30 to 5, I find it doubtful they could get back pay for that. I will be honest, I do a lot of Covid related employment work, but I have not delved into remote wage and hour issues yet. Hopefully an expert who has done this research comes along. But for now, what I can say is that I am very familiar with wage and hour stuff from a traditional perspective (people in the office with no work are still paid for those hours until fired) but I don’t know if there are any exceptions for work from home situations. I highly doubt they can get back pay from you, and if they did attempt to do so, I would certainly seek an attorney if they come at you for it and if you were ready and able to work, and always at your computer and responsive. The only thing I would worry about personally is being terminated because they don’t need you, but since you are employed by a temp agency, I’m sure they can find you a new assignment. The money you made is very likely just yours.
Unless your contract is for a particular term of years or months (subject to whatever terms and conditions are in that contract), they can likely terminate you for any reason that is not unlawful (discrimination based on race for example).
