The ones using it absolutely do, the problem is trying to convince people who think "not that deep" is an acceptable counter-argument.
The Republicans' goal isn't ideological integrity, it's do anything and everything to potentially throw a Democrat off guard and then take advantage.
Democrats never realize that GOP hypocrisy and crazy culture wars are theatrical strategy - a bait and switch tactic to rile their neck beard constituents while simultaneously grifting them.
I mean, no one will ever accuse republicans of being logical but it’s insulting that they pretend that there’s logic behind their actions.
Like anyone with half a brain can see that the antisemitic party doesn’t care about condemning antisemitism but we’re supposed to believe that’s the case because they say so, despite dumbass Marg consistently rises in their ranks. Good on AOC for calling them out but since republican voters have less than half a brain, what’s clear to everyone else doesn’t really matter to them.
This just in: everything the Republicans say is random nonsense to emptily advance what they want to do. There is no substance and they don’t give a shit if they get “called out” on it because getting called out results in literally zero consequences. Zero.
