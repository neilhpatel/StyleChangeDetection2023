The definition of update is to bring someone up to date. The definition of that is: to give someone the most recent information about something. So no, reporters do not get updated (unless there is a release of information signed) because again, CPS can not give out information due to privacy laws.
NAL but I have CPS experience. CPS will tour the home and interview all household members. Theyâ€™ll also seek corroborating information from additional sources (schools, counselors, neighbors, relatives, service providers, whoever is relevant). There are many different outcomes to CPS investigations. All the way from nothing at all, to a safety plan, voluntary services, court ordered services, or removals.
And not all reports are investigated. They have to meet acceptance criteria (although it sounds like this one would definitely be accepted).
Checking if they meet the acceptance criteria is investigation. Investigation isn't just going to someone's house.
The update will be very limited and will often be asking for more information. They aren't going to tell you the ins and outs of it of course, that's just common sense.
