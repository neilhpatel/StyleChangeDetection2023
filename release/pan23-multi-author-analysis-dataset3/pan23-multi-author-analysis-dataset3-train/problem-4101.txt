A) I doubt a moderate coalition is possible. This debacle shows that Republicans are split between their establishment and the wackos who just want to troll and see everything burn. They are being carried rightward by their extremist troll caucus.
I do think there needs to be opposition to Democrats in politics. That's just a healthy check on power.
If it actually transpired then I bet some assurances or deal would be made. But if the majority did that recall then it would be back to square one, and this time Democrats would have EVEN LESS incentive to work across the aisle.
Obviously, they can enter whatever votes they want but in order for the vote for Jeffries to have value they would need to become democrats so that they could use their votes to bargain.
Then I can vote for a progressive president, every single member of the democratic "working families" party of CT (which usually wins), and maybe then, the democrats will win it all federally and Jefferies will be speaker then anyway.
Honestly as a democrat that’s lived under Larry hogan in MD for awhile I’d be really excited to see him or somebody similar run for President in 2024 and would seriously consider voting against my party if it came down to it. I disagree with a good deal of his policies but I could at least usually say “I don’t agree but I see the logic” - he’s also shown that he hates trump and his crew as much as most democrats have. I think if the GOP put somebody like that up for the current nom then there could be pressure for some more moderate democrats to help get the majority vote through.
Talking with others I think there’s a growing sentiment like this and my pipe dream is we finally get that coveted 3rd party down the middle (because unfortunately the alt right doesn’t seem to be going anywhere and as I think we agree: a single party system is never a good thing).
