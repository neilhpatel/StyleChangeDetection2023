I reread the order and the definitions. You are correct. In order to have the protection of the ban the tenant has to be a covered person, and the definition does include "the individual is unable to pay the full rent or make a full housing payment due to substantial loss of household income, loss of compensable hours of work or wages, a lay-off, or extraordinary out-of-pocket medical expenses.".
I did read that. More importantly, I also read the definition of "covered person." Because the son does not pay rent in the first place, he's not a "covered person.".
> It also excludes evictions of those who have received judgments for drug-related activity and possession of commercial properties.
The CDC eviction ban (and generally most others) usually only applies to renters who can't pay rent due to a COVID-related issue. If he's not paying rent to begin with, he's not going to be covered by that.
They are not (yet) evicting him. They're just terminating his month-to-month tenancy. There's nothing in the CDC memo that precludes doing so.
The son is a month-to-month tenant at this point. I think in Missouri he's supposed to get 30 days' written notice to vacate. Then you start the actual eviction process. Just tell him you're refusing to renew his month-to-month tenancy and leave it at that.
