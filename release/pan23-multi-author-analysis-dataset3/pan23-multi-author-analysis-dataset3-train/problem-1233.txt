Something to remember the actual unit price for F-35 is estimated at around $60 Million US per plane down from an estimated $200 million at the start of it's production cycle. These contracts include significantly more than just the planes, and may include spare parts, maintenance support, training, munitions, special considerations, etc.
It's cheap enough that SAAB who sells a a less capable but much cheaper 4th Gen aircraft can no longer market solely on cost savings anymore because the F-35's price is now low enough to be in the same ballpark while being more capable.
Even the USAF is going with a high/low mixture of F-35s and cheaper non-stealth aircraft like the F-15/16/18. You don't need an expensive plane like the F-35 to enforce no-fly zones against civilian aircraft.
Not alot of countries with advanced strategic bombers, and the ones that have one the F35 can probably handle.
The F22 is better against aircraft then the F35 from what I've seen using tactics that we will likely see in real warfare, running the same type of weapons as the F35.
The F35 is a multi role fighter, while the F22 is really only an air superiority fighter. The F35 is cheaper, and is so far ahead of all other planes as an air superiority platform though that unless the enemy is using F22s, then we won't need anything but thr F35.
The F22 is arguably better as a strict air superiority fighter but the F35 is a better overall platform and integrates better into a combined arms military with its vast and advanced sensor arrays.
The F22 would, as far as I've seen, be the superior traditional fighter in terms of shooting the other plane down. The F35 is more generally useful.
In terms of Ambush, the F22 is more stealthy than the F35. That is its primary advantage. The avionics of the F35 would probably struggle with seeing the F22.
