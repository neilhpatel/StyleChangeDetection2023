You're making a mistake in your definition of "best candidate". To those republican voters someone who will toe the party lint to keep anti-lgbt and other culture war fights going IS the best candidate. Your and my grading rubrics don't apply one tiny bit. I get so annoyed seeing people on the left continuously cry about how republicans keep voting for such awful candidates and I just want to scream "awful candidates TO YOU! To them the candidates are exactly. what. they. want.".
Same. I am independent and itâ€™s been over 10 years since I have found a single republican candidate, local or national, that I wanted to vote for.
I tried to vote by policy for a couple years after going independent, then I figured out Republican policy was just hate, ignorance, and fear. Hard to not just only vote for the other side when that happens, especially when going anywhere in the middle just hands it to the other side.
Voting along party line isn't that uncommon.. it more or less how the majority of the population currently votes. Mostly because the GOP has completely jumped the shark on a lot of aspects of reality and long term thinking. But anyways.. voting for your party is normal... the real question is why Herschel got through the GOP primaries. having idiotic candidates is one thing.. but you would hope they get filter out at earlier stages... But Herschel Walker got like 70% in the GOP primary.
He was running against Gary Black the Georgia commissioner of agriculture and Latham Saddler former navy seal officer and was Director of Intelligence Programs for the National Security Council. Along with having a BA in international affairs.
Not sure about how good either was at campaigning, or there stage presence. But from a qualifications point of view the gap is Vast.
