Carrying the firearm past your house everyday un-holstered most likely fits the criteria for brandishing. She's doing it in a manner intended to make you afraid and it is indeed making you fearful, especially since she threatened to use it.
Make a memo of every interaction you've had with her, gather any evidence you've collected and consolidate it. Whenever you see her brandishing the firearm call the police and tell them there's a woman in your neighborhood brandishing a firearm. Make a record of every time you've called the police.
Call the police. She threatened to use a firearm on you and yours, and is now brandishing said firearm when walking by your house.
Edit; u/Lezin410 according to NC law, she is brandishing a weapon as opposed to being in possession of a weapon under the open carry laws.
Open carry is legal as long as you don't gesture towards the gun or make a move to somehow threaten with it and it's located in a holster.
Yeah, open carry in a holster is legal. Having a fire arm in your hand in public is a no go. Get proof of that and should have no problem keeping her away from your dog. But, if I should escalate defend your family and especially your dog from an armed lunatic.
