The history of narcotics prohibition is essentially the history of American narcotics prohibition, and then their success in internationalizing it. At the turn of the century, you could buy cocaine, morphine, or heroin over the counter at most any pharmacy.
Thus at the 1909 Shanghai Conference, the US and China were able to achieve a non-binding agreement with the other colonial powers, most notably Britain, to limit the opium trade. American negotiators complained that they weren't able to push further because the US lacked any federal prohibition of narcotics. As a show of good faith, the US began prohibiting the import of smoking opium from April 1909. Attempts to go further were blocked by the pharmaceutical industry. After several more years of negotiating, the first binding international drug control treaty, the International Opium Convention was agreed upon in 1912.
The first international conference on narcotics would indeed have been in Shanghai in 1909, as fevercrumb observes, which facilitated the 1912 International Opium Convention of the Hague (which entered in force in 1915). The Treaty of Versailles contained a clause mandating adherence from its signatories to the Opium Convention, marking the start of something resembling the international instruments of today. It was the League of Nations in 1920 that assumed responsibilities for drug control, developing 3 major conventions (1925, 1931, and 1936) that had provisions to curb the drug trade in practice.
