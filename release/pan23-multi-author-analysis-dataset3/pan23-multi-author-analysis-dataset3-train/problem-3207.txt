These comments of "nothing will happen" do nothing to help the Iranian people. They only hurt us and our movement. You might think you are giving us a reality check but believe me, none of us needs one. We know exactly what we are up against.
I know it sounds ridiculous to think social media can actually help those who are dying, but it is because of posts that this movement has stayed alive, that has given the people on the ground courage to keep going. People in prison continue to reiterate that we need to keep their stories alive, to share them.
If there’s one thing we Iranians have an unlimited supply of, it's tenacity and stubbornness. As long as those in Iran are still fighting, those of us outside of Iran will continue to be their voice.
Iranians in Iran have told the diaspora to do what they can to keep attention on Iran. So they have. Kind of silly to tell them to shut up and not show support when that’s not what the people in Iran want….
Yes I agree, my post was directed at another comment and my support for the people of Iran wasn’t really clear.
I agree with you, my comment was directed at the previous post who questioned American appetite for backing another regime change. my post was not clear.
