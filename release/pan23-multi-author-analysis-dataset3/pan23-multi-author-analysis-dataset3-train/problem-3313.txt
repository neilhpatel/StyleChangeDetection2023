Agreed. He's an idiot he was good at a thing or two. Equating his wealth with an understanding of free speech is a mistake. Musk also doesn't seem llike the kind of guy who has "no" guys around him on ideas like Twitter.
Musk is acting like being banned from Twitter somehow removes your freedom of speech. It’s ridiculous. You don’t get arrested when you get banned. You’re free to talk anywhere else.
Free speech is an ideal. The 1st Amendment doesn't protect what you're talking about. It doesn't protect very much, in the grand scheme. Indeed, even though outright fascism is a much bigger concern right now, people have been soberly debating for centuries about what it might mean for "free speech" if there really is no "out in public" anymore, and it's all privately owned.
And this of course leads to the not-at-all-Orwellian notion that "free speech" means something different depending on which country you're in. Accept the sliding scale, and then try to coherently defend why a country like Qatar can't say something like, "Well, sure, we have free speech too. We just have our own version, just like all the various western nations do!".
This is my point. The government already regulates some speech as they should. I'm arguing they should be in charge of regulating it in forums open to the public, such as twitter. trump should have been banned from twitter for hate speech and inciting violence, but the government should have be the ones in forcing it, not the whims of billionaires.
What he is really doing is saying he supports any kind of hate speech when he decides to not ban and unban people for making it. He doesn’t remove that responsibility when he yells about feedom of speech. Twitter is his privately owned company. It’s not a nationalized government ran social media platform.
