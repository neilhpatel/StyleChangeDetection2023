Try spending all day outside and sleeping outside on the ground in your heavy coat in even 50F weather and see how you feel the next day. Then imagine you have to worry about and protect yourself from a bunch of people who want to kill you.
I just want to point out that the winter gear as well as military grade winter tents is more important than I think a lot of people realize. It literally will save lives. It will also make a huge difference of the readiness of the UA, their ability to defend and even attack during the winter.
⚡️The Ukrainian Armed Forces will be ready for war in the winter "much better" than the Russian army, — said US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
"Tell us how many of ours have died!" - a man complaining about the Russian news only talking about successes and never about losses. This intercepted call appears to be between a serving son and his father.
So, my Dad used to be a security guard. This guy we know was bragging about this "super cool night vision binoculars" he got pretty cheap a while back. He gave them to my Dad to mess around with. They can't focus on an object across the room let alone across the yard. The night vision sucks and the IR setting doesn't really work. My Dad can't find a brand name or a model number on them. I told him to give them to me to futz with for a bit. I looked them over real good and well, "I found your problem! MADE IN RUSSIA." 100% piece of shit.

Navalny's not become a symbol of resistance in Russia because he's not different enough from the status quo. Russia's left, such as they are, would never choose him. And we think Morgan Freeman is bad.
