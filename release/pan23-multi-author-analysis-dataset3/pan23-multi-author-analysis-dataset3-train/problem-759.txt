First, we have to define what we mean by Africa. Africa is a huge continent with a lot of different subcultures, which are all different and have all been impacted differently by the United States and its broader culture, as well as African American culture. It's also important to note that not all Africans are Black. However, even amongst Black Africans, the response you'd get on this question would be extremely different if you spoke of African American cultural influence on Liberia than African American cultural influence on Somalia. Many of the African American leaders who supported Pan-Africanism were focused on West Africa, so that's where I'll say we should focus.
The 1970s had relatively little African American involvement compared to the 1960s (which tracks with the time period in which Pan-Africanism was popular).
Coming in late behind u/q203, a different way to come at this question is to look at recirculations of African-American culture in African cultures since the 19th Century. And that's complicated not just because of reasons of scale and scope, as u/q203 notes, but also because you have to separate out three different kinds of influence:
This is a question with a pretty broad scope, so let me preface everything I'm going to say with a few nuances and note that my response will inevitably be contentious and debated.
