The car loans, mortgage, and home improvement loan will have priority on the debt secured by them, with any equity in those objects owned by the estate. If the estate is in overall debt, this means those items will generally default to the bank: each car to the bank owning that specific car loan and house to the mortgage bank.
Should the estate have a negative worth, heirs can likely offer to buy specific property from the bank(s) that they wish to keep. Alternatively, an heir may be able to personally take on or refinance those specific loans to keep the property. In neither case is either legally required, but they are worth knowing about as options.
The life insurance policy is almost always paid to and owned by the beneficiary, and not the estate. This means that money nearly never can be claimed by creditors, though they may try.
Unscrupulous creditors will try to get anyone and everyone to pay up. Do not talk to them except to say "put in a claim with the estate.".
You are not responsible for any debts, unless you agreed to be--such as co-signing a loan. When you say "we have" it very much depends on what is meant by "we." If your name is not on the loan, you are not responsible.
