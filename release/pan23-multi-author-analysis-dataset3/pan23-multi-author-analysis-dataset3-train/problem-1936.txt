Today was yet another pretty quiet day for us with no missile or drone strikes, or at least it was quiet up until now. Just recently an air raid alert was triggered for most of the country, because Iranian drones are in flight right now and we are unsure where they are headed. There are reports saying that at least one Shahed has made it to the Kyiv oblast, so they might be targeting Kyiv again.
Are they really building up to attack North Ukraine again? An area that since they were chased out has been fortified. Also, do they think the Ukrainians who mounted parallel offensives in Kharkiv and Kherson, then Luhansk/Kherson cannot multitask?
Not now, maybe after 2 or 3 big failed offensives with 2 or 3 hundreds of thousands dead while Ukraine would be closer and closer to Crimea. It's surprising how apathetic Russians are to their own lives, even people who's not supporting Putin much. They are like, lets finish what we've started or we'll be cowards, shhh. So there is still little of war exhaustion in Russia, even if the war ends in 2023, there'll be a second half soon, until Russin economy is dead or Ukraine's part of NATO.
I'm not sure of the statistical amounts to operate a line the size of what we are seeing in Ukraine, but if every kia of a Russian, included 3 more injured in this war, I'm sure it would of collapsed by now.
I have the feeling you are correct about this, I'd imagine the toll on the Ukrainian side to be relatively high in "survived but injured" category, after watching many shows on field hospitals within Ukraine not too far away from the Frontlines.
So therefore I think the dead tally is accurate of the Russians, it's just the ratio of the wounded that die is far higher then what we expect to see from modern day statics.
