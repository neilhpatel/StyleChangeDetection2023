Looking at actual data, India has been creating new tiger reserves over the years and has about 50 protected tiger reserves today. The country has been seeing net positive increases in forest cover year over year, although they are small increases. But that is an incredible achievement by itself given the human population growth you are quoting. Their tiger conservation efforts have been solid and the results are impressive. They have also done a great job with Rhino conservation and have a growing Asiatic lion population.
India's conservation efforts have been great since 1973, with an average tiger population growth rate of 6% per annum. Give credit where it's due.
Meh, please be critical of us where we merit it. As long as it's objective criticism, and not just because India's priorities aren't the same as whatever country you're from (whether that be in the west, China, Russia or otherwise), criticism is useful.
Just because some douchebags run to harass you when you criticize India doesn't mean all of us are like that,constant criticism is absolutely necessary,it draws attention towards bad sides and encourages people to work on them.
