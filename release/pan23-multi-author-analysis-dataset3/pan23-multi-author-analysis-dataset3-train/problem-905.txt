There is so much confusion in the comments based on OP having conflated these two issues of rent charges and utility billing.
Honestly it sounds like they sent you the wrong bill, given that the rent jumped with no notice and the billing period changed.
Your “rent” due could actually be next months rent and last month utilities (and these could be on a lag due to utility billing cycles). We’re now in heating season, and heat can cost a lot. So the landlord is now passing that on to the tenants.
But, it sounds like the landlord utterly failed at explaining this. Read your lease carefully, it should state that this system is in place.
Read your lease. If you're on a month-to-month lease, they can raise your rent at the end of your lease period so long as they comply with state laws regarding increase amounts and notice periods.
If it doesn’t and it just says you have a fixed rent amount, or you don’t have a written lease, than the standard 30 day stuff should apply. Then your landlord is an idiot.
