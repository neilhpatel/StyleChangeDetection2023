You are correct. The landlord can't raise the rent until your term is complete. Based on the current situation, I assume you're moving out at the end of the term, so I would let him know in writing (with statute referenced) that this rent increase is unlawful, that you'll be paying $1700 for the remainder of the term, and that you'll be out on the last day of the lease.
If, however, you have overstayed your original lease and now you are a "month-to-month" tenant, then it may indeed be lawful to change the rent on a monthly basis.
As a clarification, you are not currently behind on the rent, right? They can’t change the rent, as everyone has pointed out, but lots of landlords are putting tenants that have gotten behind on payment plans. Perhaps they are confused and think you are behind?
Had to ask since you used the term “rent” moratorium rather than “eviction” moratorium. Obviously you still have to pay rent, you just can’t get evicted if you fall behind.
As someone’s who’s prior landlord tried this same exact thing no they can’t raise your rent until your term ends. They tried to tell us they had been undercharging us the entire 3 years we lived there but I had several copies of our lease showing exactly how much we were to pay. Only rebuttal was oh yeah, I meant to have y’all sign a new lease. Literally months before our term was ending.
