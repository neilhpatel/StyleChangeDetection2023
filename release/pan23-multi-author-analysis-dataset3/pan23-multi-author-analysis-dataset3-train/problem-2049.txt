Possibly! They will likely attempt to defend their use as “fair use,” a term you’ve no doubt heard of. It’s not clear that all of those sides would be considered fair use.
I think the first video is most likely not fair use. It steals your highly original work in the entirety without contributing anything to it, all for commercial gain. The other two videos either transform the work, criticize it, or only take parts of it. These may or may not be fair use.
That being said, you should reach out to a copyright lawyer if you think the YouTuber has made enough money off this to justify a lawsuit that will probably cost several thousand dollars. You could also attempt a DIY by sending a DMCA, demanding a take down, and offering to license the content back to the YouTuber for a price.
A copyright lawsuit is probably very expensive because there are a lot of facts to be litigated and the adversary will defend as fair use.
It’s worth consulting with a copyright attorney to get some questions answered and spending some time figuring out what you want to happen.
Unless you registered the copyright, probably not worth suing. If you had a registered copyright, you could claim you legal costs, often much higher than what you would get awarded. If you just have a copyright, it would probably cost you way more than what you would get.
Unless you’ve filed for copyright before the infringements you’re not going to get statutory damages. Which means you’re only going to get actual damages, which are essentially none.
