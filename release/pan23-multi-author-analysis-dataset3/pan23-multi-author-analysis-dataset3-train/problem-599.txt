Would that not show neglect to enforce the safety of their guests by adequately patrolling a known area where homeless are people have been known to trespass?
The hotel isn't under any obligation to kick people out for being homeless, or to patrol their grounds to identify people who may be trespassing. Since there's no duty, there's no negligence, either.
This fundamentally comes down to whether the hotel has any obligation to prevent an altercation. They don't, by and large, and even if they did, you would share some responsibility when you agreed to go back and confront someone after they were aggressive with you the first time.
I understand that the bills for this injury are unreasonable and unfair, and that the hotel has money but the actual perpetrator does not, but you're almost certainly going to take this on the insurance. You can try talking to a personal injury attorney about it, and a letter from a lawyer might convince the hotel's insurance to settle just to make you go away, but that's a long shot.
Hotels often do those things, because it's a significant customer service issue and because altercations on their property can drive up their insurance premiums, but not because they're legally obligated to protect you from the public.
While your version of the subsequent events do suggest that he is probably liable for your injury, recovering anything from a homeless person is pretty unlikely.
