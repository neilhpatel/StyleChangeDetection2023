His first month in office Trump sent out a special forces raid that ultimately ended up in people getting killed. It was a shitty plan for not a lot of reward during the Obama administration so they didn't do it. But thay didn't stop Trump who wanted to perform a military action because he could. When the wife of the dead special forces operator asked to not make her husband's death political, Trump used her husband's death for politics.
He wanted a giant ass military parade to fuel his ego and his one stipulation was "no wounded soldiers or vets".
When Trump visited Japan, the us navy had to put a giant tarp over the USS McCain because apparently seeing his name would send Trump into a fit.
When visiting France during the ww1 ceremony. Legit confused why people would sign up and that they were all losers and suckers.
It’s the amount of people who believed that vets were: “suckers and losers”. Including vets who saw crazy shit and then went to say: “I am a sucker who can o get back at everyone?” That’s the real shame and the entire: “grab them by the pussy.” Explaining how much of the us, women too thought was perfectly fine.
