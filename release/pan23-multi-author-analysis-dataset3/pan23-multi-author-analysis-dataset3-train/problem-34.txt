Just by being athletic, their bodies can stop or even never start their periods. Low body percentage will usually do it. Seems like such a bad thing to track because there will likely be triggering false alarms about potential pregnancy.
Yep! I am one of those women. I get migraines during my placebo week and my periods make my Crohn's symptoms much worse (edit: so I skip my placebo week per my doctors). We have slowly brought my migraine frequency down with other meds (and a root canal helped). I'm just gonna have to deal with the Crohn's symptoms eventually since I have a history of blood clots in my family (including two autoimmune diseases that cause blood clots).
Today's world is both better and worse. Better because more kids realize there are other options truths and get validation from seeing amazing people on social media sharing their true selves. Worse due to people like the governor in Florida.
CLAIM: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is requiring all female student-athletes in the state to provide detailed information about their periods in order to compete in organized sports.
The athletic association’s current Preparticipation Physical Evaluation Form, which must be completed by a student and their physician and kept on file at their school, asks female athletes five questions about their periods, but they’re all listed as optional.
"Robert Sefcik, a member of the sports medicine advisory committee, said making the menstrual cycle questions mandatory rather than optional is consistent with national guidelines for sports physicals developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Sports Medicine and other groups.".
