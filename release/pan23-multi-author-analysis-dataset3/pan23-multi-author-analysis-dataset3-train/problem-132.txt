You should have a lawyer look over this situation. She can’t be the sole legal owner if she owes other people a share of the home’s sale value. Generally, will provisions like “I bequeath X to you, unless you attempt to sell it” aren’t enforceable. In most cases, the courts would just rule that your aunt owns the home outright.
None of this will affect your mom’s life estate, but there’s a chance those provisions promising her 1/3 of the sale price aren’t enforceable. Your aunt may know this and that might be why she’s trying to get your mom to agree to give up her life estate.
The term used for your mother's ability to live in the house until she dies is called a "life estate". You need to consult a probate attorney to find out what happens with the home after mother dies and see whose name is shown on title to the home right now.
Your aunt was the executor of the estate but if that probate estate case has been closed, she is no longer the executor.
Your attorney may have to send a well worded letter to your aunt informing her that she cannot sell the house until certain events occur.
Collect all the documents you can, including but not limited to the last will that was probated and a copy of the deed that was recorded before and after the last will was probated.
Do this before your aunt enters into a contract with a third party who will believe your aunt has the legal right to sell.
A probate lawyer if the aunt takes any steps to sell the house. In the meantime, your mother would be reasonable to insist on all communications occurring in writing.
