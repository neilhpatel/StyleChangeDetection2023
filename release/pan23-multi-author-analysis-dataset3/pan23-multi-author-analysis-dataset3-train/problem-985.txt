No true Scotsman. Since I can remember, any time a republican has lost an election, it’s because that Republican wasn’t “a real conservative” according to the rabid base. And so every election, someone dumber and crazier runs. I figured BoBo the Clown and Marge were the zenith .... I’m not sure why I assumed that but I did .... and now, just like the rest of the trash before them, they’re being tossed out by their base for not instituting christofascism fast enough. Typical.

AKA, "I am now conditionally super mad about this since two months later, it doesn't help me anymore I will be a strong supporter of it in a few hours though if it suits my needs! 🤪🤪🤪".
The man literally hasn't even finished screaming about Trailer Queen lying to his followers, when he pauses to express his relief at not having to lie to his followers anymore. He will be pro-adultery in 1/2 hr if it gets him money and status. The consistency is the ego.
