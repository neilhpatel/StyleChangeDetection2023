First off patriot missiles isn't the answer to entrenchment/mines or whatever, it's to shore up Ukraine's defenses against Russia's missile barrages. Instead tanks are how you spearhead an attack and break-through, which is also what NATO is sending more of in preparation to the end of muddy season.
Secondly Ukraine has already proven they can take back territory even with what they have now, and that will only improve while what Russia has will only get worse through attrition.
6% is a fucking massive chunk of Ukraine's territory... Drop it in Pervomaisk, and the entirety of Ukrainian held SW Ukraine is safe, because to get beyond it, you'd have to go through it. Don't need to protect Uman from drone attacks out of Crimea, if the drones can't get there in the first place... Drop the second gifted battery in Dnipro, and all of eastern Ukraine is now covered. You don't need to protect every square inch of Ukraine to provide credible air defense cover to every square inch... unless you think Russia has a teleporter that can send drones right into the middle of Ukraine where there's no air defense systems that is...
And yes, their personnel need to be trained, particularly the fire control and launcher teams, so that they know what they're looking at on radar and fire at what they're supposed to, so that they don't look like dumbasses akin to how the fire control team aboard the Moskva looks.
