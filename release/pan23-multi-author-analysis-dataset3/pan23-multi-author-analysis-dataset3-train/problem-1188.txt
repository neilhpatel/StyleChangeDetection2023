Assuming you can get into college, at least a good state school, your high school GPA has absolutely nothing to do with your prospects for graduate school, which is generally speaking the avenue most people take to get into history professionally. Do not under any circumstances get a history PhD — there is no job market for PhDs — but with a masters you can do many history and history-adjacent jobs.
Most people become historians by completing graduate programs, and these have their own requirements. My school required a good score on the Graduate Readiness exam, a GPA of 3.5 or higher, letters of recommendation, and a Statement of Purpose. First year aside, I was able to get pretty good grades, and I got a smoking score on my GRE, had good letters of recommendation too. WRT a statement of purpose, it's a good idea to know what you want you want to study at each place you apply for grad school, and, crucially, which historians there you want to work with.
A lot of universities aren't terribly selective, but can still get you on the path to a solid 4 year degree. Even if for whatever reason a straight to university path is off the table, getting an associates as a community college then transferring to a university for your 4 year degree is an economical and not too difficult approach. Right now I'm an MA candidate with funding; I got into university with a similar GPA to you, flunked out after one year, attended a community college until I got my associates, transferred back to university, and completed my degree two years later.
