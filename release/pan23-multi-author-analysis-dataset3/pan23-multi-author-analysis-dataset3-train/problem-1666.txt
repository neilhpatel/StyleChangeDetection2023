It's because these people let tribalism dominate. I have a Shiite friend from Bangladesh. His whole family in Canada (except him) supports Ayatollah Khamanei and goes to a mosque that secretly preaches anti-semitism. They think criticism against Iran is fake and that Jews are evil.
Russia dangling its nukes again. What's their end game really? There seems to be none other than defeat or nukes unless somebody offs Putin and end this nightmare.
Putin really wants to use a nuke in Ukraine...like so bad they whip up one of these scenarios once a month that would "explain away" a nuclear explosion on Ukrainian soil.
If there was a second nuke after that, I believe it's possible the Russian nuke missiles sites would be nuked, along with every major oil refinery and transport depot.
So is Russia deliberately shelling themselves at the nuclear plant as a “human shield deterrent” or are they shelling themselves by accident because they are using a lot of shitty rockets?
The human shield deterrent and malfunctioning rocket reasoning that u/10millionX stated as reasons for Russia “shelling the nuclear power plant they control” makes no sense and I stated my case.
If OP’s argument that malfunctioning Russian rocket artillery is the reason Russia is shelling themselves at the nuclear plant makes sense to you then okay to each their own.
Ukraine shelling the area around the nuclear power plant because they’re fighting a war and weakening Russian military assets/positions is a key aspect of war.
Next you say that the artillery Russia is firing are unguided artillery rockets fired from within the area of the nuclear plant … which all just happen to have malfunctioned and fall very close by in the same area they were fired from. Hmmm.
