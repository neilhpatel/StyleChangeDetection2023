I commented to support your other comment, but ok. What is the myth? That people in the US are getting paid more? .
. That's pre-tax so that means taxes and Medicare premiums will be deducted from that amount. One can live off that in some states, but in more expensive states that's poverty.
That's not how it will work. It's people in their mid 50s that will be affected as it won't be phased in until 2030 (assuming it passes in its current form).
The real retiring age is more 67 since it's at that age that your job can force you to retire even if you haven't all your trimester.
That is true, but if you retire early, you receive a reduced amount compared to retiring at retirement age.
Raising the age kind of forces people to work longer to get their full retirement when they could have received full benefits at an earlier age, but the age was raised.
So basically moving retirement age to 64 is mostly impacting people who started working early... So most likely poorer people who couldn't afford to achieve higher education.
