No, haven't reached out to them. I think my plan right now is to walk over and talk to the guy and tell him (in as pleasant and polite a manner as possible) that he's SOL. This event is a result of an act of god, not negligence, and I'm not responsible. Hopefully it dies on the vine with that. If he chooses to proceed with a small claims action, at that point I'll likely involve a lawyer and notify homeowners insurance of the proceedings.
The other tree work was pruning, not removal, and done to trees 50-100+ feet away and on the other side of the house so unlikely that had any influence, but not sure on that one...fair point.
If not, he could also consider hiring an arborist to make documented remarks on the tree before the entirety of it is torn down and hauled away. Or get good photographs of it. Or maybe it's gone, but these would be time sensitive concerns as well.
Was the tree specifically inspected? In a way that the arborist would legally stand behind saying the tree is fine? Or...
