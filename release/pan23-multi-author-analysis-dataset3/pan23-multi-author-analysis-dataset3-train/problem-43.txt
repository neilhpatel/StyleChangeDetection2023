AZ does have a couple of specific "Exotic Bird Rescues" which could assist you with this problem, there unfortunately are not any state resources to help with this issue.
You'll have to investigate the exotic bird rescue individuals, as I cannot make any recommendations for AZ. They will care for the bird until it gets adopted. If they are unable to, or if you ask for a reference, they may be able to steer you to a more permanent care facility like a bird sanctuary.
If you have already taken possession of the bird then you should take the advice regarding surrendering your pet to a sanctuary.
Do not donate the bird to a wild life sanctuary if the bird is not wild and has lived as a pet its entire life. Such an abrupt change to its lifestyle will likely be very unhealthy and risky to its health. Especially if it was captive bred. Consult a domesticated parrot expert on how to proceed.
A parrot sanctuary would be better equipped to place the bird than the Humane Society, which mostly deals with dogs and cats. A lot of people want a large, expensive parrot like a macaw, but many of them won't be equipped to give it a good life and would be likely to put it in a small cage without proper mental stimulation or give it up again after a short period of frustration. A parrot sanctuary will be able to properly vet people who want the bird, I recommend asking on r/parrots to find a reputable one in your area.
