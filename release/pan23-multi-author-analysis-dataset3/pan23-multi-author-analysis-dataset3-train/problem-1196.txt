Former CPS worker in MI here. They did the right thing by calling. Should things escalate for your partner work-wise, consult an attorney. Private or public and regardless of religious sect, it doesn't matter; teachers are MANDATED to report abuse.
Does the school have an officially policy about reporting abuse or neglect? This seems like a lot of people at the school messed up by not reporting and are only going to draw more attention to that if they retaliate.
Since this is a private religious school I’m assuming that it’s not part of a school corporation. If it is I would talk to officials at the school corporation. They can also reach out to the states department of education to see if there are options or resources. And possibly a teachers union if they are a member.
Social work student here. Came to say this, I would be very interested to hear the school discuss how they weren’t required to report the abuse. The only illegal thing here is on the school and all the teachers who tried to repress reporting!
