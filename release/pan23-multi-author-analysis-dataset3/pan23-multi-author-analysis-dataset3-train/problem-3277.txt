Essentially they can surely request this item but you're under no obligation to forfeit ownership and give it to them.
Now if you even still possess this item and you're not using it, you could option the opportunity to sell it to them. But it will be wholly YOUR discretion what if anything happens next.
Just as u/SendLGaM mentioned, It's far beyond the statute of limitations. So unless the purchase contract stipulated item or item(s) could later be picked up, they have no claim to it.
There could be other terms for such defined in your sales contract though and you should reference that if you're really concerned here.
Even if it was in the contract that they were supposed to take it, once you signed the settlement documents, the house and it’s contents (and problems) are yours. That’s why Realtors suggest a walkthrough the day of settlement, to make sure there aren’t any oddities (from the seller’s perspective) as most things are done after you sign the dotted line.
I think the sellers would be hard pressed to force you to turn it over even if you closed yesterday.
