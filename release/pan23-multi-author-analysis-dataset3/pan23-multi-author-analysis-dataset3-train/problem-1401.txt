Thank you for your reply. According the the copy of the Deed I have, it's labelled only as access easement and specifically mentions the driveway. I will most assuredly be contacting a lawyer as you suggested.
Good point about the Adverse Possession. Their paved driveway is 20+ years old and theoretically it should revert back from non-use, I just looked and Virginias A.P. Laws are based on a 15 year span. Interesting route to discuss with the Lawyer I just made an appointment with. They probably won't Lawyer up but instead show up in person without one and help me win my case. Thank you again for the advice, it's appreciated.
Thank you for your response. Directly from the Deed, it states "The property is conveyed together with a right of way for ingress and egress over existing driveway to State Route ..." There is no longer an existing driveway to their property from mine, just a yard. They have a paved driveway on their land for ingress and egress.
Now that they have a driveway you may get it removed. But your not gonna be able to navigate that shit without a lawyer.
Does it give them access. I mean technically sure if they are using it for access. Without seeing the easement how its written, what it stipulates, and if there is an expiration date on it.
