Your first mistake was moving to Florida. Anyway. From what little I know about CDDs the board of directors are elected by the residents and CDD meetings, records, etc must be publicly accessible under the Florida Sunshine laws.
As you've already seen, the police are unwilling or unable to help. What have you done in the last three years to influence the CDD? If, as you say, this problem affects all residents and the CDD has taken no action, what is stopping you all from electing a different board of directors?
Regardless, you and your fellow residents really should talk to a lawyer and see if you can sue the CDD or perhaps the trespassers. You should also record any instances where they break laws - trespassing, vandalism, spitting in people's faces would qualify - and keep reporting these to the police, as well as try to petition local government to direct the police to take action.
Who are the landowners? The developers or the residents? From what I know initially CDDs start off being managed by the landowners but after a few years they need to cede management to the residents of the community.
From what I understand we get control of the CDD once the residents make up a greater percentage than the developers so it's going to be a few more years.
