Hi there - lecturer in Latin literature, historian of 4-5th century AD, and have taught both Classical and early medieval history so have a fairly good background for this one. To take your questions one at a time:
I understand that French and Spanish both developed from Vulgar Latin, but even though I don't speak either language, how is it that I can tell the languages apart, just by looking at the writing.
From that example that you gave me, in Latin, Old French and French, I can see the French in the last one, but the middle one looks more similar to Latin.
How close today's Romance languages are to Vulgar Latin, including the minor languages such as Catalan and Sardinian:
Most modern romance languages, are analytic languages (like English), where meaning is mostly conveyed by word order and prepositions. So when saying "The poet gives a rose to the girl", "The girl gives a rose to the poet", and "The rose gives a poet to the girl"; changing word order completely changes the meaning of the sentence.
So, "The poet gives a rose to the girl" could be, in Latin, "Poeta rosam puellae dat"; or "Puellae rosam poeta dat"; or even "Rosam poeta puellae dat"; where changing word order doesn't, in any sense, change meaning, since it's conveyed by "word form", the "cases", morphology.
