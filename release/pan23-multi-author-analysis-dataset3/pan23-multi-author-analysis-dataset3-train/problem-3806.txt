This was Jordan Peterson’s whole point on Russia that many found problematic but I fully agreed with.
There’s no good situation that ends with Putin out of power without heavy, heavy involvement from NATO within Russia. Putin for all his atrocities is still one of the friendlier Russian leaders of the last 100 years to the west (the bar is that low for the Communists), but say he’s gone, what’s next?
This is why replacing Putin while the conflict is ongoing is a nightmare scenario, for Russian politics Putin is a level headed leader, he's not an imbecile. He won't gamble nuclear hellfire to seize 20% of Ukraine.
Putin aint gonna make the call to the pilots himself, that yoooo, take this bomber and go nuke Ukraine. He needs someome that he can trust 100% on this and if the person(s) won't deliver, he is gone.
The people near him and the people in the chain of command to deploy and strike a nuclear warhead need to be all on the same page with him. If he miscalculates this even this internally, he has lost.
