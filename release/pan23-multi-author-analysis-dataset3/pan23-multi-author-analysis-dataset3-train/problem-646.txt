So it's better if the us warships visit the bosphorus without crossing. They can, if they want to, but they really shouldn't.
Since the us has nothing to do other than show of force in the black sea, pushing the issue and sending their ships through the bosphorus would gain them nothing positive. However it would give russia the excuse they need and make it difficult if not impossible to justify sending russian warships away.
The point of my comment was that if the US tried to get legalistic in attempting to cross warships into the Black Sea, Russia could try the same regardless of the argument's merits. They both should absolutely be denied.
Technically nobody’s at war, so Russia could argue the same thing. Declaring war just isn’t done anymore. That being said, the US is definitely an ally of Ukraine.
The world -including Turkey- recognizes russia and ukraine are at war. This results in the same effect, regardless of if russia views it as a war or not. In fact since ukraine, a fighting party, has outright called it war with evidence to prove it is, that means russia is at war.
