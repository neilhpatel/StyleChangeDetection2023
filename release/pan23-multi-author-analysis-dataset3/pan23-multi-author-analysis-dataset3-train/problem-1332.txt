-Istanbul, the [edit: cultural] capital of a nation that invented modern genocide, has made the teaching of that genocide illegal, currently supports ethnic cleansing in Artsakh, and is actively suppressing indigenous Kurdish language and culture;.
Yeah the West Bank is much more reasonable. They do still execute gay people, but that’s more community-driven and extralegal. There are entire organizations devoted to assisting gay Palestinians in escaping the West Bank to Israel because they fear for their lives.
If anyone is curious why Israelis are not allowed in it’s because they get lynched when they go there, as opposed to tens of thousands of Gazans who work in Israel legally.
The facts are, Israel kills more Palestinians, engages in more oppression, and steals more property.
Lol, organizations which could not exist (openly) in palestine, except the ones that are just pro-palestinian.
Perhaps underground they might exist, that's why I said they can't exist openly, except for the ones that are just pro-Palestinian. But even among those, there are factions that go after each other.
