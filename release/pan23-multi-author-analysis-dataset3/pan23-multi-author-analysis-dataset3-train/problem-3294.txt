How is drinking an energy drink with 180mg of caffeine any worse than drinking a cup of coffee with 120mg of caffeine? Some coffee drinks from Starbucks have almost 500mg of caffeineâ€¦ Are they gonna be banned too?
Now did you know that a plain 20oz cup of Starbucks black coffee has over 300mg caffeine, compared to most energy drinks at only 150mg caffeine?
There are quite a few issues with coffeeine in general and energy drinks in particular, I think it's important to talk about these. It is certainly an issue especially when kids overdo it. But addiction is not one of those issues, and it's important to point that out.
Additionally, it tends to make actual addition look much, much easier to fix than it is. Pretty much everybody can simply stop coffee. Pretty much everybody can absolutely not simply stop using crack cocaine. Which doesn't build physical dependence but massively fucks over your entire reward system, in some cases permanently.
Issue isn't regular consumption. Nobody is harmed by an occasional energy drink, including kids. The issue is, that due to taste and marketing, energy drinks promote massive overconsumption. And _that_ causes problems. Not only from the caffeeine but also from the ridiculous amounts of sugar in there.
No one drinks espresso by liters, surely. But per ounce of ground coffee going in, espresso has less caffeine in the resulting drink than other brewing methods.
Espresso has very low caffeine content and also is very acquired taste, kids don't drink it (and with the coffee-based drinks from Starbucks containing 1/4 of your daily calories the problem lies elsewhere. But that's a different topic).
