Congress shouldn't have to clarify that a broad power is supposed to be broad. That's entirely backwards thinking. Passing such a law is clarification in itself.
It “seems problematic” to enact a fucking law? Because it’s 20 years old??? That’s nothing in legal terms.
I wouldn’t think so since the PPP loans were passed by Congress, and you don’t have legal standing to sue if you can’t show financial harm (though that’s not stopping the SC here).
I mean if they have no standing because the loan companies aren’t suing, then unless the loan companies sue (which they won’t), there’s not really much coming back for a second attempt.
That is indeed correct, however generally speaking if something is unconstitutional there’s a pretty good chance that some person or entity is being harmed or can make an adequate argument of harm.
Bingo. And the companies know for a fact that a huge portion of these loans are going to go directly into default or forbearance once payments restart. If the forgiveness plan goes through then they’re guaranteed $400 billion over 30 years. If it doesn’t, they’re almost guaranteed to make far less.
It’s really not even that deep. Biden’s student loan plan isn’t an alternative to fixing the system. That was never even on the table and would have to be done by congress. This is just the plain business calculus of taking a guaranteed payout from the government vs hoping millions of borrowers will keep making payments. Any company would take the payout.
