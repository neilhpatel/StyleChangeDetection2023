That could easily put you in a difficult position, as he can always threaten to report your tax evasion and take you down with him if you report him for other issues, such as improper dispensing or a workplace injury.
There is no legal arrangement to receive less than minimum wage or to avoid paying taxes on your income. What this employer is offering is that you collude with him in tax evasion, on the premise that he can spend less money than he is required to while you get to keep more of your income than you're legally allowed to.
Even if your employer isn't properly running its books, you need to properly account for taxes or you risk being charged criminally with tax fraud. Do not put yourself in that kind of jeopardy.
The pharmacy must also pay you at least the state minimum wage, whether 'under the table' or not (unless you're exempted from the min wage laws for some reason, such as "you receive a salary in excess of the minimum required under law.").
Bluntly, this seems like a really bad "opportunity" for you to be taken advantage of. I'm also not sure whether this sort of arrangement could affect (negatively) the pharmacy's licensing or your own.
