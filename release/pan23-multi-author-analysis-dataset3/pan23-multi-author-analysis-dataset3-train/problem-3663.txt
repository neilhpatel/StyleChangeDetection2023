Shooting down foreign spy balloons is standard policy and a violation of our airspace. Not to mention that China has no ability to fight a world war. The international community would NOT view this as an attempt to start ww3. China has basically no worthy military partners. This would go absolute nowhere.
“Violating prohibited airspace established for national security purposes may result in military interception and/or the possibility of an attack upon the violating aircraft, or if this is avoided then large fines and jail time are often incurred. Aircraft violating or about to violate prohibited airspace are often warned beforehand on 121.5 MHz, the emergency frequency for aircraft.”.
seems like the FAA has pretty clearly defined prohibited airspace… but hey at least you tried, right?
As for flying over an air force facility, was that a published MOA or NSA restricted airspace? And what altitudes are restricted?
Not all of CONUS airspace is controlled at the same level at all altitudes. Some areas or zones that are restricted at lower categories (ie control zones around civil airports) may be open at higher altitudes for passenger routes, etc. Some areas that may have higher altitude restrictions may not have those same restrictions lower.
