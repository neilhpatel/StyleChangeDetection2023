Work Defence (Planes) but have been working with the Ukraine lot. She is a tremendous pain and frankly I have no idea how the flying fuck she got to where she is.
I respected that during the deplorable Tory PM shuffling fiasco he basically said he wanted no part in it and was busy. Good lad.
Ben Wallace is a good lad. Even before the Russian invasion, he was manning the wall demanding rearmament and British allies to prepare for battle.
Protect the logistics from attack by the enemy (russia has had this problem since HIMARS arrived, for example).
In short, it takes time to deliver on logistics. USA has been working on it for decades. Ukraine has had less than a decade to prepare. As the supply chain matures in Ukraine it will naturally support heavier and more complex combat systems. I believe that as soon as the logistics support (a combat thing) Ukraine will have it.
The US basically had to face the same equipment in Iraq that Ukraine currently has to face. The US made sure to upgrade their vehicles based on what they learned there. This is what they're sending to Ukraine.
Fast forward through nearly 1 year of Russia's invasion on Ukraine. Now, security think-tanks are seriously discussion how the war could end with Russia falling apart, given how its military has proven to be significantly weaker than anyone ever thought, whilst the naked aggressiveness of the Russian state and the atrocities planned and committed by the Russian state makes its dissolution more desirable and palpable to more people.
In reality, one year ago, the destruction of Russia was generally not even considered as everyone "knew" Russia's military was too powerful for that to be possible, and Russia's dissolution was far from desirable given the security nightmare that would ensure over its nuclear arsenal.
