It’s often said that machine guns are banned in the United States, but that’s not exactly right. More than 700,000 of these fully automatic weapons are in the United States outside of the military, entirely legally. Most are owned by federal, state or local agencies, but perhaps several hundred thousand are in private hands. With a background check and permission, members of the public can buy an Uzi submachine gun or a mounted .50-caliber machine gun made before 1986 — even a grenade launcher, howitzer or mortar.”.
“There is one highly successful example of this harm reduction approach already in place: machine guns.
The goal is to lessen the amount of guns and to lessen the total violence inflicted when it happens.
It’s telling that you decided to limit it to mass shootings. Let’s talk about what the .50 sniper rifle is being used by: Mexican Cartels.
They are getting their guns from somewhere. They aren’t building them in a tooling shop. So either they are stealing them, (which means someone failed to properly secure their weapons in a safe,) or they are being sold them by some “law abiding citizen” willing to sell guns in private sale to crooks.
You make a real genuine effort to find and punish people who own or sell unregistered weaponry, unlike our current system of throwing our hands in the air and saying “oh well, I guess there is nothing we can do about it.”.
