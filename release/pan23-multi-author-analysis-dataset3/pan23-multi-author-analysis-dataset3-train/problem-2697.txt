The US was allied with the Kurds for years, then Trump pulled our troops out and abandoned them to be slaughtered by Erdogan.
These were allies that sheltered, and fought with and died alongside US soldiers throughout the wars in the Middle East. We explicitly pulled out to let Turkey attack the Kurds without risking collateral damage to US forces.
I think the US told Turkey not to attack the Western Kurdistan so he is asking Russia to do it instead possibly for some concessions like maybe helping Iran with their Kurds or something else equally shitty.
The reduced support has resulted in the Kurds being in contact with both the Russians and the Americans. The Kurds have already given up some land in Northern Syria to the Assad regime to create a buffer zone in some regions between Turkish backed forces and themselves, essentially being forced to turn to Russia/Assad.
Why doesn't Putin give the green light? Assad and Russia don't want turkey controlling anymore land in Syria and are pushing for the Kurds to accept a negotiated settlement with Assad.
Erdogan is mad at Russia because they didn't "clear" Kurdish forces from northern Syria, which was part of a deal they made. Now Erdogan is threatening to invade northern Syria himself because of a bombing that happened in Istanbul. Good luck with that, Erdogan.
