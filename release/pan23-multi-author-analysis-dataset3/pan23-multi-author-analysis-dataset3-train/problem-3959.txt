A pan-Indian identity typically emerged as a direct response to settler colonialism. The first instance of indigenous peoples promoting a language of racial solidarity among indigenous groups was during the Natchez Revolt in 1729. Nancy Shoemaker identifies this as the moment when indigenous peoples in North America began to identify themselves as "red" in contrast to "white" Europeans or enslaved "black" people. The Natchez Revolt occurred as a result of aggressive French incursions onto sacred Theoloël (a.k.a. Natchez) land to use it for tobacco farming. The Theoloël called for allies against the French and used the idea of the "redness" of non-French persons as a rallying cry against settler colonialism.
It seems that an actual color association of "redness" was an idea that emerged from the Natives themselves. It was very much in conversation with the emergent narrative of whiteness/blackness in southern Louisiana, which was a Caribbean-style plantation society. Europeans did not start calling Natives red until they started doing so themselves.
The French previously used the term sauvage, or "wildlings," to refer to the Natives. They understood themselves as racially different from Natives long before establishing Louisiana in 1699. Most Native peoples understood Europeans as foreigners at first, much like other tribes far away from them. It wasn't until after sustained contact with the Europeans that the indigenous groups began to discuss racial solidarity amongst themselves and against Europeans.
Although I am really curious, you mention an indigenous conception of "redness"... was this something internalized and translated from Europeans? Or did they independently reach the same conclusion: That indigenous peoples are "red", in contrast to "white" settlers.
