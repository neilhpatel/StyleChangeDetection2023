I live in Israel. Sometimes I have only a few minutes to run to a bomb shelter but people on Reddit seem to think Israel should let Gaza and the West Bank be? That would mean fearing for my life on a weekly or even daily basis.
Just today people were saying that israel has to just leave the West Bank alone so there will be some peace. Does no one remember what happened when we left Gaza in exchange for peace?
Bruh you're literally responding to a comment asking asking if nobody remembers what happened when Israel left Gaza by... Not remembering that they left Gaza.
Gaza literally elected Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to lead them after Israel pulled everything out.
"In a statement, Hamas, which rejects coexistence with Israel, vowed to "pursue resistance and confront the terrorism and fascism of the new Occupation government".
Palestine invaded, they failed, they lost, they are occupied, instead of signing a peace deal where they will accept Israel's existence and renounce all bogus claims to Israeli land, they insist on fighting an insurgency.
So if they're unwilling to engage in peace deals, and are pursuing violent terrorist attacks as their main interaction, yeah, Israel is going to use whatever strategy they can to stop these attacks.
