Would it have been a better outcome to have say, several dems vote for McCarthy precisely to avoid the situation where he makes concessions to the farther right of his party?
If the handful of people that don't like McCarthy call for a vote of no confidence, what's stopping the D's from just going with it and going back to majority vote on the D candidate?
So basically, if Mccarthy doesn't do what they want and steps out of line, Matt Gaetz will be first in line to cry foul and put up a vote of no confidence.
Basically, the Nut Job Caucus gets to call all the shots. If Mccarthy takes a step out of line, they put up a vote against his speakership, and the circus starts all over again. Donald Trump proves once again that he is still in charge of the Republican party.
"One of the key concessions made by Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy in his bid to be House speaker was to restore the ability of a single member to call for a no-confidence vote in the speaker, a provision he opposed early this week, but one he agreed to on Wednesday to win over the most conservative members of the GOP conference.".
Would it really put it past these wackos to take up an entire session of congress with votes of no confidence just to stall anything meaningful from passing congress?
