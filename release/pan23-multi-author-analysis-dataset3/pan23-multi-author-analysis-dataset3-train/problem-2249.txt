Refuse to pay them. This isn't a "refund" as you didn't take the money. If they deduct it from your pay, that would be illegal, and you can file a wage claim without a lawyer with your local wage and hour enforcement agency or the federal department of labor (depending on what state you are in).
If you file a wage claim and then they fire you, you can sue them for retaliatory wrongful termination.
If they don't fire you but do withhold pay from your paycheck without your consent, file a wage claim immediately. Do not warn your boss first. Firing you in retaliation for a wage claim is illegal; you may be entitled to more compensation than merely the withheld wages.
I would strongly recommend letting your boss go to voicemail from now on (give them a dedicated ring tone to remind yourself), so you have a record of any stunts they try to pull from now on. A famous trick is firing you by phone, but telling the unemployment office that you were fired "with cause" for not showing up for your shift.
