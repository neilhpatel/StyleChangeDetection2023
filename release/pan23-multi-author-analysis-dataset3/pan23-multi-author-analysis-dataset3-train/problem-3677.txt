You know, the government which the appealed minister is a part of, introduced a law last year, according to which doctors are liable to prosecution if the prosecutor's office will deem the cause of abortion insufficient. They can imprisoned for that. Although rape is one of two valid grounds given in the legislation, after the law was passed the doctors live in fear and deny the procedures because they are not willing to risk loss of license and prison term.
So if the trail goes through and evidence appears to show no rape happened then that doctor has broken the law and could go to jail and lose their medical license.
Blame the Christian beliefs of the ruling party (who literally introduced the law that sends doctors to jail for providing safe medical treatment) rather than the doctors.
The conscience clause as you put it doesn't specify say the decision has to be a matter of conscience but of personal choice of the doctor, that choice can be "I'm not risking going to jail over this" they don't technically need to give a reason just that they are not doing it based on the clause that allows them to say no.
The law that allows them to refuse references conscious but doesn't actually require that to be the reason the law essentially states doctors can say no for personal choice reasons. And since saying no guarantees them not going to jail while saying yes may result in them going to jail you can see why no is the default answer.
