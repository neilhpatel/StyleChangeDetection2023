From a medical perspective, China cannot afford to have a full COVID wave even today. They have refused western vaccines and their homemade ones are lacklustre at best. If China will reopen like the rest of the world has done today, their hospitals will buckle like most other nations did in early 2020. Everyone will know someone who fell very sick or died to COVID. In the US, it cost the president his re-election. In China, it could cost Xi his career, legacy, and perhaps even more.
My country (Singapore) maintained a China-style lockdown policy until August 2021. When we reopened society, the COVID wave put pressure on hospitals but fortunately, the death rate was mitigated by near universal vaccination. China will face a similar wave when they reopen but with a subpar vaccine and low uptake among elderly, they will likely see mortality as high as America and Europe at the start of the pandemic.
The only way out I see for China to catch up to western mRNA vaccine tech or to buy western vaccines, then inoculate as many elderly as they can before opening up their society.
Chinese vaccines are not great, and the country has less than 10% of the population with natural immunity.
My country used the chinese vaccine for like 80% of shots. I don't know how effective that was but our lenient (mostly non-existent) lockdown meant that by now everyone has had covid and it really feels like a thing of the past. Their issue is not vaccines, it's their incredibly zealous and authoritarian lockdowns. Everytime I read news about the pandemic in china it feels as if they were stuck in 2020.
Yes, a bit over 2000 total covid related deaths (per million inhabitants) last time I checked. Still better than most other South American countries and better than many European ones. More than half of our entire population lives in the capital city and it's surroundings so people are pretty concentrated.
