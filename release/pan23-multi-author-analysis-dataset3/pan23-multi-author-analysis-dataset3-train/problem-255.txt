Your auto insurance liability may cover the damages. You should notify them right away of the possible claim.
They will definitely find out if they want to. Depends on if their insurance company decides its worth the trouble.
Call your insurance company now and ask how to move forward with this. It might be covered if you have a comprehensive policy (I don't know), but if not, you'll want to know that you need to take care of it yourself.
In NJ, for example, you shouldn't have even been able to leave without the cops being called and a police report being filed. That's just how it works for any accident.
It can go on your record if you tell them about it. It may go on your record if you don't, because if there's legal action against you it will almost certainly show up on a background check. You may be asked to provide insurance information by law enforcement. Depends on your state.
Remember that the gas station very likely has security cameras, and can find your license plate number. You're making things easier on yourself by not trying to run from this.
