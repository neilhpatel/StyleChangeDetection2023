All it will take is a speech along the lines of "they tried to crush us, and they failed" to coax the populace into accepting that their invasion is relying on handouts, and that they shouldn't be ashamed of that because their cause is righteous and the entire goddamn world is out to get them and whatnot.
And the thing about delusions of grandeur is they can absolutely weave their wounded pride into the narrative of justification. And Putin has been doing exactly that, framing them as being under attack from the West.
The Patriot system could be a game-changer for civilians who are being targeted simply as part of Putin's pain strategy. But for the overall war, Ukraine does need more advanced artillery.
The problem for Ukraine is that defence against troops takes the weapons out of the battle, whereas defence from missiles only takes the projectiles out. To take out missile threat means to strike inside Russia which the west has been reluctant to support.
no, it wont be a no fly zone because russia can still launch rockets from inside of their own border. A no fly zone would require Ukraine to destroy all AA inside of russia that can reach Ukraine as well preventing anything from flying into Ukraine such as cruise missiles and drones.
