You selected courses only for semester 1 and then didn't show up. Them asking you to pay for 8 semesters is absurd.
No, the OP says his dad confirmed with the college that they want payment for eight semesters of learnin'.
No, the OP says his father called the university who confirmed he owes for eight semesters. Unless the scammers gave Dad a fake phone number to call the university, this sounds like the university is alleging he owes the money.
This sounds very scammy, possibly like the first semester's debt got sold to a collection agency, who's acting in some very bad ways. (To note: debts can be sold from one agency to the other, sometimes filtering down to bottom-feeding agencies who pull scams.).
Same. Foreign students have to go through a lot of extra paperwork, have very specific reporting requirements, and the school would be keeping very close tabs on who does/doesnâ€™t show up.
Lastly, as a foreign student, you would have needed to submit your visa info to even be there, and you would have done a lot of extra paperwork. While UK citizens are welcome on a ESTA in the US, to be a student, you need a student visa.
