Look, if it came down to it, I hope you're right - but not for nothing, this comment sounds an awful lot like the opinion Russia had right before invading Ukraine.
I said it before the Ukraine invasion; the only way to prevent an invasion is to have western troops in the threatened country.
Yeah, to really invade Moldova from the black sea, the only real option unless they want to go through the air, they'll have to do a big push in southern Ukraine. They'd have to re-conquer Cherson and Mykolaiv, then push on towards Odesa. If they are able to do that, they would be able to take the now cut of part of Ukraine that's "between" Moldova and Romania.
I mean, Moldova is just Romania's split sibling. They could try but I can see that a LOT of romanians could volunteer for Moldova.
You could tell me all you want that not the majority of russians are like that but it's hard for me to accept russians as civilised while they have such a rich history...
Even Ceausescu, the former communist leader of Romania hated Russia lmao, there was a myth in my country that Russia tried to invade Communist Romania and we retaliated with lazers that melt their tanks lmao.
Romania has a deep hatred for anything russian, my grandmother told me that under russian occupation in the moldavian area they starved while the soldiers stole their food and my grandfather's sister was executed by a russian soldier by a nearby river where they washed the clothes cause she resisted the rape.
