A little bit problematic since that leads to different sources for different countries which might use different methods to determine it. For example searching for "stipendio media italia 2022" in google in my case leads to the 1700 € you mentioned earlier. Searching for "average monthly salary italy 2022" leads to different significantly higher results (3720 €). It is difficult to directly compare those numbers from different sources without knowing and considering how they came up with them. Are they before or after taxes? How are various benefits provided by the government taken into account? Which of those benefits does a certain country even offer?
But the governments of said countries have more resources to help them out. I lived in a town of less than 500p people. The mayor was a friend of mine. He was required to take in a number of refugees based on the population of the town, provide them housing and find them paying jobs. Among them was a group of 6 men from Afghanistan. None spoke Italian or English, and they had proven they could not be around women as they had acted inappropriately with women from city hall and any Italian teachers they tried to find for them. Then there is the fact that in this town of not even 5000 there were quite a few Italians who were unemployed, but the mayor had to put these men (it's always men) into open jobs before he could find jobs for the Italians. I'm a very liberal person and I agree with helping people in need, but how do you ignore the needs of the people from your own town? And this is what happens in every city and town in Italy.
In 2022, the average salary in Italy is 28,500 EUR, which is approximately 1,624 EUR net per month.".
Uh... Didn't we pay Turkey to take any and all of them in? That had worked for half a decade without problem, especially without a rioting Turkish population.
