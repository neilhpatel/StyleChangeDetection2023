You can sue them for breach of contract and claim damages. Your damages wold be the deposit you paid to them and any other losses you have due to their breach of the contract, like the loss of any expected profit you were going to make on the deal, or the additional costs you may now expend buying a comparable vehicle.
Did they by any chance "accidentally" sell it to someone who was willing to pay more for the car than was agreed upon in their contract with you?
They didn't hold the car you agreed to buy and they are trying to force you to do business with them on anther car by refusing you give you back the $200.
Tell them you don't want to buy another car from them and you want your $200 and if they don't give it to you today, you sue them in small claims court on Monday for more than $200.
After the call to say they sold it, I went into the dealer that weekend and demanded my $200 back for holding a car they didn't hold. They tried to sugar coat the situation and assure me I will get the vehicle we want and the I will get the $200 back when it is all settled.
Not sure if it's worth the hassle legally or i just convince the wife that we go somewhere else and lose this battle. (and maybe someone gets punched in the head).
