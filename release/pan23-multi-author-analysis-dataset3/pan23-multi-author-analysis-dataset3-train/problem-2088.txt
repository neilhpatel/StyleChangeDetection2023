As a washinon resident it’s pretty lit too. I moved here from Nevada that had an 8.25 minimum wage and it wasn’t that much more expensive, with somet things like rent actually being cheaper. It’s nice to know that outside of the big cities, you can work a minimum wage job and support yourself.
Yeah, you couldn’t do it here, most of the people who earn minimum wage and aren’t students in dorms live with many roommates, or with their folks. My partner had 3 roommates, and was still paying about 1100 a month + some utilities for a room in an old house with a shared bathroom. Then you calculate food, transport, and medical expenses on top of all that… I can’t wait to leave honestly, I moved up here for school originally but our plan is to get out of the area when his work changes. I’m from a different part of CA where it’s a little easier to manage.
Our combined water and gas/electricity bill for an 800 sqft, 1 bath apartment with two occupants is already nearly $200 a month… And that’s only because we never turn the heater on and work to conserve water… we were actually praised by the water service for being in the top 20% of water conserving households.
All this to say, I am fortunate in that I make a decent wage, but it is rough out here and $15 an hour absolutely isn’t enough.
I live in a rural area of Tennessee and the minimum wage here is $7.25 but I haven't seen any job that pays less than $10-11 an hour in years. Most of your fast food and retail stores pay $14-16 an hour.
In NYS, nearly all fast food places start at $15, and McDonalds starts at $16 in my city! My dad is making minimum wage currently as a janitor, and I've been urging him lately to jump ship for McDonalds.
