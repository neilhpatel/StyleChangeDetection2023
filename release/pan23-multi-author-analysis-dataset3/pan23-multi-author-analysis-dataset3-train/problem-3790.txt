They're pinning far too much hope on images of a famous dick. America shrugs and collectively says, "seen one dick, seem 'em all", while Republicans continue to scratch their heads at why the plan's not working.
It's rather amusing, honestly. I can just hear Lindsey Graham on the Senate floor in a couple months, "but, it's a penis Doesn't anyone care about dicks anymore?".
Well, um.. yeah. It’s the job of judges and the judicial branch to imprison people. You make referrals because you want to bring attention to the jailers with who you think should be locked up and why. Just because something is more symbolic than 100% action doesn’t mean it’s useless. Not to mention all of the documents they’ll transfer to DoJ that none of us know about, and politicians are always going to do political stuff.
The crime was obviously political in nature, but DoJ’s decisions to investigate or prosecute shouldn’t be based on anything but the facts and the law.
The only thing the congressional referral is going to accomplish is to weaken the DoJ case, and to make any charges appear political.
So if DoJ decides to charge — which they may as well do anyway — now they must face the criticism that they’re taking orders from a political committee.
Will he get charged by the DOJ that the January 6th committee recommends, we shall see. I’m not holding my breath that Trump will be held accountable for his crimes!
