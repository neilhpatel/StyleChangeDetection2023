They don’t want minorities to be treated equally because they understand that minorities are treated badly and instead of looking at it as “we will treat minorities better” they see it as “we will be treated as we have been treating them and that’s a hard pass”. I would find this very interesting coming from the “do unto others” group but they wouldn’t be conservative Republicans without the essential ingredient of Christian hypocrisy.
I've also noticed that when you bring up topics that conservatives find charged, you're suddenly "being political" but the reverse doesn't seem to be true when they bring up things progressives or liberals find charged.
Democrats don’t pour nearly enough into media (ironic because conservatives call it all liberal) to blitz out sound bites and highlight issues. Democrats always have a follow up to the republicans assertions. Democrats do not try to get ahead, only play defensively, hoping that shame or idiocy changes a vote. Maybe 10% success rate.
It could be my area and news coverage, but I do remember the klaxons from democrats over this. It was rehashed in my news cycle multiple times, especially pointing out the 2021 catch and that it specifically helps the top and screws the bottom.
