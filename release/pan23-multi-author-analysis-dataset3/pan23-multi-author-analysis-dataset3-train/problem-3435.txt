I was there a couple years ago and holy shit man, I didn’t even tell em I was from CA and I can’t tell you how many people just started bitching about California unprompted. The libruls live in their head rent free. Although there’s plenty of people in CA that are basically the same.
Most normal people. But conservatives have been playing this game for years. Remember the New Hampshire project, where the Libertarians deliberately moved to NH to take it over?
There is a documentary referenced below where a British film crew went to Idaho to investigate this "Redoubt" movement. It filmed a lot of instances of people talking to crowds of people, and in almost every one of them, the speakers would throw in something like "the liberals are going to hate this...".
Wow. I'm really amazed at how someone appear be both intellectual and also functionally insane. Reminds me of my neighbor when he had Alzheimer's - perfectly lucid, except that he truly believed he was in a different city, and kept asking me how to get home.
Now one way to look at this is that liberals are in their head rent-free, but the other more scary way to look at it is that they are dedicating their lives to fighting the liberals.
