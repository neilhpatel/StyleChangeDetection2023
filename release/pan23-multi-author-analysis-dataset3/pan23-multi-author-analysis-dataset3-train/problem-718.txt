Jesus tried to impart Democracy into Christianity by trying to teach that we are ALL Sons of God as per his "good news" and was swiftly ignored by the church because of just how dangerous that message was for the power the church needed. Instead they pretend his good news was that he died for our sins (wtf kinda good news is that?) And then institutionalized "guilt" to exploit for power.
Their privilege insulates them from what the laws and cruelties they inflict with their policies result in. These are people who happily do attend fundamentalist Churches that hate trans, gays, look sideeye at brown folk, and talk about a woman's place in the home but are lawyers, executives, and businesswomen themselves.
I feel like the lack of understanding for white female Republican voters can be solved by simply stating they feel no kinship with poor, brown, gay, or black women.
It’s because too many married women vote to support their husbands (and sons and “tribe” instead of women in general.
I know the reverse too of women passionately political (for the GOP) and husbands who go with under them. It's really a case of who is the stronger personality.
