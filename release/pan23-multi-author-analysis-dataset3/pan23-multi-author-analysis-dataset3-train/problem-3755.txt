-This is great. This means that a provider ordered labs and is following them. This is how they will monitor your step father even though he’s not in a room.
I hope your step father recovers well. Diabetic keto acidosis is very serious. Legally, there would have to be damages and the medical team would have to be operating outside the standard of care. Without knowing his vital signs and what exactly was done when, this is impossible for any of us to say. Waiting many hours is not a deviation from the standard of care, it’s just a sad reality of emergency care today. In terms of the security guards, they wouldn’t be involved in malpractice obviously, but it wouldn’t be their role to chase after patients leaving the hospital unless asked to help. They are there to protect patients and staff from possible harms, which does include belligerent family members.
-That’s not how this works. The ER doctor has to call the ICU and explain the case and justify why it warrants care in the icu. In the case of DKA, this would involve lots of lab testing, IV fluids being administered, urinalysis, and a history/physical exam. If all of those things didn’t happen, no admit to the icu. If they did happen, then it sounds like your step dad was getting the care he needed, unfortunately there were no Er beds available to provide that care in.
Not that your father wouldn't ultimately get an ED bed or be admitted, and not that cases like your fathers are what an express care is designed for, but during times when the ED is packed urgent care beds can be used to start evaluation and treatment. In your father's case, an acute care NP or PA is more than capable of ordering labs, taking a history, and initiating IV fluids/electrolytes/slow insulin infusion until he could be transferred to an ED bed for continued monitoring and any further testing.
I’m not calling you a liar, I would just be very surprised if they told you he was “non-emergent.” In field triage for disaster management, the categories are black/expectant (this person is likely to die no matter what we do given our available resources), red/emergent (this person will die without immediate attention, but can be saved given our resources), yellow/urgent (this person needs attention, but will survive for some time without immediate intervention), and green/non-urgent (minor injuries).
Disaster triage is different from the triage done day-to-day in ERs, and while systems vary, I would think it is very unlikely administration would have clinicians telling patients they’re non-emergent because it sounds like something that would piss people off at face value without adequate explanation.
