You can agree to what they say, they will have the evidence of a confession and pass you to the prosecutor.
The prosecution is required to prove your guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Make them do their jobs.
As I judicial officer, my 2 cents is to stop talking and get a lawyer. A quick Google search tells me that in Kentucky, criminal mischief second degree is a class A misdemeanor, which is punishable by 90 days to 12 months in jail and a fine. Does this mean a MINIMUM of 90 days in jail if you plead? No idea. I used to be a lawyer, but I'm not your lawyer.
Get a lawyer, lol. Regardless of whether or not it’s your first offense, if it’s a cut and dry case that you committed vandalism, that’s an easy win for the prosecution unless you can come up with an actual legal argument as to why the charges should be dismissed. If there’s clear evidence against you, it’s unlikely a judge is just going to say, “oh, well, whatever,” but a lawyer can arrange a deal for you to get the best outcome available.
Even if you're of the mindset of "plead guilty, pay the price and get this over with" a lawyer can negotiate much in your favor via plea bargain, reduced/suspended sentences, whatever. Generally making sure you're treated fairly for what you did in court.
The answer for any criminal charge greater than a traffic infraction is universally "yes". Even for the smallest stuff, the outcomes are universally better.
