Sure thing! If you have trouble contacting them, you may have luck with the Army Corps of Engineers. They work nationally to protect designated lands, such as wetlands, and I was required to work with them during stormwater inspections and construction planning phases.
You may wish to contact the Ohio Department of Natural Resources with an inquiry regarding the situation. Photographs of the actual drain, as well as any sediment deposits or damage caused by the water. If the ODNR is not the appropriate office to contact, im sure a representative would be able to help direct you.
Depending on existing parcel lines, existing service contracts with the "owners" of the storm drain (most likely the city, county, or state Highway Departments or the Department of Transportation, depending on what type of road it is), the owners of the property it physically lies on, and nearby properties affected by the damaged drain, you could get any answer under the sun, so to speak. You may not get any help from them, either. I honestly could not tell you what to expect.
This is what I was about to say. Most areas have them and they take things pretty seriously. If you don't have a vector control, call the county department of health.
Do you have a vector control group in your county? I live in California and every county has "vector control" that handles mosquito abatement. It's funded by taxes so you just call them and let them know about it.
