We moved out very quickly and my mom kept saying we didn't have to take everything because it was a temporary separation while they worked things out. There at things with sentimental value (pet ashes, prom dress, yearbooks, things like that) that got left because I was told we were going back. I don't feel comfortable asking him for these things because he would try to manipulate me into talking to him when I want nothing to do with him.
Do you think it would work if it was my mom requesting my belongings? Or does that not work because I'm an adult?
I have my license that I updated when I turned 21, I just also have a state issued ID from when I lived there that has not yet expired.
As one final thing, if you don't live in the house anymore you likely need to update your license to your current address.
However, your parents divorce doesn't get to decide what happens to your personal belongings. You are entitled to them back, and can request them from your dad. If he refuses to give you them, you could sue him for the items or their value, likely in small claims court.
There's a variety of different issues. First and foremost, as others have said you don't have any say or involvement in your parents divorce.
The divorce is nothing to do with you and you have no rights (or involvement). You can certainly be penalised for trespassing if you go to someone’s house uninvited. Are you saying you left some of your possessions there 2years ago? If so you can request them back and potentially could sue for their value but i assume based on your post it’s not significant so probably not worth it.
