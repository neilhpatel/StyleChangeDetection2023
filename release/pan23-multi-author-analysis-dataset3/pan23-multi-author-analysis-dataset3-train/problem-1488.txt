The GOP don't trust their own Speaker, they baked in the ability for anyone in the GOP to challenge him at any time. If he tries to stop something he promised, the GOP can call for a vote to remove him and throw everything back into chaos.
The GOP demanding these appointments don't care. They are not there to make the US a better place. The GOP cannot agree on a platform - they barely agreed on McCarthy.
And McCarthy, as a leader of his party, could have reached across the isle to Dems and offered them some concessions for their votes.
McCarthy never reached out to Dems because his base, the GOP voters, does not want to work with Democrats. The GOP base wants GOP policies and were never going to accept anything else. If McCarthy "cut a deal" with Dems he'd have lost all of his "moderate" GOP support too.
McCarthy... Will do his best to destroy this country and end democracy, with every maga nutjob he can use. It's sad our education system is so bad and the vast majority of uneducated people vote for Republicans.
