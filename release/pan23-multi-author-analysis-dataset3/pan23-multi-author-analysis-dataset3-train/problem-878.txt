Russian is rooted into Ukraine quite a bit, to the point where even families from somewhere like Kyiv speak Russian instead of Ukrainian. There’s also a mix of both languages that developed in more rural areas - Surzhyk; this mix is usually regarded as improper Ukrainian and often looked down upon.
What’s interesting is that russians don’t understand Ukrainian as a lot of words are different. As a matter of fact, our language has a lot more similarities with other Slavic Eastern European languages than with russian.
As I understand Ukrainian shares more words with Polish than with Russian (and even more with Belarusian than with Polish), but Ukrainian grammar is closer to Russian than to Polish.
For me I found hearing Ukrainian is like listening to those "How English sounds in a another language" type videos, where it sounds like English/Russian, but it's not quite right for it.
Also, make no mistake, I speak Russian and I can get every 5th or so word in the sentence, but I definitely can’t understand Ukrainian.
