Lol when did they stop appeasing despots again? How many Koreans did syngham rhee execute again? The shah of Iran was not a despot? or Saddam Hussein? How about that guy in Indonesia who killed like a million people, despot or nah? Can't forget our old friend Chiang Cash-My-Check either.
Unlike the USSR, Poland actually had western allies before they all got attacked by Germany, who themselves rushed to ally with the USSR. Without Stalin paying the Germans to attack the west, they would have simply watched Germany genocide every jew and Russian from the Rhineland to the Eurals.
well if you declare war and have an army on your enemy's border but you don't invade them, then you're not actually at war with them.
War would be threatening their military with defeat and country with occupation. Russia uses murder of civilians as leverage, this isn't a war, it's terrorism.
It's utter bullshit that Ukraine can't go on the offensive and take the fight to the Russian civilians as well. Russia has every advantage here and can continue to rain hell on civilian forces with little need to actually win the war militarily.
