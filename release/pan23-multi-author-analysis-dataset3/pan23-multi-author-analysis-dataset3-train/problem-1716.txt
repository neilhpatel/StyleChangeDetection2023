Call the law firm. Speak with the lawyer. Explain. If they don't dismiss you, you need an attorney of your own to respond.
Call the attorney’s law firm and ask to speak to them personally. Leave a voice mail message explaining the situation if you cannot reach them personally. Look them up on their firm’s website and send them an email stating they are suing the wrong party. Do not say much more than explain that the names are similar, but different and that they have the wrong party named in the suit.
If they do not immediately agree to dismiss the suit against your entity and send you proof of that dismissal, or if you do not get in touch with someone at least a week before the answer date, you need to hire an attorney to handle this.
You need to either respond (which would mean hiring a lawyer close to the court and having him file a response with the court) or get yourself dismissed from the case.
Be aware that lawyers generally run a few decades behind, so it's likely he'll want to fax the papers to you, or send them by mail.
The second one is the cheapest option. Call the lawyer's office during normal office hours and tell them that they've included the wrong entity in their lawsuit. If they agree to dismiss you from the suit, ask them to send papers to you showing that they've filed the change with the court. If you don't get that within a week of the court date, hire a lawyer to deal with it.
