I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre on the same page. It‚Äôs all very unethical and unprofessional. There should be laws that hold employees accountable for things like this.
When I say plagiarism, this is what I mean‚Ä¶ in the self evaluation, the employee writes their self critique of their own performance. The employee‚Äôs manager then responds in a correlating section, with their response to the employee‚Äôs self-evaluation statements. My supervisor did not do that. She just copied and pasted my statements about myself, and placed it in her manager‚Äôs section. No feedback. No justification. Just word for word copy/paste. And to add insult to injury, when I looked at the name of the rater, it was listed as a HR director. And they use a fully automated system.
In my case, there were no issues, above average productivity (their words, not mine), and a failure to justify a poor rating. If you copied and pasted everything I wrote how could you possibly come up with a rating that was 1.5 times LOWER than what I rated myself(3.0) ‚Äî with no justification?.. and then when I ask why the rating was low you lie and say ‚Äúoh no it‚Äôs not a low rating that‚Äôs above average.‚Äù The slap in the face for me is that I gave myself a 3.0 rating knowing that I had done 5.0 work, but you come around and write me a 1.5 and lie to my face about it?! ü•¥.
There is. It's just not a legal process, because otherwise the government would be evaluating hundreds of millions of wages against production and we'd be in some sort of USSR dystopia. Or, we'd need Congress or state legislatures to pass laws the set wages. That aside, the accountability that currently exists is that workers who don't feel fairly treated are not required to stick around, they can walk and take their talents elsewhere.
