Yeah, I know. The only problem is that the landlord agreed with us that she'll be able to have us move in mid-Oct because she had stated during the application review stage that the unit will be open at that time. I just don't know if she's lying to us and if it's legal for her to continue pushing back that date (it seems like she is), or if this is normal behavior for a landlord?
My friend and I live in Wisconsin and the apartment is in Wisconsin as well. We did tour the unit but it had to be a different one because the tenant who was living there at the time had COVID. We toured a similar unit and the landlord told us that it'll look the same, just mirrored. The lease start date states November 1st of this year but the landlord assured us that we'll be able to move in mid-October. I've read through the lease three times and it doesn't seem to say anywhere about failure to deliver the property :/.
A lease obligates both you and your landlord for a set period of time. If the lease has no verbiage about failure deliver the property and the landlord won't let you move in on the date specified, then the landlord has broken the lease and you are due your security deposit back.
You can ask your landlord for a mutual break and return on the deposit, but she likely is under no obligation to do so right now.
