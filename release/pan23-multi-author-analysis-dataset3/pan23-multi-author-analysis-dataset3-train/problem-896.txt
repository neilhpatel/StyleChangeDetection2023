It is true. Slavery in the Ottoman Empire is not as famous as slavery in the West but it certainly survived well into the 19th century and even in some forms into the 20th century, like the royal concubines. The main sources of slaves were the ones described above. Circassian slaves were particularly popular in the empire. There were also slaves from Africa, mainly from Sudan. Raids of the Tatars into Russian lands were also notorious, so that too is correct.
Slavery in the Ottoman Empire and among Muslims at large is less well-known than slavery in Europe and the Americas. Why? I do not know, maybe it has something to do with the politicisation, or maybe the Ottomans had fewer slaves than the West compared quantitatively, so it was less noticed, or maybe because the racial tension in the region is much less accentuated than it is in the US. Whatever it is, clearly nobody is quite as shocked to learn that there once existed slaves in Europe, but this happens at times with the Ottoman Empire.
Chattel slavery seems to fit the described parts of Ottoman slavery. They could be captured, bought, used, and sold. But how harshly treated they were I am not sure. Maybe the Islamic law and its requirement that slaves be treated leniently played a role, but I would not want to mislead really.
Didn't such slavery under the Berbers entail a much better life? You were treated as part of the family and weren't mistreated infact your children and you were educated?
