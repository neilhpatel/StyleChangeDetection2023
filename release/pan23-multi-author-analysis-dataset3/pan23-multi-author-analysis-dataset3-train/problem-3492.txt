\-So if the LLC owns the truck, what's the implication? I don't own it, he doesn't own it, but if he owns the LLC, then how does my ownership (and liability) transfer away? It sounds to me like I donate the truck to the LLC.
\-And lastly about the insurance, that seems like another complication that would arise from me owning it.
Also, how is insurance to be handled. Is he going to insure a vehicle that he doesn't own? Are you going to insure it and make him a driver?
He buys the truck as an authorized officer of the company, in the company's name. You would be a lienholder on the title.
That's where being the lien holder comes in. Having a properly filed lien give you the right of repossession, but you want to make sure the contract outlining the terms of the loan and responsibilities of each party is solid (again, something an attorney could, and for 100k should, help with).
You're right about liabilities. There's also the tax implications to think about. In reality, he should be on the title and you should be a lienholder on the title.
