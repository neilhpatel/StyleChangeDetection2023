In Texas, only immediate family is able to obtain a death certificate within 25 days of the individual's death. Afterwards, you should be able to obtain a death certificate. Though, ask about a death verification letter. This isn't an 'official' certificate used for the courts, insurance or estate handling but should suffice for the lease.
If the estate is small enough, small estate affidavits are often done on a flat fee basis and that is generally not paid through the estate since a formal probate isn't necessary in that circumstance.
I assume the reporting of a death and subsequent generation of a death certificate probably starts the process. When I was in NC the county had a local attorney they used to administer estates of people with no relatives.
My best advice for you would be to reach out to a attorney local to your area. This is a pretty unique situation, you may have the right to claim some of his belongings that you could sell to help you make ends meet, i.e his car. But again; that's something you'd need to address with somebody familiar with your local laws.
