2019 was not the best year for me in terms of reading. Checking Goodreads, it was my lowest year since 2008. I read a total of 27 books, with only fourteen non-fiction books. Not having a proper few week holiday didn't help.
Empire of Sin: A Story of Sex, Jazz, Murder, and the Battle for Modern New Orleans \-Gary Krist. I really enjoyed this book. It's an easy read but quite interesting and well-researched.
I'm hoping to read a lot more in 2020. Mostly about the interwar period. I also really want to increase my historical fiction reading and would love suggestions.
So I read a nice mixture of history and fiction this past year, 2019 is when I rediscovered a love of fiction!
That said, I do think I read some interesting and noteworthy non-fiction books, some of my favourites.
I read too many wonderful books last year to list them all, so here my top three non-fiction books I loved most last year.
I read a pretty huge number of books this year. Sadly I don't have a full list. Every month I swear I'm going to keep an updated book list, and every month it peters out within a week or two.
