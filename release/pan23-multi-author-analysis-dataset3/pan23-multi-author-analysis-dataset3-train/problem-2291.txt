No, and Ukraine is hesistant/unwilling to hit targets over belarus anyways because doing so might give luka the means to join the war, his people would rebel otherwise but potentially if Ukraine hit targets in Belarus he could make decent enough propaganda to justify it and not face open rebellion.
I know he just means "batallion" but he refers to them as "battalion tactical groups" which is a specific unit type Russia uses, and not Ukraine.
Rybar also likes to make up fake Ukrainian offensives, so they can then say they were crushed. It's a way of generating fake wins for the Russian side to feel satisfied with the war and feel like they have some form of success.
The Russians have most of their vehicles as “amphibious” but realistically they are not maintained enough to do so regularly. Yes the US does have amphibious assault craft and armed vehicles like the marines AAVP-7a1.
There are plenty, like the US AAV, UK has the Viking, and a lot of APC/IFV vehicles have amphibious versions or capabilities though we usually see the land version. It's not just US and UK either many NATO countries operate some.
UK makes sense for US forces deploying to Europe. All of the cold war soldiers would finish basic etc. Then units would go to Europe. You should train for awhile as a group before taking up a meaningful border position. It was a strategic reserve position. The French did not want an American army presence.
