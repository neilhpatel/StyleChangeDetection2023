Well, you live here, what do you expect? Living tax free in another country? That ain't how it works. You pay the taxes of the country you live in FOR the country you live in. That's universal, worldwide.
I'm more than fine with citizenship for children born here when the parents actually live here. Literally no argument from me against that. But dual citizenship? Nah, that's fucked up. You either live here or you don't and if you don't, you don't deserve the rights that come with a citizenship, like voting for example, and you don't deserve the additional rights of other countries if you live here and the same is obviously true the other way around.
They should get citizenship then. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they should just not have citizenship of another country at the same time.
You should be able to vote in a country by just living there for an appropriate amount of time without even being a citizen of that country. Does that blow your mind or are you unable that participation in elections is the rightful thing to do. If you can vote in a country when you not live their is by the way up to the country and nothing else. But pathetic to call participation entitled when that isn't even possible for some people who live for decades in germany.
