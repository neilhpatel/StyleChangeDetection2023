Ultimately, Ukraine also needs assistance creating long range standoff missiles so they can help everyone else by de-militarizing Russia within a few thousand KMs from their borders. Wipe out Russian airfields, army barracks, naval yards, production plants, and train yards.
There’s no prohibition against Ukraine developing its own weapons (like Neptune). With under the table assistance from its allies Ukraine can surpass Russias’s junk in capability and volume.
Ukraine isn’t a static entity either as seen in how quickly they’ve progressed technologically with their long range and drone weapons. Don’t confuse justice and mercy for inability.
AA guns like the Gepard can and have helped thin those barrage down since they have to travel low and slow over a large territory. Ukraine just needs more.
Ultimately, “made in Ukraine” is whatever Ukraine and its allies declare it to be and Russia can’t do anything about it.
Once Russia is pushed out of Ukraine's borders, Ukraine will join NATO or an ad-hoc mutual defense treaty (for example, with the UK, Poland, and the Baltics).
