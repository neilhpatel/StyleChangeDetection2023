There’s actually a lot of good stuff in the Quran, especially for the time period it was written in. The problem is that it’s a religious book, and those always have fucked up bad shit alongside the good so it’s basically a net neutral. That, and like most religious books it was written over a thousand years ago, and none of them are really fully compatible with modernity.
Believe me we’re in the same side. I think religion is stupid but we still have to live alongside religious people so let’s at least try to see things accurately. Believing in a magical sky man that will punish you if you don’t love him is ducking dumb, but what can you do?
Go read it if you don’t believe me. It’s a mixed bag and I personally think all religions are dumb and not true. But I don’t think I’ve ever heard Andrew tate say something good. Just because the only muslims you ever listen to are the red necks of the Muslim world doesn’t mean they’re the only ones out there. It would be like judging all Christians by the southern baptists.
But if your belief’s judge or criticize others (I.e. not respecting them), than you have no reason to not expect that judgement, criticism, and lack of respect in return.
But that doesn’t shield us front criticisms for beliefs that hurt other people. Lots of religions have edicts that label certain people as lesser, inferior, or wrong.
You have a group of people specifically choosing to single out and in their eyes disrespect their religion and how they view the world. Additionally it’s a group of people that originate from a region that has historically colonised their country.
