I'm sure the ruling party in Florida would NEVER use this to try and sway elections using the 1.6 million cons in Florida. Nosiree, just good honest folks trying to prevent the 'bad' cons from having a say in how society is managed. Those good, Christian cons who found Jesus should absolutely have a vote though. Oh? Kenny failed probation you say? Ehh it's okay. They're clearly sorry, and asked the lord to forgive him. Here's your ballot. Next. Jerome? Sorry. You still have $2000 of your $50,000 fine to pay. Get out of here scum.
You completely missing the point. Laws should be written fairly for all parties affected. The way this law is written essentially gives the controlling party subjectivity on when dues are paid. That list you gave is 'examples' of how dues are paid. The county clerk subjectivly decides if you've 'paid dues'. It's almost like they've created a system where they can pick and choose which cons they can allow to vote.
Appears the GOP are the fraudsters in the voting fraud issues they brought up as reasons for voting restrictions. The GOP has turned so dirty and amoral.
