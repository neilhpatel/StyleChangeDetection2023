I mean I can cut to the most probable answer if you want: if the county commissioner thinks he has the authority to do it, he probably does. If he doesn't, the local press would be up in arms about it.
Determining that authority is what answers your question. Your county's website might have the information about the specific way your government incorporated itself.
This is impossible to answer without knowing your local county's specific hierarchy between the schoolboard and the commissioner. Does the schoolboard serve at the pleasure of the commissioner, or are they an elected body?
Sorry, the school board is an elected body. The County Commissioner is an elected position as well. I don't know what authority, if any, the commissioner has over the school board.
I would like to see the local press bring attention to it and cover legalities and potential consequences and hope they do.
From what I'm gathering in talking to the local citizens, he can do this, but has no authority to enforce any law or bring forth any consequences in response. Apparently, he has no authority over the school board, so it's just a virtue signal on his part.
