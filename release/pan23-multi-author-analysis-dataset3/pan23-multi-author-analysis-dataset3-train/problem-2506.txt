"have your ever tried to manipulate stock prices for a pump and dump, decided to stupidly exaggerate and make an offer for an unprofitable company, wanted to back out, but we're sued to go through with it, be forced to sell your bloated stocks to afford the deal, then acted like you always wanted the company and made a shitty "let than sink in" post before absolutely running it into the ground head first?".
You know... I always scoffed when people would say reddit is full of npc's who can't think for themselves and fall so easily into narratives.
But if that's too "conspiratorial" for you, it's also because hating Elon is the hot topic issue right now, and they'll get more rage clicks if it looks like Elon is responsible for this.
It's not entirely all of your faults. This article (and all the others on the subject) was intentionally written so that to the layman reader, it would appear to have been Elon's fault. Again, that is by design. They write it in such a cryptic manner intentionally. They don't outright lie. But they use word play to give readers an impression different than reality. And it's pretty much every article you read on every topic. You can't see it though, because they engineered you to view things they way they want you to.
