The conflict is largely political and ethnic, religion's role is largely tactical and context-specific. The first Jews coming to the Old and New Yishuv were generally either secular, or refugees (aka, not super concerned with religion so much as safety).
Not every evil comes down to religion. The world, unfortunately, is not so simple as to rest all the world's evils at the feet of one concept.
Respectfully, this is reductive. The I/P conflict is about 75 years old by most official metrics, arguably a bit north of 100 years old depending on how one defines their terms.
Palestinians in the area are responding to what they view as colonialism, not some divine mandate against Jews (although that is absolutely present on the extreme end).
But that is acceptable to jihadists and their sympathizers: not one Jew is allowed to remain in Palestine, despite millennia of presence.
Regardless, you speak of reality, yet pointedly choose to ignore the fact that it is explicitly, lawfully, illegal to sell land to Jews, there is a religious fatwa in Palestine against selling land to Jews, and the punishment is death.
