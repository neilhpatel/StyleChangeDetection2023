Yeah, I don't think the point is a reasonable discussion with property management now. But I think you want an attorney familiar with credit reporting and consumer debt to put property management on formal notice that the charge is disputed and you intend to exercise your rights under all relevant state and federal laws.
The problem is that unless you want to pay them and then sue for the money back, there's not a lot you can do at this point.
Small claims can't issue something like a declaratory judgment, which says you aren't responsible. That would require a lawyer going to superior court.
