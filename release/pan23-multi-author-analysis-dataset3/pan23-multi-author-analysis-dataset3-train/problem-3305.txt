Emphasis mine. The prevalence of vaccines and the high number of people already infected at least once should help mitigate hospitalizations from this variant.
"The XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant that’s currently dominating the U.S. is the most contagious version of Covid-19 yet, but it doesn’t appear to make people sicker, according to the World Health Organization.".
Yeah. I'd be pissed if our tax funded hospital was keeping secrets from us. They stopped sharing overall population infection numbers a long time ago in most areas I think since so many people hardly bother to test anymore so the numbers would be completely inaccurate. But hospital numbers are public knowledge everywhere up here as far as I know.
I live in Canada and our local paper was showing daily ICU numbers during the peak. I imagine they will do the same if numbers are getting very high again. My province also has a webpage where I can see ICU numbers for my region at anytime. I'm going to continue to only follow closely and worry about what is specifically happening in my area before I get concerned again.
