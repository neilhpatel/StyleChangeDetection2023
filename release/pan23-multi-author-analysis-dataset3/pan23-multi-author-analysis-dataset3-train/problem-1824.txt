You’re all good to call. I have a horrific neighbor that played house music on her subwoofer at 3am and literally rattled the windows. I was advised by the officers to call and continue to call ANY time I was disturbed by noise. Ideally they make a record of it, and then your landlord pursues a eviction under nuisance behavior.
I’m not sure what your local laws are, but the officers told me that noise ordinance times didn’t really apply if the noise was loud/disturbing enough. So when she played music that vibrated my walls at 2pm I was still able to call. Good luck!
What’s more likely is that if you keep calling, the police will keep knocking on your neighbors door, and eventually they’ll be so irritated that they’ll keep it down.
There is also the possibility that the noisy neighbors will knock it off before the cops get there, or that the cops will be busy with a higher priority call and will take an hour to get there. However, they are required to respond. At least, that's my department's policy.
I was in a similar situation and had the same concern, so I went down to the police department and talked to the shift supervisor. He confirmed that not only was it okay to call as often as the noise was occurring, but to call every time in order to establish a pattern. The cops won't escalate to fines without a pattern.
