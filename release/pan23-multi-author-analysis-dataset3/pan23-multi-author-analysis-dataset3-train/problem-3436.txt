All of the upvotes to this. You need to submit a responsive pleading by the deadline. I think you should at least get a consultation with an attorney for this.
I’m not your attorney and this is not legal advice. That said, if you feel like you have a serious legal matter in your hands it is always a good idea to consult an attorney in your state. Most attorneys offer free consultations.
This seems like something where you need to make an appointment with someone at the Financial Aid office and go in and see a person in-person with all your documentation. If your mother has no income and only collects spousal support then you’ll likely qualify for some form of financial aid, although I can’t say why they were rejecting your documentation and it doesn’t seem like you know either.
In regards to a lawsuit, if you’ve actually been served with a court summons and not just an attempt to collect a debt, you must response before the date on the summons or the college may get a default judgement against you. I have to imagine though that the college would send you a notice of an attempt to collect a debt before going straight to suing you.
