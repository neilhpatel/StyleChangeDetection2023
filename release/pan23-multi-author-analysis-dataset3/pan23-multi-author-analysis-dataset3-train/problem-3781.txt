Nearly entire Turkish spoken people are ethnically Anatolia Turks (And some Gagauz Turks and Pomak people) But Albania and Bosnia regions spoken Turkish as a second language (something like English in India).
That said, there are places in the former Ottoman Empire where Turkish has been spoken continuously to the present (by larger or smaller groups), in places such as Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Greece. However, these speakers overwhelmingly identify as ethnically Turkish as well. I can't speak to whether this is because they were Turks who emigrated from Anatolia or were locals who assimilated culturally, but in any case, these are examples of places where the Turkish language did in fact spread.
I disagree with your statements on Ottoman Turkish (your statements on its linguistics, more specifically): while it was most certainly a language of the elite and used mainly amongst bureaucrats, polymaths, the literati and anyone with the good fortune of being wealthy enough to afford education, it was not merely an amalgamation of Turkish, Arabic and Persian as some people think it to be.
If we go back to the first Ottoman constitution of 1876, we can see that "Ottoman Turkish" was not perceived to be a distinct language from regular Turkish, instead it was perceived to be its formal, official register: This is the aforementioned constitution in latinised Ottoman Turkish, and the eighteenth article (mâdde 18) states (NB: I have added diacritics to correspond to accepted romanisation methods and older pronunciation): "teba'a-i 'osmâniyyenin hidemâtı devletde istihdâm olunmak içün devletin lisân-ı resmîsi olan türkceyi bilmeleri şartdır." Meaning: "in order for Ottoman subjects' works to be employed for use in the state \[state affairs, government\], the knowing of Turkish, which is the official language of the state, is stipulated." Now, it is true that Turkification efforts were present well before the founding of the Turkish Republic and extended back into the late 1800s (although not as strong then), so you could very well argue that part of the reason for naming the language here in this constitutional article as "Turkish" is political, however, if one knows a reasonable amount of Turkish, it is easy to see that the foundation of this sentence is Turkish.
Lastly, the seemingly ubiquitous claim that the Ottoman Turkish script was "a really bad fit" is early Republican era propaganda used to distance Turkey away from the East and towards the West (perhaps to look more civilised, to foster better international relations and/or to facilitate trade); type in "Harf devrimi", "Harf inkilabı", "Turkish alphabet reform" or something similar to that and look at images to see examples of this, here is an example of propaganda:
Ottoman Turkish has various widely differing styles, some of which are very close to Persian in style (mostly poetic works and some Siyakat documents), yet still Turkic, for example, Şeyh Gâlib's famous mesnevî, Hüsn ü 'aşk: and some have much more Arabic vocabulary and syntax, typically law documents, take for example the Gülhâne edict: Some works from the late Ottoman era, often but not necessarily popular literature can also be wholly Turkic in style and very comprehensible to a speaker of Modern Turkish with a large repertoire of vocabulary, like the current national anthem of Turkey: (all three of these documents in this paragraph are latinised so you can see the difference easily if you are not familiar with the Ottoman script).
While the Ottoman Turkish script is not as accurate as the Turkish Latin script, it is not hard to learn if you pay heed to how it deals with euphony and verb formation (and archaic spellings), and it was serviceable for the language (as it should be considering it was used for over 600 years, and more if you count the predecessors of Ottoman Turkish). It was also faster to write than Latin and more versatile than it aesthetically due to the eclectic plethora of calligraphic styles it could be written in ( illustrates this well), so it was in many ways a more suitable script for artisans, scholars and bureaucrats. For example, bureaucrats would use Siyakat to encrypt documents with information about financial assets and Divani for writing edicts, endowments and other deeds and official documents to prevent forgery. Artisans would use Sülüs to write religious inscriptions or Nesta'lîk to write poetic inscriptions. Just about everyone would use Rik'a in handwriting, and Nesih would be used for clarity, in printed texts and perhaps in more mathematical/scientific documents.
