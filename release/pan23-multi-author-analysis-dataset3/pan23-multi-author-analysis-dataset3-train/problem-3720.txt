If there is a lease, you have to give at least a thirty day notice that the lease won't be renewed . If there is no current written lease, then he is considered to be on a month-to-month lease so the notice can be given at any point they are living there. Have a written lease termination notice sent to him via certified mail, make sure the owner of the house keeps a copy of it for their records.
In this case, I'd highly recommend a lawyer, especially if the owner of the house has no experience with evictions.
they are legally tenants and to remove them requires an eviction. I assume when you say you can't take him to court it means that there's a moratorium on eviction there. You didn't post your location so I can't tell you about your specific moratorium but if you research it there might be reasons in it that you can still evict a tenant. I know some are only restricting eviction based on failure to pay, but some have more comprehensive lists.
that makes things a bit harder. you'll have to file with the court, which is going to cost something, but it's often not incredibly pricy for a simple eviction proceeding.
With all the eviction moratoriums going on, it's hard to say whether you'll be able to actually evict the person without knowing where you're located.
If he was given property written notice to vacate, and didn't leave by the date on the written notice, you file for eviction if eviction courts are open in your area.
