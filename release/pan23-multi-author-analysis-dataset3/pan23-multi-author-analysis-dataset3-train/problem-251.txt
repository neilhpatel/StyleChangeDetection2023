Also to note: “Two Santas Theory” and supply-side/trickledown economics. Both of which fall under Reaganomics, but with the former being a re-election strategy that depends on ramping up national debt specifically. This allows Republicans to spend when in power, and become debt/deficit hawks when a minority.
Dems are only indirectly responsible, since the GOP keeps cutting the method to fund Dem priorities. Democrats are pretty responsible with funds, the deficit only increases when the GOP comes in and cuts taxes AGAIN because it's all the have left to run on.
If the GOP didn't cut the corporate taxes over and over again, the DEM programs wouldn't have caused a deficit since they actually would have been payed for.
And the other corporate tax cuts too, you said in another comment that none of them have expired yet, so how can you also claim that they haven't contributed to the National Debt?
The corporate tax rate going from 35% to 21% since the start of 2018 didn't "really" add to the National Debt?
So you're saying that 4 years of a reduced tax rate, with no substantial spending cuts to match it, didn't "really" add to the National Debt even though it obviously increased the budget deficit, which adds to the National Debt?
How the debt was created is exactly how it is being grown now……the only ability republicans have is to cut taxes. They don’t have the ability to cut spending because it would mean reducing the benefits their voters get. Same today, which is why they’re now trying to starve the government of money forcing the democrats to make cuts, which will never happen…..we may go through some kind of shutdown, but eventually, the republicans in the house will buckle. Recall that republicans could not cut spending when they were in full control, so there you go.
