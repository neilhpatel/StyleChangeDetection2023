It's not a blanket policy. It applies to transgender people taking hormones. They directly cited it to me in an email as a reason to deny me my warranty. But that was the 2nd of 3 different reasons they changed.
okay, how about "Transgender people who take hormones (which is the VAST majority) are disproportionately affected by having no warranty compared to cisgender people (the VAST majority of which do not take hormones), which in my opinion is transphobic.".
EDIT: okay, how about "Transgender people who take hormones (which is the VAST majority) are disproportionately affected by having no warranty compared to cisgender people (the VAST majority of which do not take hormones)".
Yeah, it's problematic that even relying solely on the OP's telling of things, "Transgender people don't get a warranty, cisgender people do" appears prima facie false.
Fair point, but if that disproportionately affects trans people, that's still transphobic. If it affects 100% of trans people medically transitioning, that's still transphobic.
It seems to say (literally) that it applies to anyone taking hormones, not just transgender people. Which is pretty broad: birth control pills are hormones, for example.
Their attorney wrote, "This letter is intended, further, as a demand to remove any defamatory statements you have posted publicly, including, but not limited to, any social media accounts.".
Part of me wonders if they made it up. They never had me sign any warranty or show me any exclusions.
