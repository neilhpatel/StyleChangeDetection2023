I removed the overdraft option several times because I was migrating my account from WF to a regional Credit Union. And I was happy to live with declines because all my vital reoccuring had been migrated to my new account. I just wanted to see what else was attached so I could migrate or cancel thise services.
They threatened me with EWS, warned I wouldn't be able to open another bank account (already had one), told me to manage my finances better, harassed me...
And one day, a day before the EWS reporting deadline they warned about, they called and asked for a new balance and had removed all the overdrafts. They said it was a 'courtesy" because I had been a customer for 22 years. I paid the money and asked them to transfer me to account services so I could close my account.
The same bank that THREE times said I missed a payment, charged me a late fee and put my account on “hold”.
I auto pay online and each time I follow up on this dispute, I win. BUT, I have to go to the several hours of work to dispute it.
