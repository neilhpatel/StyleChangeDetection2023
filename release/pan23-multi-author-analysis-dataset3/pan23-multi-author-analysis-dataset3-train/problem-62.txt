if five R votes are all it takes for mccarthy to lose the majority, i cant imagine many of the boeberts / gaetz types willing to complyâ€”seems like theyre relishing in the dysfunction and would rather keep it that way than make him speaker.
And just think that the closest races all broke in Republicans favor or else this could be an even tighter house and 3 Republicans(or even less) could have blocked the entire speaker just by themselves. Boebert won by 500, another Republican won by 600, and the next 3 closest races were around 1500-2000 all for Republicans as well.
In some ways it may actually benefit Democrats to return to a 1 person calling for a motion to vacate the Speaker because say you had McCarthy refusing to budge on a government shutdown and you had Republicans in moderate districts getting calls about people not getting paychecks, not getting this, etc...
It could be a way to do the 'compromise candidate'. I don't think there's any real 'extreme outrage' right now. Most people just view this as a clown show since no 'regular people' are losing skin from the game.
I wasn't talking about Democrats shutting down the government. I was saying if McCarthy and Republicans did a prolonged shutdown... Then the lower the vacate threshold the better chance a small faction of moderate Republicans could then challenge and join Democrats for a new Speaker. Where as if the old rules were kept it would take a majority of Republicans to challenge their speaker.
