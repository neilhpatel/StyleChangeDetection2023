He gets to office B then loads the van to do his installs or work at other sites. Sounds like office B is the warehouse and office A is the main campus.
You drive from home to office A to pick up a company car to go to your worksite at office B. You clock IN at office B. You can't drive your personal vehicle to office B because? Is it in a secure location? Do you have to have a company vehicle to gain access to Office B's site?
Office A is where the company vans are stored during non work hours. He has to pick up the work van then drive to office B to pick up supplies for the day. He wouldn't be able to use his personal vehicle for that as it's a liability issue, and probably a space issue too. Since he is more than likely required to use the company van, he needs to be compensated for the commute between offices.

You said it was 2 hours of commuting and office B is 45 min away from Office A. Would it still be 45 min away from you to get to Office B if you drive your own vehicle?
If you look at the commute - are you saving time or losing time going to office A? If you had to drive from home to Office B how far away would that be?
