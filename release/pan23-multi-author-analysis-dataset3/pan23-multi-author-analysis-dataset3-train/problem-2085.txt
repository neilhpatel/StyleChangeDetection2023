It's a proposed constitutional amendment, so it would require a lot of votes. 2/3rds of both the Senate and the House, and then 38 states would also have to approve.
Step 1: Two thirds majority of both the House and the Senate. That's 290 Representatives (about 70 more than Democrats had last session) and 67 Senators (17 more than they had last session, not accounting the two who kept fucking everything up).
First off: You don't understand how the Senate works, do you? 60 for the vast majority of things. Not 50.
Exactly. The exact same bad faith "Dems bad!" Question I've seen a thousand times in the past two years.
Step 2: State-by-state ratification. Three quarters of all states (38, rounded up) must ratify the new amendment in the time given either via state legislatures or via state constitutional convention.
The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each State for ratification.".
Yes, there is. Every single civilized nation and democracy in the world (except us!) works this way. And then don't have this problem. They only have the normal kinds of bribes and corruption that we too used to be able to handle when it was only a crooked politician here and there.
The truth is that Citizens United is irrelevant. Roberts' own opinion points out that Congress has always has the power to fix this issue without violated the First Amendment in the slightest (what CU is keyed on).
