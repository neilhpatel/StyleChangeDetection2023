- the lines have to be redrawn very regularly (every 10 years) so there is very little tradition or identity associated with districts.
- you can’t just use existing natural boundaries or county/city limit lines because you have to divide the state population evenly by the number of allocated representatives. That’s not the way natural/existing boundaries work.
- the best options for reducing partisan gerrymandering involve legislating into existence a bipartisan redistricting committee or process. But why would a party in power legislate that into existence the other side having equal say, when they could just, you know, draw the lines themselves?
- even if the party in power did want to construct such a commission, it’s not actually clear what’s fair. Should the bipartisan committee have equal say from both parties, even if it is a state dominated by one party or the other at every level of government? What do you do about natural discrepancies between urban and rural voters and the way that creates uneven levels of homogeneity? That is, if a bunch of democrats are naturally packed into an urban voting district in a way that dilutes their voting power, is that okay because it follows an existing border? Or should you draw the boundaries to ensure that each voter’s voting power is the same and outcomes provide proportional representation even if it produces crazy borders with meaningless districts?
Voter fraud is how the political minority explains why they elections don't reflect their presumed status as the majority.
It's just their fig-leaf excuse to implement voter disenfranchisement measures so they can win elections.
The irony here is that the only voter fraud is the retrumplicans claiming that there is voter fraud. Perhaps there is evidence of voter fraud on Hunter's laptop.
