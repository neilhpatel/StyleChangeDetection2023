Pathetic Republicans are so mentally fragile that they think that merely being around trans or gay kids will turn everyone tans or gay.
Gay and transgender people just want to live normal lives like everyone else, nobody is coming after your kids!
I have honestly been questioning my political affiliation, I really am what you call socially liberal and fiscal/economical conservative(with some exceptions). I'm pro choice, pro lgbt, and pro weed legalization but I like my guns and care about my pocket book. I live in a purple state with a republican governor and democrat legislature and I'm happy with that. Neither party really represents all of my views. I just want people to have freedom.
I am a capitalist but I believe that if you can't pay your associates a living wage then you shouldn't be leading a business.
I would support a policy that raises the minimum wage for each state to meet the cost of living and adjusts it each year according to inflation.
How are we supposed to be the party of small government if we pick and choose which freedoms to defend.
'cause denying their rights, happiness and freedoms to others are the republican values. It's all about projection, coming from them :
