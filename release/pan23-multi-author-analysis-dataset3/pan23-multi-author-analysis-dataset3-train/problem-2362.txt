While the mainstream media spun the midterms as a Trump disaster, the majority of the GOP voters base didn't buy it. Maga-republicans candidates/operatives were listing all of Kevin's sabotages.
Even if Kevin manages to win Speaker without fear of being 'Boehnered', the Freedom Caucus (teas) and GQP are going to make his life a living hell as the majority of the politically engaged GOP voter base cheers them on.
Here's how to cut the Gordian knot: a small group of moderate republicans - it would only take five - tells the rebels that if they don't shut up and support McCarthy, they're going to vote bipartisan and back the most moderate democrat.
It might be amusing to taste the republican tears if McCarthy gets reappointed by democratic votes, perhaps at the cost of cutting a deal on a committee membership, or two. Oh, how they'd wail and gnash their teeth.
Ok, McCarthy's 'toast'. Then what? The loonies don't have a candidate of their own who could win, and McCarthy is still backed by the largest faction. Who aren't going to support a magamoron. So either a compromise candidate gets found, or one of the other group has to bend.
