And to be clear, this is not a vaccine mandate, it is a choice between getting a vaccine and being tested.
(Personally I don't understand the reluctance. Pre-vaccine, I lost three family members to COVID and they were brutal deaths without anyone allowed in the room. Four friends got very sick, two lost their jobs, and one likely has permanent lung damage; she's 31 and otherwise was previously very healthy. They all likely caught it at work and/or caught it at work and spread to families. And these things are still happening. When I received by first shot it was a massive sigh of relief and I assumed things would start to go back to normal since everyone would get vaccinated. Boy was I wrong. But the principle here is to protect everyone, even the vaccinated who could acquire a breakthrough infection. We all have to work, and the workplace shouldn't be a potential death sentence.).
It's theoretically possible that the end result is that the state law effectively requires employers to allow for testing.
I should have added, my employer is not allowing testing as an option, but it's allowing for medical or religious exemption.
Edit: Possibly if the organization has a legitimate concern from religious standpoint, they could be exempted from the law.
