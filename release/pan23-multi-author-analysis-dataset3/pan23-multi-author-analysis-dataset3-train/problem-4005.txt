Roman adoption might best be conceptualized as an oligarchic society's response to demographic realities. Thanks largely to cripplingly high rates of child mortality, many Roman families failed to produce a male heir. Adoption allowed a childless man to perpetuate his family- a concern to all classes, but most pressing and visible among the aristocracy. There were two legal forms of adoption - one for those who had previously paterfamilias of their own family, another for those who had been under the paternal power of another - but the upshot in each case was to make one man the legal son of another.
It's worth pointing out that adult adoption is also, de facto, an effective method of family planning for reducing the number of heirs in one family while guaranteeing an heir in another. If a family has two noble sons who survive to adulthood and one of them is adopted into another family, now both families have one heir to their fortunes. Adoptions for these purposes were generally from other families of the same status, not adopting extra children from the lower classes, so every one of these adoptions solved not one, but two problems. It's also worth noting that precisely this situation is the backstory for a play by Terence, the Adelphoi, in which one brother who has two sons has allowed his childless brother to adopt one of his sons so that each has one heir (and as it's a comedy, various hijinks ensue) -- and Terence himself, centuries before Hadrian and the emperors, was adapting from even earlier sources. As you say, it's a common means of handling the problems of inheritance.
This does indeed seem to have been a common solution to a longstanding problem. Adoption was extremely widespread in Mesopotamia and is also attested to a lesser extent in Egypt. Both men and women could adopt and be adopted in Mesopotamia. Adoption had two primary benefits:
