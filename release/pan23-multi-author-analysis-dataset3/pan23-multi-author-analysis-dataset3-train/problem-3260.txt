File a police report, especially if you've got a fire dept report that states what happened. I'd go down to the local precinct and find someone to take your report and provide you a copy of it.
I'd talk to your property manager, take them a copy of the police report. Say if they attempt to have you evicted you will be happy to discuss with a judge. Stress that you have no cat and have not broken any of the rules of your lease, assuming you have one. They can't make you leave before your lease is up without taking you to court. If you don't have a lease or are month-to-month they have to give you proper notice to move out (and, vice versa).
Has the landlord told the tenant to stop, provided the tenant with notice that these actions breach the lease etc?
Present that to your landlord or whoever you've had contact with that was threatening eviction. Had the building not been evacuated, who would have been at risk from your neighbors I'll intent(purposely deploying ammonia). Have you let other neighbors know they were at such a risk, what would they say to their safety and their children being exposed to that, and this crazy neighbors doing this endangering everyone.
"OSHA has set an 8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm and a short-term (15-minute) exposure limit of 35 ppm for ammonia in the workplace. NIOSH recommends that the level in workroom air be limited to 50 ppm for 5 minutes of exposure".
File a police report for harassment at the very least, but prolonged exposure, premeditated and intent from a toxic substance. May lead to very serious charges being brought, and you wouldn't be the one pressing them, the police would do it on behalf of the state.
