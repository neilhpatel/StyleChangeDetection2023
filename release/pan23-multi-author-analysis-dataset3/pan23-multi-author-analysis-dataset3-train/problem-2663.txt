I hope they enjoy being everyones verbal punching bag instead of us for a change and I hope they remember that if Russia or China attacks Europe we'll be there defending, bleeding and dying in their land for their people who have a significantly higher standards of living and averge life expectancy than our own, but if China attacks us then much of Europe will choose to stay out of it because they "Dont want to be dragged into an American war". Its not like Europe tried super hard get us to join them in European wars that resulted is catastrophic loss of life, all for the sake of western democracy. Wonder what would happen to western democracy if the US fell? Maybe loads of Europeans would just celebrate not having to tolerate us anymore so they can go back to believing they are the center of the superior civilized world.
Are you pickin up what I'm puttin down? Its a great tank for the right environment, Ukraine is not that environment. The Leopards are far more accessible and cost effective for Ukraine which will have to pay for this stuff after the war as its not free. The Abrams runs around 9 million each. Also neighboring allied countries are pushinh Sholz for the go ahead so they can provide their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, he's the only one blocking it.
A lot of countries have those tanks ready to send to Ukraine, but before that's allowed we need Germany's permission.
As soon as Germany is convinced, many tanks will be shipped to Ukraine! This will turn the tide on the front lines quickly.
