What your BIL says makes no sense whatsoever. If the company does not care for you to have a PhD from a fake institution, why do they require a PhD in the first place?
If you get a fake degree, or a degree from a school that is not accredited you could be fired. And for c level positions it is normal to vet all candidates, to get transcripts and ensure the degrees are from accredited institutions. So this could come up right away. Or it could come up at any time later. If this company does government contracting based on certain qualifications it is possible you could be sued, or face criminal charges for fraud. But generally listing a degree from a diploma mill is not grounds for fraud charges or a civil suit.
Some state laws address this more specifically. Like in OR you are required to disclose the degree is not from an accredited institution.
In the IT industry job requirements are rarely hard requirements. If you have a masters degree and experience you can just apply anyways.
Is PhD level knowledge something you are familiar with? Are you able to perform tasks that someone with a PhD can?
A lot of people think "MS is good so PhD is better. Better chances to get noticed and be seen as more qualified...".
This is fraud. If you worked for the company and are found out, say 5 years later, you will be fired and prob sued for the cost of all the salary and benefits you received.
