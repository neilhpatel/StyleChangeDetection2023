But the people running these things don't tend to be older, more conservative thinkers and a headline like "Corporate greed is bad and is fucking you over hard" doesn't go over terribly well with them. So they shrug it off and continue to give the same advice they usually do when it comes to dealing with inflation - because, well. Fuck the little guy.
A lot are, but it's mainly based off traditional understandings of how inflation works - under most circumstances in developed economies, the primary drivers of inflation are increases in overhead and increases in wages (i.e., people having extra money available to spend.).
Right. Okay I see. What you are saying is we need loads of immigration from the third world to keep wages low and rents high.
The need for ever increasing GDP is fucking killer. Please just give us a nice safety next with things fundamental to human health and wellbeing and then focus on us being happy.
Does it matter that it cost more to train locals to do work? That's what we want. We want highly trained locals with high wages. Anything else is detrimental to society. It doesn't matter if population goes down that's our choice. Give us more time off, cheaper housing and free education and healthcare I'm sure people will pop out more kids.
