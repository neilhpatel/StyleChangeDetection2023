2.	I don't give a shit about their US rates, the article is talking, again, about Germany, where Tesla has to compete against German employers.
Tesla is an American Company that isn't used to German standards. And if you underpay your staff & behave as they do right now, Tesla Germany will be another Walmart Germany - which spectacularly failed in Germany.
I mean duh, if you pay 20% less than other car companies, in one of the most competitive fields in Germany - car making - whilst Germany is experiencing a worker shortage & record low unemployment, i can't see a reason to work at Tesla.
This is for the United States.. Nobody gives a shit about the US when this is about Germany. And in Germany, IG Metall - the largest Metal working Union in Europe - hammered out Salaries for all major car manufacturers in Germany apart from Tesla. And Tesla pays 20% less.
Tesla: We pay you 20% less actually. Also, the job is not in Berlin itself but in a remote village about one hour drive from the city center. No Home Office.
