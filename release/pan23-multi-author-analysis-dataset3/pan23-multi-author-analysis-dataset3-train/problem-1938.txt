I read that some of the indentured Chinese women ended up as domestic servants, and many ended up in laundry houses, which is why I'm curious about laundry. I can't remember where I read that the more upscale brothels and parlor houses kept indentured servants, so I can't really say they did, but I'm interested in the relevant duties they would have.
I have never encountered a brothel with an indentured servant, but my knowledge is not comprehensive, and the general rule of the West - or at least humanity in general - is that if you can imagine it, it probably happened somewhere. I don't think this was common. From what I have seen in primary sources, Chinese American prostitutes generally worked out of Chinatown or in transitional neighborhoods, removed from the blocks were there were Euro-American brothels. In addition, I have not seen any brothels that were integrated with Asian women involved in sexual commerce.
Cribs were small single-person dwellings used by individual businesswomen. They were not afford the protection of the brothel, but they did not need to pay any "administrative fee" to the madame and the "house.".
Right. From my understanding, they didn't want to use period-specific cursing because, oddly enough, to our 21st century ears they would've sounded silly and ridiculous. The use of foul & offensive language is on purpose, and was designed as a "shock to the system" to underscore the lawlessness and brutality of it all.
