As for showings, your landlord needs to provide prior notice and you do need to need to provide access (or not bar them from entering). Noting requires you to leave the house though.
You do have a lease. It’s the last one you signed and likely states after the term is over, if automatically changes to month-to-month.
CT doesn’t have a state statute on notification time for terminating the lease, so it’s probably in your lease and is typically 30 days. Which means you or the landlord can terminate with 30-days notice.
Typically you’re owed 30 days notice to end a month to month. You can check ct for any specific changes.
It’s a crappy situation but looks like you need to start looking for housing. Better to put in your 30 day notice with housing secured vs scrambling after the house sells.
With proper notice you must let them show the house to prospective buyers. They do not have to be during when convenient for you. You can try to ask/ negotiate for better times maybe in exchange for you leaving the unit during showings.
