Curious why you think this. There's no big gender disparity in lower age groups of any kind, women just don't have to settle so much as they can now hold meaningful jobs, take long maternity leaves and find any manner of sausage via apps or the internet.
that doesnt sound like the biggest problem, until you take a population of 1 billion, and factor in the gap of 50 million people, and the gap is likely wider with younger generations than smaller ones, and selection pressure makes it more likely that men have more partners than the other way around.
In America men are also increasingly not finding partners for the reasons you listed, that women are more educated and working now and expect more equality in the household, and men aren't keeping up.
also you cannot actually be serious that “men expect women to do more housework” is the single, let alone the largest reason young men are lonely and single. do you realize how narrow-minded you have to be to believe some bullshit like that? i will put money down on a bet that i can google “why are young men in the usa lonely and single” and i don’t find that “data” until maybe page 3 on an unrelated incel page.
it sounds like you personally just haven’t been lucky with the men you choose to date or surround yourself with if a generalization like that is your actual conclusion.
internet culture and dating apps are a huge problem why. it’s way more nuanced than “x gender can’t keep up”.
