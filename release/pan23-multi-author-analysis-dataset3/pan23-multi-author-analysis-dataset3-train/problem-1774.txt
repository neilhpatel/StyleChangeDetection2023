Nah, Ukraine has been very vocal that they need tanks and IFV's to be able to conduct another offensive on the scale of the "Kharkiv Blitzkrieg" around spring time.
My guess that the Ukrainian Forces already have enough tanks for the counter offense, but they need new ones after they destroyed or broken, because of offensive operations.
This is why the USâ€™s Abrams tanks are not recommended for Ukraine and the Soviet era tanks are encouraged to be sent to Ukraine, even as these relics are still powerful, but extremely vulnerable to RPGs or similar AT weapons.
Do all of the Ukrainian tankers have a good enough understanding of English to operate the tank and possess the very specific terminology the tank itself uses that American soldiers are taught at Fort Knox?
They are very familiar with old Soviet tech like the back of their hand and they know how to operate and repair them and they have plenty of disabled Russian tanks to pull parts out of.
The basic armor build of the tank is classified, even from 40 years ago. This tank has seen many tech upgrade cycles since it's initial delivery to the Army and Marine Corps decades ago.
So, when you buy a tank, you are not only buying the tank itself but ALL the logistics and spare parts you would need to maintain those tank for years to come.
There are probably some spares held back in some secured warehouse somewhere should one or more of our trusted allies need replacements for theirs which are in their tanks.
I'm sure that most of those older tank computers were ground up and shredded for security purposes and may be no longer available today to swap out with their more modern counterpart replacements.
I'm sure that the various computers inside have also been upgraded over the past 40 years that the rollbacks may not even work on the more modern computers that are currently installed.
