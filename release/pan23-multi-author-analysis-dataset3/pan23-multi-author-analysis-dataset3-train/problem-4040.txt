This dinner theater is an insane waste of taxpayer money. A handful of surveillance drones would would be 1000 times more effective than armored vehicles.
Take the money and spend it on more drones or better surveillance systems or something like that. Something that actually makes sense given the circumstances. Not just something big and heavy duty because it makes your micropenis feel like a big ol' dongus.
Because otherwise this is just another boner pill for their base of limp dicks looking for someone to blame for their shame.
Like, assuming you are looking to do a hardcore border lockdown. A tank isn't going to do it. They're slower than other vehicles and their visibility is more limited than other vehicles. The advantage of a tank is that it is armored and has big boom sticks. But when you're dealing with desperate migrants with no weapons what is the point of having an armored vehicle?
Are migrants really shooting at border agents that much, let alone with enough firepower to require armored vehicles? You'd think if that happened Fox News would play it nonstop. What is an armored personnel carrier going to do other than completely roast the poor guard soldiers in there?
