ThatÂ´s pretty interesting! When I heared about Operation Unthinkable, it sounded if this plan was very serious and more or less only stopped because of the Americans.
Btw. it is true, that Operation Unthinkable included to arm some German POWs and let them fight? Would that be Wehrmacht and or SS troops? Would be allies really arm SS troops?
Yes, the plan included rearming German POWs. This would not be done in time for them to be part of an initial attack, but if (a) the initial attack failed, or (b) the Soviets continued to fight rather than agreeing to Western demands, 10 German divisions could be formed by re-equipping German POWs with surviving German equipment (and, in principle, more German divisions could be formed by equipping them with Allied equipment).
Patton (a) distrusted Soviet aims, and (b) felt that the US had an advantage if it came to war with the Soviet Union, and (c) that advantage would decrease with time. However, he did not advocate such a war, and did not want to fight the Soviets. He felt that the US should negotiate from a position of strenh, if necessary supported by the threat of force. He believed that this would result in Soviet compliance without war.
The Soviets prepared plans for war with the West. Again, this doesn't mean that there was any intent for war against the West. However, at least some of their plans may have gone beyond the hypothetical level of Operation Unthinkable, possibly in response to intelligence reports about Operation Unthinkable. When Operation Unthinkable became public knowledge in 1998, historian John Erickson (author of The Road to Stalingrad and The Road to Berlin), commented.
