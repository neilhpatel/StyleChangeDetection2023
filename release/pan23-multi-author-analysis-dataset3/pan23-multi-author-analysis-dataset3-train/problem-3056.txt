College students usually convert into paying subscribers in their 20’s. It’s an entire generation that Netflix should be cultivating for future customers. (It’s how Apple saved its ass back before iphones - make your product affordable for college students and you can hook them permanently.).
Yeah. And they need you to notify them when you travel. And heaven forbid one of your family members travels while the others remain at home.
Because even if you pay for that extra person they also can't travel without letting Papa Netflix know.
No one else is using our Netflix except me, my wife, and kids—my brother in law keeps a Roku at the lake with his subscriptions on it. My mother in law isn’t tech savvy enough to use it.
I don’t know how it will work yet because it isn’t released in the US yet, but I have two kids away at college who use our accounts all the time.
I pay for two streams, so I feel like I should be able to use two steams wherever I want for my own or my family’s own personal use. I don’t feel like it’s entitlement on my part. They sell plans by the number of streams and resolution. I agreed to those terms, and I’m not sharing with someone who lives outside of my household. If they want to change those terms, that is their prerogative, but then I have the right to cancel.
