That’s intuitively what i figured, especially with something like a lease where laws are necessary exactly so that landlords don’t engage in power abuses and strong arm tenants into signing away their rights. Granted my landlord seemed to enjoy self righteously pointing out how dumb i was for assuming laws mattered more than a lease.
the above link is for the law. If I am reading it correctly, section D seems to imply that the law can't be overturned by wording in a lease contract, but I am not sure and thats why I am here.
Thanks for the reply, not sure if this addresses whether or not a lease might supersede the law in regards to when the 30 days start. Law states at termination of lease or move out (whichever occurs earlier). The lease stated 30 days from termination.
The landlord must notify the tenant of the deductions within 30 days after the tenant has vacated the premises.
Finally, if the landlord does not return the tenant’s security deposit within the 30 days, the landlord may be liable to pay the tenant double the amount of the deposit they are owed.
While the landlord is required to return the tenant’s security deposit, the landlord may withhold all or a portion of a tenant’s security deposit from the tenant for damage in excess of normal wear and tear, unpaid rent, or breach of lease.(by vacating the premise and terminating the lease five days too early you have in fact breached the contract.
