Hawley was trained by the Jesuits to never tip your hand or leave evidence unless winning is assured. He may come off as a braying buffoon in public for the MAGA masses, but he is Machiavellian in the halls of power. He knows that these other yokels have engaged in seditious conspiracy and have exposed themselves to legal jeopardy that could include impeachment, disbarment, and imprisonment.
In Dershland, with no statutory criminal charge of treason or bribery, nothing a president does can be impeachable. 'Other high crimes & misdemeanors' being vaguely defined means the founders just meant treason and bribery, of course. Also, presidents cannot be charged with crimes while in office. In fact, the DOJ is under his absolute authority as a part of the Executive Branch. If the president has ultimate authority over the agencies, he has ultimate authority to dissolve them. That is the Unitary Executive hellscape that this group of theocrats who have seized our judiciary has envisioned and worked toward with all fundamentalist zeal.
Only a criminal conspiracy to overthrow Democracy in America in writing, among the President's Chief of Staff and his utterly deranged peers in Congress, nothing to see here.
It never ceases to amaze me that there was literally a bloody coup over the presidential succession and people still pretend like we live in a functioning democracy.
Then these seditious fuckers literally attempted a coup and start screaming about martial law and FEMA camps the second they realize their attempt to overthrow the government wasn’t as successful as they imagined. And that’s with them cheating the entire time.
