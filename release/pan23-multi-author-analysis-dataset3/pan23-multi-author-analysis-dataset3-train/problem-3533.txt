I see this frequently referenced as a “clever” workaround but it’s really not. Only dumb companies will try it and even they’ll get it out of their systems pretty quick.
It won’t take long for the repeated failures in hiring to get through to most of those dumb enough to try it in the first place. And as for the other, a few idiot HR departments is nothing new.
Any company that actually needs the $175k worker will scare them all off with the posting. No one worth that is going to apply. And any company trying to recruit the $30k workers is going to get tired of even their low end applicants having inflated salary expectations.
They either have to tell you, or look incompetent by pretending they don't know the pay rate for the position they're hiring for.
PROTIP: If you live in a state that doesn't require this, and a recruiter asks you for the salary you're looking for, simply ask them "What's the salary range for the position?".
As it should be. Why waste everybody’s time if we know the terms will not be agreeable? Too many businesses don’t realize employment is intended to be a mutually beneficial agreement, they’re not doing you a favor employing you.
