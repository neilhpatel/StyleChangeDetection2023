Exactly they want power they do not care if its through democracy or other violent means. Creating a evangelical Christian nation justifies any action they take.
In order of asking, yes, they certainly will become Christian Nationalist. It's very clear that's the way it's headed. And no, if they do that, they can't win long term. , and I would expect the rate of that to increase. And also, just because you're Christian doesn't mean you will support a christian nationalist party.
As for the "not every Christian will support christofascism," yeah, you're right there, but there are a significant minority of non-Christians who will because they crave order and fetishize strenh.
Over half of the country is Christian and will be for decades. Yeah, great, they'll lose their grip on whatever remains of this country by 2060 or whatever. Makes me feel tremendous.
Well they don't run on that platform, they run on being anti-woke and for traditional values and stability and hating people who don't look like a Brady Bunch character. And that appeals to more people than just right wing bible thumpers.
That tells you about everything you need to know about what the “Christian conservative” movement really is.
