It can be bad because the landlord can raise the rent with 30 days notice, or give you notice to vacate with 30 days notice (although yours looks like 60 days).
The 60 days in your written lease is also troubling as Texas laws state the different notice periods are legal if both agree to them in writing. Your landlord might argue Sept and October rent at this point as you did not follow the written agreement.
