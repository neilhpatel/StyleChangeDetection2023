And this question is irrelevant really because main premise of Russian lie is that wagnerite was abducted from Ukrainian-controlled territory (like someone would give him permission to be outside of prison or hospital before the POW exchange).
If his name was proposed to exchange for some needed people for Ukrainian side than I think Ukrainians shouldn't care about wagnerite opinion - they are illegal combatants.
If Russia proposing to return Ukrainian prisoners for them why do you think Ukrainians should care more about some criminal mercenaries over their own people?
Russia/Wagner are again trying to intimidate their canon fodder from surrending to Ukrainian forces by making them think that Russia has people in Ukrainian cities to abduct and kill Russian "traitors".
The Russian soldiers invading Ukraine are deliberately bombing hospitals, schools and any other important civilian locations that they can. They are looting the areas that they occupy, and raping and murdering the population. Russians may not be inherently evil, but they sure do seem pretty keen to carry out every war crime and atrocity that they possibly can.
You can be critical of Putin and the war without resorting to lazy stereotypes and racist suggestions that Russians are inherently evil. That's just Cold War propaganda.
