yes. if the other guy is found to be liable, his insurance will cover the full cost, including your deductible. they will pay your insurance company, and your insurance company will refund your deductible to you.
You can file the claim with your carrier, and provide statements and a police report, and that will get them mostly there as far as liability. Going through your carrier will get you the fastest results as far as getting the vehicle repaired, rental, etc.
Does calling and barking work anywhere? No? Its not going to work with insurance either. That's a good way to ensure you are at the bottom of their priority list, and talking to a supe/manager isn't likely to change that. They need to confirm liability, and they have rules/regulations that they have to follow to get there. The easy way is for their guy to cooperate, the hard way is that he does not (they have to give him time to do so), and if he does not, hopefully the PR is clear enough that they can determine liability and accept it based on that, but this can take time, especially on high exposure claims like this one, they need to be sure.
You can ask for it to be totalled, but if the repair cost doesn't hit the threshold, it won't happen, being upset about having it on Carfax isn't going to get them to total it.
