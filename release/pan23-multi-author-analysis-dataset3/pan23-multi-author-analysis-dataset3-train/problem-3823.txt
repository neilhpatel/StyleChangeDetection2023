If he took the plea deal, part of that would be him not being able to appeal. Unfortunately, he will now always be on the list. If there is no other accusations, he can get his level reduced over time depending on what level they put him at. But him choosing to take the plea makes it so there is nothing more that can be done there.
Well to took a plea... which means, in most cases, that he admitted to the act in court. There was obviously enough evidence to make his attorney feel they would not win. If there was no evidence then he wouldn't have plead out.... and it would not have gotten to the point of filing charges.
But "there wasn't any evidence" was an argument to make at trial, or before taking a plea deal. It's not particularly useful post-conviction.
