Pretty sure Biden said something like “any negotiations are between Ukraine and Russia. The US won’t dictate peace talks for a conflict we’re not actively fighting in”.
Edit: Biden’s exact words were at the G20 Summit and they were, “I've been very clear that we're going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves – and we are not going to engage in any negotiation. There's nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, this is a decision Ukraine has to make.” [emphasis mine].
When will these people realize that Russia needs to negotiate with Ukraine, a sovereign nation. The US cannot speak for Ukraine, nor should it.
Sure, get out of Ukraine and then they can talk. It truly is that simple. Russia trying to pretend they actually have any juice to make demands is silly at this point.
The argument here is that the fact remains that Russia got its ass kicked despite having much superior numbers and weapons at the start. It was truly only after Russia's 40-mile-long convoy to attack Kyiv got defeated that the serious weapons showed up.
The fact of the matter is that ukranian citizens literally fought with Molotov cocktails against TANKS and that Ukraine has allies because that’s how humans work.
And people seriously overestimate our help. We have devoted 5% of our military budget and have sent only things that we where planing to scrap anyway cause you know himars, it’s 80s tech. Had we SERIOUSLY helped and send f16s, patriots from day one, Abraham’s etc this war would be very short indeed. Oh and the things I mentioned are not even close to our tip or the spear modern army capabilities.
Don’t know. How long did Afghanistan last against Russia first U.S. later? How long did Vietnam last?
