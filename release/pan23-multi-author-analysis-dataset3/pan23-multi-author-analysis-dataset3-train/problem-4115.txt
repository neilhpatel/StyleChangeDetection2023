One of the key lines normal under your J&C paperwork is something along the lines of " Anything else your Probation Officer decides ".
Correct. The P.O's know the courts are backed up and can/will do things knowing that you will not see a judge for many months, especially right now, to fight it.
As long as you are under the custody of a P.O which probably extends past your exit date, he can order whatever. I did 4 years, on probation for 10. 10 years of them telling me to do whatever, but they do lighten up quite a bit once they realize your not re-offending and have a job etc. Your paperwork from the judge has the release requirements on the back I believe and says how long you're on probation after your extended release.
Most states have some type of "good time" that is taken off of your sentence for good behavior, sometimes that extends when you are on parole and you receive so many days off of your sentence each month. That is the compliance credit I'm referring to. You can request a time sheet from your PO that should show you what credits you are receiving. Depending on if this is the case or not, you may be able to be done with your sentence before 9 calendar months.
