I remember reading the dictionary as a kid (as one does) and I came across "Byzantine Empire", which was defined as the medieval continuation of the Roman Empire, and I was like...the \WHAT\??
In high school I first read about the crusades in a "World Civilizations" class. I knew vaguely what the crusades were but that was where I learned that they actually worked (at least in the beginning), and there was a little European kingdom all the way over in Jerusalem. That's when I knew I was hooked. I remember what I was reading too, it was a popular history, The Crusades by Antony Bridge.
I’ve tried thinking though what elements of the Middle Ages have caused me to be so interested in it. Sure, I love imagining what life would be like in another period, and think that learning about any period gives insight into our psychology and motives, but that’s no reason for being interested specifically in the Middle Ages.
I read last and first men, and to be honest I didn’t quite like it all that much. I felt it was a little too random at times, like the author thought “next will be humans with... bug eyes or something? Or 5 arms?” But it does have its philosophical merit. Stapledon is a philosopher after all. My girlfriend liked Starmaker even more, so I recommend you read that too!
Yeah, Star Maker is another favourite of mine! I can definitely get behind you with the more fantastical human species, but there’s a sort of earnestness to the completely wild stuff being written that wins me over. Personally I think that extinction or some kind of permanent post-sentience is far closer than Stapledon wrote about. But regardless I do think we’ll last long enough to change dramatically. We haven’t been around for too long and have already changed/stayed the same in so many incredible ways.
