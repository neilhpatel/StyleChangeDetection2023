I'm curious as to what the changes in GDP were and were they also in line with the change in wages. Would be interesting to know what the prevailing interest rates were, too, both before and after since the change was inversely related to the wage rise.
They find ongoing impacts to interest rates and wages, in opposite directions. Interest rates fall, wages rise, though the rise in wages is somewhat smaller. To quote them on interest rates:
There is a problem with linking economic outcomes to one event in history, such as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, in that modern large economies are complex and are being affected all the time by numerous drivers, and there's no reason to assume that even the important drivers are all easily measurable. Therefore I'm going to talk about the evidence across multiple pandemics, not just the Spanish Flu. At the end I also mention a bit of US work that looks at comparisons between US states.
The interest rate data used in the Jorda study comes from a study done by the , if you go to their website you can find an Â with the figures, the tab "IV Country level, 1310-2018" shows the figures for real and nominal interest rates for eight large countries.
