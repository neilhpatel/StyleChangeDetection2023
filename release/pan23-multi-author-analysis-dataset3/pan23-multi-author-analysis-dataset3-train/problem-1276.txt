As a government employee I can tell you why. Previously the deal was that government jobs paid less than private sector jobs but you got better job security and a good pension.
It used to be that government jobs paid less but had better benefits. There’s been so much demonization of defined benefit pensions by people who don’t understand the math and healthcare has taken a dive for everyone. Now it seems government jobs just make less money.
It’s all about the pay for most (non-LE) government workers. They simply haven’t kept even close to the private sector and many municipalities just don’t have the budget to pay more, even if they wanted to. Doing so would require tax increases (or new taxes) that citizens don’t have the stomach or pocketbook for right now.
Bingo. You nailed it right on the head. They’re stripping away the previously great benefits of a government job and not raising the pay at all, while piling more work onto each position.
Yep. Tier 3 at my state job and it’s dramatically lower retirement than tier 1 or tier 2. Now many governments are making employees mandatorily contribute to their pensions which makes it even worse. I’ve seen some states as high as a 10% mandatory contribution that comes off your gross check. Ours is 6.5%. They “compensated” everyone by raising their pay that much, but then we have to pay taxes on that higher pay. The net effect is less money (worse case) or equal to before (best case, in low paying jobs).
