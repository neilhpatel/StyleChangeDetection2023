The red state US bans are strictly enforced and basically shut down the clinics. While most of Europe have much more loopholes and far fewer restrictions. It is not comparable.
It’s actually not close. DeSantis is by far the most fascist. Trump IS fascist and authoritarian by nature of his natural tendencies, but also somewhat populist owing to his natural desire for showmanship.
I disagree. I think he’s a lot worse. He’s more fascist in his policies than Trump even was, and that’s in addition to already supporting Trumpian policies. He’s way smarter than Trump, he actually knows what the fuck he’s doing.
I don’t think anyone is going to doubt that Trump is a better showman than DeSantis. But the idiots thought Trump was going trounce Biden because he was getting better turnout at his rallies than Biden.
Biden whupped his ass once already, and Trump will drive Democratic votes thru the roof in swing states.
If Trump ran third party, he would basically ensure Biden won. He's not going to siphon votes from Biden more than he does DeSantis. You might even see some deep red states flip because of how goofy the math works out.
