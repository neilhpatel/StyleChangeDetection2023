You are correct. The Consumer Review Fairness Act, passed in 2016, explicitly makes non-disparagement clauses illegal for the purpose of public reviews. Including that clause in a contract opens the vendor up to fines by the FTC and by state attorneys general. And attempting to enforce it would be another no-no.
If you like the vendor, go ahead and stick with them. If they screw up, go ahead and review them fairly and honestly. And if I were you, I would include in any review that they included an illegal non-disparagement clause in their contract.
Does the contract say that you can't write a review stating that there is a clause in the contract about leaving a bad review? Because if I read a review that stated that, I would get the hint...
Is a "complaint" a review? BBB has those listed separately: vs you can also mail in both if I remember correctly. so skirt the whole online thing.
Is 3/5 stars on google business reviews "bad" or "average"? what about 2/5? to me that is less than average and not "bad".
what about "I wish I spent more money or looked harder for a better vendor." A statement such as that doesn't imply "bad" service just that there is better. It implies displeasure and doesn't cross the line (I think).
