That's not entirely correct. Some MFG extended warranties DO offer refunds if you've not exceeded the milage and sell/trade the car in.
I am wanting my $3800 I paid for the extended warranty that I did not use. I traded my vehicle in and the dealership payed the remainder of the loan. The dealership is claiming it is non refundable and not giving me any official documentation stating that it is non refundable. I have reached out to the warranty company as well and I am waiting to hear back.
Thank you for the response! Not the end of the world i've just been getting a ton of mixed responses from finance at these dealerships and decided to turn to the experts here on Reddit lol.
Thank you for the input. I was told by the salesman that sold me the new vehicle that they do issue refunds for extended warranty if you do not use it. Also it seems screwed up to me they are probably going to try and coerce the person who buys the vehicle I sold the dealership into buying another warranty even though it is already under my extended warranty plan.
Thank you, the dealership didn't even have my warranty documents on file and I had to tell them who they outsourced it to.
