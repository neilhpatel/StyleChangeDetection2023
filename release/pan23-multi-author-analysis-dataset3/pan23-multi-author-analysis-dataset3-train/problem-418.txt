We see a lot of lack of maintenance in all in types of equipment from simple protective gear to the biggest ships, so one could assume that at least a part of the nuclear weapons is in a similar state.
The lack of maintenance comes from the fact they couldnt be bothered to do the scheduled rotation on the tires of their trucks , which in terms of cost and time is much less than maintaining an icbm and nuclear warheads.
Now you apply the same logic to the nuclear stockpile and it becomes scary for russia to even launch one , imagine being the first nuclear power to nuke themselves on accident.
But I think it's hard to estimate how much maintenance effort actually went into the nuclear arsenal.
Nuclear weapons were made with tech from the 40s/50s, it's nothing that sanctions will prevent, and they can produce the necessary ores from domestic mines.
Russia is still a major global player in providing enriched uranium for nuclear power plants. To think they're not making weapons grade enriched materials shows (IMO) a complete lack of knowledge on the subject.
