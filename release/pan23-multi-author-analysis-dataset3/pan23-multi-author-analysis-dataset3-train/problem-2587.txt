Yet again, I don't even think you do have to engage them at all: the drop in living standards should be enough to let them know that maybe it was not one of the best decisions. Hell, they don't even have to say that they changed their mind but just do better decisions when voting.
If you call an undecided voter a racist enough times eventually you seem irrational and they vote against you. How many times must the left repeat that mistake?
Actually the point I’m trying to make is that how you phrase those reasons matters. I’m finding you hard to side with and I agree with you. Politics is never an absolute right or wrong And you’re acting like they said 2 + 2 = 5.
And yet a crowd of people calling them stupid is all that matters needed to keep them where they are.
There is already talk of getting the uk back with some kind of peripheral membership, but if everyone thought like you, the vote would fail because you put all your energy into cackling people stupid - that’s not how you convince people to change, and you don’t have the sort of majority that allows you to be arrogant.
