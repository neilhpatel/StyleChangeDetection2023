No. We need to refer to them as "entitlements", because that's what they are. I pay into the system, I am entitled to reap the benefits. Republicans keep trying to make "entitlements" a dirty word, and we shouldn't let them.
Rolling back or eliminating social security is an idea that the smart republicans are trying to walk back.
Republicans are working on becoming an endangered species. If they successfully ramp down or eliminate social security and medicare for future recipients, they will never hold the majority ever again.
Republicans want to replace Social Security with a mandatory 401k style investment approach. Most people suck at investing, which is why we must have something like social security. Companies that have moved from defined benefits (pensions) to defined contributions (401k with match) know they have screwed their employees. Defined benefit plans have large institutional investment managers to hit return targets. Individuals are mostly guessing.
I would rather see an approach where any income over $1m has a 5% additional social security tax to make up for shortcomings in SS.
This plus a return to fair taxation of the wealthy and corporations would make funding of social security not a problem. The almighty shareholders, corporations and the wealthy primarily, have been sucking up an ever-larger portion of the pie for four decades using the trickle-down lie as a justification.
