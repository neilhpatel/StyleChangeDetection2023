The Empire of Khwarazm existed across much of Persia, extending from the mountains of Aghanistan and Uzbekistan to the shores of the Black Sea, and including Transoxiana, Ferghana, Sistan, Khurasan, and Iraq-Ajemi. It was, in a word, huge. It was also a very young empire - having been won and formed in 1200 CE, it was only \6 years older, in fact, than the Great Mongol Nation (Yeke Mongol Ulus) forged by Genghis Khan in 1206. In fact, across much of the first two decades of the 13th century, it was still far from a settled affair, and major fighting had only stopped in many of the regions as late as ca. 1215. As such the ruler of this Turko-Persian empire - variously styled as the Amir/Sultan, and self-styled the Shah (though the caliph in Baghdad rejected this presumption) - was every bit the brash conqueror-king with delusions of grandeur.
