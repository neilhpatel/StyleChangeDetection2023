OP, it's going to hinge on the amount of drugs found and whether it falls under personal use amounts. As mentioned, you need a criminal defense attorney, now, and to not speak to the cops without that attorney around.
Do not speak to the police without a lawyer at this point. Plan as though you are likely to be arrested, until your lawyer tells you otherwise.
No; they'll likely be returned once the investigation closes, or more likely after whatever charges are laid are resolved and the appeals period closes.
So, in other words, not forever, but probably for multiple years. You and your lawyer can try to recover your things earlier than that, but I expect you'll have more pressing concerns.
You need a lawyer. Your phones have been seized as evidence of a crime, and the police have other evidence that also connects you to a crime. Having two phones is not illegal, but having two phones and a bunch of drugs is a great place for a prosecutor to start building a case for possession with intent to distribute, which can put you in jail for a very long time.
