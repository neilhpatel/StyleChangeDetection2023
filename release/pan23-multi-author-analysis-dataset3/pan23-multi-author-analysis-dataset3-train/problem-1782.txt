Basically, if Obergefell gets overturned (so states would be allowed to ban gay marriage again), this law would require them and the federal government to recognize marriages performed in other states where gay marriages are legal, but wouldnâ€™t require any states to legalize gay marriage.
I also don't trust that the Supreme Court won't just rule that marriage equality is unconstitutional because it wasn't allowed when the nation was founded and because some 12th century scholar said it shouldn't be allowed.
Basically what this means is that even if your state denies you the right to marry, they don't get to decide for other states or the federal government.
This bill requires states to recognize marriages from other states, even if said marriage would be illegal in the recognizing state.
Section 2 of DOMA also gave states permission, under federal law, to deny recognition of marriage licenses from other states. In other words, a legal marriage in California between two men would not be recognized in Arkansas, if Arkansas had made such marriage illegal.
If Obergefell were reversed today, Arkansas could refuse to recognize marriages performed in other states. This law forces them to recognize them, even if Obergefell were reversed.
