Russia's next strategy: Overwhelm Ukraine by throwing bodies into the grinder until Ukraine simply runs out. So much death and suffering just to appease the delusional whims of a madman who has murdered his way into Russian leadership.
Also keep in mind that a lot of russian invaders who are dying over the last few months are literally prisoners charged for rape and/or murder.
Some of them seem like they were fine people in life, but most are either brainwashed folk who went to militarized schools or even just straight-up radical nationalists who hate every nation except mother russia and find joy in trying to kill Ukrainians.
What I think Russia is doing regarding supplanting Ukrainian children and forcing Russians into Ukrainian towns/villages to start living there is brutal. I’m concerned they keep this war going until the west loses interest and we have a indecipherable mix of Russians and Ukrainians living together in Ukraine with a ongoing “civil war”.
The alternative would have been a Russian civil war, something that "cultural Russians" are now fighting in Georgia, the Crimean region of Ukraine, the E.U. as a whole and, now, the country of Ukraine in the reality of boots-on-ground, open combat, as opposed to the persistent cyberattacks and cultural war waged by Russian sycophants through attacks on infrastructure against "hostile" nations the Russian Federation considers an enemy, which is nearly every recognized modern country.
The same people that were in power consolidated their government-mandated power to an economic stranglehold on production.
