They do not have to provide a reason and just have to give your friend 60 days notice as they've lived there more than a year.
They can end a month to month tenancy with no cause as long as they give the appropriate notice, which is 60 days, it would only be 30 days if they had lived there less than a year.
It is not an eviction, although it could turn into an eviction if they do not leave when they are supposed to which can cause issues that make it difficult for them to find somewhere else willing to accept them as tenants.
Or the terminations of tenancy may really be unlawful and they can refuse, and overcome an eviction action, or make a demand for relocation assistance payments.
Examples of "no-fault" terminations are when an owner wants to occupy it themselves, substantially remodel it, withdraw it from the rental market, or comply with a government order to stop renting it.
"Evictions" are petitions to a court to restore a landlord's right to enter, control, and occupy a rental property, and all the rental agreements and rules before that are about "tenancy" and its commencement and termination.
