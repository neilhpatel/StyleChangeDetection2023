- “Queen Consort” Camilla is pretty horrible for continuing to go along with the affair while being aware of who Prince Charles was already married to.
- Numerous other British royals are pretty horrible for their racist comments about Meghan after their press did their research and found out her mother was black.
If this were an ‘Am I the Asshle’ I’d say everyone sucks here..Harry and Meghan have clearly been subjected to lots of nasty bigotry and mistreatment by their family and definitely by the British press. That is disappointing that the family couldn’t fight their own establishment to really defend their loved one and his wife and children. But, Harry and Meghan really don’t need to be airing this saga so publicly. We all have some family drama but I wouldn’t want the person with the grievances to go on international tv over and over to talk about it. Whoever is right or wrong, this public agitating isn’t going to help their case among the family that they apparently want back. And they also get to have their conflicts with a side of major wealth and privilege that almost none of us can relate to.
They're still rich and privileged compared to almost everyone else in the world, so it is hard to keep playing the victim card.
