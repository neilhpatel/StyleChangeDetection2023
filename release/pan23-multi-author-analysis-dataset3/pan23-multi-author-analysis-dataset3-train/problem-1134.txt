Trump trying to pull the "don't you know who I am" to the FBI is going to be pretty funny to see if they ever get around to arresting his ass.
Desantis just won reelection as governor in Florida last week after failing to address wether he'd serve a full term in a debate. I don't think people down there that really like him will care too much, but if he registers now, just a week after the election, before even being sworn in for his second term it'll probably look pretty bad to those that are more moderate on the Republican side. And because he's a smarter Trump, he'll follow the old ways, pretend to be governor for a year, and announce an exploratory committee next year, probably in the summer or something, whenever the campaigns normally start ramping up.
He’s not going to win, this is different than 2016, there’s no posible scenario where he wins again, this is good, he’s going to split DeSantis votes and there’s going to be a Democrat president again, no need to worry.
Until the votes are counted and 1) he’s lost and 2) there’s no 1/6 Part2, I feel like there’s plenty of reason for worry. “It’ll never happen…” and yet it did….
