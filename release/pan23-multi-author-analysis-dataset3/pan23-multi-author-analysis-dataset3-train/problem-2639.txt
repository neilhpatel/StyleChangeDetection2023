Because the group in power shouldn't be able to construct a narrative to bene3fit themselves. This is why only giving Tucker the footage is also terrible.
Thanks of the elloquent, thoughtful response. I absolutely agree that people involved should be tried and convicted for any crimes committed. I also worry for narratives to be gobbled up by an ill informed voting public.
I worry more about the footage that could be used as evidence in court being used to craft narratives to be chewed up and then regurgitated by an ill-informed voting public. We have already seen that much of what the Republican Party does in the modern era is to consolidate support and coordinate talking points. I expect that this will be exactly what happens if Rupert Murdoch et al use the footage to craft public narratives, especially since they have announced in court that maintaining their credulous audience, getting Republicans in office, and subsequent profits are the primary factors when considering programming content.
I truly hope that this appearance of impropriety and partisanship ends up leading to investigations and charges against those involved but I am not hopeful given how enamored the right wing seems to be with treating our political and governmental systems like a business crafted with the intent of benefiting shareholders and the bottom line rather than a constitutional system of checks and balances.
Publishing government facility security footage is not only a national security risk but also an example of the legislative branch meddling in the Affairs of the judicial branch.
Itâ€™s potentially more than watching themselves, it could include methods and paths that were employed to move the second and third in line of succession to secure locations, where those secure locations are located, where blind spots in coverage might be, capabilities of cameras such as resolution, zoom, pan/tilt, among other national and congressional security practices and procedures.
