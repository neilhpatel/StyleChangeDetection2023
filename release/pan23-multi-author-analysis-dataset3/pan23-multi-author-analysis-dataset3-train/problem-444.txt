If they tried to sue you, you could make two arguments. (1) There is a “prior use” defense under 35 USC 273 and you can’t be sued since you were using it for over a year prior to their filing date. (2) The patent is invalid since you publicly disclosed/sold a product that practices the invention, which qualifies it as prior art under 35 USC 102(a)(1).
If you were selling this product for more than a year, then you were not entitled to a patent, per 35 USC 102(a) and 102(b)(1)(A). Neither was your competitor (edit: it looks like they filed less than a year after you made it public--they possibly would be safe under 102(b)(1)(b), if they publicly disclosed it before you and else than a year before filing), but unless you are willing to invest SERIOUS money, I don't believe there's much you can do to at least invalidate their patent.
If they made some public disclosure first (and it was less than 1 year before filing), then they could in theory still be entitled to a patent (under 35 USC 102(b)(1)(B) ).
It has to be before their earliest filing date, which might have been a provisional patent. Also, check the claims of their patent carefully, it's common for those to be very narrow, and you may not be infringing anyway.
2. Check the earliest priority date of their patent to be sure it is later than this date. They may have filed a provisional patent before the main patent.
1. Be sure you have good documentation that you sold these publicly, or had some similar public disclosure of the invention (such as advertising it on a website, or soliciting customers), and when this occurred. archive.org, other records, etc.
