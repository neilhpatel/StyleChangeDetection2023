I can't help but admire her. She knew a group of guys wanted to harm her and she worked with the FBI to draw those assholes out. That is so bad ass!
She makes hard decisions that are for the good of our state and democracy. I voted for her and if she ran for president, she can count on my vote.
I live in MI and I cannot express how happy I am that my vote helped to keep her in office! I have a ‘Michigan Militia’ compound near me, about 20mins. 2 of the guys involved in the attempt to start a new era Civil War and kidnap her, were actually from that compound. (Also, the “compound” is just a raggedy ass fence and 3 double wide trailers cut and welded to make one huge trashy trailer.).
I get it. Your ego can't handle the idea that you're no more special than the other 8 billion people on the planet. So, you pick a religion, pick a stance, and feel superior.
I’m religious, and also pro choice. Want to know how I keep both states of mind simultaneously? Separation of church and state. It is a system explicitly laid out in the foundations of this country.
Following christ is not the same as following the bible. The bible was written by man. God doesn’t live in church, he lives in your essence. You are born knowing right from wrong, you dont need it to be taught to you. The teachings of the church are warped and corrupted teachings from man, not god. The bible has been around for how long? And there are how many different variations of it? You cant take a single word in that storybook as being the word of god. Think outside the box.
