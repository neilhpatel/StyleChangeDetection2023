Accommodations for one person doesn’t automatically mean it’s approval for everyone. Ada accommodations are meant to be decided on a case by case basis. Some are common enough that there’s case law about it.
WFH isn't always reasonable. It depends on your job/role. A consultation with an ADA lawyer can look into your particular disability and your workplace and help work towards a resolution.
I have sent multiple emails to HR about why I need my specific disability, and how I am able to work while managing said disability.
Hi! Thank you for such a detailed reply. To clear a few things up, my disability is definitely real and they have seen first hand how bad it can be. They have had to have the ems services out at least 5 times in the span of 4 months because I pass out. My doctors notes have explained in detail why I need the accommodation and what my disability requires me to have for medical equipment.
Thank you. I find it odd that my manager who uses the same systems can wfh and I am not able to. The main reason seems to be "the pandemic is almost over". They keep saying it over and over to me. The pandemic has nothing to do with my request, right?
