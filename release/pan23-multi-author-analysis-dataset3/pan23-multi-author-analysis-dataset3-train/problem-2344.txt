A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.
It is flat out an intentional and effective usurping of democracy and ignoring the votes of the people.
“One potential takeaway from [the midterms] is that the US is a center left country with a gerrymandering problem.”.
"We have redistricting coming up and the Republicans control most of that process in most of the states around the country. That alone should get us the majority back.” - Rep Ronny Jackson (Republican).
A direct quote from a Republican that they intended to use redistricting to get the majority back… and that’s not enough evidence, of course.
But, they also have to be realistic, as a GOP majority in the House, no matter how small, is still a majority, and the GOP operates more in lock-step than the Democrats.
I think that's because mainstream TV owner's like gridlock and close elections more than either party - despite their advertised biases.
