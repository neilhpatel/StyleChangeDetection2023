To begin with it's worth noting that there are pretty big differences within the writing of Chinese varieties - differences in syntax, and using words with different origins would result in a difference in the written forms between two varieties.
But the Chinese writing system obscures pronunciation - two varieties may pronounce the word for a concept differently, but if the two words have the same etymological origin, they will use the same character. (c.f. Mandarin ni and Cantonese nei - both written 你).
This is the same with Chinese dialects. A Cantonese person would not be able to verbally communicate with a person who speaks Hakka. However, both dialects use the same writing standard (vocabulary and grammar) in Chinese.
I think the reason why you may find my question confusing is because you may not be familiar with Chinese dialects.
I'm interpreting your question as "why do European language look more distinct than Chinese languages when written down".
Are you asking why Europeans never implemented a single alphabet to underpin all of their languages?
Or are you asking why Europeans sharing the Latin alphabet diverged to include unique characters (e.g. the Spanish ñ, the Scandinavian ø, the German ß)?
