If you require masks and some customers can't wear them, no doctors note helps with why you have people wearing masks.
There's no common widespread medical exception to mask wearing. If someone had severe trigeminal neuralgia and was sensitive to things on their face, this may be a reason, but again, this is very uncommon. These patients should be willing to wear another form of face covering like a shield (although these are far less effective, and it would be reasonable to disallow these as well).
"For the health and safety of our employees and patrons, all individuals entering the shop or participating in any games/tournaments must wear a mask that covers their mouth and nose. If for any reason you are unable to comply with this request, you may call ahead to place orders for curbside delivery, or view recorded games on our YouTube channel.".
However if any of these thoughtless guests pay any sort of membership fee to come and participate, you'd probably be best off just giving them a prorated refund for the remainder of their time.
