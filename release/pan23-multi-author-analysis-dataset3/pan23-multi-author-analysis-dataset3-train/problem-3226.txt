Buying goods at one price, and selling them at a markup, is not a crime except very limited circumstances. Even in those circumstances (say, scalping tickets in a state that dosen't allow that), if you threaten someone at gunpoint in order to take their property you are committing a serious crime.
There is no state that would consider selling a GPU at a markup a crime on the sellers end regardless.
It is absolutely still armed robbery (you are armed, and forcing them to give you property. Regardless of if you give them any amount of money, if they did not consent to the sale at that price. You can not legally obtain said consent with the threat of force.).
