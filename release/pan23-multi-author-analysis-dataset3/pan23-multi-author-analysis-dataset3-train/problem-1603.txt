To give a stylized example, one can imagine a society where everyone is maximally poor (say, 1000 people earning $1 per day, which we can take to be bare bones subsistence) except for one ruler who extracts all surplus production (which amounts to $10 per day). This society will appear to be extremely equal, measured by either the relative or absolute measures of income inequality above. But in some very important sense, this society is maximally unequal; nobody except the one person earns more than subsistence. If the ruler tried to extract more revenue, people would starve, which is not sustainable in the long run. This then is the stylized case for most societies before the modern period, where measured absolute and relative inequality are both low, but yet, most people are extremely poor, and the elite take a very large share of what is available to take.
So perhaps that's it: The inequality in the income/wealth of the members of a society is a different concept than the concentratio of income/wealth by some members of that society.
When it comes down to inequality perhaps people care less about the "distance" between them and others in their purchasing power, and more about the concentration that some have of the total yearly income or wealth of that society.
So in summary, what I'm getting from this is that inequality may seem to be always increasing, as long as wealth in general is increasing for society as a whole. It's just a product of the mathematics, analogous to the growth of information or population, and not a sign of increasing injustice by itself. But the measurement by LM&W, designed to measure pre-modern societies for inequality, would conclude that the modern day is one of the least unequal, because of how far most people are from subsistence level.
One problem is that comparing the "purchasing power" of epochs with completely different technologies tells us more about poverty than about inequality.
