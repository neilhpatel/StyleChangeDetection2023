No. Collection agents have some communication requirements. Creditors do not. You owe the money by virtue of you owing. That doesn’t change based on whether or not they remind you that you owe.
What is almost certain is that the debt didn’t simply disappear. A company with receivables, either continues to collect them or sells them for value.
It sounds like you contractually owed the $1,300, they talked about forgiving it, and then you left them old if the bag on the other amount. In most cases then yes, that’s legal.
Is that even legal? The extra $1300 was for a month of rent I already paid when I moved in. It would be a double payment. I have a lease that states this directly and proof of the payments. If the old company messed up and told them they are entitled to that full $2500, it sounds like the extra $1300 should be owed by them, not by me.
They already did when they sent you a bill for the $2500 you owed them. You know it exists. They know it exists. And you can expect collections to know it exists if you don't pay.
