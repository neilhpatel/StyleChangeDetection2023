edit: Also just remembered another funny Dahua feature. With other non-Chinese brands, NVR user account credentials are typically managed by you/your users. Meaning that if you lose your password, and if you never setup any password recovery method, you're out of luck and probably need to factory reset the system to be able to use the NVR again. Think of it as your Windows PC. Lose password? Tough stuff. Probably need to format the PC.
And how do you trust any previous/future system/camera updates/firmware upgrades to not have any backdoors/hidden exploits?
If an IT tech/contractor at a government department doesn't know that P2P is a security threat, we probably have bigger problems than a few cameras...
I presume the mass usage of China made cameras in public offices is down to budget managers/bean counters having the final say when ordering technology rather than security experts. In the long run an own goal for China but $B's made in the short/medium term. I suppose now they shift manufacturing to a third country to avoid the "Made in China" stigma...buyer beware.
