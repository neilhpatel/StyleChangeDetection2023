Seeing as you will be a landlord living in the same unit as your tenant, making them a boarder, make sure you understand how that changes the legal situation. Laws are more protective of landlords when they have boarders rather than regular tenants, so if you break up and want her gone there are different rules and timelines to follow.
Your rights as a landlord are important to know, but your limitations and responsibilities are even more important. If someone refuses to leave, it ends up in court. That's the only way it can end. If you research all landlord tenant laws you will see everything that can end in a big legal fiasco.
You don't lose the house if you break up with a boyfriend/girlfriend unless you put them on the deed for some crazy reason.
You can't. You can have them sign a lease, but if they violate the lease you will have to sue them or find replacements. You need to research landlord and tenant laws for Texas because you are their landlord. If you already told them they are moving in, are you going to have them back it up a bit while you get the paperwork in order?
A big legal fiasco would be that your girlfriend stop paying rent, months go by, finally you break up, you try to get her out, but you lock her out. She sues you and she wins.
