This is the correct answer imo. Pay to get the car out now, in order to mitigate damages, THEN sue both the parties involved with this illegal tow and let them each try and convince a judge that the other party is responsible.
It seems like the cops would go with OP to the towing company and tell them they had stolen property that they were obligated to immediately return, and then the towing company could sue the property management company to recover their own damn damages.
It's baffling to me that the answer is that OP has a duty to mitigate damages when OP was 100% the victim of other people's seemingly unlawful behavior. (I generally can't just take your stuff or ask someone else to take your stuff who will then demand you pay them to get it back.).
2. Your possible options for recovering damages are to either: sue the towing company for illegal towing (not recommended, probably not worth the effort or money spent on a civil suit) or to contact the property management company and try to recoup fees outside of court before escalating.
INAL but had something very similar happen to me (an illegal tow, was well within my rights to be parked where I was).
