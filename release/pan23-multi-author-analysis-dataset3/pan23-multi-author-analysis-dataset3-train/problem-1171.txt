I mean, it's already well into American airspace and was in Canadian for quite a while. It would be a bit of a pain in the ass to shoot down at that altitude but it could definitely be done.
I'm not sure that anyone actually cares that much though. It's a balloon. It isn't like it is going to get any surveillance data that satellites couldn't already provide.
Can one of you mega smart people who think this is some sort of a spy device explain why they would do this rather than use the many satellites they already have looking at the globe?
But use your brain. You think they sent an unguided intercontinental balloon to just randomly grab some LiDAR imagery (that they can get from satellites), risking international incidents with whatever countries it drifts over?
Every country in the world has satellites up in the sky, legitimately able to manouver and literally SPY on anything they want in the world, but China is going to use a balloon, something almost completely uncontrollable once it hits high-altitude air streams, to spy on the west.
Perhaps they didn't tell you about a Chinese spy balloon because the very idea of a SPY balloon is utterly ridiculous.
Are you implying it isn’t a spy balloon? Or that my government shouldn’t have disclosed it because you find it a bit silly and outdated? I think they have a real duty to let us know when these things happen.
I’m Canadian, our government didn’t bother to tell us there was a Chinese spy balloon in our airspace we are only finding out retroactively that it passed through Canadian airspace.
