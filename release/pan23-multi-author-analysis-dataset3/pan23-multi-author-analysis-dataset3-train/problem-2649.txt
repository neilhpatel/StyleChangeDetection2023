So you're saying that if II walked in my apartment and it took me awhile to find our ID's, they woukd have had the legal right to walk into my apartment? Because from what I've read and researched, a foot in the doorway is equivalent to crossing the threshold and that they cannot do that unless invited or have a warrant.
Fair enough. I'm mainly asking for possible future incidents. This was the only time cops have ever been called on my fiance and I and after he told me about it and everytime I've thought about it since I get this weird feeling about it. Like an almost sick/angry/violated type of feeling about it. Mostly I'd like to know if I can tell the officers to remove their foot or not.
But I do understand how there is no action for me to pursue a suit for infringement of rights, I dont want that. I just want to know if a cop has to listen to me if I say "Please remove your foot from my doorway, I'm going to quickly grab that document." I'm not saying I would lock it, run, or be suspicious. I just don't feel like they they should be allowed a peep into my private home unless I choose to let them. I guess it's a minor control issue/general distrust of cops thing.
Not a lawyer, but this is why people suggest not talking to the police. That's not easy when they knock on your door. It's ok to talk through a window instead of opening the door. It's also ok to record the interaction, just in case. It's also also ok to not say more than you need to. "I'm ok, thanks for checking, am I free to go?".
