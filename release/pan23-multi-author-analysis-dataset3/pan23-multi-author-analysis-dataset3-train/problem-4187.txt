You say that islam is seen as the original religion of humanity and tied to black identity, how did they confront the fact Africa had many religions such as Yoruba that had no tie to Islamic thought?
/u/USReligionScholar has mentioned the criticisms that were actually levelled against the NoI, and /u/swarthmoreburke explained the nature of Islam's entry into West Africa, so I'll try to answer the final part of your question: why Islam?
While you wait for an answer specific to your question, you may be interested in these answers by u/Commustar which explore aspects of Islam's history in sub-Saharan Africa.
_Muslim Societies in African History_ by David Robinson, particularly chapter 3 "Islamization of Africa" and chapter 4 "Africanization of Islam".
Talking about the "Arab Conquests" in 600-800 AD silences the next 1000 years where there are processes of Africanizing Islam and Islamizing Africa (to borrow from David Robinson).
_The History of Islam in Africa_ chapter 8 "Islam in Africa under French Colonial Rule" by Jean-Luis Trigaud details French colonial state's efforts to control and marginalize power of Islam in French colonies.
And despite the cooperative (or at least non-confrontational) attitude of Muslim rulers with Colonial authority, French and British colonial perspective was initially very alarmed at the potential power of Islam to disrupt their colonial mission, and consistently sought to minimize the power and influence of religious orders and leaders.
The association of Islam with anti-colonial politics would only be compounded by the mid-20th century, when the "non-aligned movement" began to properly coalesce and as Muslim regimes (among others) deliberately refused to situate themselves within the Western international political framework. According to Curtis, this identification of Islam with the Third World and its causes helped temporarily minimize theological disagreements within the Nation of Islam, insofar as neocolonial threats were regarded as more pressing.
