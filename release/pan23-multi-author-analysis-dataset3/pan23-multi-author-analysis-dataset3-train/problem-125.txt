Oh my gosh this is fantastic I was going off the novel and not the film, but it looks like I was also fooled by Mr Bennet's thriftiness.
I didn't quite mean 'poor ' when I said humble, just that it seemed very different from Mr Darcy's huge, slightly lonely stately home when she visits Pemberley (compared to growing up with 4 sisters! I know 1 is quite enough for me).
I know. I said that. Mr Bennet was an esquire (think like a squire, basically; one step down from a knight). Nowadays we think “Esquire” means lawyer, but words change over time and Mr Bennet wasn’t a lawyer (or a barrister), but was an Esquire.
I don’t know much about the history behind wealthy women’s duties post-marriage, but I am a literary snob, so I wanted to clarify some things about your assumptions about the Bennets. Namely, Elizabeth Bennet did not grow up poor, or even humble.
It's important to note that Elizabeth Bennet didn't really grow up in a much more humble home. With an income of £3,000 a year, the Bennet family was extremely wealthy by most English people's standards. (Even by other Austen heroines' standards! The sensible Elinor Dashwood considers £1,000 a year to be a very substantial income.) There are two things that make the Bennets come off as relatively humble: the dowries set out for the daughters in their parents' marriage settlement, and the culture of their family home.
