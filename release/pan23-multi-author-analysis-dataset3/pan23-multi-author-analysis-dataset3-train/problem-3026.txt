If you want to advocate for a law that says landlord doesn’t get rent in a month he makes improper entry I’m sure you’d find support. Especially amongst lawyers who would get richer on the arguments. But that law doesn’t exist today.
You’re right. You can remind him of his obligation to provide notice before entry for the remaining duration of the tenancy.
That landlord used the wrong word doesn’t change anything substantive. You were in a month to month holdover and that holdover is being ended on notice.
The notice to vacate can be given any day of the month and takes effect on the 30th or 60th day from that point. Regarding the landlords entry, Texas has pretty poor laws regarding this. No Texas statute addresses landlord’s entry, but Texas courts have held that a landlord may not enter the rental property unless entry is authorized by the lessee. Once a residential property is leased, the landlord’s ability to enter the rental unit is diminished. Since no Texas laws state when a landlord can enter a rental property, the rules default to the lease agreement. Some lease agreements give a list of reasons when the landlord can enter and other leases do not mention landlord’s entry at all. Does your lease address landlord entry? If it is not addressed in the lease then there are only very specific times the landlord can enter without notice. 1) to make repairs requested by the tenant. 2) In the event of an emergency inside of the dwelling. And 3) If the landlord is going to post a notice either under the landlord’s lien law or when demanding possession in an eviction.
On what day did he provide you with the eviction notice? It's July 1st and you stated the notice was dated the 15th of June. Just curious if the notice had been served today or on the 15th.
