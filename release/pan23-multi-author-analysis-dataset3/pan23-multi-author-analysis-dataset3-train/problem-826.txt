We should probably begin with a more basic question: did the Greeks really believe that their gods lived on Olympus?
So - having determined that many Greeks (at least in the post-classical era) probably didn't believe that the gods actually lived on Olympus - did anybody climb the mountain?
It is likely that the ancient Greeks who lived close enough to Mount Olympus to climb it did not think that the gods literally physically lived on top of the mountain in exactly the same way that humans might live there.
There is overwhelming evidence that the ancient Greeks not only definitely climbed Mount Olympus, but that, at least in late antiquity, this was a relatively common occurrence & that people even sometimes offered sacrifices to the gods up there.
Certainly, some people in ancient Greece did believe that the gods literally lived atop Mount Olympus in ornate palaces, eating ambrosia & drinking nectar just like they are described as doing in the Homeric epics, but the ones who were climbing Mount Olympus evidently did not believe this. It is likely that many of 'em thought of Mount Olympus as more of a metaphorical home for the gods, rather than their actual literal abode.
I must confess, the thing that stuck out to me most in this was the point that the Romans also used Olympus as the heavens.
Here, at least, there is a clear distinction between Olympus and the home of the gods. The distinction in even clearer in Lucian's Icaromennipus, a satirical second-century text about a man who decides to fly to the home of the gods. Mennipus (the protagonist) doesn't bother with Olympus; he sets sail directly into the sky, and figures that the gods live very far off indeed. To quote his calculations:
