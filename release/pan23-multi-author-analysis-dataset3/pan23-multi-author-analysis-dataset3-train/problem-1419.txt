Why on earth would you make this about the Russian "national character"? All regimes through history justify their conquest and imperialism with the language of defense and victimization. This is just propaganda 101. Portraying millions of Russians as fundamentally having inferiority complexes is lazy stereotyping. Blame Putin, his regime, and their actions, not the "Russian national character" for Ukraine.
At this point, nothing the Russian Leadership says or does has anything to do with us in this context.
Okay, bohemian Russian-bot, but why not make good on such a deal, when instead, you have alluded to “control” over European energy, and/or open war on the land you intend to claim?
It isn't strictly for the sake of conquering, they have sound reasoning for wanting to do this... all that said, Fuck Russia for starting a war unprovoked.
For one, do you really think a Russian bot would be allowed to say fuck Russia for what they're doing.
"Fuck the cheating motherfucking Russians," Strzok said in a text to Page in July 2016. "Bastards. I hate them.".
"I think they're probably the worst, Fucking conniving cheating savages. At statecraft, athletics, you name it. I'm glad I’m on Team USA.".
