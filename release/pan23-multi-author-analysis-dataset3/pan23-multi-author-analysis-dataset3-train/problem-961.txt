"In one day, Mr. Buffett made twice as much money as it would cost to guarantee 15 paid sick days a year to every rail worker in America," the Vermont senator said. "The greed of the rail industry must end.".
"Warren Buffett, the owner of BNSF Railway's parent company, became $1.38 billion richer yesterday," Sanders tweeted on Wednesday, referring to the boost to Buffett's net worth from Berkshire Hathaway stock closing higher on Tuesday.
Sen. Bernie Sanders has called out Warren Buffett for making billions of dollars, while rail employees are fighting for paid sick leave and better working conditions.
