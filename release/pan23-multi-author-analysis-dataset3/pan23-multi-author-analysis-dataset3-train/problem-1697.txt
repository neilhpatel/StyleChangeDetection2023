If you could supply a few nearby tribes, I could probably narrow down some sources that'd be more pertinent to the peoples you're closest to since a lot of my library focuses more on Coast Salishan groups in the Seattle area and northwards.
Tacoma Salish (like Puyallups, of which I'm enrolled) are pretty different than Vancouver Salish, who tend to have a lot more direct cultural overlap with Chinookan groups on account of their closer proximity. As in you might've found a village in the Vancouver area in the Old Days that appears Chinookan (squat plank houses and skeletal figures in their artwork), but spoke a Salishan language.
As such, a book that I'd recommend for Chinookan peoples would be "Chinookan Peoples of the Lower Columbia" by Kenneth Boyd, et al. I also have Columbia River ancestry (Wasco) and found it rather enlightening since most literature on NWC cultures focus on SE Alaska, BC, and WA from Seattle on up.
Also, if you’re in Washinon or Oregon, both states have specific resource websites with Native Nation curricula that includes a directory of local tribes. For Washinon it’s and Oregon it’s . Good luck!
Thank you! I’m being a bit vague because I’m bouncing between jobs but I was in the Tacoma area, I am in the Vancouver area, and probably will be back in the Tacoma area.
