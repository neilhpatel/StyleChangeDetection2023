They never harp on Republican lies, and they hit Democrats every word like a scholarly debate. The candidate they like has a friendly smiling picture, the new/outside candidate has a mean face.
The so called "liberal media" is actually for the already-rich. Every little headline trick is needed to keep just enough rumors going for voters to doubt progressive ideas.
They know enough people are simple and enough are disengaged to squeak out conservative wins in Congress. Fuck the President, the rich know the Senate controls their regulations and taxes.
Voters: "Wow, I like clean river and minority rights, but Democrats don't shout down trans boys naked in front of my daughter in the locker room ...or BLM riots. Didn't Democrats say: Defund the Police? Police suck, but that's just weird, we need some cops. I guess they need a wake-up call, I'll vote Red this time to check Biden.".
Very well put. Corporate media as a whole is completely based off of the advertising profit model and the advertisers don't care as much about people being well informed but very much care about whether people are engaged as the channel goes into ad breaks.
