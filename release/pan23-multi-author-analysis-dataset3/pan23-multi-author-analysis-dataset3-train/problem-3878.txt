As a follow-up to point 2, take photographs of the tree's condition before you perform any trimming and after you have it professionally trimmed. This will provide you with cover in the event your neighbour blames you for damaging the tree.
You can trim the tree up to the property line so long as you can do so without trespassing on your neighbor's property or causing injury to the tree. You don't need their permission. If you speak to a local arborist they will be very familiar with relevant statutes and bylaws in your area.
As for the tree branch that broke in the storm, is the tree okay, and was the branch that broke over your property? If so, it doesn't really matter whether you did it or the storm did since you would be allowed to trim it anyway. If the tree has been significantly damaged then they could take you to small claims over the value of the tree and they would have to prove it was you and not the storm, which it sounds like you have good evidence to contest.
I wouldn't worry about that at all. You have a picture you took right after it happened and you can show that there was a storm when it happened. I would be very surprised if they made an actual issue of that.
