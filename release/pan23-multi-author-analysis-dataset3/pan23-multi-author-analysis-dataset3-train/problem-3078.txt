You’re right. There’s no way for them to tell the under 21 military that they can be sent to a war by the government but they aren’t allowed to vote for who that government is. It is absolutely appalling that this used to be the case which is why the protests were so big and loud but stripping it away from the young people in this day and age would devastate their chances of stepping foot in office and they would lose the rather large young conservative voting block that makes up a large portion of our military men and women.
I hope they keep talking about it though! Let the conservative youth know exactly who the Republican Party is. They might be conservative but they aren’t nearly as conservative as the old conservative base and pushing them too far is just pushing them either not to vote or to vote for moderate Democrats.
The GOP current “traditional values ideology” is dying, their only way out of it is embracing change which they will else they will hand democrats a super majority by 2032.
Since both parties also slide left to accommodate that, old democrat voters sometimes found themselves changing affiliation. However, the Republican party right now has brought their own move to the left to a grinding halt. And that's why none of the Gen Z voters voting Blue now will be changing their affiliation in a couple decades as some people seem to think. Trump managed to fuck up so much more for the Republicans than most people realized...
