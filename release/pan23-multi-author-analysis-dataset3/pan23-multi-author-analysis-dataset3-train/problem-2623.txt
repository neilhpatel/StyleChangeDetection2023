The thing is these corporations always fold immediately if you actually have a serious government staffed with individuals who are principled. They're the biggest fucking cowards in the world.
The majority of America is force-fed their opinion by corporate-owned news conglomerates. The average American is crippling ill-informed and routinely supports corrupt politicians who nakedly operate against their constituents interests, often to no detriment to their own reelection.
You can fix shit. If you had a government filled with politicians as serious as Bernie is about correcting our largest issues, our issues would be solved so quickly.
The people in Ohio voted for all of the people that tore apart the safety measures for a multi-billion dollar railroad company that just drove many metric tons of poisonous chemicals into their back yards and killed an entire county.
They're not complex. It's money in politics, corrupt politicians, and a lack of accountability for corporations.
Whatâ€™s especially frustrating to me is just how many of these issues would be solved by simply taking corporate money out of politics. There would still be plenty of problems to be sure, but it would be a huge blow against all the corruption and fuckery.
That's why they spend all their time and energy bribing the politicians and convincing the public not to vote, or vote for corrupt fucking hacks.
