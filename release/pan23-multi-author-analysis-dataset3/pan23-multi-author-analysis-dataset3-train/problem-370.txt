Same here I set my thermostat to 50F, 10C because I'd be home alone for about a month. Granted, it's really cold in the house, but I have a space heater and a ton of blankets in the one room I use that has a bed and computer so the one room stays warm but my overall power/gas usage is like a tenth of what I would normally use I've turned it into a game to see how little I can use.
That just means your neighbours heat plenty, maybe even a bit more than normal because your flat is colder and leaching a bit, I do the same, having old people living in the floor below you has some drawbacks, but big advantages this winter.
True, but Iâ€™ve lived in a well insulated tower block that also had a lot of south facing glazing and it got so hot during the summer and held the heat in.
You get some heat from your neighbours walls, those are not insulated and either brick or reinforced concrete so there's a decent heat transfer. Also most of those blocks are centrally heated or have district heating so you get hot pipes running through your flat anyway. Also the heating bill has a shared component which is usually more than half of your bill anyways, so you're paying even if you're "not using" and keeping your radiators turned off.
