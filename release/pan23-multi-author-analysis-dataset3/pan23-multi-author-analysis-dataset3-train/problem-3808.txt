This has nothing to do with American discomfort. In fact, it has nothing to do with discomfort at all, people WILL die without heating and cooling. That’s the world we live in, like it or not.
Are you willing to turn off your power? Would you rather the world financially support regimes like in Russia and Iran? Should millions die from exposure so that we can shut off all fossil fuels tomorrow?
I’m not even saying get rid of all fossil fuels immediately, its fucking common sense at this point. We are live watching our country get left behind. I am just so sick of the democrats having terrible messaging and not getting behind winning ideas.
Honestly, the real solution (yet one that both parties lack the will and gall to go through with) is a large scale investment in green tech, rebuilding our electric grids to support a sustainable future, partially funded by tax increases on fossil fuels, as well as a removal of their subsidies (and harsh fines for the market gouging they have been doing). I would have no problem with investments in oil to help with the transition, but the green focus isn’t there on the level it needs to be so this kind of news is disappointing.
The gop is trash and will never get on board, but the dems are cowards because they say they are pro environment and then let the conservatives dictate the narrative. They could easily dominate the conversation with simple talking points like “The GND is a jobs program. American Energy, American Ingenuity, American Jobs. It will let us free ourselves from countries like SA and Russia, and we will even be able to sell/lease the tech that we develop to other countries.”.
