It's shocking to me how long partition-type succession existed in Europe for when it is so bad for the stability of the realm. However, we have hindsight, and access to incomparable amounts of information that medieval rulers obviously did not.
Sure, it was probably more difficult to control the peasantry but surely the nobles were very unlikely to embrace a heresy?
What the peasantry understood from religion was often at odds with what was prescribed by theologians. Joan of Arc's trial splendidly shows how highly educated members of the university didn't understand how the Christian faith was lived and experienced by the common people. Theologians were high on the idea of discovering the hidden messages and symbols behind worldly matters and realities to access the realm of God, meanwhile the peasantry believed in God with their heart. That brink was partially overcome by late medieval spiritual movements, centered on the idea of imitating Christ and focusing on his life on Earth as a man, but those very movements could also be seen as the root of the early modern protestantism.
Could you expand more on what distinctives of the Reformation (more broadly than Luther) pulls from the intellectual developments of the Middle Ages?
Did this gradually lead to the view that scripture and Latin itself were sorta the purview of the educated enough to be "incorruptible" essentially?
Do you think the gradual loss of general Latin comprehension among the laity led to a more aristocratic view of scripture and scriptural knowledge?
