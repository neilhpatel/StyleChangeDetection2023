The police absolutely could charge you with a state or federal level FELONY for this. But you are correct that you probably don't need to shell out for a lawyer until the police arrest you. Just don't say ANYTHING to the police without a lawyer if they follow up, invite you to explain your side of things, etc.
If you are contacted again, decline to speak to them without a lawyer. If you are charged with a crime, hire a lawyer. If you somehow decide you want to speak to the cops, hire a lawyer and follow his advice.
That said, OP needs to not talk to the police without a lawyer and in the unlikely event he gets charged, he needs to get a lawyer.
I have had one client where I thought, "fuck he should have talked to the police." Sure his case got dismissed, but he would have never been charged. It is extremely unlikely you are that 1/10000, so STFU though.
I doubt anything will come. I imagine the police asking me to come in was to help his dept. budget arresting and fining people. Ex. if you come back we will probably arrest, but not worth worth pursuing.
They will come and arrest you if it escalates. Most likely if that happens, you'd be taken in and processed and released on bond and given a court date.
