As for the others on the planes — it's not clear they had a sense of it until the Hiroshima mission. (The Nagasaki mission, of course, knew about the success of the Hiroshima mission, and its payload, before they went out.) They knew they were part of a top secret detail whose purpose was not yet fully revealed to them. They knew that they'd be dropping physically large bombs of some sort — they practiced with "Pumpkins," which were the size of the Fat Man bomb, but just filled with conventional explosives. And there were a lot of scientists involved. So it's clear that some of them put two-and-two together, as the idea of atomic bombs was something known popularly before the war.
Paul Tibbets, the captain of the B-29 that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, the _Enola Gay_, definitely knew what they were dropping. He was in charge of figuring out, in essence, how to drop it successfully (and in this role, he picked his own men, helped design the modified B-29s, and did a number of other key mission-relevant details).
To my knowledge, the only "contingency plan" they had was to ditch the bomb in the ocean if they needed to return without dropping it (they did not have enough fuel to bring it back with them). A crash would destroy the bomb (and in the case of the Hiroshima bomb, detonate it).
Like, ok, I know this is a big bad bomb, lots of destruction, but just destruction they had already saw a lot during the war at that time. I understand that the moral problem with atomic bomb is not how huge the explosion is, but the effects in the people that survived the blast, the radiation in the area, horrible deaths due to radiation and so on. So, this people knew those "side effects" of the bomb, of for them it was just a big kaboom?
