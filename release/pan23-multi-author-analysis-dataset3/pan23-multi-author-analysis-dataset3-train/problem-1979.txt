I think even more than any emotional issues is that it's just a grift. These people, like Candace Owens and this guy, are generally con artists and frauds, and selling out to nutjob Republicans is just another con to them.
Great job, you've invented state-controlled media, imagine what Trump would have done with that if he'd had the power to shut down news networks he didn't like.
They have no morals or principles and anyone looking for a good grift for power and money these days can see that Republicans are easy prey.
They love the idea that Democrats must be held accountable for lies but that Republicans do not. This is why they don’t care if their side lies but they lose their minds if a Democrat so much as stutters.
They enjoy the idea of lying with impunity. They don’t see it as being lied to but as their politicians making a mockery of their opposition. They see it as a flex. The more egregious the lie, the more it feels like they’re pulling a fast one on “the bad guys”.
Frankly the most troubling thing is why people who run for office feel the need to lie and some of the stuff they lie about.
Hearing that a GOP member lied (among other things) is becoming so commonplace it’s nauseating. These garbage people need to be held accountable for their actions.
