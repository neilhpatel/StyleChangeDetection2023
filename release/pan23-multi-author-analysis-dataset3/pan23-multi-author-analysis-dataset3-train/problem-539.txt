They never said it was a Missile Defense System more likely its a radar tower Putin probably scared out of his mind that CIA or some other group will come in the night.
That's why the US has been careful to deliver defensive weapons or ones without the range to threaten Moscow. But now the Ukraninans have built their own drones with an 800 mile range - capable of hitting Moscow.
Because this is about them feeling threatened. Us putting US military hardware in Ukraine is their "Bay of Pigs". I mean pretty much the only seaport they can launch an aircraft carrier from is in Ukraine. And on top of that you want to put US missiles within striking range of Moscow??
Anti-air is a null sum game. If they had to move an anti-air battery to Putin's house, it had to come from somewhere else. So, one less anti-air battery in Crimea.
True, but I was thinking about the air base in Russia that was attacked. That seemed pretty successful even though it was much deeper inside enemy territory. But that may have been due to them simply sending enough drones to overwhelm the air defenses at the base. Which is a viable strategy , imo.
