We do have enough Typhoons, I’m not aware that the US are needed to patrol our airspace.. but he was specifically asked about f35 jets according to the article. afaik we only currently have the naval variant operating from aircraft carriers and yes they would be impractical to send.
You infer rather a lot from what he did and didn’t say. My point is, we have plenty of typhoons, if aircraft are not been sent there are possibly a lot of reasons why not. The US has not committed to sending jets either.
If it looks like it the wars going to drag on I can see more support, such as fighter jets, being supplied.
The U.K. government would be stupid to hand over planes if the wars going to be over by Christmas. However if it looks like it’ll go on past 2025 then I can see jets being sent.
That’s how I believe the Ukrainians would use the aircraft. The U.K. sending planes wouldn’t be about the actual planes, it’s a political message about supporting Ukraine.
The Ukrainians will just use them for training, they won’t be near the front lines. If we send jets, then other countries will.
