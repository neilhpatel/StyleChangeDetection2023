Doing nice things as a diss would make the world so much better. "Thank you for the earthquake assistance you Greek fucks. Now please accept this $200 million trade agreement you bitch.".
Lmao. Turks can vote all they want for whoever they want, but the outcome will always be the Erdogan. Did you forget the coo? Is everyone’s Turkey info like 20 years old? Turkey is a good country with a bad dictator.
The Turkish government is a foul entity. The Turkish people on the other hand are kind hearted folks who deserve none of this and I wish them the best.
What’s not being talked about is the PM of Armenia ready to provide aid to Turkey, a relationship that needs no introduction.
Turkey provides aid to Greece when they need it, and vice versa. It has been like this for a long time, stop talking about things that you have no clue about.
In 1999 Greece helped out Turkey with İzmit Earthquake, less than a month later another quake happened in Athens. Greek consulates and embassy in Turkey had their phone lines jammed with Turks calling to find out if they could donate blood, and a guy even offered one of his kidneys.
