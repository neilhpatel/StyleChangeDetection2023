Can't care for their families, families will split apart as a result, and they will likely end up in the street on drugs/drunk or killing themselves. All for the glory of mother Russia. I'm sure the next 500k will be well armed and supplied given the current ones aren't.
The lucky ones are dead, the unlucky ones will spend the rest of their lives disfigured or missing arms and legs and unable to work. Being severely disabled in a country that doesn't give two shits about you is probably a fate worse than death in my opinion.
If they announce a full mobilization it's going to get worse. They will have to close the borders or lots of people will flee. I'm sure everyone in Russia knows someone who died or is ripped apart by this point, gonna make it a little less appealing to go.
We are witnessing the end of Russia as a meaningful player on the world stage and economy. They were already demographically terminal but this is going to leave massive gaps in their society and workforce that will echo through the next century at least. Unreal.
