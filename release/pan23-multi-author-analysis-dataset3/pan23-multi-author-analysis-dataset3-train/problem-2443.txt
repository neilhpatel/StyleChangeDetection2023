The question here is: is an announced pay reduction of 20% for employees who voluntarily work from home legal? And the answer is: probably.
And while I generally agree that the policy OP has described in their post prima facie doesn't violate federal laws, there are scenarios where this kind of policy, if not carefully overseen and implemented, can plant the employer in hot water: for example, de facto discrimination can become a concern if, for whatever reason the employer created or ignored/failed to mitigate result in mostly minority employees feeling pressured to take the work-from-home option at reduced pay.
Your statement is so broad that it is technically wrong. For example, an employer who treats an employee as exempt (i.e., "salaried") must pay that employee a minimum of $684/week, which works out to $17.10 an hour. Further, employees who work 30/week or 130 hours/month in most cases get other benefits that cannot be cut "porque si.".
Yes. Barring an employment contract, itâ€™s perfectly legal to lower any employees salary down to minimum wage, or the exempt minimum as the case may be.
