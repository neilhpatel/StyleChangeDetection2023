The Most Important Election Ever 3: The Vote Warriors™ is a pretty solid sequel, but my favorite will always be the 2016 original: The Most Important Election Ever: Abuela Rising™.
even if we assume that the whole "most important election ever" isn't just cynical hostage-taking and the dems actually believe this shit, it feels like a p bad situation to put yourself in if literally every single election is this massive existential crisis of unprecedented importance.
The 2000 election was literally stolen though, in a manner so flagrant that calling it a conspiracy is giving the theft too much credit. Mainstream dems almost immediately shut up about it and accepted it, legitimizing outright political fraud. Meanwhile in 2016 they threw a shit fit over foreigners not using the proper channels for dark money campaigning and cast doubt on the entire electoral process despite four years of investigations never yielding any evidence of vote tampering. Then in 2020 voting was the most secure ever and it was not only absurd but seditious to suggest voting might be compromised.
Because this is the first time ever Republicans are openly saying they want to throw out votes that are not for them and overturn elections. Hell, some GOP candidates are even campaigning on that message.
