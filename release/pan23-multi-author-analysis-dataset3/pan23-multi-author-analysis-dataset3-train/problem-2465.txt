As awful as this article is, biomass does produce more carbon than coal, while being deemed "renewable" as you can grow more biomass.
Biased source against biomass, not including net carbon capture from the growing of new biomass: (PDF warning).
My main problem is that doing biomass ends up with forest habitat destruction and has a massively long payoff period for carbon neutrality. Yes wood is renewable, but even going natural gas is going to result in less emissions if you just plant trees to offset the natural gas carbon emissions.
Granted, I'm on board with sustainable use, but typically biomass plants end up just needing such large inputs to generate sustained electricity that they end up consuming direct timber, not just recycled waste product.
And a facility that makes energy from biomass doesn't just generate electricity, it can also be used to supply steam and heat to other industries displacing the use of natural gas.
Biomass may release more CO2 per unit of energy than natural gas, but the source is sustainable, and when you look at life cycles and long-term environmental impact, it's better for the planet. The one problem biomass has is that it isn't very energy dense. Hence, it's limited to areas that have the ability to exploit and manage a responsible forestry plan.
