Harry started in a cavalry unit and deployed to Afghanistan but iirc served as forward air controller. But then he became an Apache pilot and went back.
He was an apache pilot. The Taliban were very rarely able to shoot down helicopters, especially at night. It’s very feasible that he was able to kill 25+ Taliban in this role. Many attack helicopters pilots would’ve killed alot more than that.
He flew with and directed helicopters. I think he did have a guard with him apparently, but it was a role he could do without their direct interference I presume.
Apparently there's a camera mounted on the guns so you can go back through the footage and count the dead.
I feel sorry for him but I always feel uncomfortable about airing dirty laundry in autobiographies you have to buy.
I definitely think it's questionable but I think his quotes are being taken out of context. It seems to me, based on the military's comments on the issue he's probably more reflecting on his time critically rather than with praise.
