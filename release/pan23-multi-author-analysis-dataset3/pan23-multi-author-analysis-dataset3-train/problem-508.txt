“Many Africans in regions without French influence view France as the enemy of Africa as a whole at this point”.
interestingly enough 3 years later, France and the French Africans are still yet to even begin talks to implement this, almost as if France doesn’t want to.
with numerous anti-france protests, multiple coups per year, government crackdowns, mass emigration, rampant terrorism and the fact that the french west african region remains the poorest in africa and on earth i don’t think it’s what the people want, staying tied to the euro and storing their reserves in france isn’t exactly helping the case.
but only countries that are (functioning) democracies are allowed to be in ECOWAS so as their governments continue to violently collapse they’re automatically suspended and all the perks are taken away, and since Nigeria has been paying the bills for the last 50 years nobody here seems to care anymore about what’s happening right next to us because it’s effectively a money drain and people tend to have this “run to your French masters for help” opinion, so we’ve all decided to move on with our own personal plans.
