Would have, could have. Maybe. But it wasn't. The government made a profit and the deal has been concluded. The government was paid back. It's not the governments buisness any more.
The German government made 134.5 million euro off a 9.5 million euro investment, and Lufthansa paid back all the money they borrowed. If the government was still holding the stock and Lufthansa still owed the money, that would be one thing, but that is not the case. If I was Lufthansa, I would tell the government to eat a bag of dicks.
I am pretty sure, although I am not a math genius, that €134.5 million will more than cover any interest accrued on €9.6 million over two years. If the German government is paying that high an interest rate on their debt, they are getting screwed. The German national debt doesn't figure into the equation. Also, did Lufthansa acrue interest on the money they borrowed? If the loan was paid back with interest, that's a moot point.
Except that was only one part of the bail out paid in a loan. Germany also paid off debt greater than the total market capitalization of Lufthansa at the time for just part of the company. A move many critics called a bit of a fucked up deal.
