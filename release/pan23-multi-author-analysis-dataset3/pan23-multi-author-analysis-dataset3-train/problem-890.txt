I think my main issue right now is lack of contact information for the Board. When they got elected, they inherited email addresses assigned by the management company to be used for contact. I have attempted to include them on my complaints, but the emails get returned as undeliverable. My SO was the one who talked to the President (who just told him to keep putting in complaints) and that was just a random encounter in the neighborhood. Otherwise, I have no clue which building or units they live in.
Only one of the three board members emails came back as undeliverable this time, I'll take that as a win for now. Also put the complaint in a "tug on the heart strings" kind of way, so we'll see if that helps at all. Included my video again, and I'm going to start taking video of the other times we have no water, so they can have a fresh reminder every day.
I'll start complaining more, daily if I need to, and I'll try including the emails for the board members again, and spend some time finding out how spread the problem is throughout the whole neighborhood. (So far, we've only confirmed 3 out of 31 buildings are having the water pressure issues.).
2. Talk to the Board of Directors and ask them, specifically, to direct the PM company to fix the water problems, or ask them to look into the water problems independently. The Board doesn't have to take you up on this, but your record of complaints not addressed might sway things.
