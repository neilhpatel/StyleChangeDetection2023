Quick answer is, there was no scholary sources talking about censoring classic literature; and this makes sense, considering the themes and availability of such documents.
Well "censorship" can mean either cutting the book or suppressing the book's availability (or both). While the book might not be edited by a censor, the access to it might be artificially obstructed - and that would be censorship and suppression too.
Could you speak to if there was any censorship changes made to that literature in order to fit North Korean norms, or was it just recontextualizing? Is there any examples of specific classic literature that was suppressed?
No, they do not censor classical literature. They use them in educations and even stress their importance, funding researches of them; but mostly to those which fits the political ideology of DPRK and makes the spirit of 'the people' to be nourished.
As I noted above, and as you can see from citations, all this was in light to strenhen the spirit and identity of 'the people'(민족) which is the core of DPRK's political identity alongside Socialism. And they are researched and teached in such a viewpoint; all aiming for the political ideology of DPRK.
