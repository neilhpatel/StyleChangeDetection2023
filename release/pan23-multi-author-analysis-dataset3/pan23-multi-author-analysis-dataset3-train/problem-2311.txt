If you read the quote he really wasn't talking about Twitter but the handful of media conglomerates - and private or public makes no difference, the government can force them to be broken up if they find they violate anti-trust laws.
But again, he wasn't even talking about breaking up Twitter but was asked a question about it and used it as a segue to breaking up large media conglomerates.
That's factually incorrect. Private companies, even a mom and pop bake shop, fall under antitrust laws.
This has nothing to do with existing antitrust law, anyway. The situation being described is that Elon Musk owns a controlling share of all these corporations. They are all separate and distinct corporate structures with no plans to merge.
Not saying it isn't \wrong\, and Bernie is calling for new laws regardless. It's just not what existing antitrust laws were intended to deal with.
The only exception would be in purely terms of antitrust issues. But there is no single organization that controls that much of "the media".
Sure, but Bernie seems to be implying that the government should do something about twitter. That would be a violation of Musk's free speech if it did.
But if he's saying that Elon Musk shouldn't be able to own twitter, then that can become problematic. I'm not sure I even understand how Elon is part of the discussion in terms of anti-trust stuff. He doesn't own multiple media companies, and there's no way to "break up" twitter, since it is one website.
