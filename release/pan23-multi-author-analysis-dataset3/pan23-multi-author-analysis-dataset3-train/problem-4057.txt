The same law stops early voting the Friday before the election. Which does give the counties more time to prepare for Tuesday's election (relocating equipment from the early sites and setting up the day of locations), so I'll give them a pass there (although the whole law was designed to reduce turn out of the "wrong" voters).
There will still be early voting, with the likely situation that urban counties will hold Sunday voting to counteract the limited Saturday voting. So that gives flexibility to people who can’t make it on Election Day and don’t want to or can’t vote by mail.
While I personally support as much ballot access as practicable and think arbitrary rules are stupid, we also have to stop treating our supporters as people without any agency. If people are motivated to vote, it’s fair to say they can do so.
Then there’s Election Day. If people miss early voting or can’t return their mail ballot in time, they can vote on Election Day. That may be difficult for people but the option is there if nothing else works out before.
