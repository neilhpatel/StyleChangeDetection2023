Become a corporate lobbyist after this term ends and becoming an independent will allow her to lobby for "moderate" Republicans. Republicans get about 2/3 of big money donations, so that's where the money is for lobbyists.
As I understand it, she was talking money from traditional Republican donors already. I think it why she sank the minimum wage bill.
Remember when she was campaigning as a progressive Democrat? At one event she eagerly explained to the audience how the reconciliation process works in circumventing the filibuster.
Yeah. It looks like the national Democrats (leadership, I meanâ€¦the progressives are out for blood) are going along with it and playing nice for now. No way to predict what Arizona Democrats are going to do.
Democrats do need to be careful though not to overplay their hand in Arizona. Everyone wants a progressive Democrat for this seat. And the Democrats have done reasonably well in Arizona lately. However, Arizona is NOT a far left state. Kari Lake was only 17,000 votes short in the governor race. If Sinema does run as an independent, I don't think anyone knows for sure how that's going to change the electorate. Analysts seem to be all over the map. Some say it will make little difference. Others say it will be a mess. And some say it will hand the seat the GOP. No one knows.
