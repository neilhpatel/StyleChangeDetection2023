Syria is a client of Iran, who would like to establish a land bridge to Lebanon and supply Hezbollah with strategically significant armaments to create a 2-front war dilemma for Israel while it finalizes its nuclear weapons capability.
(Quite possibly, the recent bomb attacks in Jerusalem, that resulted in the death of a Canadian citizen, were Iran's response to Israel's recent public comments softening its position on sending defensive missiles to Ukraine.).
It's hypocritical of you to accuse Israel of crimes against humanity for not endangering its existence by getting involved in a war between a nuclear power and its own bitter regional enemies, while these countries are actively supporting Russia and thereby directly supporting crimes against humanity:
Nothing you've said addressed anything I said. Sorry about your feelings. But how do you explain the broad support Israel enjoys in Congress and the US military if it's interests are as divergent from the USA's as you say they are?
Israel's support and subsequent stance make it an accessory after the fact to crimes against humanity. And your defense 'of Israel in this regard makes you morally bankrupt. You don't give a damn about humanity - all you care about is Israel and its increasingly authoritarian government.
