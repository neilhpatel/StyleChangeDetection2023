This directly contradicts what you say about liability issues. Why is that? Does it have anything to do with the fact that my employer is at fault?
It does not matter if an employer is at fault or negligent or if it was entirely out of their hand. WC is coverage for workplace injury in either case. It's insurance.
Assuming you are in the US, your employers workers comp will cover medical, and any missed work that you may be entitled to per state guidelines. WC is mandated for employers to carry to ensure that employees have medical costs covered, but the other side of the coin is you generally can not pursue personal injury for things like pain and suffering.
Workers compensation is a distinct type of personal injury action because it is mandated for most players to carry, and workers rights to recover for things like pain and suffering are more limited than in other personal injury matters in exchange for the certainty of having a trial expenses like medical costs and missed wages covered.
