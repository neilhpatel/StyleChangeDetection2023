I'm not sure I understand your question. If the first floor tenant has use of the yard and allows you to use it, you can use it. Why would the landlord even be involved? Of course the other tenant can revoke permission any time they want.
They can revoke permission at any time. IF they choose to go that route, they could call the police for trespassing, which could cause problems for you.
You can use the yard with the downstairs neighbours' permission, you could get in trouble for using it if they revoke permission, even after mowing and paying for pest control.
The neighbours having code violations or the zoning "agents" giving notice to the wrong address doesnt change your lease or the areas you are entitled to use.
For this type of lease violation, you couldn't be directly evicted - you'd need to first get a "notice to cease" from the landlord, which would tell you "hey stop using the yard or you're going to be evicted." You could only get evicted if you kept doing it after that notice.
If you were really worried I'd get it in writing from both. Realistically if the downstairs tenant doesn't care, I doubt the landlord will either.
