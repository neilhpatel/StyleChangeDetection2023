I am not doing dog therapy, ours is a SAR trainee, but obviously we know the basics for other service animal tasks.
Dog therapy at its most basic form is kids hanging around with a well behaved dog and interacting with the dog.
But at its core that is what dog therapy is, well behaved dog interacting with kids, and I see nothing in the article stating otherwise.
It does not change dogs behavior towards humans, especially not the kind of behaviors that would disqualify dog as a therapy dog.
But having some random dog owner walk in with her large un-neutered dog is very irresponsible and self-serving, especially since the children were not given an option to abstain from this group activity.
The owner of the dog hasn't gotten the dog neutered, which is one of the first signs that an owner is lazy or neglectful. It's also a sign that the dog is someone's pet, not a service animal. Pet owners have varying ideas of what makes their pet "trained", so you cannot guarantee that this animal will be good or safe with stressed/traumatized children.
