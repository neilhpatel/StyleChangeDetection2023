Its interesting how you mentioned that we pick our echo chambers, which I definitely agree with, and then I see all the comments replying to you accusing the other echo chamber of being "infested", being bots, being trolls, being racists and incels, and sock puppets.
I just found the lack of introspection funny, by those reading your comment. As if they are the echo chamber, but we are not.
It's a bit of an echo chamber here. It's okay to have your own opinions and not constantly compare what people say to the 'correct consensus' ya know?
Trudeau is looking weak as fuck right here. Then he gives the most generic NPC answer I've ever seen. Xi Jinping is talking down to you like a schoolboy and he has made sure to do it front of the camera, say something with a little substance back. "Well I'm sorry for the misunderstanding but it seems we approach things a little differently. In my country we believe in free speech, not censorship".
Justin Trudeau looks weak, he is being talked down to even though he is the elected leader of 38 million people. It's not acceptable. He can't even give a strongly worded reply, just generic inoffensive PR speak.
