Ukraine will never invade Russia. They would absolutely get nuked in that situation, and the West would have a hard time justifying a hard response, since Russia would be hitting their own globally accepted territory.
The US should be outfitting Poland with everything we can since they're probably going to be Russia's next target if Ukraine falls.
Hopefully Ukraine will be given plenty of werstern tanks for their next major offensives to blast ruzzian fascists with.
So what, they're also facing British, American, and Soviet tanks. And this time the German tanks are being used to defend Ukraine, whereas last time they were used to invade it.
Also I hear Ukrainians say they're facing Russian tanks again, only the first time didn't happen 80 years ago, more like 8.
Of course this war is exacting an insane toll on Ukraine, I mean even if they score a decisive victory and kick Russia out, their civilian infrastructure is almost gone and their GDP is already down by double digits. The disruption to Ukraine's industry and agriculture is also very dangerous both for the country and the region. But it's still very unlikely that Russia could wage and win a prolonged war for reasons stated.
Wow.. you figured that out all by yourself?? Good for you shithead.. only this time there won't be a lend lease or a few million Soviet civilians from neighboring countries to save your country's sorry ass. Enjoy!
