This gets a 2 year pause where things can change. Every single indication is that the GOP learned lessons from the last election and have every single intention to seize power in 2024 regardless of any elections.
Trump's play has always been to delay. Like, he can refuse to hand over docs to the House committee because he has a chance to not have to hand them over, at all, if the GOP takes back the House.
In any case, people who think he can't win in 2024 are forgetting how just many Republicans are willing to openly cheat on his behalf.
But it is best never to underestimate tactics of the republican politicians or overestimate the thinking of their voters.
The problem is, this is america, they love celebrities, and there aren't really any go-to democrat politicians who may want to run, meanwhile the republicans have Trump, DeSantis and more.
Left-leaning people need to learn what the republicans are doing, and what they will do. Apathy is what the republicans want.
After all, he only won against hilary by the skin of his teeth, and that was due to the EC and the voters who genuinely thought he'd 'drain the swamp' or simply hated hilary. Then he lost significantly to Biden, showing his antics over his 4 years didn't do him any favours. Now he's very unlikely to succeed.
I'm doubtful. Even if everything went perfectly according to prosecutors' plans from here on out, there's no way he'd be tried and convicted in the next two years.
