Seems like files where left at a secure office that Biden used while he was VP. I'm going to rate this as questionable judgement since there where classified docs, but it seems like like was a private office so, meh. The investigation is most likely protocol for classified docs in general, so also meh, the same protocol its likely what kicked off the Trump records investigation or its a direct result of said issue. Honestly if the Trump team found some records in one of their offices and returned it to NARA I would have called it a non-story, even if some of them where classified. Main issue on the Trump side is he stole the records hid them in a broom closet and lied to the FBI and NARA so kinda loose all credibility on the whole innocent mistake story.
Hmm that reminds me that trump stole the most secret documents in the world, refused to give them back and then lied to the government that he gave them back after being raided by the fucking FBI.
Not like big orange taking super high level classified documents to his private resident then lying to authorities he had them until the fbi uncovered it in a raid on his home.
Not some idiot who took higher level secured documents on their way out of office then refused to return them, causing the fucking fbi to raid his home.
But nice attempt to “ what about both sides” there champ! I’m sure next time you learn something on fox it won’t be disinformation.
These were in a locked box in the VP office and low level security. Bidens team immediately notified the correct authorities when found. Sounds like a pretty responsible way of handling a mistake.
