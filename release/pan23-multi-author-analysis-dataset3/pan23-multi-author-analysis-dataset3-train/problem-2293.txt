Iâ€™m more convinced than ever that you are right. It simply gets them nothing to use nukes. In no way does that accrue any measurable benefit for Russia. Putin may be a lot of things but he wants something. And nukes get him nothing.
I think at this point, with what we know about nukes, it doesn't really matter if who you nuke. Everyone is going to make you stop. Like even China isn't gonna put up with putin nuking Ukraine.
In addition, outside of a MAD, senario nukes would still be used sparingly even on unwanted land to avoid MAD and/or triggering a nuclear doomsday.
One nuke, no matter how big it is doesn't have enough nuclear yield to pose any nuclear threat to neighbouring countries.
We need to stop feeding this myth, hundreds of nukes were used already during tests and we are still fine.
The whole purpose of having nukes in modern time is as a deterrent, ala MAD. But if he is actually dumb enough to use one, then he may use more which can lead to massive fallout into other European nations.
