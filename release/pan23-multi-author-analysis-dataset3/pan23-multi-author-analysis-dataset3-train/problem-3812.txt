I’ll also add I had never been in trouble prior to this and I had been with the company for over a year. My biggest issue is that I was the only one fired. Target stated that they covered security issues in orientation but all they covered in mine was the different codes and an active shooter situation.
Fair enough, but if the issue was putting myself at danger… why was “D” not fired too? He was in the same place and at same time as me. What about “H” who clearly broke policy when he let out an individual alone? If I’m fired over a liability than shouldn’t those individuals also be fired?
In this instance there is an obvious equitable application of this policy that sees you fired and the others not. They made an error that, unfortunately, gave rise to a dangerous situation they didn't cause or choose to enter. You, by contrast, deliberately entered an already dangerous situation.
If your company has policies about safety, then whomever ignored those policies to let this person out alone can be disciplined. And you can be disciplined for not following policy or protocol on responding to a dangerous event.
I'd file for unemployment here. And appeal if denied. But with any tie to that you violated a company policy this may be a righteous termination for cause.
