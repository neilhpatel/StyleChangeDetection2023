Either in 1945 the Allies had so many genuine war criminals, those who actually gave the orders, to process that they did not have any time to waste on people who only played a marginal role in the war crimes.
Imagine that Hitler's own personal secretary, , was never charged with a single crime, despite everyone knowing she was Hitler's personal secretary...
No, but its reasonable to assume that once said person had first-hand knowledge of atrocities that the nazi party was committing and were not publicizing, quitting maybe was not an option. Do you really think the nazis are gonna let someone with this kind of knowledge of sensitive state secrets just waltz away back into civilian life?
1. Someone worked in a death camp and knew what was happening there, to at least the same degree the courts in this case assert the defendant did.
And knowledge that being sent to a concentration camp was essentially a death sentence was also fairly well known. It helped keep the population subjugated. Many also knew that mass executions were going on, even if the existence of gas chambers was not as well known.
Many of these trials take a long time because the accused' intent has to be proven - that s/he knew about the systematic killings.
