From the sounds of it, the evidence you brought _does_ contest the assertion that they told you what you owe, but it doesn't really do much to address the assertion _that you owe the outstanding amount_. Whoever's fault it is, if your doctor didn't receive payment, they are entitled to collect from their client - that is, you. If the judge's decision was to award them the amount outstanding, with no additional fees and interest, then this all boils down to a very high-impact way of telling you what the bill was.
In a bench trial or a small claims suit, it's ultimately up to the judge to listen to the evidence and decide what facts are sufficiently proven. Whether the judge thought your information was false, or whether they thought it was irrelevant, yes, it is ultimately within their authority to find in favour of the plaintiff in spite of the evidence you brought to the table.
The judge did not ignore your evidence; they have stated that your assertion is irrelevant and, in spite of your evidence, the other party's claim has the legal footing.
I'm not saying their lack of action is your fault; it's clearly not. I am trying to make it clear to you that ethical sensibility and legality do not have to overlap.
You, the person, went into the clinic for medical service. The insurance company did not. Therefore you owe money. If you were unable to get the insurance company to pay for a thing they should have covered, you may be able to dispute the matter with them after the fact since you acted in good and reasonable faith.
