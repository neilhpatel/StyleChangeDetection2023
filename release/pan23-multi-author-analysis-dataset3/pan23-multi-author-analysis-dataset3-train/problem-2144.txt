First, consider taking a blank sheet of paper and writing down everything you think you know about The Civil War. It can be a list of words, phrases, dates, and names or a but the idea is to dump everything you think you know about a topic before you read. Then, as you read, consider adding information that surprises you or catches your attention. Basically, if you feel yourself going, "huh, I never knew that!" consider writing that thing down. Your goal is to start to make connections. As you read, you may notice that the things you wrote down fit into categories and you may find those categories change the more you read. So, rather than taking notes as if you're preparing for a test, think of it like taking notes to help your brain keep things straight.
You probably noticed some conflicting information and that's going to happen a lot when it comes to reading and studying. People develop habits that work for them and so will you. There's no one right way to read history but there are some strategies you can use to help your brain make connections. (Basically, that's what's happening when we "retain" information; the new information hooks onto information we already know.).
2. Take notes. Write down what you find interesting. Separate topics into sections and code it. For example put an easily recognized mark that tells you what you want to research more.
