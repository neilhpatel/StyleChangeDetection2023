I'm not sure. I just know my therapist diagnosed me with mental health issues. It even went on my medical record. She told me she's not a doctor though.
My only problem is that if I end up moving to a new state or getting a new therapist then I won't have a way to take my records if the place I currently go to was to shut down. Should I ask my therapist how she's able to officially and legally make a diagnosis?
Without more info it’s probably because she’s able to diagnose you. If aren’t in disagreement about the assessment then what’s the issue? Presumably you’d want accurate medical records to be maintained anyways.
If you can’t or aren’t willing to provide more details then there is no way to provide more legal information.
You need to provide more details about your situation. Therapist is a broad term than can encompass professionals who can and can’t make these diagnoses.
A “therapist” who isn’t capable of providing a diagnosis can state that they believe you have mental health issues. That’s not a diagnosis, it’s an observation.
This “therapist” may have told you they aren’t a doctor in terms of being a Medical Doctor, or M.D. or D.O. They could very well have a related doctoral degree in psychology that would allow them to make a diagnosis but not allow them to treat you medicinally.
