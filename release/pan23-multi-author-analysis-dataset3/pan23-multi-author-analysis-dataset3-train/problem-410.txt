For most trespassing cases you have to be explicitly told to leave prior to being arrested. Some jurisdictions the mere sign saying no trespassing or a fence or some sort of obvious barrier in which you would have had to explicitly overcome/avoided can serve as that initial warning and you can be arrested if found on property.
How could he be trespassing in an unmarked and apparently open to the public space without a representative of the property owner directing him to leave and him refusing to leave first?
(a)â€‚A person is guilty of criminal trespass in the third degree when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or upon premises.
It does not sound like you committed this offense. You did not knowingly enter UNLAWFULLY. You drove your car into a parking lot that was not roped or sectioned off and made no attempts at circumventing a restricted area.
Also, if you did NOT enter the building and entered a parking lot with no signage posted, even simple trespassing would be a long shot.
