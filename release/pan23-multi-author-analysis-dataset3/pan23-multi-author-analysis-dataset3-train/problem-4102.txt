Actually Hitler and the Nazis fear mongered an impending Polish invasion to help justify invading Poland first. They were just ahead of their time! /s.
. Thankfully the younger and educated polish population knows that PiS is bullshit, but still too many people vote for them.
If you claim I "still see Eastern Europeans as lesser Humans" I take that as a Nazi accusation, yes.
There is no denying that what Nazi Germany did to Poland was a grivous sin. Other countries suffered less from their malice and still, 40 years ago, it was quite common that people in France or the Netherlands would not even sell you a pack of smokes if they noticed you being German. But now it's been 80 years. I've spent my last 4 vacations in Israel. Now if any country and it's people were to never forgive the Germans, I would expect it to be Israel. And while I don't think the son should suffer for the sins of the father, still I could understand it.
It's sad, Poles and Germans aren't all that different and IMO would get along fine without these people making their career of keeping this festering hate alive in people.
How about you do like the rest of Polish people not living in Poland should do and stay away from our politics and trying to "explain" to others how Polish people feel.
Nope, I have a shitload of respect for Poland and love the country and the people (I mean, thats why I lived there at some point). Same goes for most people in Europe.
