The original "notice" was sent to us because we refused to pick up his dogs poop. Both of our dogs share a yard space and we had a verbal agreement that we would rotate weeks of picking up dog poop. After multiple weeks of only us picking up the poop, and plenty of snarky texts from the landlord, I went to talk to him about it. He began yelling at me saying that I was a liar and said we have 60 days to move out.
I understand. There is another layer here as well. We are being relocated due to my fianc√©'s job. We kind of took the "eviction" as a blessing because we are going to have to move anyway. Now that he has "taken it back" we have to pay the remaining years rent if we are to leave. This is what we were hoping to avoid. We have been looking for houses for awhile now as this is not the first problem we have had with our landlord. Is there any way that the actions he has taken would let us break our lease agreement or should we try to talk to him to reach an agreement?
On the flip side, if you want to move out, you need to provide the landlord notice per your lease agreement.
But on another note, move out when the lease is up. This guy is unstable and an asshole. It will probably get worse.
He rrscinded his eviction because it was illegal. Not picking up dog crap on a verbal agreement isn't an actionable cause. Evictions have to be in writing, often served by the Sherrifs office. Not a text message.
