These will be an interesting addition. They have about 80% of the explosive power of a GMLRS rocket (from what I can tell) with 60% more range at roughly a quarter of the price. They've carried over the GBU-39's ability to follow indirect flight paths, geo-locating, and laser targeting. I wonder if they quietly carried over the ability to target EW jamming.
I am unsure how it will interact with Russian air defense. Will the glide portion of the flight cause it to be slower and easier to counter? Does Russia have any air defense available to place that far behind the front line?
