Most of the surrenders were after (a) Japan had accepted the Potsdam terms, and a ceasefire had been ordered (on the evening of 14th August) and (b) the Kwantung Army surrendered (18th August). The ceasefire did not stop the fighting - not all units received the order, and many units that received the order kept fighting, including aggressively counter-attacking. The Kwantung Army as a whole officially surrendered on 18th August, but again this didn't stop the fighting. Most of the fighting stopped in the next few days, but in some places, it took a week after the surrender to crush major resistance. One division (the 107th) fought until 30th August, when the surviving 1/3 of the division surrendered.
For the whole war (including the war in China from 1937), Japanese military deaths were probably over 3,000,000, and Japanese civilian deaths about 750,000.
100,000 surrendered and a similar total casualties— but this can’t be for all Japanese units throughout the whole war, right? Is this just the Kwantung Army?
