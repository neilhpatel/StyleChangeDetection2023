In this case one guesses the issue is that you are not, as a homeowner, directly liable for this loss. If you'd hired a professional contractor of some type this would be squarely a workers comp issue. So it is unsurprising the homeowners insurance won't pay.
Obviously this is an amount of money where you should consult an attorney - whether that's about pursuing the insurer or doing something else.
Also - this would probably something you want to try and claim medical payments on instead of liability.
There is a coverage on homeowners insurance called medical payments, has nothing to do with private medical. the coverage pays for hospital bills of guests who get hurt that don't want to sue you.
Med Pay is a goodwill coverage that prevents the injured from having to sue you in court in order to collect on the liability coverage.
One small silver lining is that your homeowners insurance may still provide you a lawyer in the event this contractor sues you for his medical bills. If he files suit, let your insurance know.
If he doesn't carry the proper insurance, he may end up suing you personally. Your insurance co already said it's not your (their) liability. Stop doing things to assume it.
