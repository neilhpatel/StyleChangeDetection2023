Even independent artists need to understand the difference between needs and wants before arguing for more money. Most of them are paying upwards of $2,000 per month just to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. These are the people who constantly complain about 'needing' more money when in reality they just need to learn how to spend less. But spending less isn't as sexy as getting more, so very few people actually consider it.
They need to understand that hard work does not equate to wealth and they are not entitled to any money they can't get themselves. I personally will not take any of their pleas for wealth seriously if they live in a major city, among having other unnecessary expenses.
Not really. Creators just need to get their rockstar mentality out of their heads and maybe move to cities cheaper than LA.
Not really. It's excruciatingly difficult to maintain the facade of intellectual property and gets harder as time goes on.
Reality is we need more NOW and it's hard to adjust the system to shorten the life-span of a copyright without hurting the whole process.
