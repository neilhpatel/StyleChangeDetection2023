Not to defend any of these barbaric practices of course. They are not okay and some things are obviously much worse than others. Honor killings are inexcusable and are a barbaric tradition that should have been outlawed decades ago.
And there are also a bunch of things you were taught growing up that are very wrong that you still don't realize are wrong.
And yet there are a whole bunch of things that I was taught growing up that I was able to identify as wrong and back away from. It did take years, so I'm sympathetic, but it's not an end-all excuse. If a person stays in that their whole life there is some part of them that wants it that way.
And yet people do break away all the time. Or at the very least wish in their heart they could without risking their lives. I'll give credit to that. But I won't excuse or normalize abhorrent behavior simply because it is the norm in some places and at some times. It's too condescending to think they can't tell right from wrong at any level.
Doing what your neighbors do is perfectly fine most of the time. But for matters that cross into evil, inside most people know, and then they decide who and what they are.
Maybe you're right, but my interpretation is different. It's not so much a "need to dehumanize" but the other way around; their natural feelings dehumanize and their behavior comes from that. It's not so much that they're holding the leash tight because paranoia and distrust; they simply want to control everything and the leash holding paranoia and distrust flow from that. They're doing exactly what they want, no matter how awful it looks to us if we imagine ourselves in their shoes.
