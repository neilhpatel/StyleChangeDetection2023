Your father is a victim of identity fraud. He needs to freeze his credit and file a police report. His bank is researching this and has no proof that it wasn’t him writing that check. He could have also given someone his account number which would make him liable. It’s on him to do all he can to demonstrate that he’s a victim of identity fraud and didn’t do anything to create this situation which includes filing that police report. The bank will take his side more seriously then.
They froze the account to investigate fraud. It’s standard practice as they don’t know what actually happened. You may be sure but they need to investigate to confirm your story and prevent additional losses. How do you know they didn’t check the ID? The scammer might have had a fake ID, thus identity fraud as I originally stated.
Also, to me the fraud seems quite obvious. A lady got hold the the information, then wrote a check to her business. Her name is on it and she has a presence on facebook looking and acting like a jackass. My parents have no connection to this person. The only question is how she got the (possibly washed?) check.
There are plenty of other things that I'm sure they can see. Nobody is asking anything. I reiterate that the money never went anywhere due to his reporting so this is just them seizing or withholding money based on the attempt. It isn't as if they transferred 87k anywhere and lost the money.
