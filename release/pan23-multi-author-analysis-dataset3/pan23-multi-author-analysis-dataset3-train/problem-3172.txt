I don't really see how an inverted pyramid of a population demographic is quality in any way shape or form, especially when China's entire economic model is being a cheap place to manufacture goods, driven entirely by a large number of unskilled population. I don't really see China becoming a high tech economy in the short amount of time that it'll take before their demographics go down the toilet.
Unfortunately how pensions work is a zero sum game. Someone must lose money through taxes for someone else to gain money when they can no longer work.
China has zero social security as well, the costs of all those elderly will fall on the smaller and smaller population of younger workers who are already overworked.
That's all fine and dandy but OP is just completely ignoring the fact that a declining population won't be able to support the however many tens of millions of older Chinese people that will move into retirement or be incapable of continuing to work. Especially if the state itself doesn't provide any social security via taxes and pensions, the younger generations will have to carry everyone on their backs and a stable economy that does not make.
