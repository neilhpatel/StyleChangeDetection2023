To give you a real life example of how long the process can take, it took 3 years for Modern Family actress Ariel Winter to become emancipated from her abusive mother, and this was someone who was starring on one of the most popular shows on TV and making a reported $75,000 per episode, or $1.8 million a year, around the time this was happening.
You also generally already have to be fully supporting yourself, not that you have a plan or think you can fully support yourself, in order to become emancipated. It's not "emancipate me and I'll go our and get a full time job to support myself" it's, "I'm already working and making $X and here's my budget showing I can afford rent, food, transportation, insurance, and all the other expenses of being an adult.".
Right. Which isn't going to happen, because as explained, a judge is not going to take custody away from his parents and give him to a 14 year old child in another state.
Anyway, I'm not going to continue arguing with you, as it's clear you aren't actually seeking legal answers at this point.
Just because you are legally an adult does not mean any company has to work with you, sign contracts with you, etc.
