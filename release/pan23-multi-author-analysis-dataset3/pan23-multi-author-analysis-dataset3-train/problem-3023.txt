I wouldn't tell them anything. They can't really tell where you cashed it but they might be able to tell if it was deposited instead of cashed depending on how their back reports that stuff. Either way, having been through multiple companies that did things like this it was always because of financial issues or tax issues. I wouldn't doubt the checks are written from a different account that handled the direct deposit. It's in your best interest to cash it at your bank and not deposit it to guarantee you get paid and face no fees.
I strongly recommend cashing the check at the paying bank, maybe seeing what the cheapest low level savings account is and opening it to waive the fee. The teller can see if there's sufficient balance in the paying account to cash the check and avoid the risk of a bounced check.
The only way to guarantee you get the money is to cash it at the bank it is written on. Unfortunately that bank charges a fee for cashing checks.
Strangely enough they give us the checks on Thursday and allow cashing anytime on Friday? I didn’t even consider any fees for a bounced check though, very good point. I’d rather not mess around trying to recoup those fees if it happens… Thanks.
I really appreciate the thorough response! This definitely paints a better picture to what’s going on behind the scenes. Luckily I’ve got my resume updated now and have a backup offer (if I can’t find a better position) for when this shit-show inevitably blows up….
Awesome thanks! I’m not strapped for cash or anything at the moment; all health insurance benefits are through my wife’s work anyways so I’ll probably end up riding it out. Just have to put the finishing touches on my resume sooner rather than later lol.
