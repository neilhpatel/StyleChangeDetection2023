I know where it is towed off too. I wanted to see which was the best options since the police are performing an investigation on the case. And I would not like receive a citation if I did not see the other driver stop at all. Im confused on my next steps. It was towed from my driveway.
Thank you so much for your help. I plan on getting an attorney. One attorney recommended to file an insurance claim, thus I did as well as showing the police my insurance claim number. Is this a good idea? I can see talking to the police as a easy way to find myself into trouble.
Talking to the police is a very easy way to talk yourself into charges. As of right now it appears that the other party has reported this as a hit and run to the police. As of right now YOU are the suspect in a criminal case. At the very least, get a consult with one.
Is the car registered to you? Usually when a car in a hit and run is located we will try to find the person to talk to them instead of just taking the car.
You need to know exactly what they are investigating. Which means you may want to consult with a criminal defense attorney because it seems to me like they are investigating a criminal matter at this point.
