How they accomplish that is, to a large extent, up to them. And might be anything from contacting the client organization to report the harassment to ensuring you no longer have direct contact with this particular client representative.
Title: Is there a way I can report a client for sexual harassment without hurting my company’s relationship with the client’s organization?
You need to work with your company’s HR department or other mechanism for handling sexual harassment. They owe you protection from this kind of harassment.
This case is different, both because the employee has ongoing contact with the harasser (the contact isn't transient) and that the employee describes a pattern of harassment. When this employee makes the complaint to their employer, that employer needs to act.
While your statement is right, we should be absolutely clear here that sexual harassment by a client is something the company is obligated to address.
For clarity, laws protect you against sexual harassments from things that happen under your employer's control. It doesn't necessarily protect you from harassment from an outside source. It does if it becomes a repeated thing that your employer could prevent.
