It’s absolutely not the norm. You confuse Open Skies which was a treaty between Russia and NATO countries and had very strict rules of surveillance and a limited number of prescheduled and preaproved flights every year, with what is in fact a clandestine spying operation.
>> That is both obvious and badly misses the point: Everyone spies on everyone; Open Skies was just an attempt to establish norms and guidelines about means and methods, given the fact that everyone was going to be spying on everyone anyway.
Nobody should think it’s over, but nobody should really care that much: All major powers spy on each other all the time always; the only thing novel about that last one was that they managed to get noticed.
(That’s from General Glen VanHerck of North American Aerospace Defense Command and United States Northern Command.).
It is though. Sovereign airspace can extend up to the Karman Line which is at 100km or 328k feet above sea level, or infinitely depending on the laws of the country. There's no agreed upon upper limit. Countries can't just fly military aircraft in other countries airspace and not expect some kind of response. It being steerable or not makes no difference to that.
