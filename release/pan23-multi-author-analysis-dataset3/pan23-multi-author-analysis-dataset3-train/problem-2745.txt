They weren't buying anyway. The point of the price cap is to force the oil tanker insurance companies to deny Russian tankers coverage. All the ship insurers are in counties that have accepted the cap, and will not insure a Russian tankers that is selling it's oil above the cap.

Well, from some reports, Chinese insurers now have around have around 14% share of the marine insurance market and from what I know, China has not accepted the price caps on Russian crude. There are other insurers ofcourse for example Indian Insurers too who have not accepted the price caps.
If this keeps up, I get the feeling more and more buyers will turn to these insurers and in turn let them capture a much larger piece of the Marine Insurance market.
