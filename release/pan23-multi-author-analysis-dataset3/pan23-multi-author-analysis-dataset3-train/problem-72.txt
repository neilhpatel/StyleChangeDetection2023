Hobsbawm's trilogy on the "long 19th cenutry" comes to mind, although I haven't read it yet. It covers the 1800s, from the French Revolution (1789) to World War I (1914). There is a fourth volume on the "short 20th century" (1914 â€” 1991) as well.
In the U.S, "there would be no gentle gradations in society, no mestizo culture, no escape through money or mating from the degradation put upon blackness, no accepted and respected class of free Negroes and mulattoes to stand as an intermediate segment of society...the physical condition of the slave might in fact have been considerably better than in the countries to the south. But his prospects for a life of comfort and acceptance as a free man were also much poorer.".
Ok... I wanted to know if during the peak of American slavery what the relative quality of life was for slaves in other countries at the same time.
In Latin America, there were not nearly as many women, and the slave population decreased over time instead of increasing as it did in the U.S. But this also allowed for intermarriage, greater acceptance of mixed-race couples and children, and a sort of caste system of part-Spanish creoles, mestizos and mulattoes.
