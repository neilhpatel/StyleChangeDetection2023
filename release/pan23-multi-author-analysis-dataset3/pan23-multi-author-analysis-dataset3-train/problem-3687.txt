It's a vicious cycle though. I live in the bay area and have homeless and people smoking meth on our trains. People don't feel safe riding the trains -- especially at night, so they don't take them. People then start driving instead of taking the trains / buses.
It’s all part of the same transit system including the subway, and people jump the fare gates and sneak onto the buses already. The transit police don’t enforce the fares.
It's part of a larger regional system that gets payments from MD and VA. Presumably the buses in VA and MD will still charge, and the subway system is hella expensive for people riding in from the ends of the lines. (Over $10 round trip daily for me.).
So much this. It's understandable if service slows with the demand drop, but it is simply unacceptable to have 4-8 hour periods where no public transit is available.
it has the same problems of getting slowed down by traffic but it's even slower because of the stops, so it's not an appealing option. for example imagine that street with a single traffic lane, rail line down the middle and hard protected bike lanes on either side. When traffic gets worse they can add more rail car traffic or people can choose to ride their bike. Traffic still slows down but the flow of people overall is much more resilient.
tracks create permanence though, that's the other side of the coin. that's like the best thing about transit lines is they create densification. buses you get a busier street with some buses on it, light rail a city springs up around it and you lower the need for transit in the first place.
It's the same infrastructure, you can't distinguish between buses and traffic for the most part. So what you end up with is just more auto infrastructure. this snowballs and gets worse because buses also get stuck in traffic.
