Yanks are keen to forget they dragged most of Europe into their Iraq massacre. They constantly want their arses kissed for world war 2 but seem to have very selective amnesia of the past twenty years. Are you one of those?
And what does this have to do with Americans flip flopping between casting up all they do for Europe and begging their "strong allies" for help whenever the US decide to go out on another foreigner massacre?
You Europeans are sure the usa is stupid and barbaric, the US thinks you are dumb and weak that rely on the us and this extend of course to russia, india, china and more.
So just because america is out here holding the world together after europe fucked it up, well you’re bloody welcome.
And back to the African nation remark, remember the USA objected against colonization and stated the versions nations should be invested in and become trade partners.
Yeah, I get that don’t in the west of Europe, but what does that have to do with the rest of the world and their business as usual. Kuwait is not in Europe.
Of Kuwait?? It’s hands down the best run middle eastern nation. And it unfortunately continues to have religious nut jobs threaten the safety and freedoms of its citizens.
