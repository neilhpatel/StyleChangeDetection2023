The initial Sagan et al. model assumed you could have a very devastating nuclear winter from a relatively modest exchange. More recent models tend to be focused on modern arsenals, and so have much more modest exchanges inherently built into them (the arsenals of the US and Russia were cut dramatically in the early 1990s), and tend to suggest a shorter-term decline in temperatures, sometimes dismissively called "nuclear autumn" (but it is still enough of an effect have a huge impact on food production). (And of course, there are modelers then and now whose model shows no such effect.).
Neither the Cold War nor present modelers are big fans of searching for a "threshold" â€” it's not just the number of bombs, or even the yield, but the type of target, and none of the models profess to have enough confidence in the model to say, "this is safe, but this is not.".
P.s. for /u/Kochevnik81, the citation of Aquinas should be I-II, q. 96, a. 4 (I assume) or Ia-IIae or if I'm being lazy online: 2.96.4.
Sure, I certainly wouldn't want to over-egg the suggestion. But it strikes me as true, in at least a suitably qualified sense, and notable that especially from the turn of the 14th century theoretical discourse on politics seems to develop a more significant and formal place within the intellectual discourse in Latin Europe.
It might be worthwhile to add here that we certainly get more elaborated political philosophy in twelfth century renaissance, and upon request, go into more detail, but for example, in twelfth century, to name a local, we have John of Salisbury ( who worked under two archbishops of Canterbury, even under Becket ) who accounted for such a view 50 years prior to the events, even so far as tyrannicide - but his political philosophy is rather nuanced and would need some longer sections and exposition to properly situate. Further, some decades later, we get Bracton with his account ( quite different though, and less "severe" ) etc.
