No, generally, that's not how HOA's work. It's representative, not direct, democracy. In fact, most HOA members are so entirely disinterested that getting a quorum for an annual meeting (50 percent) the first time is often impossible, even with proxy voting. Most HOA's have to do a second annual meeting where the quorum requirement is lower.
Developers don't create HOA's without a reason. From their perspective, it's nothing but a hassle. There must be some kind of common area or something the HOA is responsible for maintaining, even if you don't realize it.

And while in theory it's a participatory process, as a practical matter, it's not. Most people just don't care and leave a few volunteers who have the time and are willing to put in the work.
