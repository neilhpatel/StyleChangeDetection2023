There were quite a few, but 2 things below in my view are enough to call him a good leader (maybe even a great leader?).
\- Delivered a peaceful power transition first time in ccp history. This could have been the beginning of transforming China to a more democratic society if not for Xi.
Jiang Zemin was no democratic reformer, but compared to the Mao 2.0 that is Xi, he was quite the open minded liberal.
Jiang probably wouldn't be remembered as fondly by the world if Xi Jinping weren't such a regressive and totalitarian mess. Jiang was the leader of China when the country needed great changes to reinvent itself; his reign was during an era not far removed from the tiananmen square massacre, and an era back when the path China would take is still full of possibilities. Chinese liberalization was a promising possibility under Jiang and Hu, because many thought the economic liberalization of China and the ever growing middle class would lead to political reform, which would eventually lead to a democratic and free China. But now what we have is a Mao wannabe that is Xi, and China's so called passage towards liberalization appears to be a big fat joke in the hindsight.
Jintao Hu was more compromising and had occasionary wanted to adapt western idea and got stopped by the hardliners.
