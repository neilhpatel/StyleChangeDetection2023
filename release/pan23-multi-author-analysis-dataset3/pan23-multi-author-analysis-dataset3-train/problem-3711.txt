This will sound ageist, but I really feel like a big part of the problem is the politicians that run the country are too old.
We don’t let them drive or answer phones because they get tricked into giving all their financial info to phone scammers, but for some reason we let people their age run the government?
Employers force people over 65 into retirement and anyone that’s taken care of a very elderly family member knows you wouldn’t want them doing anything important. They forget everything and can’t stay awake most of the day.
I’m Gen X and my generation has already turned into our parents like in that commercial so it too late for us.
Not only because of cognitive issues, but also people who were born in the 30's and 40's should not be deciding the future for new generations.
Regardless of whether or not they are still sane nobody over 75 should be deciding the future of a nation they no longer understand or will live in. She could retire and be replaced and if she won’t do it declare her mentally unfit and remove her. She represents 39 million people in one of the most powerful states. Dementia or Alzheimer’s does not matter which ever one it is she shouldn’t be allowed to decide her own breakfast let alone vote on decisions that affect tens of millions.
