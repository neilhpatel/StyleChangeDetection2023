That's all there is to it. Anything after that is just distracting from the fact that Republicans think Democrats are coming after their Coco Puffs and 50 Republican senators sabotaging America.

Meanwhile, the Trump and the Republicans have never had a supermajority, and yet they were successfully able to roll back regulations. How is it that the democrats always need to "elect more democrats" even after they win, but Republicans with the same or smaller sized majority always have enough?
If the public wants more regulations here, they can get over themselves and elect more democrats. Until they do that, they will not get more regulations on this stuff.
He is regulating where he can. For example last year he re-started the process for the 2-person crew minimum rule that was initiated by Obama and shelved by Trump. He also put a pause on a Trump rule allowing liquid natural gas to travel by rail while more safety analysis is done.
Another notable rail safety thing they did is pause a Trump rule allowing liquid natural gas to be shipped by rail. There were safety concerns when Trump's dot allowed it. Pete .
