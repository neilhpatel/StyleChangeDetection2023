Because the inevitable claim will be "Russia did it on purpose" whether it's true or not, or "Ukraine accidentally sent a missile in the complete opposite direction of Russia" whether it's true or not.
Same people saying that Russians did this are probably also the same ones that were outraged when S300 missile hit polish village in unfortunate accident.
Also While it wasn't directly caused by Russia, this accident did happen BECAUSE Russia was attacking Ukraine. So its still in a way their fault.
Yeah it wasn't fired by Russia but acting as if Russia was blameless in that situation is ridiculous they are the ones bombing Ukraine.
Yup, the only reason Ukraine is hurting as much as they are is because Ukraine isn't actually a member state of NATO. Hell, I'm pretty sure if NATO wasn't holding them back, Poland and the Baltics would be active belligerents by now.
Russia is an active belligerent against former Soviet states, so the logical assumption is "Russia" when belligerence befalls a former Soviet state. People are quick to blame because such capacity for learning is what allowed humans to evolve into humans.
