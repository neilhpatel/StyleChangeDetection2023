There are so many farmers in my community that live in a 400k house, in ground pool, their wife drives a brand new 80k GMC yukon/Chevrolet Tahoe, they own a 200k boat, go on two mountain vacations a year, and spend every weekend at the beach in summer. The median income per household in my county is 43k.
Did you see where I said the median income is 45 k for a household in my county? After taxes, take home is around 28k which is around $2,300 a month. If I go look at a 400k house for sale on Zillow in my home town the payment is estimated at $2348.00 a month, so the average working couple doesn’t even make enough a month to cover that ‘cheap’ house payment.
Of course not all farmers are like this, but there are quite a few that know how to work the system.
Being jobs and good pay back to rural areas by any means necessary. People satisfied with their lives tend not to go full conspiracy theory.
A Conspiracy Theory might turn out to be correct. But in general, when we talk about conspiracy theories, we're referring to the ones that make huge leaps of logic and inferences based on cherry-picked information to confirm an already held belief.
"Conspiracy Theory" uses the colloquial, so that just feeds into the perception of "Theory is just a guess" (Mixing up 'theory" and "hypothesis" is another big one).
Dropping "theory" and just saying "conspiracy" to mean "crackpot stuff" weakens the word Conspiracy.
To clarify, I'm talking specifically about "Conspiracy Theories" - I'm going to lay out my thesis (har har . ) so please don't take this as more pedantry. I just want to be clear.
