This is so far from transparency, please explain how giving ALL the info to a single biased admitted in court as a 20th century garbage spewing jester is transparency at all?
You miss the point, fucker talksome is not press, he's a fucking clown not a member of the press, the courts and his lawyers agree that just by looking at his dumb face you immediately infer he's just a clown therefore cannot be sued.
Just ask them if they believe what Tucker and fox are telling them or if they believe the interviews and communications of the idiots on the ground that day that were presented in a court of law. Then bring up how foolish they are to let news media sway them when facts from real people are readily available.
I know they aren't technically the state media like RT, but they lie on behalf of politicians and to say otherwise is disingenuous.
I also have a legal/LE background and have to say this isn't illegal as far as I know; probably the only thing the democrats can do is release the same to real news outlets to counter it.
The whole point of it is they are going to find some random thing, like a guy talking on a weird phone/walkie-talkie, with an ear piece, etc. Then string together a bunch of clips of the same and say it's federal agents, antifa, or whatever.
I don't think people realize how seriously bad this is. We have a senior government official providing material aid to a producer of disinformation.
