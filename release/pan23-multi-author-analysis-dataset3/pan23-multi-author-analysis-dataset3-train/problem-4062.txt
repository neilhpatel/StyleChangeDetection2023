100%. Could have let it fuck off in to the ocean and never worried about it. But Republicans were losing their minds over it, Biden called their bluff, and then we find out this has happened before.
I'll bet his little feels are hurt that Biden didn't telegraph to him that Biden was waiting to do it without risking any people getting hurt.
Cancun Cruz who allowed trump to insult his wife and call him names and then supported Trump's insurrection attempt is calling out weakness?
Ted Cruz would cackle with malicious glee if a democrat did half the shit Trump did to signal weakness to China. It would give him talking points for years.
China also whiffed on fulfilling its promises under the trade deal that Trump was so proud of after a two year trade war he promised was easy to win.
After railing against China for years, Trump told an audience there that he didn't blame them for taking advantage of the US.
The same thing happened during the Trump years, and Trump government didn't shoot down those Chinese balloons back then. Why? Do the Republicans have any explanation for that?
