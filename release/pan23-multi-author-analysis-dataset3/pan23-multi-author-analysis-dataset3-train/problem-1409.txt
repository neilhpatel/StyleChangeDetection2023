He also has to serve 5 years on probation after getting out. The soonest he has his privacy back is about 19 years if he behaves himself.
And this is why it works. Federal sentences only let you shave of 15% of the time for good behavior.
If it's Federal Prison the most you can shave off your sentence for good behavior is 54 days for every 365. So, my math says he would only get 2.36 years off his overall sentence of 16 years.
16 years has almost the same effect as a life sentence. A better argument would be that, at one time, conspiracy to assassinate the head of government was a capital offence.
I’m no fan of the death penalty, but if there’s anywhere to use it, it should be seditious traitors who want to destroy society.
Since douche probably thought he would never end up there, enjoy what voting right wing turned the prison system into you worthless pathetic seditionist piece of garbage!
While I don't condone what will happen to you in the joint I won't deny the realities in prison you're probably going to get turned out a few times....all you had do was NOT BE A SEDITIONIST.
