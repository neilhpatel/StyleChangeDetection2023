Despite having physical custody, the child “belongs” to someone else in the eyes of the legal system and those people can take their child whenever they want.
It may not be in your or the child's best interest to start by reporting to DCYF, however, because legally they're the adoptive parents and can take the kid back at any time. This is why you need the lawyer to help get all your ducks in a row. You may be able to lean on WA DCYF to facilitate the adoption if he was adopted out of there (which could save money), but that also may not be in your best interest.
Generally, child abandonment includes having no regard for the child's health and safety. By leaving them with a family that was willing to take care of them, they might not be guilty of child abandonment.
How would this not qualify as child abandonment? And what about the funds they received for adopting a child from foster care, wouldn’t they have to return that?
Parents and that's what the adoptive parents legally are even if they are scumbags are allowed to send kids to stay with other people without it being abandonment. It's likely the adoptive parents would have faced some pushback or repercussions the same as any biological parent trying to put their child into foster care but they didn't try. Currently however they are just allowing the child to stay with OP and that means they can reclaim the child at anytime. OP should speak to a lawyer or a social worker contact about getting guardianship and child support, the state actually taking this child back into the foster system and hopefully into their home as a placement if the adoptive family is intent on abandoning him or adoption if the current family is willing.
