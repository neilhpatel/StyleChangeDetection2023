NAL but wanted to share an experience. My batshit sister when she was in elementary school punched a girl in the face and broke her glasses. The family took to court and my sister had assault charges as a minor. Based on this Iâ€™d say you can pursue assault charges if you wanted to.
So I would still call the police, let the police decide which law if any is applicable to the assault. Just because a child cannot be 'guilty' of a crime does not mean they don't need serious intervention!
Why would an assault in a school be treated differently (by the law) than an assault on a public playground or on a sidewalk somewhere? And why should the victim need to care about the age of the alleged criminal? (ie should all of that not be 'worked out' in an investigation and/or prosecution).
(1) To acknowledge that certain behaviors or conditions occurring within a family or school environment indicate that a child is experiencing serious difficulties and is in need of services and corrective action in order to protect such child from the irreversibility of certain choices and to protect the integrity of such child's family;.
Thanks - this pointed me in the right direction! Georgia does have a juvenile justice code designed to intervene in certain situations -- see:
