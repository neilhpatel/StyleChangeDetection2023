We had this specific issue in Ontario, not BC, but from having lived in BC, laws are similar. Be sure to contact your lawyer to document the refusal to vacate immediately and have your lawyer notify the buyer and their lawyer/realtor that the former owners are trespassing and do not have your permission to be there. You do not want to say anything that could be construed as giving them permission to stay, even something as simple as "sure, take the extra day, it's fine." You do not want them claiming to be tenants.
You do NOT want this to become a tenant-Landlord situation or dispute, where the sellers are looked upon as your tenants. That would give them a whole new set of rights and put you deeper in the hole.
Call the police on the sellers for trespassing - for attempting to steal your property. They probably will not do anything, but you want a police report officially documenting this.
You need to immediately find a Canadian real estate attorney TODAY. Try engaging your real estate agent's attorney to at least initially represent you. That may or may not be possible, since your real estate agent is a party to the transaction.
Honest question: If the sale is complete, doesn't the buyer own the house now? And if so, wouldn't the sellers be criminally trespassing and thus subject to removal by police?
