The U.S. could slash it's Budget for defense by 1/3 and even 1/2 and STILL spend more than any other nation, and still have the most advanced and most powerful military on the planet. Imagine having an extra 300 / 400 BILLION Dollars to use in the Economy?
Nearly 1 Trillion Dollars on a Defense budget.... what are we defending against? Who is going to invade us we're not going to see coming for hundreds of miles?
