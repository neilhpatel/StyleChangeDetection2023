To keep an already long answer from dragging any further: Meiji restoration comes. Half of Japan wants to modernize, half of Japan wants a return to the status quo. Samurai lose their positions early on in Meiji, (were up to the 1870s-1880s by now) and the caste system as a whole breaks down. THIS is when the master swordsman samurai myth emerges and takes shape in a way we might recognize it today. Those who opposed modernization and the end of a long isolationist period harkened back to the past, or a rather fictionalized version of it. Samurai were great warriors now, not politicians or landlords. They fought noble battles with swords, layered 7-8 times over on the forge to be able to pierce STEEL. Thus, a legendary class of warrior roots itself into the zeitgeist of a tense period in Japanese history, and the role, bravery, nobility, and legend of the samurai becomes greatly over exaggerated.
Most of what I know about samurai I know from books and movies (Shogun being a big one), and in these modern portrayals, samurai are always eager to commit seppuku (ritualized suicide) to restore their honor. It flies in the face of logic - most people aren’t eager to end their own lives. Was seppuku actually common or revered in pre-Edo Japan, or is this another myth?
It seems they are conflating the various shizoku uprisings with the myth of samurai emerging, but the fact is that the shizoku (e.g. Saigō Takamori) were condemned for their decision to turn against the Meiji government. It isn't until the 1900s when the Nihon country begins to take shape and the samurai/shizoku threat is gone that they begin to reimagine themselves to achieve the later half of their goals in being recognized as a powerful, sovereign state.
