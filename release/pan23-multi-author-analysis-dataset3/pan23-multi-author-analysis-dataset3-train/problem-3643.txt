I support capitalism for societies as populous as modern nation states because communism/command economies do not function well for a large complex society where people don't all know each other.
Like communism- except well, communism helps people on theory and capitalism only means "I can be a billionaire and have to hell no one ever and can choke out competition if I want" in theory. I have yet to see any theory that would ever work out logically for capitalism, honestly.
Funny how you decided to respond with a useless non-sequiter instead of actually providing some rationale for why you think capitalism is good. A+ Debating right there.
One thing people constantly get wrong is lumping socialism and capitalism together as part of the same category and treating them as mutually exclusive. They're not. Capitalism is an economic policy, socialism is...well, a social policy. Socialism should function as a check on capitalism to ensure that the best parts of capitalism are allowed to thrive and the worst parts are discouraged.
Capitalism in theory is a good idea, but it needs regulation through socialist policies or it becomes the bloated, unfettered hellscape we see today. A free market with healthy competition is very good for consumers, but without regulations and consumer protections, the most powerful businesses will take advantage of the system to crush competition and centralize the flow of profit. Much like a dictator taking advantage of democracy to seize power.
