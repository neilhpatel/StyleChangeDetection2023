Believe me when I say I was an asshole as a kid (and a spectacular one at that). I now fully appreciate that part of the value of sports is teaching young men that engaging with older men as peers, as is the case when you swear at them, results in consequences you can't always contain or forecast. This is part of the lesson. This doesn't mean he's a bad kid, it just means that he needs to appreciate that he needs to work on control and behavior. Frankly, the best solution would be to send a genuine apology letter and have him respectfully request a 5 minute meeting with the coach so he could deliver it, emphasize that regardless of outcome he feels remorse, and move on.
You're upset that an adult corrected your child for throwing a tantrum and now you want to sue the coach for coaching the kid on how to be a functioning adult? I don't see much of a basis for a lawsuit here.
Okay? He demonstrated poor sportsmanship and then swore at a coach and did enough that an umpire ejected him from the game.
Your son threw his equipment in a fit of poor sportsmanship and when called on it, escalated to swearing at his coach. I'm siding with the coach here; that behavior is unacceptable, and I'd bet money (from your total disregard of your son's poor behavior) that it wasn't a first incident.
