Honestly, I would have no problem with this being part of a field trip, but it's inappropriate for taxpayer funded schools to be hosting religious ceremonies. With this ruling, every religion has a legal argument for coming to schools and proselytizing under the guise of pedagogy.
My general position is that religion should be kept out of schools. If instead of a smudging ceremony, it was a catholic priest baptizing kids at school, then I'd be just as outraged as most of you all would certainly be.
if a Christian group wanted to come into a school and, say perform a baptism while kids watched and then cleanse the classroom of demons by waving around some incense as a demonstration Iâ€™d tell them to get fucked.
One group wants to smudge my kids. Another wants to baptize them. A third thinks people should pray a certain number of times per day. A fourth likes it when women are totally covered. An African tribe wants fgm. I think they can all do whatever they like outside of schools.
If they had some Christian ceremony where kids were forced to participate people would be up in arms. This seems no different.
See, this is where we differ. Because you're seeing a bunch of children being forced to engage in MaGiC sPeLLs and I see an acknowledgement of another culture's hokum, as opposed to Christian (or Jewish) hokum.
If the mass is being performed so kids can see what it entails and are not being forced (or even encouraged) to take part and it's not being treated as a sacred ceremony to talk to your invisible child-rapist sky daddy?!
So? It's an educational look at a different culture, one that once called this continent home. It's not an endorsement of a religion, or a mandatory proselytizing. The Christian is just pretending to be persecuted because that's what they do.
People really should start complaining when these Christian nutters try to force everyone to pray. I guarantee stupid crap like this will stop appearing in courts.
