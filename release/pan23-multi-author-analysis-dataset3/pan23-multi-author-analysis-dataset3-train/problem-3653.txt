Nah, title is accurate. I mean, it could also say "democrat solidifies victory over political opponent who lost the initial count and the subsequent recount," but that'd be as uselessly editorial as your version.
"Democrats invalidate votes" turns up a lot of historical moments from before the party swap - and anything modern is "election denying" not vote invalidating. Which yeah, I'd deny the 2000 election as well. Supreme Court essentially handed the election to W - whether he would have won a proper recount or not.
And no, demanding a recount within the boundaries of the law doesn't count. That's double-checking, not asking for illegal invalidation. Even then Republicans managed to fuck their up by doing absurd shit like looking for traces of bamboo.
Alleging actual fraud, with evidence. Not "Pretty please overturn the election I lost." Not cancelling individual votes that didn't go your way.
The recount didn’t flip the result from the previous count. That’s not at all the same thing as saying error didn’t pervert the result of the vote.
We know there is at least an error margin of 231 votes, since that’s how much the count changed. That’s the bare minimum amount of error possible with the results we see. But it could easily be more than that, and the vote was only decided by 280.
The original results had her win by about 500 votes, but the recount brought it down to about 280. Both sides gained votes in the recount but the republican gained more. Still though it wasn't enough for him to overtake her.
