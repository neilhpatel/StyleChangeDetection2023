How does the House speaker selection work? Like what happens if one candidate has 210 supporters, one has 200, and one has 25?
Does the person with support from 210 reps become speaker, or do they have to keep negotiating until a 218 of them get behind someone?
Under current House rules, it still takes a majority (not a plurality) to become speaker. If Dems don’t have a majority of the seats in the House, then this won’t happen.
I believe that to become speaker of the house you only need a majority of the votes that are cast not 218+ votes. Pelosi became speaker with 216 votes last year.
It usually, but not always, takes 218 votes to elect a Speaker. But the rule is a majority of those voting, not of the entire Congress. You could have members missing or abstaining, for example.
It took nine ballots before Gillett got to 215 votes, enough to be a majority of the votes cast. The rebellious Republicans finally gave Gillett enough votes after a deal was reached on some procedural changes they wanted.
