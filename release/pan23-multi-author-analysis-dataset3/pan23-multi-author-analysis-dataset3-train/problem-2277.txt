"You see defeating the west's HIMARS was simple. After realizing that the HIMARS have a pre-set kill limit, I sent wave after wave of my own men at their disposal. Until they reached their kill limit and shut down. Igor show them the medal I won." - Putin.
Putin really fucked up. So power hungry and ego driven. Instead of using the wealth of Russia to better the lives of his citizens and create a nation people would want to immigrate to, Putin has personally seized so much control over the wealth and production of Russia it is commonly believed he is the wealthiest man to ever exist. Now he’s in a war he can’t win while his oligarchs see seeing their wealth disappear and the citizens are seeing another generation never come home. It’s sad to see and it’s hard to know just how much this will affect the future of Russia.
If feeling bad for Russians helped, we’d know by now, and you know what, it doesn’t look all that effective.
It needs to get bad enough for the average Russian to opt rather to fight and likely die in Russia, than go to Ukraine and certainly die .
Since hardly anything has changed with the Russian military doctrine, I bet my bottom dollar that the same thing is happening now in Ukraine except it might be even worse (i.e. purposefully using unsecured lines that can easily be listened/tapped into and talk about where the other groups are digging/stationed at which ends up opening them to artillery/drone fire, giving wrong orders to other groups so that they will end up being sitting ducks, having one guy or a bunch surrender to the Ukrainians just so they can rat out on the other groups, etc).
