NAL. You should contact a lawyer about setting up legal guardianship and possibly terminating parental rights for both of the parents and then adopting the kids.
Definitely get a lawyer but since you have these incidents on record you can counter-suit for full custodial guardianship. If you can speak with your relative (the mother) and she is willing to sign off making you their guardians that'll make it all the easier. But since you've been rearing these children since birth you have a wholly valid case to dispute for guardianship and I can't imagine the court system would remove the children from a visibly stable home into an environment that would be detrimental towards their enrichment.
I get the feeling that either someone at the state is trying to give you a heads up on the down low that the father is pursuing custody and that you need to become the children's 'legal' guardian immediately to stop it. Or that the "Someone from the state" you talked with wasn't actually a state employee but someone working with the father to make it seem like you have to turn over the children without a fight.
This sets off so many red flags. Maybe you left out their job title and specific agency for brevity, but no legitimate state employee is going to tell the de facto guardian "There is nothing they can do" to prevent the children from being returned to a parent with a documented history of violent outbursts. The CPS worker I know would have run through all of your options to prevent this.
