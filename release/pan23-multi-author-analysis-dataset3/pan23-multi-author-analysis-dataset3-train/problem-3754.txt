The first Indigenous peoples came to England in the reign of Henry VII and became part of the court as more of an exotic curiosity. The arrival of three Inuit men with Bristol fisherman from Newfoundland is documented in 1500. They were introduced to the king in 1501. In 1503, an ambassador at the court remarked that two of them (the third either returning to Newfoundland or dead) had assimilated so well into English society that they could scarce be distinguished from native Englishmen. What they thought of their experience is unknown.
It is unlikely that Kalicho, the Inuk captive brought to England in 1576, ever met the Queen before his death a couple weeks after arrival. But she did have a post-mortem portrait of him hanging in her privy chambers. The Lutheran theologian Casiodoro de Reina joked to the Wilhelm IV about Kalicho: "They carried away one of the men of that island with them, although a savage creature; he never could be tamed, and so he died. His painted image has restored him almost to life \[and\] he is preserved in that Queen's court. As I am writing, I can scarcely contain myself without laughing at this Lucianic lie." The woman (Arnaq) and child (Nutaaq) who arrived in England with him died soon after him. The next year eight other Inuit captives were brought to England, but little is known about them.
If I could piggy back on op's question and your post: Who was the first Native (non-Inuit) in court?
I’m afraid I can’t tell you exactly who the first non-Inuit would have been, but it likely would have to be some time after the founding of Jamestown. So 1608 is most likely. Someone else may be able to chime in. I believe some of the pins on the map I posted are from around then or a bit later.
