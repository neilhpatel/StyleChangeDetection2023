You can register an online account in the IRS website, with your SSN (you do not need your husband's to register). Once you register, you will have the option to view "wage and income transcripts." If you have a joint bank account, AND that bank account earned any interest in 2020, the bank name will be shown with a form 1099-INT.
If the account is actually a joint bank account, you should be able to withdraw money from it. If the account provides debit cards you should be able to request one, directly from the bank, and start using it.
The question is whether the account is really an actual joint account, or whether it's just your husband's account where he keeps all of your joint money. It should be easy to determine this by looking at a statement or by calling the bank.
If it's the latter, the money is not legally in your name, and it's up to your husband to voluntarily give you access, either by rolling that account into a true joint account, or by cutting you a check. If he won't do that, you may have to pursue divorce if you want to force the issue.
