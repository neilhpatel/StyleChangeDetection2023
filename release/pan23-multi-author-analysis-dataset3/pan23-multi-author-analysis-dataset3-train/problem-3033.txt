The finance manager frantically said a lot of stuff all boiling down to they want $2500 more. Stuff like, "the check is short," "it doesn't equal up to the amount." I'm not trying to under pay the dealer, just not pay more than I'm supposed to.
Start by insisting that the dealership explain, in detail, why they think you owe them more money. Do not go in person with your car, or at least park it off-campus if you do visit in person.
It's for the dealership to provide that receitp to you when they apply for temporary vehicle registration tags.
An aside: The "buyer's [temporary] tag receipt" should be a form with specific information about the car and the buyer.
A "buyer's order" with the price and details of the vehicle sale is a little different than a "vehicle purchase agreement". You probably have only a buyer's order because you didn't apply for financing through the dealer so there's no need for disclosure of things like interest rates and lenh of loan (the mandatory TILA disclosure boxes).
