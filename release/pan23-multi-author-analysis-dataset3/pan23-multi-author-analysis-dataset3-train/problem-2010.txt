Stems from the same core philosophy. All liberal parties have been on-board with it for decades. Liberals actually believe in the liberal side of it, conservatives only when it suits them.
Neo-liberal economics are based on the liberal idea that people should be free to govern themselves and that authorities should act according to and with mandate from the people. Current economics are based on the fraught idea that people vote with their wallets. That it's as easy as people guiding the market in accordance to their wishes and there is no need to regulate the system as that would act in juxtaposition to the idea that people should be free to buy and sell what they want. Conservatives co-opted this system as a means to consolidate power through exploiting greed and lack of oversight.
You can fault conservatives for a whole lot, but the companies making lots of money with as little regulation as possible is a liberal idea. It's called neo-liberal for a reason.
and somehow phrase as if that's the liberals agenda when it's the conservative's. So their argument is a lie. There is a differ nce between something being a liberal idea and being the linerals idea.
