These exemptions are bullshit. Fucking hard enough to prove rape is normal circumstances and incest victims will have to prove what exactly if they’re willing to speak out? I imagine the chorus of folks who will reflexively say ‘they’re just saying that to get an abortion’ or the creation of some absurd burden of proof requirement that will dissuade these victims form seeking out an abortion.
Even in cases where it’s undeniably, statutory rape, such as when a 10 year old becomes pregnant, the GOP will deny the case exists, deflect with whataboutism and then try to prosecute the doctor anyway.
You need to learn what “indication and provision” means in a medical context. The indication and provision for ectopic pregnancies being different from induced abortion just means that it’s a different path to the same end- termination of the pregnancy.
“[T]he indication and treatment for ectopic pregnancies is distinct from the indication and provision of induced abortion”.
Some ectopic pregnancies miscarry on their own in a process called “expectant management.” This is what a lot of doctors are having to do in states with restrictive abortion laws- wait and hope the patient miscarries on her own. Sometimes when an embryo implants in a fallopian tube, the removal of the tube is required in the removal of an ectopic pregnancy, which isn’t a “provision” that is necessary in an induced abortion. And sometimes, treatment of an ectopic pregnancy is nearly identical to the patient to an electively induced abortion.
Ohio literally tried to pass a law requiring doctors to "re-implant" ectopic pregnancies rather than abort. This is not a procedure that even exists. So stop lying about their motivations and outcomes.
