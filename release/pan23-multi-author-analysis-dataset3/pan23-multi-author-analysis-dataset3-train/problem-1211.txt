A bit late to the post, but anything economics. I recently read "The Economic History of China: From Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century" off the sidebar list. Great read, particularly enjoyed learning how society changed with the introduction of new crops and farming techniques. Something I've never given a lot of thought to. So anything interesting you could think of in economics, doesn't have to be any era or place, or even explicitly about economics. Thank you!
Hey folks! Hope your all having a lovely day. Does anyone have any good recommendations on books about Andrew Carnegie? Especially his early fortune making and later philanthropy.
Alas, my province has just put all inter library loans on hold until further notice for reasons. So it'll be awhile before that happens. I might try and trek down to the university library and see if they have it in the system there.
Or for that matter on the development of libraries. Doesn't really matter where in the world, but I've been reading a fair bit about the history of the LA Library, as well as some sort of general history stuff and I'm interested in digging deeper.
