Only problem is, the ones that would want to fight, would also be at risk of serious retaliation. (Eg Moldova, whichever Stan countries are anti Russia etc).
Russia's failure in Ukraine will make every nation on earth safer from their neighbors, even Russia. The world must continue to seize the opportunity to become ever more unified, stable and robust in the deep practicality of standing up against Russia's kind of aggression. Law-abiding nations need to continue give much more aid to rightfully sovereign Ukraine, than the autocrats give to the old imperialist Russia. Aid need not be lethal to send a clear message. Defeat of Russia will encourage more security, stability and sensible policy making around the world, and greatly lessen the future temptation for nations to attack their neighbors.
And if North Korea sends troops to Ukraine, South Korea must seriously consider doing so as well, or at least a very large number of non--combatant Abrams and F-16 maintenance technicians, fully equipped. Just as Israel and Saudi Arabia Iraq, and Turkey must more than respond to what Iran has done in Ukraine. The Pacific Rim nations must respond to what China and India (after their abstention votes in the UN) are or are not, doing in Ukraine. As the worlds most populous neighbors, they both have the most to gain from the "support the non-aggressor" precedents increasingly being reinforced in Ukraine.
As we are seeing in Ukraine, sheer numbers might be helpful in war of attrition but not for conquering land. Technology, doctrine, resources, morale, logistics etc. is what matters.
