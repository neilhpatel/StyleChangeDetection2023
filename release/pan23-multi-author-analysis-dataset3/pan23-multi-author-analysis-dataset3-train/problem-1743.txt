Others have covered much of the matters at hand here, so I will simply give the briefest of comments to sticky some important information to the top. The TL;DR is that this sub is quality over quantity, so not everything gets answered, and answers take time to write, so seeing them requires patience. We strongly encourage users to make use of the Remind Me bot link that is stickied in every thread by Automod to come back later to a thread if there is no answer. Popular thread almost always get answered, even if it takes 12+ hours, so you'll be rarely disappointed there.
Bear in mind that a proper answer can take hours to write so if the thread is only a few hours old, it is probably worth leaving it awhile longer.
In any case, this got longer than I intended, but there are two somewhat divergent issues in play after all, and hopefully this offers decent enough insight into both.
I appreciate you taking the time to offer the insights and the response - it's helpful and appreciated.
I appreciate you taking the time to address my concern, even though I disagree with the mod interpretation. The "I'd suggest" is simply a literary/rhetorical device leftover from my law study days, for example.
