It really isn't. In terms of foreign policy, Israel's center-left governments were consistently better performing, and that includes Iran as a threat.
I think it would be hard to argue that foreign policy isnâ€™t the wedge issue that keeps the Israeli right wing in power.
In case you're not following, Israel's right wing parties' PR is dominantly focused on internal security, with 2nd place being playing on the feelings of the poor.
Well he's not getting it from Israel. Israel was never Russia's friend, and after going through several wars with one another, their relations are a simple "don't bother me, I won't bother you".
Russia's and Iran's mutual arms deals plus Israel's aid to Ukraine are definitely putting a strain on Israeli-Russian relations, but it would take a lot more than that to sever their ties.
Israel and Russia are not friends, more like "we're enemies, but we have other things to focus on". Unlike Europe-Russia dynamics, there are many factors at play that decide how Israel-Russia relations progress. For both, it's impossible to just shut everything off and say "we're done talking". Europe can certainly afford such an approach.
