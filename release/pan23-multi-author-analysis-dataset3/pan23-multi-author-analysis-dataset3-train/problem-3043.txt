As an insurance agent I can tell you this is bull shit. If you have comprehensive (or collision) coverage on your car it does not matter who moved the car or who wrecked it. If your car is stolen & wrecked you pay the deductible and they pay the rest. Something sounds very sketchy here. I’m guessing they are trying to make any excuse not to pay because I’d guess there are a lot of claims due to Ida right now. All of this is if you have comp and/or collision. If it’s liability only then insurance will cover nothing. I would suggest contacting an attorney for this. You’d be surprised how fast tones change when they know an attorney is involved. Hopefully you have proof the manager towed it himself. That will help a lot. Good luck.
I forgot to add the rental coverage info. This guy explained it perfectly. Comp, rental & gap coverage has to be on your policy in order for it to cover. We offer gap coverage but 9.9 times out of 10 it’s cheaper to do it on with your loan. If you do not have these coverages on your insurance policy then they are not covered. Gap, towing and rental are usually add ons on top of comp & collision. If you do not have these coverages then going after your building manager is your only legal option.
If the building manager owns a tow truck, does he have some kind of separate business for that as well or any kind of special licensing to operate a tow truck?
NAL, I could be wrong here, but if the building manager towed your car himself with his own equipment, and he doesn’t have a tow truck company that is licensed, would that not be “grand theft auto” or “joyriding”if the manager moved the vehicle? I don’t see how what the manager did is any different than a random person getting into your car and driving it up the street and leaving it there, which, is basically the definition of joyriding and is a criminal offense.
