My idea/expression is a specific service. Basically a novelty one would pay for. I would advertise the title all over and I was wondering before I did that if I should copyright/trademark anything? Main concern is someone else copying idea and claiming it is theirs and then taking my website down.
How much power would a copy-cat have to take my OG website down, should they be the first one to copyright/trademark?
Could they copyright it in a way which could get the original site-owner to have to be forced to take the site down? The site I am describing would feature a service offered by a “character.”.
I am not intending on suing anyone -- I am trying to determine if someone would do that to me and force me to take down my site, (me = the original creator of the work, but who thought I could just put the website out un-copywritten/trademark'd).
Title: If I have an idea for a novelty-oriented website, how do I go about copyrighting/trademarking to ensure I can’t have the idea stolen / my site taken-down by a copycat who takes legal action against my site?
Basically if I go into this and make an original character with a catchy website title offering a niche service and skip all copyrighting, are you basically saying that I'd be protected (udner "copyright protection") even if someone else copied me / tried to C&D me / shut me down (via them copyrighting it since I never did)?
