You are not obligated to pay it since the lease states that electricity is provided. The landlord made a bad assumption. Unfortunately, if you tell the LL you won't pay the difference between $45 and what she's billed she may make your tenancy difficult. Though it's possible she'll do that regardless.
A few points to consider. If the bill was $60 would she have complained and demanded you pay $15? Unless she's shared a year of past billing statements you don't even know if she's being honest about the prior tenant's usage. If the bill isn't in your name and she's not providing it you can't be sure she's being honest and will continue to be honest and you don't have direct access to daily/hourly usage data which may be available and allow you to make informed decisions to reduce the electrical expense.
You could use this as an opportunity to negotiate for something that will benefit you. For example capping all future rent increases at 2% per year and her giving you an additional 30 days notice if she doesn't intend to renew - all in writing. If it was me, I'd ask for 12 months of electrical bills to review. Then I might state that upon receipt of future bills I'll pay for anything over $75 (not $45) or for the service to be put in my name and to receive a monthly rent credit for $75, but here's what I'd like in return. If she balks I'd say that I verified that I'm not legally obligated to pay for electricity and that I'm treating the $300 I gave you previously as prepayment towards next month's rent.
If the lease stipulated electric was included, you're not obligated legally to pay extra just because the previous tenant was on the low side and you're on the high side.
Generally when utilities are included in the lease, there is a certain quota for which the landlord accepts responsibility, over which it is the tenant’s responsibility. While it doesn’t sound like that was mentioned in the lease, it does sound like you’ve agreed to it in writing as a modification.
Most lease agreements contain a clause (usually near the end) indicating the circumstances under which the terms of the contract can be changed. For the leases that do contain this clause, it usually states all changes must be done in writing and with a valid signature by all parties to the lease agreement. Don't forget - a lease is a contract.
Check your lease first. See if it has that clause. If it doesn't, you may have waived your ability to argue that you should not be paying the electricity bill by already making those payments. If it does, you may still have waived that ability, but will have a better argument weighing in your favor.
ETA: yes, it occasionally is just a box that is checked. I have also seen versions where it is automatically written into the agreement. Leases vary in a number of ways, which is why it always important to read the fine print and ask questions when you have them! They’re contracts - all parties involved should understand the terms they’re agreeing to.
