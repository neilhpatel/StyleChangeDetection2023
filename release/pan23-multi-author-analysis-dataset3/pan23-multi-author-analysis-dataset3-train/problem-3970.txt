I don't think so. If one think is clear after the last few months, it's that Russia still believes in great power politics and spheres of influence. If Ukraine is not in Russia's sphere of influence anymore, it must be in the US's sphere of influence now. Therefore, they should be listening to their orders. I think the fact that Ukraine is acting as it's own, sovereign nation, is incomprehensible to him.
For a long time now Russian leadership has been saying that Ukraine is just a vassal of NATO. That Zelensky it's just a puppet of the US.
It's almost as if he is contradicting the very idea that zelenskiyy is a puppet as they claim. As if he is president of a sovereign nation or something.
It's not required of Ukraine to concede anything of theirs to Russia. They are a sovereign nation. They are being annexed. Nothing is obliged from them.
I love how Lavrov deliberately misreads the powerplay of "yeah, we all would love to see this end peacefully in negotiations" as a condemnation of zelenskyy. It's not.
