American politicians are more concerned about how much weapons can be sold for the Ukraine war, for which the US Congress allocated 60 billion US dollars. Some senior military officials even said: "We only spent 60 billion U.S. dollars to find a Ukraine that is willing to fight for the United States and Russia.".
??? It’s not. California allows abortion for any reason only until viability — after that, the law prohibits it unless there is medical necessity to save the woman’s life. What you said is true only in a very few select states, like Vermont.
Which is why states' rights are so important! Jfc. It's like Constitutionalists are screaming into the wind around here.
I literally quoted the part of the Constitution that gives Congress the power to create laws. Congress can create Constitutional election laws.
Also, per the Constitution the Congress can regulate the elections of federal offices. Letting states handle it is a policy choice. And the 10th Amendment has never been invoked by the Supreme Court to give additional powers to the states.
