I've lived through enough spillage incidents that absolutely kill productivity while all devices are imaged, cleaned, etc.
What gets me is the relative nonchalance this entire issue is dealt with. Biden, Trump, Pence, Hillary. If I did this at the scale that we're seeing, I'd be in federal jail for many years.
Jail is an option. To me, this goes way beyond 'oopsie' and a hand slap. This is criminal incompetence. Again, my opinion.
This is what I was thinking. If this was Biden, the headline would be “Biden aide copies classified pages to laptop.”.
If it was the NY Post writing the headline, it’d be, “Did Biden order aide to copy classified pages to laptop and hide them from authorities?”.
“… a Trump aide (who works for Save America PAC) had previously copied those same pages onto a laptop and thumb drive—the aide reportedly did not realize they were classified.”.
"a Trump aide (who works for Save America PAC) had previously copied those same pages onto a laptop and thumb drive—the aide reportedly did not realize they were classified".
