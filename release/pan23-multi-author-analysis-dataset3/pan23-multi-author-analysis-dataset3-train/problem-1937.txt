Big fuckin' surprise. Guarantee you they saw some out of context screenshots from Gender Queer on a private FB group, were told that and more explicit content were in the kids' section, and went from there.
It's the "they eat the poo poo" priest writ large. "Check out these out of context shots of a book not meant for children THAT'S what these queers want to give to kids in your library".
It's so funny that these old ass boomer Repugs think that shutting down a library is going to stop young LGBTQ kids from finding LGBTQ material.... when there's the FUCKING INTERNET.
Gay kids are gonna be gay no matter what these old fucks think, and if anything, banning these books and events are going to encourage the kids to go find them on Amazon and read it on their kindle.
They're actually picking the worse path imo - instead of LGBTQ YA novels, which parents can check out reviews of in order to determine their appropriateness, they're encouraging these kids into the wild wild west of gay fanfiction.
