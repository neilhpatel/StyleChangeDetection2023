Which means the remaining Gepard ammo Germany has can't be transferred to Ukraine. This political decisions leads to big problems for the swiss defense industry which is now confronted with requests for guarantees they can't provide. Which in consequence cut them off from a lot of contracts.
No, pretty much every country has laws which refer to reexport of military goods. For example all former NVA equipment (military of east Germany) which was transferred to Ukraine was approved by Germany, same with the Leopards. But Switzerland doesn't allow the reexport into a conflict zone.
The Factory that produces ammo for the gepard is in Switzerland and they got laws that prohibit transfer of Arms to countries in war.
To make up for it. Pretty wise since gepard has been useful at shooting down the 20k suicide bomb drones, a Ukrainian gepard operator said just 3 short bursts and the drone is down. Less expensive than using anti air missiles (s300 - 140k, modern defense systems 400-500k )and easier to operate 24/7 compared to manpads.
