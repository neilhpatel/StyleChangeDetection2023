ITT: People who didn't read the article, and so believe that teens will be allowed to undergo sex reassignment surgery.
Listen you have your opinions I have mine its simple as that, I have no issues with gender reassignment surgeries I just don't think it should be available for minors. Identify as a different gender, they should express themselves however they want and then if they still feel that way when they become an adult then there's no reason why they shouldn't be allowed to have it. Tell them of the option and that it's available when they become an adult. And until that time does come you should encourage them to act like themselves.
Bigoted Ignorance and reprehensible? You make it sound like I'm against gender reassignment and Gender change entirely and kids can not be trusted to make a decision involving surgery that can't be fully reversed. By all means help them change gender using non surgery methods.
That's fine, I'd have been angry if it was talking about actual gender changing surgery, people shouldn't be able to make that kind of decision that young.
The common misconception of those who are anti-transgender is that the decision to change gender is made by crazy parents or troubled kids on a whim when in fact it’s made over the course of many years with the consultation of many doctors.
Ya, I’m just saying that most of the time parents will first report their kid may be transgender at a young age but they will sit back and observe for many years before they do any kind of medical stuff.
