Wars are won and lost through logistics. Most of Ukraine's train system, which they depend on to move men and materiel to and from the front, runs on electricity. The more the Russians can limit Ukraine's ability to keep forces fed, supplied, and where they need to be, the better Russia's prospects of reducing the Ukrainian military.
As part of the weapons deal Ukraine has with NATO, they can't use it for offensive strikes into Russian territory. Inside the conflict zones, it's fine. But if they start hammering Russian cities with western missiles, their weapon and intelligence supply will be cut off.
I mean yes, Russia is depleting its stocks of precision guided missiles at a much faster rate than they can be produced and are having to look to places like Iran to get more. That's typically what's meant by "running out.".
That's the point, there is no such occasion. Everyone knows the implications of MAD. That's why we've been to the brink of it during the Cuban Missile crisis, but never actually there.
Just read up on the cold War, per your instructions. Now time for your quiz: Approximately how many nukes were used in the Cold War?
You can't make a comparison of a time where nukes weren't used, as evidence that they will this time. Your own comparison only fuels the argument that they wouldn't use them now, since they didn't then either.
