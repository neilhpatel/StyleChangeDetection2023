Spratt was helped by the nature of his product. Dog food is durable and this was before widely available refrigeration. This meant he could ship it farther than most people could ship other types of food. Ironically, this means commercial dog food actually predates most commercial human food. Commercially produced and distributed dog food predates commercially produced and distributed milk or bread, for example. Of course, as soon as Spratt's product hit the open market other people began to produce dog food of a similar model. Spratt attempted to defend his innovation but was not granted a patent or exclusive rights on the grounds that dog treats and food had pre-existed his industrialized version of it.
Well, if you're construing it broadly we have references dating back to Late Republican Roman for specialty dog food. We get our first recipe in an Early Imperial book about farming, where specially making food is recommended to increase the dog's life, health, and ability to work. We also have references to Roman bakers selling bread for dogs. Humans transmitted knowledge of what dogs liked and was healthy even before that. And after Roman times, through the Middle Ages, we find European recipes for dog food and recommendations on what they can and cannot eat.
I'm curious why you know all of this about the history of dog food, though. One of the things that always surprises me about /r/AskHistorians is that you can ask the most obscure question about history and someone who has spent ten years studying that exact corner of history will come along and give a detailed answer.
