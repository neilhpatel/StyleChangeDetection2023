"The democratic president hasn't managed to deal with the massive deficit he inherited from us fast enough! So now elect us again, so we can blow it up so large, that the next democratic president will fail to fix it entirely as well.".
Yep. Right wingers in Poland keep complaining that these deals were influenced by the USSR, and that they didn't get enough money out of it.
It's also seems worth noting that this was brokered by the USSR, which saw both Poland and East German as Soviet vassal states at the time. But the frontier line was definitely made permanent by resettlement patterns and the breakup of the USSR...
But, if you really wanted to return to the 1939 status quo ante, the territories would go back to Germany, and Poland would receive the monetary indemnity and whatever other forms of reparations are appropriate.
After the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, there were further treaties between the reunified Germany and the Republic Poland, in which the existing agreements on reparations (e.g. Potsdam Conference and Treaty of Warsaw) were reconfirmed. For example the German-Polish Border Treaty of 1990.
That free Poland had no say in reparations because of Soviet occupation is a myth spread by the PiS.
