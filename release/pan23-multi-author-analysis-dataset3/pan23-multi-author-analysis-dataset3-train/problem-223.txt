I did read your post. I’m telling you it’s a very uphill climb because you also likely messed up. Know how I know that? Because you were unable to stop in time.
Exactly. And to the driver in the rear, all it looks like to them is “sudden stop, no reason!” OP would have rear ended the other driver even if she was stopping to avoid running over a kid.
EDIT: I mean take a step back and really think about it. Whether it’s a broken down car, stopped traffic that comes out of nowhere, or a lady who who had a stroke, you are responsible for being able to avoid what’s in front of you. It’s literally your number-one job when driving.
It’s not open and shut but pretty close to it. Slamming on the brakes with no warning is a common highway occurrence that you’re supposed to be ready for.
So going down the interstate I should expect a car to slam on their brakes with no lights around and come to a complete stop? There was no car in front of her and she was still for about a second before I hit her. If she rear ended the next person that’s understandable but there was no car in front of her when I hit her. She stopped paying attention and sat in the middle of the road for no reason.
