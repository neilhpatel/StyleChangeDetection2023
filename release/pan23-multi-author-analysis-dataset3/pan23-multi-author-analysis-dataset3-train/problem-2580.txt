True. Would I be able to claim the loss of tournament winnings since the models were part of my competitive list? Also they were all professionally painted so could that be counted into their value?
If you got these recently and they are still available and you have receipts from getting them painted, you could ask for that amount minus depreciation from use. Alternatively, if you have pictures of them before they were destroyed (or less helpfully, a comprehensive list), you could contact a store or dealers who sells a significant quantity of Warhammer and see if they can give you a valuation. If they are common enough to be on say eBay, determine what they cost painted or unpainted (plus the cost of painting).
I know Warhammer can be expensive. If a lot was lost it damaged, you may want to look into making an insurance claim (against his insurance as a contractor or the home insurance for the property). For home insurance, you may have needed a rider to insure expensive collectibles. The exact circumstances of the loss may preclude one or both of these options.
If you go the small claims route, the issue will be showing the judge how much they are worth. People see "toys" and don't realize how expensive they actually are.
