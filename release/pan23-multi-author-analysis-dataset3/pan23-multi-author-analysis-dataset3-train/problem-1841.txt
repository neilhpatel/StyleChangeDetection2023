Speaking to a gun broker may be the best option here. I'd be really careful about WWI/WWII gun value because there frankly are a ton of that era's weapons floating around and that doesn't necessarily make them valuable.
The problem is that you're going to veer into FFL territory quickly because of the sheer volume here. I assume none of these are short barreled rifles, automatic weapons, sawed off shotguns, or NFA stamp items, correct?
The original paperwork for a majority of the collector guns is all there. The only ones that don't have any sort of authentication paperwork are the newer guns like glocks and Beretta 9mms. I will have to go through the process of separating guns and paperwork and pricing. As far as finding the right buyer, you're right. I don't think I won't to hold on to thousand plus dollar rifles for years until the right seller comes along.
None of them are machine guns or "trophies". He served, but was never deployed, so everything he has accumulated over the years has been through dealers.
Yes they are. Some of his firearms are original unfired from WWI and WWII. Some of those are worth 2-4k or beyond. I don't want to sell them as a lot because the initial investment for them won't be covered.
