Washinon allows for grandparent's right to maintain a relationship with a grandchild in certain circumstances.
There are family law lawyers in Washinon that specialize in grandparents rights/visitation. I would start your search there. Washinon does appear to have legal options for grandparents to ask the court for visitation in situations like yours.
I'm not a lawyer by any means, but is an overview of Washinon state law on grandparent's rights. The section you should look at is "grandparents as de facto parents". There is a 4-part test to see if you qualify, and based on your post, it seems that you have a strong case. You definitely need to bring this up with an actual lawyer versed in this stuff.
You need a family law attorney. The visitation law for non-biological parents changed a few years ago. Under RCW 26.11 a petitioner must prove a strong emotional tie with the child among other things.
In your post you relate your concern she may have become violent again. The court would look negatively on that if it were to be brought up ( or any other similar language ). I truly wish you the best. Iâ€™ve been in your shoes and only wanted to give a heads up.
