You are in the driver's seat, tell them how much you need to move, or you're staying for the long haul. If the agent calls back shouting tell him to no longer contact you via phone and only in writing, then block the number or set it to go to voice mail.
While your lease is in effect you live in California which has new rental laws. You can stay till the end of your lease, you can stay past the end of your lease and they would have to give you an eviction that includes a reason, and turning the unit over to another renter is not one of them.
The new owner retains your existing lease and you're still bound by that lease until the lease term ends or you execute an early lease termination clause, if it exists.
Talking about a cash for keys option isn't an obligation. Unless specific amounts and terms were agreed upon and put into writing you won't have any recourse here. Even if you did and they backed out, you'd still have to comply with your lease and pursue damages via court.
Then you're on the same month to month lease with the new owners. They can't instantly evict either. They'll have to give you proper legal notice to end the tenancy. Same for you if you want to end it.
