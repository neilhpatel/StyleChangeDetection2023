So... you came back to New York, intended to remain, and enrolled in NY Medicaid? If you weren't simultaneously using Medicaid benefits for multiple states, I don't see the problem.
I’ve noticed that all states have their own state Medicaid, I was under the impression that I had to have permanent residence in said state to be able to use their insurance. If this isn’t the case then that really helps on my part. Thank you a lot.
Wow I had no idea about this, I feel a lot better. I thought the state of your drivers license had to match your health insurance. Would it be a bad idea for me to call up my NY Medicaid and update them with my Tennessee license info instead of them having my surrendered NY license? The address on that license isn’t where I stay anymore, but I’m not sure if people look into these kind of things.
I’ve been in New York for a year since I moved to TN, but I have not changed my license or any info over to NY. My dad lives in TN, mom lives in NY, so if I ever got questioned then I’d say I go back and forth.
