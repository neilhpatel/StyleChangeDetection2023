Even so, a minority not showing up is still a lot of people that otherwise would not be here. Plus, your study only focuses on families, not individuals.
Lol wow what a leap. They are cheap labor for the wealthy in America and depress wages for native Americans for one. I also live in an agricultural area that has experienced the effects on a day to day basis for much of my life We also have had one of the most lax immigration regimes since 1965 with illegal immigration happening concurrently. We used to have immigration in waves and then greatly reduce the amount for assimilation to occur. We have not allowed any time period for assimilation since 1965. So illegal immigration in my view exacerbates the core problem which is our broken immigration system. You didn’t even come up with a counter argument by the way, just virtue signaled lol.
Not all of them are refugees and I don’t think the scenario you’re describing pertains to most illegal immigrants, who are more so economic migrants as opposed to refugees.
It sure what you mean by “legal right”, they are not citizens, unless you are referring to the asylum process. They have the legal right if they are seeking asylum, which there is a different process for that doesn’t involve crossing the border illegally. Most illegal immigrants nowadays do not come from Mexico, but South America, and many (and probably the vast vast majority) are not actually fleeing for their lives but rather for economic opportunity. Seems reasonable to not bring them over the border, give them a court date, and release them into the interior of the country they were trying to illegally enter and hope they show up for their court date.
Because they are fleeing Mexico (and other places) because they fear for their lives and they have a LEGAL RIGHT to present themselves in the United States and stay until their court date.
