Your first statement doesn’t necessarily follow from the second. Another justification would be they don’t like you, irrespective of your race. And that one would be legal. If you can establish a patter of treating POC differently than others that goes beyond just you, that might be substantive. But if your evidence is just you, you’re unlikely to be successful.
Adding to this, it is unlikely OP would create a situation where they were legally entitled to the sign on bonus. That construct doesn’t really exist.
It is much more likely one might negotiate to a place where the employer agrees not to claw back that bonus.
Your signing bonus is a matter of contract law and constructive dismissal is not relevant. If you were to successfully sue for constructive dismissal, you could ask for damages to cover the forfeit bonus.
Some general points, constructive dismissal is an incredibly hard bar to meet and nothing in your post suggest that. Your employer is generally entitled to fire you for any reason whatsoever, unless it’s a protected one. You would have to provide evidence that the protected characteristic was the reason you were fired, additionally you would have to prove that the working conditions were so intolerable that it would be reasonably expected that a person would be forced to quit For it to meet the bar for dismissal.
you don’t “resign under terms of constructive dismissal”, you would have to sue them for wrongful termination.
Title: Best way to leave hostile work environment under constructive dismissal? Can I keep sign-on bonus?
In this case the sign on bonus. As an at will employee you’re generally free to quit without notice. Note treating you different doesn’t automatically mean they’re doing it based off race. They can think you’re a jerk and legally discriminate against you.
