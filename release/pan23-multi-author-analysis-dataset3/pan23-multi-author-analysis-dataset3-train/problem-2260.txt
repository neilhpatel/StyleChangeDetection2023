Foreign countries aren't willing to shell out money to conserve these rainforests. So that's when some countries like Brazil begin clearcutting rainforests because it pays the bills and generates revenue spurred from economic development.
The rainforest is important for the world and the environment but its an economical curse because you cannot develop on this land without harming the environment.
We can't have it both ways, criticising them for deforestation cause it affects us but expecting them to take the financial burden of conservation.
The world economy isn't going to continue to exist as we know it until we figure out how to account for externalities like pollution and deforestation. We're going to reach a breaking point sometime in our lifetimes.
If you haven't noticed, we're already reaching that breaking point. I don't know if there's going to be a clear delineation of before and after, it will probably be a more gradual process than that, but it will likely take place over the next 10-20 years. We've known for decades that the problem exists and what we need to do to protect ourselves... and instead we just keep making the problem worse.
