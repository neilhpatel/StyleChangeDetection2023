A lot of them are, yeah. It’s actually really messed up. Maybe it started out as shitposts and irony, but the problem with that is like what happened to the_donald, eventually people who legit believe that stuff invade and the satire gets driven out.
It’s definitely a niche thing that goes beyond monkeys being menaces, it explicitly is that weird subculture that fantasizes about mitigating, torturing and killing monkeys, especially baby monkeys.
I mean, idk if youre talking about sub niche subculture, but every place I've ever been or lived that has monkeys they have been a huge menace. They are aggressive, thiefs, and just aggravating. Most people don't like them. I obviously agree they shouldn't be slave labor but I get why people hate monkeys.
And I guess I'm not opposed to monkeys harvesting coconuts, as long as they're doing it of their own free will and aren't being abused?
Apparently, coconut farms _not_ using monkeys don't exist or are at least very rare. Brands put a made up "no monkey business" logo on their coconut milk because it sells well, not because they've verified that all farms they source their nuts from are monkey free. There's so many farms and so many middle men, nobody up till the importers knows what they're buying.
There's this public tv show here which investigated stuff like this, one episode was about coconuts.
