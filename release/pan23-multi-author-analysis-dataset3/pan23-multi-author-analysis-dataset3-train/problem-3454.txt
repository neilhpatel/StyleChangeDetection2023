The FAA requires them to be registered. They require a type of pilots license to use commercially. They should be treated and protected like all other aircraft, and it's a federal penalty to shoot at any flying aircraft.
If they are not aircraft, then the FAA needs to relax their laws against them and admit they have no jurisdiction over them.
Further, there is no chance that the FAA will require a sport pilot certificate for recreational drone activities. None. It just doesn’t make sense at all to require a 16 year old kid, or there parents to spend thousands of dollars for fixed wing stick and rudder aircraft training so that they can control a drone with their thumbs on their smart phone. The skills don’t transfer well and it’s like asking someone to be a licensed Plummer in order to plunge their own toilet.
MN has some fairly strict fireworks laws as well. Depending on the size and type, along with whatever evidence you have of them, you could file a report with the local police.
Easiest would probably be small claims court (Conciliation Court). There are some fees attached, but it would be the easiest way in MN.
