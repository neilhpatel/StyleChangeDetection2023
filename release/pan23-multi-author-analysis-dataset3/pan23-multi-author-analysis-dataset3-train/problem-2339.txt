Couldn't this completely backfire and end up with them being required to pay to be hooked up to a public utility?
Gotcha. I'm not a lawyer, so I can't say what would happen if you contacted the authorities. I know that in my state the public authorities won't do anything about a private contract. So this is at a weird intersection of private contract and the utility thing. I think it would be in your best interest to work with the RV park to come to a new agreement. I know it'll be hella expensive, but when it comes time to resell your property something like that could be the difference between being able to sell and being stuck.
I have the same fear about them being difficult when it comes time to sell, however, 3 of the homes have been sold/purchased within the last year (myself being one of them), without paying them and without any real hangups.
I agree, unfortunately they are not being very reasonable with my offers (which is just current market rate, nothing crazy). So its back to the status quo of just ignoring them, like has been the case with previous home owners for decades.
What type of lawyer would be best equiped to look into this? Real estate law? Contract law? Is there a utilities law? Lol.
Thanks, and that was my thought as well, I was just seeing if anyone had any other thoughts before I potentially unleash fire and brimstone on the park.
