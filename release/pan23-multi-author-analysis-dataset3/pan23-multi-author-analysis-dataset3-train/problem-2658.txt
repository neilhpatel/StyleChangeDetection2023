You proclaim to espouse facts and then make a completely unfounded assumption about religiosity leading to corporate dominion over man and nature, and the subsequent death of the planet we are currently living through. That’s a pretty wild leap.
Pretty sure you’re confusing religious individuals with corporations that have equivalent rights as humans if you’re talking about humanity’s survival.
I am not religious at all, but I know the average person of faith is not a rabid cultist. You are confusing believing in God with fanaticism. They are not the same thing.
They do. Their cartoons of the Pope and priests and such, also rabbis, are horrific. My understanding is that for the more extreme flavor of Muslims, there are two impacts: the insult, obviously, but also the prohibition on depicting the prophet. Which, I would have though, only applies to them, but there you are. I'm obviously wrong.
That's not a new phenomenon. You could always lose your job for saying something inapt. Jokes, observations that the boss might be wrong, lots of things. Easy to fire people in the USA, and it happens all the time for good and bad reasons. Just like the reasons people get hired.
