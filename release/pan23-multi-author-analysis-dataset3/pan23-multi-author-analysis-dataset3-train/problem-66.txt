Thanks for the response. I do think this is a scam as well, but the lady never asked me to return the item or anything. Neither did Walmart. She said herself that she was refunded and that Walmart is going to file a police report. Not sure how she got my info, but I suspect that Walmart customer service gave her my info.
If Wal-Mart gave her your information (which I am highly suspect of, that would probably get someone fired), they need to go through their call records. I'm pretty sure that's a big no-no.
That's what I'm assuming, it's the seller posing as someone who's credit card was stolen and somehow got your information, and try to get more money than they got paid? I've been on Ebay since the 90s and this is the first I've ever heard of this. If your card/Paypal was charged properly for the item, I would ignore it and she can go through her credit card company if she truly was scammed.
Just as a precaution, I would change your ebay/paypal passwords, and set-up 2FA on both if possible. I'm quite suspicious about all of this.
