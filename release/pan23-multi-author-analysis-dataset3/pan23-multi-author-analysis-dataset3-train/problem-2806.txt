Oh look at that, a great opportunity to remind everyone of how that zealotry fuels one of their more forgotten dogmas, and why that passion should scare the shit out EVERYONE on Earth: The Right wants to protect Jerusalem because, in their mind, it plays a key role in heralding The End Times.
This makes their motivations for 'supporting' Israel, whoms formation as a nation state, and continued existence as a nation state until they are all sent to hell, IS one of the prophecies that had to be fulfilled in order to trigger the rapture, very very very obvious, and very obviously antisemitic.
Then there’s the just numbers angle that you’re justifying suffering, death, torture, dispossession of millions of people, just because Israel treats their gay people better… and even then, it’s not like it’s wholly accepted in Israel either, specially not by the more orthodox who also just happened to seize power.
Nah dude. The point is you deflect any and all valid criticism of the Israeli state by framing it as anti semitism.
What you’re saying has been said for ever now, it doesn’t change the tactic of the Israeli state and it’s supporters of always framing all critique as anti semitic.
Pretty sure the hostility comment was about surrounding middle eastern countries who’ve had Israel imposed on them.
There's a good bit of antisemitism in there, too just like in the bible but the quran does not command killing anyone just for being Jewish.
