For the stove, if you failed to clean it correctly to prevent that sort of damage to the stove, we do bill for it. You are expected to clean the provided stove following manufacturers instructions to prevent that sort of buildup. If it was correctly cleaned throughout your residency, that type of damage would not occur.
After months/years of build up, it is very difficult to get off, and may permenantly damage the top of the stove. In that case, we WOULD bill the resident for the damage to the stove.
However even if the oven needs to be replaced, you would only owe the depreciated cost of it. Let's say an oven lasts for 10 years on average and it's 5 years old when it needs replaced. You would owe for half of the cost because of depreciation.
Also, it sounds like you were notified of these damages more than 30 days after move out. The landlord has 30 days to notify you of damages and/or return your security deposit or he can be liable for double the deposit amount.
Landlord had 30 days to give you back your deposit or show cause as to why they were keeping it WITH an itemized list with prices paid. Since they didn't provide the itemized receipt until after the 30 days, they can't hold any of your deposit.
They notified us vial email 28 days after move out that they were keeping our deposit and we owed more. They didnâ€™t send pictures and a receipt for the new oven until about 2 months after move out.
I was actually just reviewing the documents they sent me. I asked them for an invoice for the oven that was purchased. The invoice for the oven is dated 2.5 weeks prior to our move out inspection being completed. We were still living in the apartment when the oven was purchased, prior to the move out inspection being completed. Does that make sense? They bought the oven before seeing that one would be required? That seems fishy right?
