It’s already only valued at 55k, so you don’t really seem to have much room to contest their valuation.
But Start by doing a little research on the property tax appeal process. Generally, to appeal, the assessor must first visit your property. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because they could have material facts about your property wrong such as incorrectly stating it’s square feet, age, or condition. From there, you generally try to prove to them that your are being unequally assessesed in valuation compared to similar properties. If you have an actual argument you can make, you generally do so at a board of equalization, and then in tax court.
Property tax is an area that is very unique by state. So this is just to give you a generic overview.
Most states have a process for contesting the assessors opinion of the market value of your property. (The mill rate applied to your property valuation gets your tax amount).
Property taxes are very local. I live a state away from you. We moved from one county to another a few years ago. The taxes on our former home which is half the value of our current one has almost exactly the same property tax bill. One county is very fiscally conservative (low taxes), the other is not (high taxes). If you want change, it starts with spending at the local level--school districts have a lot to do with property taxes.
