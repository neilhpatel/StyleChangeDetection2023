The first thing you need to do is get your cat some medical attention. Once the vet does everything they need to do, pay the vet in full out of your own pocket. Then send a demand letter to both the groomer and the service you use. Send it via certified mail with a signature receipt. Keep it simple and professional. 2-3 sentences should be plenty:
EDIT: You may also have a mandatory binding arbitration clause in there. If so, you gave up your right to sue. You'll need to go through the arbitration procedure instead.
EDIT 2: Just to be clear, if both the groomer and the company pay you, you have to refund one of them.
You could also sue the groomer who did it personally and have part of the settlement be, no more grooming.
Section 17 does not purport to limit the liability faced by the groomer, only that faced by Groomit. Sections 6 and 12 may suggest that Groomit operates or at least presents itself as a separate entity from the groomers and that the groomers are not its employees or agents (whether that's true or not is a separate question).
