Yes, same event. One of the largest donors to building the nursery school for children with AIDS was forced off the stage so Trump, who never gave a dime, could sit in his seat and get applause.
Well, there was the time his older brother dumped a bowl of mashed potatoes over his (Donny's) head when he was being obnoxious at the dinner table. Donny never got over it. It's recounted in Mary Trump's book, "Too Much and Never Enough.".
That’s the thing. The MAGA people don’t like leftists, but we basically did what we were supposed to do by voting for Democrats.
But Trump is petty, vindictive, and narcissistic. When some other Republican (I always assumed it would be DeSantis) got picked as the new golden child, Trump would freak out and start trying to create a rift in the party. This is where we currently are.
DeSantis will pick up more of Trump’s supporters after the primary victory, but the fighting will just make Trump’s remaining supporters even more adamant. DeSantis will pick up the overwhelming majority of the Republican vote, but Trump will get somewhere around 10%, and that will be enough to sink DeSantis.
But unless the GOP successfully consolidate the anti-Trump base around one person (DeSantis), then we'll have the same situation as 2016 where Trump kept winning states with a plurality in the 30-40 percent range.
