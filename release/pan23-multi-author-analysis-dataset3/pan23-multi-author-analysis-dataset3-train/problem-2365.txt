DO clarify the period and/or culture you're looking for. The more precise a question is, the better chance it generally has of getting an answer.
Hi! We've removed your post. While the question in the title is fine, and even the link to the video, the elaboration in your question is not. It is important not to attempt to lead the question - or assume the answer - and we frown on cavalier references to genocide. So if you would like to repost the question without the speculation, you may.
DO keep in mind how others will read your question, and so be conscientious about asking about sex, gender, race, discrimination, ableness, and genocide.
DON'T link or post to any site or video that expresses discriminatory views (that isn't really relevant here, but just future reference.).
DO NOT post what you think is the answer and ask if that is correct. You can always ask follow-up questions if there is anything unclear in the answer.
I will post my my question again without the elaboration. Just for future reference, are there any do's and dont's tips on elaborating question?
