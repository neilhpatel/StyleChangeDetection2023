When you were being physically abused…I’m thinking your wrist be broken, did you ever report it to a doctor (other medical professional) or a law enforcement officer/agent? If not, why?
If so, see if it is appropriate to get a restraining order. In this way, you might be able to break your lease with cause and/or be a candidate for domestic violence resources available.
Texas will allow you to break a lease if you are a victim of stalking, sexual abuse or domestic violence - however, the landlord could ask for documentation of DV. It is at the landlords discretion. (I looked into it a bit for the stalking side, but my complex was difficult about it - wanted to see a restraining order to prove stalking, but also said if there was a restraining order, then I shouldn't have reason to worry).
Texas requires landlords to make a 'reasonable effort' to re-rent in the apartment if you have to break your lease for a reason that is not allowed. You would be responsible for whatever they lose in rent in the time in between.
You can break the lease for a fee. It’s better to break the lease and have a negative item in your credit report (if you can’t pay ) than having an eviction.
But it's better to have a hit on your credit report and move to an appropriately-priced apartment, than try to keep paying for a place you can't afford and fall behind on other debts.
