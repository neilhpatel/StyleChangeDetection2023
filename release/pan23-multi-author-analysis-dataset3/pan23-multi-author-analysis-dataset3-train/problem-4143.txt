It also works if he is willing to send millions of poorly equipped men to die which is kind of a Russian tradition. Hopefully the world ramps up ammunition production to meet Ukraine's usage but in the short term that is not looking great.
I'm sure that if we said last March to build/reconfigure tanks for Ukraine, the MIC would be happy to deliver thousands by now:
Yeah we're patting ourselves on the back but it took a year just to agree to finally send some modern-ish tanks, and only single digits made it into the country. Still no ATACMS, the offered MiGs are somewhere in limbo for a year too, and Biden just rejected F-16s.
So I really don't get it. On one had everyone in NATO/EU is saying how they're committed to helping Ukraine restore its recognized borders, but on the other hand not actually doing what would be necessary to actually achieve that.
I reality I think even a lot of support fell off Poland all by itself would ensure Ukraine got what it needed to hold on - but Putin probably wouldn't realize that until it happened.
It kinda “works” because exchange rates between Ukraine and Russia isn’t way too low, like I don’t know actual numbers but say Ukraine loses 1 soldier per dozen or so defending against bare handed Russian conscripts.
This usually don’t happen with US and other first world nations because the ratio will be like 1 loss of American citizen per deaths of million local insurgents, but Ukraine isn’t at that kind of rate just yet, so the risk remains.
