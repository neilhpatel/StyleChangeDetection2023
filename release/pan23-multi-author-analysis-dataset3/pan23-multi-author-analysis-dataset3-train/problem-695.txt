You have two options. The easiest one is to contact your own insurance and have them cover repairs and medical expenses, and they will subrogate by pursuing the at fault driver or their insurance for repayment. You will have to pay your deductible upfront but the at fault driver is liable to reimburse this amount to you as well.
You are not owed extra for having a new windshield, since cars are supposed to have fully intact windshields, but the overall condition of the vehicle pre-loss can vary the total loss payout up or down from KBB or similar comps, depending.
The slightly more tedious route is to have the at fault driver file a claim and have their insurer cover your costs directly.
Can I file with my insurance even after his came and took my car to the assessor? Basically, can I have two claims going at once? If his pays me KBB value but I have car replacement on my policy, do I get both of these in the end?
I’m in Oklahoma. I agree that I should get follow up care, but without a car now, I don’t know how to get there. I tried calling the at-fault drivers insurance (Geico) but since it is late, I waited on hold for half an hour then decided to try again tomorrow.
It’s hard to swallow the idea that this guy’s total carelessness is going to derail us financially. My lack of car payment after careful budgeting was allowing me to save for my daughter’s college in the fall. Do I have any recourse to get him to pay for a replacement car? This truly sucks.
