Right now churches in America represent pools of unaccounted for money. The more it has to be accounted for, the less free and easy it is for grifters to use.
And this stems precisely from what has become the attitude of evangelicals and fundamentalist churches. If you have to start from the position that evolution isn’t real, the earth is only 6,000 years old and all of science is a pernicious lie - if, in other words, your foundation requires the construction of an “alternate reality” - you can’t effectively turn around and pretend to have answers for problems faced in this reality (one that is rejected in no uncertain terms by the church).
Then there are the tiniest fraction of churches that actually care about what Jesus says rather than enforcing their ideology on you.
Try putting the Christ back in your Christianity, we're tired of selfish greedy bigoted mofos hiding behind a cross while waving a flag and espousing hate.
Good Christians standing up to the fascists who pretend to be Christians would be a much better rally if they want some new converts. The first ad I saw from this campaign was about Jesus being an immigrant. The Christians I know hate immigrants.
