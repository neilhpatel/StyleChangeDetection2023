I understand that they can refuse to accept packages. The memos is saying packages that have been left for 24hrs, there’s no one tracking this 24 hrs and there are multiple carrier deliveries a day. These are not packages that are being refused upon delivery.
I am in Brooklyn New York. I’ve never seen an apartment building here that didn’t accept packages. They have a whole mail room dedicated to mail boxes and packages.
So it doesn’t matter that they built a mail room and have been accepting packages for the past 10 years? I don’t understand how a person who the package is not intended for can send it back 24 hrs after it’s already been delivered.
The issue here is not acceptance. The packages are already accept once theyre left in the mail room and marked delivered from the carrier. so how after 24hrs (that no one is tracking) can it then be sent back to the vendor ?
Because no law forbids them from sending it back to the vendor after an estimated 24 hours. They might even be able to throw away the boxes, especially if there were so many that it caused a fire hazard or other issue, as with tripping.
