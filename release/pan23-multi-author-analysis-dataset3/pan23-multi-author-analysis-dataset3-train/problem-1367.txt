Obviously that's simplistic, but it's still reasonable to ask where things might stand right now if the US had started training Ukrainians on the F16 and Bradley at the start of the war, or given them 100 HIMARS instead of 20, or ATACMS instead of just the shorter range GMLRS.
Ukraine is obviously motivated, and their forces have demonstrated that they have been able to adapt to Western tactics and weapons quickly, so what's holding back support?
This assumes the Russians know where the Ukrainian armed forces are concentrated enough to justify a missile.
That the war would be over if Ukraine got all the weapons they wanted? That the war wouldn't be over if they got all the weapons they wanted? That we should give Ukraine more weapons? That we shouldn't give Ukraine more weapons? That sending weapons to Ukraine is a good investment? That sending weapons doesn't significantly impact our force readiness? Or something else entirely?
I think people feel that if the US and allies just gave Ukraine what they were asking for, the war would be over by now.
I think NATO has held off on shipments of thinks like tanks, in the hope that Russia would look at the ground they have already lost, and negotiate a swift end to this conflict. Shipments of offensive weapons would likely have inflamed the Russians further, and made a peaceful settlement less likely.
Might end faster if we gave them longer range missiles and permission to use them on every military target in Russia - and tanks. Definitely need to give them tanks.
