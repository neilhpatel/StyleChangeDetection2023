If your lease allows it, you can consider subleasing. Often you'll need to get the landlord's approval of the new tenant, but it's an option.
Keep in mind that if you take this path, you will still be responsible to your landlord for the full rent, but the new tenant will be responsible to you for rent as well. It's a risk in that sense, but could get you out of the apartment for essentially "zero" cost to you beyond the hassle of finding a new tenant.
I'm sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, there's no way to just invalidate the lease short of buying the landlord out.
If you haven't already, double-check that your lease doesn't include any stipulations about what happens if one of the parties dies. Some leases do. I'm sorry about your father.
I'm sorry you lost your father. Generally speaking, death does not invalidate the lease contract. Any financial obligations he had would have to be covered by his estate. Since you and your dad were on the same lease, the landlord wouldn't care how the rent was split so long as the full amount got paid in full each month. Your options are to pay the two months' rent to make an early break or ride out the lease like normal.
