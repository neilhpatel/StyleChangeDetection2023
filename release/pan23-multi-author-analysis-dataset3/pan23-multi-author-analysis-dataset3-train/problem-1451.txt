Former Police Officer- I agree with your question. No one is going to get in trouble because of the incorrect description of the vehicle. It will not hit another driver unless the plate is somehow duplicated in the system and shows as belonging to the VM listed.as someone mentioned, call DMV and verify that the plate and registration are correct for your vehicle.
It's also possible that he wrote the plate down correctly, but requested the wrong plate (off by a letter or number) from the patrol car computer.
I would pay the ticket since as you admit it is a valid violation, but I wouldn't leave it there. You should be concerned that your plate may be associated with a different vehicle either due to error or fraud. It seems odd that so many of the details are completely wrong until you consider that the officer most likely wrote them down from the info that came back on your vehicle. So I would immediately check with your state's DMV to confirm that they have that plate associated with your vehicle.
