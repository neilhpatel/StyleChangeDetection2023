We thought troy never existed until we found it. Many non-christisns thought Jesus made up until historical scholars verified he did actually exist. Whose to say Hercules didn't exist and get mythologized after death like Jesus? Id bet money Archilles was a real Greek soildiers who died at troy so the chance of Hercules existing seems fair.
Hercules the man never lived long enough to be that old. Surely he is not the only man to ever wear lion fur. Would others not want to emulate the heros look? Especially in a statue?
Well, one big find of statues was from a cave under the parthenon. When the Persians took Athens they destroyed the statues on the acropolis. When the Greeks returned they took the pieces and put them in that cave and made new ones. So, kind of, sometimes.
Kind of, yes. I learned when I went to Rome that after the fall of the Roman Empire that the cities population declined drastically. Large portions of the city were then left uninhabited and over hundreds of years floods and the like covered over the ruins.
