Jews never went, so it wasnt a big deal. Only in the 2000s did it become a hot button issue. Jews rarely went, and were allowed inside the mosque. That changed after with the 2nd intifada.
the place is like central park new york, its huge, not a lot of people except ramadan, and most people use it to get from one side of the city to the other. the mosque itself is just one part of it.
Because we're not Christian or Muslim. We don't believe either Muhammed or Jesus was special. Why should we change? There is a lot more to being Jewish then a religion, it is an old culture with our own languages goods and traditions that have been passed down in our families for thousands of years. Many Jewish people can at least trace their families back hundreds of years. Unlike other religious not only do we not proselytize, but we actively encourage people not to join. Even the Quran recognizes us, it recognizes as Dhimmis meaning that we are still of Abraham and have protections under the Quran, just not as much as Muslims.
Yeah nothing as terrible as one wanting to pray in our holiest place for thousands of years, predating Islam by about 2000 years. Ben Gvir is terrible, but honestly he is only highlighting an area where Jews are subjected to blatant discrimination of the worst degree. This ridiculous arrangement is in place so that the Palestinians don't get angry, all people want to do is pray and have equal access to the site.
As much as i hate ben gvir he had shown a big issue for jews when it comes to the peace process "how and why is it fair that jews cant pray at their holy site while muslims can?".
Okay. You've convinced me. You're right about everything. Walking near a mosque was hideous, outrageous provocation. Arafat wasn't a bad guy. Thanks and enjoy your day.
