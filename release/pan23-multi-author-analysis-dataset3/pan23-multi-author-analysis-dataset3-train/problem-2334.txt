1: You need to deal with this in the state you live in now, and you need to deal with it before you leave.
2: If he's abusive towards you, you should be able to get a protection order against him. Then if he comes near you or contacts you, he can be arrested. It may or may not be possible for you to avoid disclosing your out of state address in court, that's a question for your lawyer.
You should start by contacting an attorney who's barred in NC, the state that has jurisdiction. Your county's may offer legal services, safety planning and other resources. They may also recommend that you petition for a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO). If the attorney that you choose to represent you doesn't handle trusts, they should be able to refer you to someone who can.
You should also begin to temper your expectations. I know you said that you don't want a legal battle but most abusers won't let go of those within their control without a fight. Unless your child's father's emotional abuse towards your son is so severe as to make him unfit, he'll be awarded some sort of custody or visitation which may include trips to the home state and overnights.
