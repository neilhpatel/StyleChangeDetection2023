This is the right idea, but technically you don't need to "prove" your entitlement to the land at first instance.
The way it works is that the side challenging the will must produce evidence to demonstrate the coercion. IF they are able to prove that, then this becomes a rebuttable presumption that you can then refute with your evidence.
The other side does need to prove their case or the status quo stands but itâ€™s still a good idea to have evidence to refute their claims no matter how unlikely they seem to be to succeed. Her lawyer will be able to help with/guide that process.
Almost definitely not. In the American legal system each side bears the cost of litigation in most situations. As another poster said they have the right to contest the will and (almost definitely) the right to do so in front of a jury.
They have a right to contest the will and the right to demand a jury trial. You have the right to defend. Whether they have a case is up to the jury to decide. Legal bullying is well, legal and you can't do much about it unless the judge finds the case to be frivolous. Which you and your lawyer should research and make a motion for.
The claims of mental capacity due to sickness or coercion are common place and they will need to have evidence of it. You should also seek evidence that this was not the case.
Issues revolving will mistakes revolve around forgotten children and coercion where the full estate is stolen or positions of caretakers.
