It did get me thinking: what made Ibn Taymiyyah focus on the Shi'ites so much? He reserved the sharpest jabs at them, and, short of considering the Twelvers disbelievers, he went as far as issuing fatwas against and facilitating raids on the Alawites in Syria (), prioritizing the fight against them ahead of the Mongols (), as well as excommunicating them (). This is in spite of potential confusion and lack of knowledge Ibn Taymiyyah might have demonstrated about the Alawites ().
Hello My god, thank you so much for this detailed answer Things are finally clicking for me as to why Salafism has only picked up pace in the last couple centuries. It's so interesting to see this trauma inflicted upon the Islamic world by the Mongols giving birth to this movement. To any outsider, this seemed like a conquest not unlike others. Yet for some member of this newfound religion, the blame was placed on the Muslims themselves.
In his mind they were practicing Islam wrong, this wrongness had caused the Mongols and the only way to save Islam was to purge them.
The idea that Allah did indeed bless the umma was as self-evident to contemporaries as the reality of the size, scale and might of the nations of Islam. While division, civil strife and bloodshed did exist previous to the Mongol’s, one can see that from a contemporary perspective it was still always Muslim’s impacting upon Muslim’s.
They converted the Mongols in large numbers; and Salafists could not compete with the gentler, more spiritual reaction to the Mongol conquests, Sufism. As time passed the sense of crisis and trauma receded and with it the sense of hopelessness and despondency.
