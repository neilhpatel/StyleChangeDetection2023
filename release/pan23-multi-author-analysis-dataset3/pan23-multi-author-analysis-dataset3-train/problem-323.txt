To anyone confused: type 1 diabetes is generally diagnosed in youth (of course there are exceptions), and ALL type 1s need insulin to live. Pretty much everyone who’s a type 1 diabetic is still screwed, aside from the lucky ones who’ve made it to 65. But that’s a VERY tiny percentage of us.
But the general public has zero knowledge of the differences between type 1 and 2, and really overestimate the percentage of insulin dependent diabetics that qualify for this .
I don’t know any type 1 diabetics over 65, personally. The vast VAST majority of diabetics over that age are type 2. If they need insulin, I’m glad they’re able to get it now, but this isn’t even close to helping solve the insulin situation for the people that need it most.
Does this let you get the "good stuff" that's come out in the last 5-15 years or is this cap only if you get the crappy insulin that was available up until the recent advances? My Mom was a type 1 for just over 50 years until she passed two years ago. Fortunately she always had good insurance but insulin is not all the same and the stuff she got to use in the last decade was vastly better than the stuff she was taking in the 1970-2005ish period.
