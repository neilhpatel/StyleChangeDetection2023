But what if the war is actually stalemate with Russia in the upper hand? That would explain why Russia thinks they have any sort of leverage in the negotiation table, and why even Western diplomats are catering to Russia's request to negotiate. If Russia's army is really that deadbeat, then why are we still so scared about them having any direct confrontation with NATO? Even if their nuclear stockpile is using old and outdated equipment due to "corruption?".
Sure. That does not cancel the fact that they completely failed to properly respond. If those drones were armed, NK could literally kill targets in SK capital, in the middle of the day, for several hours straight.
So not only SK military failed to shut them down, they also lost jet plane during scrambling to respond.
Depending on what happened to the SK aircraft it could just be bad luck. Hell a few years ago in Belgium a mechanic accidentally trigged the gun on one f16 and destroyed one parked nearby. And if you're in aviation circles which I am to an extremely small degree you will hear with some frequency of military aircraft haveing issues.
I guess youâ€™ve missed the news over the years of drones flying over sensitive us installations without knowing who was flying them. Just because we are starting to take them seriously does not mean we have a lot of anti drone infrastructure and procedures in place.
