This is an important point I completely overlooked. Alfonso VII grew up in Galicia, and was crowned King of Galicia at 7 years-old, so he probably spoke a dialect very similar to that of Alfonso I of Portugal.
To answer your question, Alfonso VII of Castille and Alfonso I of Portugal both probably spoke Galician-Portuguese, but likely understood and could communicate with Castillian speakers, perhaps speaking slowly as I do with Brazilians haha. They likely would have thought of both varieties as dialects of Latin. Imagine if the Queen of England sat down to chat with Kanye West, both would likely adjust their speech a bit, but they wouldn't consider the other to be speaking a different language.
Disclaimer that I'm much more well-versed in Spanish than Portuguese, the former's my first language and I don't speak the latter with any sort of fluency, they're close enough that when I have to communicate in "Portuguese", I just speak slow Spanish haha. So I might lean a bit more towards examples of Spanish than Portuguese.
The origin of the name español, by the way, is a bit controversial. The Real Academia Española says it comes from an Occitan term referring to the region of Spain. This makes sense because if it were a native Spanish word, it would be españuelo.
