He had deposited his work checks, they had bounced, and then he did not check his account balances for about 2 weeks because he assumed he had the funds. He ended up at about -$2900 or so, because he only used his debit card and swiped it daily.
I would: Get a detailed balance history, have the teller stamp and sign it with the date, and get a copy of the bounced check. Present it to your employer and explain that their check bounced and that you would like them to make you whole considering this was their fault. (Our member did this and his employer did pay the rest of the overdraft).
I would advise you to go in and politely request to talk to someone who could assist you in dealing with a bounced check/the fees that followed. Explain the situation, and see if they will reverse some or all of the Overdraft fees. They may agree or decline- some institutions don't reverse ANY fees unless it is THEIR error.
In that case, we advised him to go after his employer, whose check bounced- however, there was a situation where we could only reverse X many fees.
Was she referring to the check bounce fees only, or did you specify you wanted the daily overdraft fees taken off as well? They may not be able to refund the check bounce fee, but they should be able to refund the overdraft fees.
