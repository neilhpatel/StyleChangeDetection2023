They need an estate attorney asap. Aunt is being very suspicious here to me, if they didn't own or have an interest in said property they could get some money from then the aunt wouldn't need them to necessarily sign something. It's not adding up here.
Here's the thing. Just because the house is potentially worth that about, it doesn't mean they'll get that much out of it. Houses aren't like a gold ring and the value will be the market value. Houses cost money. They cost in upkeep. They cost taxes. You have potential to be fined for not doing things like mow the grass around it. Keeping utilities connected to it and having them run so that the house doesn't further dilapidate costs money.
If grandfather's estate has been exhausted paying for all this stuff, then you three have to figure out a viable option of what to do with the house. Has it even been deeded to the three? Have they gone through the probate process?
If it hasn't been probated that's where they need to start. If they truly own a portion of that property, the aunt can't exclude them from the property. Now if she's the personal representative of the estate and it hasn't been fully probated, she can in that regard. But the property needs to be probated and a deed executed giving it from the estate to aunt, friend, and her sibling.
