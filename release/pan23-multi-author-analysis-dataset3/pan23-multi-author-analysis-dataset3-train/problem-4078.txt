They get all kinds of shots, and no one complains. This is just political bullshit because there are so many idiots that think masks and vaccines are against their “freedoms.”.
This is what happens when you have scientifically illiterate morons in leadership positions (republicans) that had the bright idea of making the vaccine political. These morons do not care if they weaken the military and its readiness so long as they get political points.
There are plenty of senior officers in the military who argue that covid mandates are decreasing readiness.
I would agree that not all soldiers are conservative and not all conservatives are anti-vax but a large portion of the pool of recruits (lets say 20-40% as a complete guess) are conservative and anti-vax and thats sufficient to affect recruiting in a major way.
Active duty personnel were required to get vaccinated those who refused were discharged unless they have a valid religious exception that was difficult to get so thats a meaningless stat. It's like 97% of CIA agents passed a security clearance: well yeah they had to. (I've gotten 4 vaccines I'm hardly a covid-denier).
As someone who has had 4 vaccines I got covid both after my 2nd and 3rd dose. I think anyone who thinks the vaccine are great protection from infection are fooling themselves. The official data right now is that vaccines decrease spread by 7 to 23% with the effect being essentially 0 after 12 weeks. It's someones personal decision if they want to contract serious illness and die. I have chosen to protect myself. The balance of evidence suggest vaccines don't protect you from getting covid so its not really my fight to force others to do so.
The point is to boost military recruitment numbers which are very bad right now partially due to vaccine requirements. Should have been paired with getting rid of marijuana disqualifications.
