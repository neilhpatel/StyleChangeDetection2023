It's a general tendency of democracies to avoid doing the right thing until they have tried everything else, to paraphrase Churchill. It's not just climate.
Which is wrong if you hear "climate change was unpredictable". Climate change has clearly been a thing and identified since many years.
But it's right if you hear "the severity and lenh of the droughts we had last summer were unpredictable". Because we expected a shitshow with the heat, but not as bad as what we got. Who predicted that we would have 3/4 months without a single drop of rain in 2022?
Of course all the people against Macron are using one version. But the other version makes perfect sense in french too. People jump to conclusions because it's fun and easy, but language and especially french is more complicated than that.
The main issue is on how you can interpret his words. He said that the climate changes we suffered from last summer were unpredictable.
But he didn't say "who could have predicted the effect of the climate crisis on our country this summer". He said "who could have predicted the climate crisis and its effects". The climate crisis is included in the "unpredictable". And Macron speaks his mother tongue well enough to say what he means. This is not a mistake or the rambled garbage that could mean anything and nothing some recent American presidents have us used to.
