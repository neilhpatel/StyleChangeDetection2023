Welp, we can't have national medical coverage because it would cost too much and fuck those sick people.
Dude. they vote against jesusy shit all the time. They cry about making this a christian nation but don't want to do the things that christ would actually call "good things".
If you're a principled Christian the actions of Nationalist Christians should bother you more than anyone else. They're using the name of your religion to justify their authoritarian bigotry.
Does that mean right-wing Christians have to swallow voting for a party which they have issues with? Yes, but that's the choice they have to make. Nationalist Christianity is now a player in USA politics, and how you react to its existence, including pretending it doesn't exist, affects how people perceive you.
If a Christian wants their religion to be respected they should make expelling these extremists their foremost priority, rather than doing nothing while expecting other people to differentiatie between good Christians and bad Christians.
Every Christian who votes against the Nat-Cs is a Christian saying "Your butchering of my religion is the greatest offence, and I will actively prevent your attempts at seizing power until you either become irrelevant or change your ways.".
So, this is where we are at. We are going to bankrupt all the teachers and jail the librarians. This reads like what happened to Magnus Hirschfeld in Germany.
