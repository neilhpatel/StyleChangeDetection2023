Personally, I would report this driver and his GF to the local DA since this person reported a fake “accident” and filed a false insurance claim.
Im really wondering how this driver and his GF found a lawyer to take the case, if you have video evidence there was no accident. Seems like once the video was sent to the lawyer, they would drop the case.
What would you counter sue for? Them suing you? The stress caused by their baseless lawsuit? You aren’t out any money, because there was no accident and the insurance company is defending the lawsuit against you.
I would contact your insurance company and see if they will defend you in this case since you were clearly not at fault for a claim being made against you.
But, you have the obligation to tell your insurer that you have been served with a lawsuit ASAP. They need to hire you a lawyer in time to file a timely answer to the lawsuit and keep you from going into default.
If they don't hire you a lawyer, you need to hire one yourself. If you can't, you can generally represent yourself. However, this is usually a bad idea and at the very least you will need to devote significant time to learning how to do that.
