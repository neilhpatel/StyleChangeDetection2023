What blows me away this cycle is how well Democratic policies actually poll unilaterally. Holding the elite accountable, penalizing corruption, ensuring individual liberties, helping the middle class, improving infrastructure... Amazing how the republican party has convinced their voters to vote against these policies, but a potential messaging opportunity to continue to persuade those voters over to sanity.
"If we're so corrupt why don't we remove lobbying money and super pacs from politics? That'll show us. While we're at it let's get corporations out of politics all together. Oh we are catering to much to the ruling elites and billionaires? Let's tax them. Great idea, wish we thought of that!".
I think most Democrats and Republicans agree that stock trading should not be legal for sitting members of congress or any of their family members. As far as Covid mandates, the proof is crystal clear: have been show to be over 75% higher in red states. Democratic Covid mandates may have been unpopular but the truth is they saved lives. That messaging will only age in favor of Democrats.
If Democrats were better at listening, they'd probably do a better job of getting their message across to the other side. And if Republicans were better at listening, they might begin to understand that the other side's progressive ideas would be good for the entire country.
Both sides need to do better if we hope to see progress -- The us vs. them mentality is not working.
We need to stop the divisive rhetoric. We're all one country and we need to start valuing our diversity. We need to start working together. It's hard to get group cooperation when we all feel like no one is listening.
All I said was that both sides need to start listening. People in urban areas need to start listing to people in rural areas, and vice versa. If we all try to understand some of the concerns/reasons of others living in different areas, then we can do a better job of meeting more people's needs.
