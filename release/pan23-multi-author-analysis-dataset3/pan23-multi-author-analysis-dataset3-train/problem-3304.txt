Your behavior here was totally inappropriate, clueless, and borders on stalking. If you truly don't get this, you should contact mental health services on campus and ask to see a therapist you can discuss this with at lenh.

You were wrong. What you are seeing is posts I sent when I removed other posts as a mod of this subreddit.

To go off of what you quoted above.
