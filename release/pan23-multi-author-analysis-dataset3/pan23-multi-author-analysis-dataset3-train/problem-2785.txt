Not only the value of the fish, he can sue for the cost of cleaning up the pond and disposing of the dead fish and the cost of any other damage she caused.
Sue her for the costs to import the fish, maintain them in a habitat, any supplies or transport, duties and taxes to replace etc... Several hundred fish is going to cost a lot.
Make an insurance claim, they will investigate for costs and damages and will take it against her personally for causing the damage. They will pay you out and repair if insured, but will seek to claim that back from her as the offending party.
Security cameras surely caught something before she busted them, but it shows major levels of premeditated criminal intent. File with police for breaking and entering, vandalism, trespass, you can have a restraining order against her (you don't feel safe in your home, this may be a first step in escalating behaviour), threats etc...
Aside from pressing criminal charges for trespassing, destruction of private property/vandalism, cruelty to animals (MGL c.266, ยง 112 malicious killing), etc, and suing for damages, you and others can try to file harassment charges or a restraining order. If you have evidence of the bullying and taunting that would help. As for what she may do in the future unless you have evidence it's hard to get anything done. Other than a restraining order if you truly feel that you are in danger and can convince a judge. Multiple people filing filing a restraining order tends to make a judge pay a bit more attention.
