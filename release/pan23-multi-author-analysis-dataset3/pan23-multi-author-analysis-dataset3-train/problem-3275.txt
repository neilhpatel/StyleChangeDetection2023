If falling precast concrete is a legitimate concern you need to walk offsite because they're doing something wrong. Freak accidents happen, but I'll take my chances with a freak accident over permanent, profound hearing loss.
Unsurprisingly when I met him again last year, after years without seeing him, he was dealing with Long COVID and had been sacked in 2020 for refusing to wear a mask at work.
I heard a really stupid one about ear protection from guys working jobs where they were underground and pre-cast concrete sections were being lifted down to them.
One of them says to me "you might go deaf without them, but if you wear earplugs you might not hear someone shouting for you to move if one of those things falls.".
Yes. This shit has been going on for years now. Anyone who really wanted to leave could have made it happen within the last several years. No one is saying it's easy but it's damn sure not impossible. No amount of poverty would prevent me from getting my kids tf out of Florida.
