Well see that’s precisely my question. Based on that website as well as others, you don’t need to publish/ get a court order when changing your name due to marriage or divorce. My question is does that apply only if you’re changing just your last name. The general consensus here seems to be no although the mods have removed all those answers due to being anecdotal regardless of the fact that they were helpful.
Thank you. So under option 1B, I effectively “keep my maiden name” so to speak, and petition the court sometime shortly thereafter to change it entirely, if I’m understanding that correctly?
Option 1B would be "First-First Middle Maiden", which means no change at all, and then you petition the court to change your entire name.
Option 1A would be "First-First Middle NewLast", then petition the court to change your First and Middle names.
The only option (2A) you have is to enter "NewFirst NewMiddle NewLast" on the marriage license when you go file.
If you petition the court and are granted a name change first, then go to file a marriage license later:
