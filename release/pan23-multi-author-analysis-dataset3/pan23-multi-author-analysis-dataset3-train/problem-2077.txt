There are so many red flags in this paragraph. He's already abusing her here. If this guy really exists in the way she's described him, the idea of her going to another city or state sounds like a trafficking setup as much as anything else. If he's so enamored of her, why isn't he traveling to see her (that's mostly rhetorical).
There's not much that you can do from a legal aspect. I'd guess that the guy is smart enough that he hasn't crossed any legal lines yet in their chats (like sending/receiving nudes), so the cops aren't going to be able to do much. Her parents have much more control over her than anything you could do. Maybe you sit down with the parents and talk first about your experience last year (glad you're healing from it!) and use that to lead into a talk about what your friend is dealing with. But I absolutely encourage you to talk to her parents (and maybe yours, too) about this.
Tell her parents, tell them everything you know. If you don't think you can trust her parents (I don't want to presume she has a good relationship with them, if you suspect they might hurt her) then go to a teacher you trust, ideally one who knows you both. Teachers will have to, by law, report this.
I'm aware of that, but we're talking about 15 and 16 year olds calling a stranger to report something really scary and difficult and uncomfortable.
This is it. Tell her parents, be prepared to potentially lose her as a friend, but you'll have saved her from a legit predator. That's what he's doing. No doubt about it.
But it's not the only option. They can go talk to a teacher tomorrow and have the school, the parents, and CPS take it from there.
