I think you are being scammed. Are you sure you are dealing with a real company and not someone pretending to be with a company? Did you meet anyone in person? Talk over the phone? The Zelle transfer is likely fraudulent and will be reversed.
Unfortunately, what's likely is that the money you received via Zelle will be sent back. You generally aren't allowed to keep fraudulent receipts, and I would bet that those transfers were from hacked or stolen accounts. That includes the money you've already spent, and you and your parents will be liable (via Zelle's terms) for reimbursing Zelle for the missing money.
Your parents are not going to kill you, especially while you're involved in a police investigation. You need to get them involved, and then you need to go to the police and lay out what happened. Your parents need to know what happened, and they need to know that someone is threatening you to try to keep you doing this for them.
In theory, you and your family (and the police) can pursue your "employer" both to charge them for the fraud, and to compel them to return your money, but most of these kinds of scams are done by people who pick victims in other countries, specifically to make it hard to prosecute them.
