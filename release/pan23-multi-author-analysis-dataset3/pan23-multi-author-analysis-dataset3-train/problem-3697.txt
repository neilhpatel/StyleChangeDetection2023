Then un-automate the process. If this requires charging people to upload video then so be it. Youtube isn't the preferred video platform anymore because most people who post videos get hit with DMCA trolling like this.
But I guess "I don't like how Youtube handles targeted campaigns" doesn't quite rally the troops like "Youtube censors voices against China".
But no matter how many times this exact same thing happens, people continue to be absolute dummies and pretend it's because X website is censoring the topic.
I don't. Its just the absurdly more likely answer than "Youtube leaves up every other video critical of China to target an 80k sub channel". I mean hell, the article itself doesn't even try to claim that Youtube is doing it because of its China stance; just that copyright law is being abused.
So it's China abusing youtubes system and not the company itself, nothing really to see here other then China trying to censor shit. What can youtube really do?
"Chinese censors are using YouTube's copyright infringement reporting system to shut down content they find politically unacceptable, according to a fellow satirist.".
