He looks weak letting Trump shit on him without responding, but if he responds with the same rhetoric then he isn't different or better than Trump.
I don’t think he’d legitimately win either based on the “somewhat” calm the US has been in lately. But consider he doesn’t need to win legitimately and his running holds more weight. It’ll be wild. DeSatan has a good chance of winning legitimately, Trump has a chance of winning regardless.
I hope Trump wins the primary, so that he will be the first president in American history to lose the popular vote in three consecutive elections.
Meanwhile, DeSantis still clings to his euphemisms like "wokeism" and "CRT." Even his own fan base has no idea what DeSantis is talking about.
Trump proved that Republicans don't need to speak in plausibly deniable euphemisms like "states rights," "national security," and "family values". Trump won his first primary by doing the euphemisms and going straight for the throat with "Mexican rapists," "Muslim registries," and "liberal media is the enemy of the people.".
This. If they don't run Biden, they better run a good looking white Christian man in a hard hat, who served in Gulf War One, and likes to hunt..
