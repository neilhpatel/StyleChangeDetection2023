In California, you can be let go for any reason other than protected classes. But you can collect unemployment If the violared rule is not reasonable. I'd be hard pressed to explain how tattoo removal of preexisting tattoos was anything other than unreasonable.
Do you have any reason to believe there is discrimination involved other than against people with tattoos (which is not a protected group legally)?
If your tattoos are part of your sincere religious beliefs, you were part of a protected class and can claim religious discrimination. Only if you sincerely believe though, if you can’t swear that you do this doesn’t apply. There are Christian denominations that hold this belief.
I do think “changed the policy to fire people who couldn’t comply” is a fair unemployment claim at least, you should be able to get that.
It sounds like he is looking to challenge the unemployment benefits denial--not the the firing itself. You don't have to be part of a protected group to receive unemployment benefits.
