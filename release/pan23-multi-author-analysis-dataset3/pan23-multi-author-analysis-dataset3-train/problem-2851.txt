It's not about whether it's worth it, it's that you're required to. For the prenup to hold water, each party needs their own independent attorney, and her attorney will make you get one as soon as they find out you don't have one.
Yes, you will need your own lawyer to protect your interests; otherwise, it's very likely that the prenup would not be considered valid and would be thrown out if you two ever get divorced.
There’s nothing wrong with getting your own lawyer and your father-in-law should really be encouraging you to have your own lawyer if he wants a valid prenup. If he wants to give his daughter ongoing stake in the business he’s worked to build (and if he went through his own expensive divorce) it’s no surprise he wants some protection in place. That sounds like a very fair rate too, so I wouldn’t be worried he’s hired her a shark who is attempting to screw you or something. Find someone, talk through potential scenarios (you leave your job to take care of the kids, she leaves hers and has no ‘income’ but is continuing to build wealth, you divorce after 1 year versus 30+ years) and how you can reach an income that feels fair and secure.
