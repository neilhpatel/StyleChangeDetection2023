I won't settle for a red ripple. We need a pollster-humiliating, pro-democracy, BLUE WAVE. I hoping to bloody fucking christ that there are a plethora of unaccounted for voters out there that shatter the fucking egos of the soulless, superficial, "horse race" obsessed, election prognosticator class.
3. Once a false, popular vote-losing Republican president is installed, with false majorities in both houses of Congress, they will re-write laws, declare Trump/DeSantis/Lake "President For Life", change the Constitution, and every nightmare you can conceive of will follow.
2. Even worse, Republican election-deniers win in some of the Secretary of State races in swing states, and refuse to declare rightful Democratic winners in state govt, House, Senate, or Presidential races citing "irregularities" or some other bullshit, and declare the Republican as the victor.
the fear is that if the republicans win, they're going to keep their maga extremism rolling, de-legitimizing the democratic election system, pushing laws through to the SC which has been stacked in their favor, and ultimately using that combination of election-disruption and bypassing congress via the SC to gain authoritarian power, a la ww2 Germany.
If a Republican ripple takes away control in either the House of Senate that is still essentially a wave because absolutely nothing will get done for the next 2 years and then voter apathy will get worse and like every other damn election Democratic voters will get disenfranchised.
Voting out Republicans isn't going to made easier two years from now with more gerrymandering and a non-productive congress. Any investigations into Jan 6/Trump will stop. Any hope of codifying abortion rights will be gone. Any improved budgets for low SES will be nerfed. Nonsensical impeachments will take place just to grandstand. Its' going to be a joke.
