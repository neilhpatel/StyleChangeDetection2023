Not just the railroads. I find it laughably ignorant, naive, and disingenuous that these people pretend that Republicans aren't the party of deregulation. And then when a disaster hits, gonna still vote for the same corporate shills.
"On Thursday, the EPA — which delayed implementation of the Obama rule after Trump took office — announced it would largely unwind the regulation, which was widely unpopular in the chemical industry.".
Yup. It was under-regulated when enacted in 2015, and repealing it didn't help. But no one politician or party is directly responsible for the derailment.
"The ECP braking rule would’ve applied ONLY to HIGH HAZARD FLAMMABLE TRAINS. The train that derailed in East Palestine was a MIXED FREIGHT TRAIN containing only 3 placarded Class 3 flammable liquids cars," she said. "This means even if the rule had gone into effect, this train wouldn't have had ECP brakes.".
Of course. This is the walnut who literally said, "I think if they win, I should get all of the credit, and if they lose, I should not be blamed at all.” He is absolutely that big of a narcissist to try and skirt responsibility for this. Hold his feet to the fire and watch him squirm.
