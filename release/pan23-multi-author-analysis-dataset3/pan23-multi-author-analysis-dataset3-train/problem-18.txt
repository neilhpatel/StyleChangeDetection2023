So would that mean that if Republicans couldn't unanimously agree on a speaker, nobody would be? How does it get decided then if Dems remain steadfastly against any R, and no R's vote for the D candidate?
Honestly, I hope Dem votes come through, HOWEVER... the GOP only having a vote or two majority trying to hold that putrid coalition together would be really fun to watch.
Pelosi can hold together the Democratic coalition, no one on the Right will be able to keep them together....there's too much batshittery on the right.
If the GOP gets the house it's going to be an ugly chaotic majority because their coalition is jam-packed with absolute nutters, and not even nutters that are all nuts in one direction, there's the Boeberts and the MTGs, then there are the super capitalist anti institution Libertarians, a whole mess of super religious zealots and all of them are pulling in a different direction.
I dont think they are going ro get anything done tbh and it's going to be 2 more years of total embarrassment for the GOP because they aren't going to get any popular legislation passed without Democrats- which in itself is going to cause a lot of chaos and dissention in the party.
It’s completely possible if all the Dems vote for one person and 4 Republicans don’t fall in line (lol You know they won’t) we could easily have a Dem Speaker of the House with the margins being this close in the House. It’s a House vote for leadership not a majority side only vote. The majority in the House isn’t like the Senate. There are TONS of crazies in the House ESPECIALLY from the least educated very poor Deep Red states who love to stick it to themselves and the country with their safely elected clowns. The margin in the House might only be like 4-6 votes. So it’s completely possible that the GOP might have a few crazies that don’t understand how any of this works.
