Iran has invested to hide much of their capacity and spread it out- you would need someone on the order of jdams across the country to do so. Israel probably can't do that, and I doubt the USA wants to commit to a major war in the middle east where the outcome is unclear.
It’s not like this wasn’t expected, Israel and the US have made it very clear they will use military means to stop Iran from producing nuclear weapons.
Israel won't attack Iran unless they're confident they can destroy Iran's entire capacity to do this in the first strike. Maybe their first wave isn't 100% effective and Iran manages to hit a few targets in Israel, but the only way Iran would be able to properly strike the Israeli homeland would be if Israel severely miscalculates or screws up the execution of their attack.
You’re vastly overestimating Israeli capabilities to strike that far away on a continuous basis while vastly underestimating just how many relevant targets there are in Iran.
It won’t matter much, because the distance alone with lack of Israeli capabilities makes a strike where Iran’s military capabilities are destroyed simply impossible.
Unless you’re completely leveling many cities in the matter of days, which Israel quite literally doesn’t have the firepower for, you’re not going to destroy their ability to wage war within days.
