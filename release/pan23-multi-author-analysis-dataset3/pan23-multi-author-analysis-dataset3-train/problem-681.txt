Are we sure they will have the votes to do it? Dont they only have a 3 or 4 vote lead in the House? There has to be at least some Republicans in a purple district where voting yes on impeachment would look bad for them...
Sure, MTG will be grandstanding on the House floor making QANON speeches and calling for impeachment, but I don't see impeachment going anywhere.
Then the (R) house would impeach Harris 3 times so that TFG woudn't be the most impeached president.
"Why didn't we pass any meaningful legislation when we impeached Biden and members of his administration a dozen times? It's obviously the Democrats' fault. Vote Republican so we can actually do stuff this time. (Though we won't tell you what stuff we'll do beyond vague 'save America' statements.)".
Right. These people want to get re-elected. Look at Boeberts district. I'm not sure they called that race yet but its deep red and yet its so close. Adam Frisch could still win if its not yet called. The people that want to see congress endlessly impeaching Biden seem to be in a minority.
