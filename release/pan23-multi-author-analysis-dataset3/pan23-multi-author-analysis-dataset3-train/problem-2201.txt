In general, museums and archives have a collecting policy that drives what they accept or deny. Some museums might focus on a topic, while others focus more on geographic area. When museums or archives (or libraries) are deaccessioning materials, they offer materials to institutions who might be interested. So, even though it might be difficult to figure our where an item may have ended up, looking at collection policies will greatly narrow the number of institutions to contact. It’s possible that it’s at an archive instead, so broaden the search to include these institutions. Of course this assumes that the item was not destroyed or lost when the museum was flooded.
Do you know where the collections in that museum that was destroyed ended up? If you don’t have some idea then it would be almost impossible to track it down. There’s no national registry or anything like that, each museum is responsible for its own collection.
If the item was donated or sold to the museum then it’s pretty unlikely the museum will return the item to you. Although they will probably be happy to show it to you and provide photographs if you ask nicely.
