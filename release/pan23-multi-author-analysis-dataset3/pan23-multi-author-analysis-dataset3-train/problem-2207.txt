Ofcourse, how dare you help the country we atacked ! Fun fact, Ukraine got the support after it forced russias unprovoked atack on its territory to a halt, people tend to forget that.
Nazi RuZZia invades Ukraine, but to blame the US and to brainwash idiots complains that there is still a war (that Ukrainians aren't already dead).
There is no doubt, for sure the US is responsible for keeping the Russians from raping and killing even more of the Ukraine's population then they already have..
Even ignoring the fact that they unilaterally invaded Ukraine, the irony of “the US helping isn’t fair” when Russia is actively seeking weapons and soldiers from its few friends is a major eye roll. Between Russian statements and the absolute brain dead Republican what-aboutism/lack of integrity I’m done with the amount of disingenuous bullshit people in power spew because they don’t even care enough to tell a believable lie, because the morons who support them lack or choose to suppress critical thinking.
