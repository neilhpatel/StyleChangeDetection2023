It is not about population...China was also the most populated country in the past but only recently with strong authoritarianism did they become an economic superpower... Throughout most of thir history they were very poor and constantly in starvation conditions.
All what you said is true... But you are only looking at disadvantages... China's authoritarian politics allowed it to slide up from being one of the poorest countries to become the world's second largest economy.
It's the world's second largest economy in spite of its authoritarian politics. With how large a population it has, it would be embarrassing if its economy wasn't doing well.
China is the prime example of why authoritarian regimes don't work. Because they had so much control over their citizens, they were able to recklessly pass laws that had terrible, far reaching consequences.
During the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong launched a campaign to kill all sparrows in China because they were eating the crops. But the sparrows kept the locust population in check and so without them, the locust population exploded and they ate so much of the crops that it resulted in a famine that led to the death of millions of people.
I can see why a country might need to be more authoritative in national emergencies. But that can be accomplished just as well in a democracy. You just need to look at the US in WWII to see the effectiveness of executive action. In my opinion a country would be much more stable in a democracy where checks and balances make it essential for people to negotiate if they want to get parts of their agenda across. If you only have one supreme leader, thatâ€™s just an inherently unstable system. All of your nations policies would be done for the advancement of that one persons interests.
