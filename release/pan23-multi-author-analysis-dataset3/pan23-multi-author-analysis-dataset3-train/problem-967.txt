Interesting concept, but with the court being split 6-3, I would worry it would simply galvanize the conservative side and give them something to use as a rallying cry... while still not having a material impact on the outcomes of SC rulings (would still be decided 5-3).
Are you suggesting that lower court decisions should not be reviewable, or that Congress should be able to switch off due process rights when they feel strongly enough about something?
There is a temptation to think courts should "stay out of" issues we agree with but get in there and reverse issues we don't agree with, but that's not how it works.
I think they are suggesting that SCOTUS, to the extent they have the discretion, should stay out of cases concerning basic settled issues of federal law.
But that's a big difference from saying "federal courts should stay out of issues of settled law." No, they shouldn't. They should respect precedent, but engagement with legal issues in a changing society means they have to revisit things from time to time.
I believe courts should self-correct as precedent falls out of step with societal norms (not political parties’ whims/platforms). There is a little too much nuance in this topic to meaningfully discuss it on Reddit, but that’s my take.
