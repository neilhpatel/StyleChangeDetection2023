Yes they can fire you for it. Itâ€™s part of a federal mandate that says any healthcare provider that accepts Medicare or Medicaid has to have all its employees vaccinated by Jan 4.
Again, there is a reason they are mandating everyone in your workplace get vaccinated. THAT is the accommodation. You are putting patients at higher risk by just working there every day. You are risking the hospital's standing with Medicare and Medicaid, which a lot of people need to get treatment. Don't figure out a loophole and put people in danger. Find another job or get vaccinated.
Yes they can fire you and you can't do anything about it. However, if you work a job where you know you are a larger covid threat (won't get vaccinated) and are routinely in close contact with a group of people likely already ill or immunocompromised, why would you feel okay about having that job? Not making it political, but making it just common decency. Fine, don't get the vaccine. But go get a WFH job or something. You are in a position that would cause the absolute MOST harm if you were to get and pass on COVID. There is a reason why they are mandating it for your workplace.
