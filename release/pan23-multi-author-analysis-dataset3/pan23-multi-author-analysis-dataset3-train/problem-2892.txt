You're not wrong, but not right. Specifically, the big problem is that no one in the West (or heavily Western-influenced places) knows how to protest anymore. There's a reason Western media has promoted "leaderless" protests so heavily, and that's because they simply do not work.
A lot of people on Reddit really don't understand how flexible the CPC can be. So long as any given protest movement doesn't (A) threaten part of China to break off from the rest or (B) advocate for overthrowing the government, they're more than willing to compromise and give in to people's demands.
Also, they're willing to make compromises to keep people happy as long as it doesn't involve their red lines: namely, losing territory or threatening the party's hold on power.
They have to judge wisely. Yes they staked a lot on zero COVID, but they can spin a backdown so it doesn't look like one. Like they guy said, they can just claim they're lifting restrictions a little because the risk is lowered - thanks to zero COVID - and carry on. It's either that or crack down and draw more attention to it.
China does some weird things sometimes. Recently Xi's met with the Australian prime minister and was very conciliatory in his tone and talked about starting trade back up again and the analysis here is that his previous tough talk on Australia was intended to send a message to the Chinese public and members of the party, now that he's secured his third term he's softening his stance.
