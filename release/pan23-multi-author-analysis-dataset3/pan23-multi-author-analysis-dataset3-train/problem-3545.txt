Do not let him start paying you $16/hr until he has given you written notice 24 hrs in advance. If he tries to pay you $16/hr before the written notice, or for the same day that you received the notice, file a wage claim. Otherwise, consider this “constructive dismissal” and file for unemployment. If I were you, I would start looking for a new job immediately.
This is incorrect. They need to give a written warning 24 hours in advance. It sounds like it has only been communicated to OP verbally so far. If they reduce OP’s wages before giving written notice, he should file a wage claim.
If you quit rather than accept the new pay rate you may be ineligible for unemployment. If you can prove that nobody else is having a pay cut and that you now make significantly less then you might be able to argue the cut was discriminatory which would make you eligible, however you would have to file, have them contest it, then plead your case with the unemployment office who may or may not side with you.
So long as he paid you the $25/hr for work already completed, yes it is legal. He has notified you of his intent to cut your pay and so long as it only applies to new work (work after the notice) it is perfectly legal.
As long as he gives you written notice at least 24 hours ahead of time, it is legal for him to unilaterally cut your pay, and your legal recourse is to quit. You likely will not be eligible for unemployment, though there is some wiggle room here.
Even though you quit, you will likely be able to receive unemployment. Cutting your pay by that extent can be classified as constructive dismissal (which is what your suspicion is, anyway).
None. The pay cut has been communicated to you before the hours worked, and is more than minimum wage. You can either agree to the wage (by working) or refuse the wage (by not working).
