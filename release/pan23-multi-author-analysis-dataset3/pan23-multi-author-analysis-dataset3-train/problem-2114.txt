I still remember that MSNBC interview that most people thought, including Abrams, was going to be Biden's announcement on picking her to be his running-mate.
Honestly, if Biden's intention was to pander to the minority voters, Stacy Abrams was a better choice. Biden, Warnock and Ossoff wouldn't have won in Georgia in 2020 if it wasn't for Stacy Abrams' efforts. Abrams deserved that VP spot and more.
Stacy Abrams was a better VP choice if Biden wanted to court the female POC vote. Democrats would have never won the Senate and the White House if it wasn't for Stacy Abrams.
That's an incredible thing to say when someone who hasn't been elected to any office won the presidency in the 2016 election.
I don't think a politician whose highest office held was minority leader of a state house would be a good choice to be the Vice President of the United States.
I don't think she deserves the level of criticism she gets, but I'm also not at all "worried" about her lack of political prospects. It just means that some other Democrats will have to fill that role that she already isn't filling as the next big star. It doesn't matter to me one way or another.
