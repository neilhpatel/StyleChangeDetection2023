He has been gone for too long to be able to just move back into her place. He's not entitled to live there anymore. And if he left of his own free will, which it seems he did regardless of anything he signed, then you don't really have a case for illegal eviction either.
You can't sue her for damages if he paid zero rent, he also left on his own free will, and she let him live there for 20 years rent free, while taking care of him. What is your end game here?
I understand that your upset, but she's 83. Shes not a medical professional and he left on his own free will before he was determined to be incompetent, and they're not married. There's a very low chance anything will come of a criminal case, you're likely wasting your time, unless there's something major you are leaving out. She very likely has dementia herself at that age. It's going to be nearly impossible to criminally charge an 83 year old with dementia for not taking care of your father with dementia.
Focus on your dad and let it go, your making it harder on yourself wanting to get justice. There's no justice to be had here.
I’m sorry, but there is likely no justice to be had here. The gf is elderly herself and is likely that she has dementia too. I know it’s frustrating. Why don’t you try to enjoy the time you have left with your father and let this go.
