I did think about the Marquette law school legal clinic; already filled out their form to get an appointment.
Plan so far: Monday first thing, call the credit union I've been paying for 22 years. If they say it wasn't sold (which I expect they won't have sold it), then get a statement from them & try contacting the clerk of courts. Failing there, try the fake bank, offer the statement from my real bank, and ask them to send their proof of ownership (for lack of a better term). Wait to hear from the legal clinic. See if I can find a real estate attorney.
Reach out to a real estate attorney in your area. The Wisconsin bar association can provide referrals if needed.
You needed to contact your mortgage servicer ASAP. This is most likely different than your mortgage lender. There should be information on your monthly mortgage statements as to who that is.
Are you behind on your mortgage? Itâ€™s not uncommon at all for mortgages to be transferred among financial institutions. It is possible that the bank you took out the mortgage with no longer owns it.
