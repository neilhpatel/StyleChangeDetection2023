You're being downvoted because that attitude is likely the reason she went down there and confessed. She \could\ get 10 years, period. You shouldn't be treating this like it's no big deal.
She could be looking at felony charges/conviction here. We're talking multiple years in jail. You need a very good defense lawyer ASAP to negotiate a plea deal.
OP's girlfriend needs a very good defense lawyer fullstop. The best legal strategy is something only they can advise her on and might not include a plea deal.
Ooof. In the future, if the police ever ask you questions in relation to a crime where you're a suspect, invoke your right to remain silent, don't consent to searches and request an attorney. You're under no obligation to give a statement.
Your county may have a pretrial diversion program that your girlfriend is eligible for. These generally include some combination of services such as substance abuse treatment, community service and monitoring including random drug tests. In exchange for completing the program, your girlfriend could avoid prosecution. She should consult a criminal defense attorney for advice.
