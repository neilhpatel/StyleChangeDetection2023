Call an estate attorney. I believe that what people are saying about them taking the house is wrong because it still in your great-grandfather's name. His children are no longer living so it should not be an issue. But an estate attorney would have more answers for you than anyone on Reddit.
You need to speak to an estate attorney. The bank can take that house and sell it at any time. You’ll have months of warning. And you won’t have insurance for the house if you need to make a claim.
So see an attorney and know that mortgages don’t work the way you think they do. You won’t get to own the house that way.
When grandfather died, his children, aunt and uncle, gained a stake in the home’s equity. When they died, that stake became part of their estate. The creditors can go after the estate. Thus force a sale of the house to collect it.
It is possible that your aunt and uncle inherited a portion of the house before they died and it is now part of their estate. But there are lots of questions to be asked before that.
