According to Grigori F. Krivosheev: "All losses of arms and equipment are counted as irrecoverable losses, i.e. beyond economic repair or no longer serviceable"[16].
- 37,600 Armoured car and half-track (including 5,000 Lend-Lease armoured personnel carriers lost[17])".
- 83,500 tanks lost: 5,200 heavy tanks, 44,900 medium tanks, 33,400 light tanks (including 11,900 Lend-Lease tanks and self-propelled guns lost[17]).
While it is still hard to say how many tanks Russia had pre war, it is certain they have lost a shitload of them.
If we got just by visually confirmed losses as tracked by the , Russia has lost 1733 tanks. 1020 of those being destroyed, 80 damaged, 86 abandoned, and 547 captured.
Now is russia building more of their "modern" systems such as the T-90Ms? Yes, but at a seemingly reduced capability as they have been .
The fact that they've dipped into using T-62's in any capacity says a lot, though. It means most of the T-72's they've got remaining in the legacy fleet either don't actually exist in the fleet anymore (i.e. illicitly sold off and still marked as being there) or are so badly maintained/thoroughly stripped of parts that they would need to be extensively rebuilt to work.
