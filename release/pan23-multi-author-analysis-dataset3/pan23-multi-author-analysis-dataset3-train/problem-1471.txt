Do you have a bill of sale? If you have that you can fight anything that comes down the line. As for the title not being transfered, you need to get in tluch with them and make them go transfer it. Don't ever sell another car without going to the tag place and transfering the title.
The seller must remove their license plates before handing the vehicle over to the buyer. If you do not do so, you may be liable for any violations after the buyer has taken possession of the vehicle. Make sure to cancel your insurance as soon as possible after you’ve removed your plates so you don’t continue paying to insure a car that you no longer own.
If the vehicle’s title has been lost, stolen or badly damaged, you can get a replacement/duplicate Tennessee title by filling out form RV-F1315201. With that form filed at the DMV plus a $11 fee you can get a duplicate title.
For more information, visit the Tennessee DMV website. The Tennessee DMV also provides this helpful list of vehicle forms as well.
Where I am, the DMV only licenses DRIVERS. For titles and registration, you have to go to the title office at the county clerk in the courthouse. OP is probably in a similar area.
