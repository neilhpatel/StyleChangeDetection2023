If the US was actively involved in Ukraine, are you saying we would have soldiers in foxholes and/or CQC galore?
So like, 20 years ago America invaded and you didn't like, so now russia gets to invade? The boys dying weren't alive at that time.
Also you say we all must stop the situation - what do we do to stop it that doesn't allow any nuclear armed nation to invade whenever they want - and in that case, every country will either join a military alliance or get nukes - a much unsafe world due to the actions of one man and his dying alcoholic population.
We justified it - and you call it bs - first Iraq- the un justified and was a huge coalition from Iraq invading a neighbor (just like now, without nukes russia would be gone) Second Iraq, bad, but I was literally 5 so I didn't havr a say in it. Syria, questionable, but dude russia is in Syria too so like it pushes even in terms of interests.
You talk like we never justified invasion of Iraq, Syria as member of UN and NATO. Like what has passed in previous conflicts, historically made up by US and that devastated countries that today are still under those effect.
