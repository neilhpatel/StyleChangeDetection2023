As a student you are required to buy your own access to your school's Outlook and electronic services. You can't share your .edu email with other students, especially if it's used for testing. You can't share your school zoom account with others for the same reasons, cheating. Netflix is not treating students any different than the school does, which requires prompt payment for their services rendered.
Netflix pissing off students means those students are less likely to pay for the service once they have their own careers.
Sounds like you're a Netflix employee to sell their services so hard. You'd know that tons of people are quitting Netflix, if you would have checked reddit forums lately.
2) All those people will quit Netflix rather than pay or switch to ad-supported. Netflix makes the same amount of money as before, but with fewer expenses due to less load on the servers.
1) People who share accounts will now continue using Netflix, but on additional paid or ad-supported accounts. More revenue.
3) People who actually pay will quit. En masse. Unlikely since Netflix just revamped their offerings and remains the best interface with the best responsiveness.
