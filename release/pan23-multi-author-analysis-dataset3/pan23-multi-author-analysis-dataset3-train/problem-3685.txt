The government does not prohibit anyone's ability to worship as they believe with a few notable exceptions. However, it has an absolute interest in protecting the right of a citizens to be able to participate in society equally. If your religion tells you homosexuality is immoral and sinful, you are free to believe that. You should not be able to use that belief to deny others their ability to access government services, get married, and enjoy legal protection against discrimination.
I honestly do not understand how someone denying to provide goods or services to a potential customer due to their orientation is any different from denying it based on race or gender.
But there’s a difference between “not wanting to do business with someone” and illegally discriminating against them because they are a part of a protected class. There’s a vast difference between disagree and discriminate and you’re arguing for the latter. No ones religion should allow them to discriminate against others.
Do I have the right to discriminate against someone based on their religion? Religious people are claiming the right to discriminate based on their religion. If that's true and they have that right, does that give me a right to discriminate against them because of their beliefs? Can't I just say, "My firmly held religious belief is that religious people are nutjobs and I don't want to be around them.".
I am fin with this. As long as they apply it equally (and I don't understand how I haven't seen this argument anywhere). They should not be allowed to handle weddings of previously married couples, non virgins, or other "sins" as outlined in the bible. If they are going to do this based on the bible, they need to follow ALL of the rules, not just the ones they want to.
