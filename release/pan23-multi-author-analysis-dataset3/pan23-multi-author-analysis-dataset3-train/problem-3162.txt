I've also cited a Tennessee government informational pamphlet that says that the TCPA applies to "persons or businesses", a phrase which is repeated by multiple Tennessee private law firms. The law itself says it applies to "any trade or commerce". I can't find any information or precedent to back up your claim that it would not apply to private sale.
As-is sales are not absolute. Unjust enrichment is when a party unfairly profits at another's expense.
This is not unjust enrichment. Consumer protection statutes generally don’t apply to a private sale. Does any statute you cited apply to this seller? I suspect not.
You are misapplying the term “unjust enrichment.” This was a bad deal for the buyer but both parties got a thing for consideration: one got a used car that apparently even runs, the other got a few bucks. Not “unjustment” for your purposes. As for protection under consumer protection statutes, the buyer here took some advertising fluff literally, even inferring a promise that the car would pass emissions when no such promise was made, and paid the price. You’re saying consumer protection statutes will shield him, you make the case. I’m not doing your research for you.
