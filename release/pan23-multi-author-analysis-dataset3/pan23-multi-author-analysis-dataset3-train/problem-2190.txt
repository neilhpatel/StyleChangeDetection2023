this talks about concert permits in some municipalities .. same assholes that didnt give permits for festivals this summer whether its Kurdish or Turkish they don’t care they are equal opportunity cunts.
They're not banning Kurdish performances, they're coming up with any excuse to ban or restrict any festival or concert that might get on social media with talking shit on the ruling party/Erdogan.

It’s misleading because it takes it out of context and implies Turkey banned Kurdish music when in fact, Turkish government banned dozens of festivals where all sorts of performances were going to take place. Kurdish is not specifically targeted. If you read the comments, you’ll see that people have understood it exactly as intended which was Turkey is attacking Kurds again. That’s what makes it misleading.
Misleading post. Over the summer, they’ve cancelled many music festivals all around the country on similar grounds or supposedly because there were complaints. So it’s not only Kurdish musicians.
it's never been about kurds in sweden. swedish government supported PKK, both econpmically and diplomatically. provided asylum for PKK members who fled to europe. imposed an embargo to a NATO member country. so what the fuck did sweden really expect from turkey?
