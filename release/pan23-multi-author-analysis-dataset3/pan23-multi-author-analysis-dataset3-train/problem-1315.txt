They have also practiced slavery much more recently than in the west. Like, people are aghast at the US abolishing slavery in 1865, but large parts of the middle east still had slavery in 1965.
So we should apologize for 3000 years of colonialism even though we have abolished slavery quite a while ago now? Modern slavery is still a thing in middle eastern countries, so why should we not be able to voice criticism for that?
When you look at the criticism the Western slavetrading nations get most their criticism from within. They also have very mixed population and the descendants from formal slaves still live in these societies.
You have to ask where the descendants of the slaves of the Arabs are. When you figure out the answer you'll learn how fucking ludicrous it is to criticise the west on this front.
It is politics basically. FIFA became a complete clown show because of Blatter's reforms that took power away from UEFA and CONMEBOL and handed it out to nations where bribery is normal. Not that FIFA has ever not been corrupt of course.
