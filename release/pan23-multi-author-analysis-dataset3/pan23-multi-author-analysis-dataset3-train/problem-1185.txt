Unfortunately, they don't need a good reason (or even a reason) to legally fire someone. You can be fired for something that is entirely not your fault, and that's not illegal. There are only a handful of illegal types of firings (protected class status, going to jury duty, etc.). She needs to file for unemployment.
If she's been fired, she should file for unemployment and look for a new job. Being let go because your boss doesn't like you is legal, unless it was for a reason based on protected class or she's in Montana/has an employment contract.
There's a ton of laws that protect her in various ways -- how little her employer can pay her, the maximum number of hours she can work before she entitled to be paid time-and-a-half, not being able to be fired for specific reasons (race, age, ethnicity, religion, etc.), her ability to discuss unionizing without negative repercussion from the employer, etc.
What's important is whether or not she was employed in an "at-will" arrangement, which most employees are (barring those under a binding employment contract or in a union).
That's not to say that at-will employment doesn't favor the employer or employee in some situations disproportionately, it's just to say that that's how it is for the most part. Employees aren't tied to any employer any longer than they want to be, and employers aren't stuck with employees they can't fire and have to keep employing for whatever reason.
But the employer can also make changes to their workforce, including hiring and firing people, and so long as them going about making those changes doesn't violate the law, they don't necessarily have to do it in a way that seems "fair" to everyone involved. This can include firing "good" employees for bad, dumb, or silly reasons, or no reason at all.
