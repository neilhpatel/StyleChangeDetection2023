I had an argument with somebody that was vehement that Putin would have gone down as the greatest statesman of our times if he hadn't attack Ukraine because he made Russia a world power again and.... that's absolutely objectively not true.
Still so many people, even those that don't like him, hold on to this fake narrative of Putin pulling Russia out of the mud and bringing him to lead the earth when all those stories about Russia's greatness have been thoroughly been proven lies.
But we should all be wary of any narrative that paints the Russians as so fundamentally corrupt and inept they can't fight their way out of a paper bag, which is a popular sentiment I see on these front page posts.
This war is a test for greater future conflicts. It's giving us a sense of how impactful modern tactics and weapons are. If Ukraine can really keep Russia at bay for years, or hopefully push them out of Ukraine, then I'll eat my words on Russia's threat.
"I really, honestly wouldn't put it past them to start supporting Russia out of spite and blackmail".
I am looking at Ukraines in the senate and the house and I have heard over and over again calls from Kevin McCarthy to cut funding.
Didn't McCarthy threaten Ukraine by saying that he will be withholding funds sent to Ukraine once he takes control of the House in the next couple of weeks? Or has he walked that back?
