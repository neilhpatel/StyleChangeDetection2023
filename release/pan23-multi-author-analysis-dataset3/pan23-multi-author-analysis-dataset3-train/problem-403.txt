Yup. The problem revolves around the question "Everyone needs a place to live, so what are they gonna do if you jack up their rent?".
In theory competition could drive down prices. But given that hedge funds are being used to buy up all the housing, that's not really a factor.
Yes, housing or rent prices are obviously the issue. Problem is the solution is complex, costly, and involves all levels of government, none of which are coordinated on this. Plus the profit seeking from big businesses and their control over housing gets in the way of any effort to help poorer people.
There's also the dilemma of making a place both desirable to live in but also affordable at the same time. Often the more desirable you make it the less affordable it becomes. Either way we'd need some pretty widespread zoning reform, affordable housing investments, and stopping big businesses from owning homes.
Well the places where the prices are outrageous tend to be the places where everyone wants to live. As this article notes, there's no housing crisis in West Virginia since no one's moving there or wants to live there. Instead more housing is needed where people want to live, either because of jobs or weather or other reasons. If there's a lot of competition for housing, inevitably the prices will be high, and likely cities and states will always be behind meeting the demand for cheap housing in their areas as the population grows.
