So if putin fires a handful of missiles at the US there will be hundreds of missiles fired in defense, virtually ensuring the inbound missiles are destroyed.
He means that one missile into Russia will supposedly lead to a response of hundreds of warheads. And yes, one missile can carry several nuclear warheads. It’s unclear whether he means a nuclear missile entering Russia or any missile, but I think it’s all bluffing anyway.
We've updated because we have no intention of firing a nuke or missile into Russia, but Russia has been threatening it.
The update is that in this case the US won't go nuclear, instead we will hit Russia with unrelenting missile barrages to effectively eliminate a portion of the Russian military. That may be their black sea fleet, or maybe some other Russian asset not in Russian soil.
Neither side will lose their mind over a single non nuclear missile hitting their home countries. They will respond in kind, meaning one missile for one missile, whether it's intentional or not.
