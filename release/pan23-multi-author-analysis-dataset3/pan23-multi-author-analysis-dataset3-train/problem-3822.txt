You would also need to check with the insurer or review the plan description to determine if coverage goes until the end of the month of termination or stops on the date of termination.
Well I paid for my insurance out of my check in June and my contract says I am covered with insurance until the end of the month I terminate my contract. But the cobra says I was terminated 5/31.
Yes and at the end of the day I let them know I would not be coming back via a formal letter. I am a teacher and It was a school it was our last day of school.
IANAL but I do work for a school district and have worked for school districts in several states. Education and teaching contracts are different beasts-they're at will/there's no penalty if the employee leaves and the employer can fire them, but typically stipulate payment with benefits until the end of the contract term. Your contact may be different than the ones I've seen though.
Exactly. I've given notice of a desire to non renew for the next school year as early as January of the current school year and my salary and benefits continued until July 31st because that's when my teaching contact stipulated that the current school year ended. I also had my sick/vacation leave paid out too, but I know that happening very much depends on your contract.
EDIT: I know you said charter school, but if you are by chance in an education professional union (I'm not sure vif you're a teacher or what your role is at the school), REACH OUT TO YOUR UNION REP. They will be able to help with this tremendously!
