As usual Israel will respond with a show of force. The coverage and discussion around this conflict are impossible as the cycle of violence goes around and around.
Uncomfortable truth about countries in conflict: often times one has more powerful weaponry than the other.
Yea, I know enough about the geo political nuances in this conflict to know its a complex situation and to not point fingers. It isn't black and white, it's bloody and gray.
Yikes, is this how it's always been here on this sub when Israel is mentioned? I doubt any of these users are Palestinian or Israeli and yet they act like it's happening to them.
More Palestinians die than Israelis, but it sure isn't for lack of trying on the Palestinian's part. If not for the Iron Dome the rocket attacks would have been exponentially more deadly.
No, it's not. This is part of a larger wave of attacks going on for a while now, and none of the attackers or the organizations sending them even mentioned the journalist. Just your usual "defend Al Aqsa from the Jews" and "From the river to the sea" business.
