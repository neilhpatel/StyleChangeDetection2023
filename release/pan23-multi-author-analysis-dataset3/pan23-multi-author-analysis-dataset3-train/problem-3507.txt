So you wouldn't condone the USA of dosing mexico with freedom if they made a military pact with china and china put military bases/missiles on the usas border?
I simply asked you a question in regards to you saying that russias reaction to Ukraine saying they want to join NATO is unjustified.
Serious question because you don't think russias response to Ukraine doing it with USA is justified?
I think there is no fucking world in which Russia is justified invading their neighbor, using total war, and raping/ killing children/ old women because their neighbor wants to move closer to the west. I do love the whataboutism though; I’ve found it’s a helpful tactic to deploy when your argument can’t stand on its own merits.
How am I spazzing? You dragged in whataboutism. It’s a goofy angle to take if you want to argue anything of substance. That sounds like an awful lot of projecting on the mental issues though- seems like a weird thing to bring up, but then again if you are fighting a losing fight (or playing devil’s advocate), you move to the “well what if Mexico became china’s ally?”, then on to accusing someone of being unhappy or mentally ill because they think a nation isn’t justified in invading their peaceful neighbor then raping kids and old women. Which one of us seems like they have mental issues? And I mean honestly, if you took a step back and read this thread between us as a third party, don’t you think you’d look a little silly with all of this?
