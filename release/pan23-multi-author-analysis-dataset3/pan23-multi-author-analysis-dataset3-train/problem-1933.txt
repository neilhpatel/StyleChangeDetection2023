Funny how none of them mention the fact that the Supreme Court wasn't given this much power in the constitution, Is it really that hard for a reporter or politician to read it and tell people the truth? The supreme court was just intended to settle disputes between parts of the government and review treaties per the constitution.
Then you have the extremist conservative Justices on the SCOTUS making rulings that go not only against precedence, but also the Constitution. Alito and the other right wing Justices essentially stated in their decision overturning Roe that any rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution means they basically don't exist. That only rights that are "deeply rooted in American history and tradition" are unenumerated rights, and everything else isn't. Completely ignoring the Ninth Amendment that explicitly states that just because we have certain rights listed in the Constitution cannot be used to deny rights not specifically mentioned in it.
Ignoring the constitutional crisis that the court is already creating by ignoring the fact they are overstepping their boundaries?
On the other hand, to ignore the lawful ruling of the Supreme Court would be to flat-out declare that one of the three branches of government is invalid. Once that happens, there's nothing stopping anyone from ignoring any of the three branches. Sort of like the intent behind January 6th.
this has no correlation to January 6th at all. The Supreme Court isn’t only illegitimate. It’s undemocratic. continuing to provide it legitimacy only upholds the current system of right wing obstruction.
helping immigrants and the homeless isn’t “socialism” and a socialist government isn’t required to help these people. but thanks for making the point that the only moral system of government is socialist. I agree!
