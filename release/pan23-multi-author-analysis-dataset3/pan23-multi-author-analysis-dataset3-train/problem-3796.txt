Reminder that aesthetics is not the most important criteria to judge districts on. I care much more about how well they represent the general population (as measured by median partisan lean and number of wasted votes) than what they look like.
Depending on how turnout goes the actual election could be two liberals, two conservatives, or one of each (the last option is most likely).
But special elections and the lower turnout that comes with them would normally favor Republicans, right? They tend to be more consistent voters as opposed to many Democrats who unfortunately don't vote. So she should have won by a narrower margin than the Democrats did in 2022, not a wider one.
That the party out of power continues to run backwards from their 2020 margins, to say nothing of their 2022 margins, is a big deal. It shows that either the constant drama from House Republicans is already a drag on them less than two months into a new term, or that Republicans have learned nothing from the beating they took in November. Or both.
I, for one, cannot understand how the party that's coming remarkably close to threatening civil war on primetime cable news because it can't get what it wants anymore is having trouble breaking through with the average American voter.
