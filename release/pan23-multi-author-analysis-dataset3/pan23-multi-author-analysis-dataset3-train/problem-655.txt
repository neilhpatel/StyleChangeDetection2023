Sounds like no. DAs can and do charge police officers. If there is a conflict of interest, they are mandated to transfer the investigation to another county agency.
I work as an attorney in law enforcement. And you are wrong that victims are "really screwed" most of the time. We can and do charge cops. Depends on your county. Nothing is gaurenteed, but the advice on this thread is very helpful and you're discounting it all.
Well, we cannot give you specific advice without specifics. Especially when basically every point of advice you respond that people won't do anything because it is law enforcement.
The first step is to report to law enforcement. I am sorry about what you have went through, but everyday cops are not bullet proof and you need to report this, or if you have enough money get your own attorney. A civil suit is a secondary route, but a report is necessary if you want any of these allegations to be taken seriously. Adult protective services is also a great option.
If so, Pennsylvania Adult Protective Services may be able to assist you. You can contact them at 1-800-490-8505 to see if they can do anything.
