At that point your employer could have simply said "okay, then you're fired" because they have no obligation to continue employing you if you don't tell them... but if it is that big of a deal to you, that's an option you had available.
Nothing illegal here. Telling other people you aren't vaccinated and then having social issues because others are upset you have refused the vaccine isn't illegal.
2. That isn't protected info anyway. Your employer is not your medical provider, so they aren't covered by HIPAA. Even if they did leak it, there's no legal issue.
If your employer contacted your doctor or insurance, asked them if you were vaccinated, and your doctor/insurance told them without your permission, then you may have a HIPAA violation against your doctor/insurance... but still not your employer.
An employer has every right to ask for the status of testing or vaccination for a disease that can effect staff or clients, and this is not a new thing in many industries. Pretty much every school system has required regular TB testing for decades now, for example.
