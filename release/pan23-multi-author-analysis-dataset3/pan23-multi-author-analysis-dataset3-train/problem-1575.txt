But that's about it. Any ability to check this will come from the majority, not the minority. All Democrats will be able to do is make things painful for McCarthy and Republicans in the 118th Congress, and/or to retaliate in the 119th Congress, assuming they can flip it back in two years.
>Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.
The 14th Amendment, Section 3, requires a 2/3 majority vote to allow the expelled member to remain, not to remove them.
The 14th Amendment is untested against incumbents (AFAIK), and if you just mean the normal expulsion process, then I'm not confident we'd see at least ⅓ of Republicans vote with Democrats to expel that member, since it takes a ⅔ supermajority.
However, there may be more chance for impeachment if that particular representative has little support to keep them around, but I doubt the republicans will allow themselves to lose a majority.
