Their obsession with bogus election fraud cost them dearly in the midterms. Exhibit A: Kari Lake. Her entire campaign was based on "election fraud" and aggressively false claims. I think you're right that there is a dwindling segment of voters who inexplicably aren't burnt out on this narrative but for the most part voters have moved on and are sick of hearing about it. Lots of folks who post on the Conservative subreddit were even saying things like "Can we finally move on now?" after how poorly leaning on phoney election fraud claims did for them in the midterms. The GOP has adopted Trump's sure fire method for losing voters which is to cry, whine, and play the victim 24/7. It's pathetic yet they still cling to it despite being demonstrably ineffective.
Agreed. They've committed so heavily to the whole election fraud bs that I don't know if they think they have to keep going with it or what but it definitely turned people off and drove voters away from their party last time around.
Actually I'm not so sure it's a losing fight given the only way they have to win elections is by stirring up rhetoric like this, outright voter suppression and gerrymandering. If they can't win in a straight fight IT MUST BE FRAUD.
It’s a losing fight. They’d get more votes talking about eggs and how to get more people under 50 to vote for them by at least acknowledging their plights and struggles with affording anything.
But hey who am I ? Just a traditional center right voter who votes blue more all the time because they are ridiculous.
