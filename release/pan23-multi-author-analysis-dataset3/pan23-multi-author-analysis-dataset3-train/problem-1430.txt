I signed and accepted a loan offer, they let me drive the car home, i then was called by the dealer saying that if i didn’t get a cosigner i had to return the car. I complied and returned the car, then the next day i was told that i no longer needed a cosigner and they demanded i go get the car again under the original terms.
I spoke with the bank earlier today and they told me that, they never required a cosigner like the dealer had told me. It’s getting really sketchy and i am beginning to consider getting an attorney.
I still have all of the paperwork from the deal. Upon returning the vehicle, I was given a refund for the down payment & that was that. They gave me a reciept for the down payment but that was it.
Hold on to the refund of down payment receipt. Get your copies of the agreement, application, and whatever else is in that agreement. It could have a clause in it that you have so many days to return the car and rescind the deal.
The dealership will be banking on the fact that no documentation was signed canceling the deal, but their refunding of the down payment could constitute a cancellation. I am no lawyer, but you may need one.
