How is you apartment management actually filtering that? Do you get your mail delivered to a locking mailbox or is your mail being delivered to a front desk and then you pick it up? Does your property manager have access to your mailbox and are they going through it?
Regardless, you, and your mail carrier, are the ultimate decision-makers on what mail you receive. At a minimum, your apartment manager does not have access or authority to physically open your mailbox and take things out. So it sounds like you already did the best thing by telling your mail carrier and having a little note in your mailbox is the perfect solution.
That's good you got a response from and spoke to your mail carrier. Sometimes apartment managers will provide a list of residents or mail carriers will request a list of residents to help the carrier keep track of who is no longer a resident and what mail should be returned. That list, however is not exhaustive, i.e. the letter carrier can choose to deliver more addressees than is on it and has the discretion to do so.
The management company provides our mail carrier with a list of residents and it is also written inside our mailbox.
