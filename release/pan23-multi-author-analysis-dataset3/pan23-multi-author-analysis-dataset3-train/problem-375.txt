Conservatives will simultaneously blame Biden for the supply chain issues while stating the the government has no business regulating the private sector. They'll also reject facts when you show them that the supply chain back up started under trump.
They lost their jobs on trump's watch and got them back on Biden's. Don't kid yourself, trump would have been taking all the credit so Biden should as well.
Pretty funny how Republicans blame Biden for inflation, Guess he has control of all these other countries as well.
Yes, Joe Biden is not the cause of inflation. But Voters aren’t going to care because he didn’t exactly do a damn thing about it either.
Then in the summer of 2022 they have the opportunity to do something about it legislatively. Instead they spend another half trillion on energy investment and doubling the Size of the IRS. And have the bright idea of titling it the Inflation Reduction Act. An act that has had basically zero effect on top line inflation.
inflation is the fault of years of zero interest rates. Then Trump kept rates low to tank the economy under Biden. If J Pow had his way rates would've been raised under Trump and the economy would've tanked under Trump and gotten better under Biden.
