MTG being speaker depends on members of congress, nothing regular people can do about it either way for another two years.
Besides the same problems McCarthy has to deal with she'd have to as well. That is if even a handful of Republican Congress members don't want her to be speaker, she isn't going to be speaker. And I'd guess there'd be more than a handful that wouldn't want to be associated with her given how poorly the Trump style of politics did in the last election.
As a practical matter, I think they need to let the Republicans nominate McCarthy first, and have him fail to get enough votes.
But McCarthy will probably pull it out by just persuading those who aren't going to vote for him to not vote at all.
Because the only way I see his view point being a thing is if they fear D's would steal enough votes for somebody else other than McCarthy.
So I need help understanding procedure on Speaker vote. Does the entire chamber vote on Speaker? I listened to a talking head on fox news (at the gym that some old person put and then walked away from the tv) and he was talking about how he thinks democrats shouldn't be allowed to vote on Speaker since democrats forced pelosi down their throats.
