"You just take a look. Take a look at what happened in Pensilvania. Look at what happened in Wisconsin. Everybody knows it. The media just doesn't like to report it.".
TY. Makes total sense. And agreed, one cannot use reasonable and rational explanations when dealing with those who are illogical or irrational. And my next question was exactly where you went--could logic be applied as such legally in court toward motive and intent. I understand a little better now. I should know better, too. This is the same fatigue I felt trying to be rational with a narcissist from years ago before the terminology became commonplace. Cheers.
Seeking brighter more logical minds than mine and those who know the correct terminology (inference, deductive reasoning, etc) When the statement "the election was stolen" is uttered isn't the logical sequence something like, it was mine, it was stolen from me, therefore I lost the election and I want it back. His false public statements about being stolen are based on his agreeing that the election was lost. Is that inferred or deducted or whatever the correct words are.
