Even if she gets sued, that has nothing to do with you, your parents, or anyone else in your family. But if she is pretending to be an actual person and confessing to crimes, that could fall into defamation, sure. Canada/US makes it more complicated and not worth suing someone with no money. But why do you think this would have any impact on your family?
Okay, but if your sister is sued, and if the person suing her wins (for whatever it is, defamation, car accident, whatever) that is wholly her judgment. The only way it could impact your family is if she co-owns property with you, something like that, and they could go after the property.
It impacts my family because of personal agreements and decisions we have made in terms of supporting her (and her supporting us). Like I said, it's not tied to the legal aspects of it at all and it's something that all of us need to discuss together depending on our private circumstances if a lawsuit does happen. It's really not something I want to talk about publicly on here, and it's really not relevant to legal advice either.
So theoretically, I could pretend to be anyone I want and say whatever about them, and as long as it was over a PM, there's no legal reprecussion?
Edit: I also should mention that all the details about her previous criminal record was almost entirely made just to one guy over PM. Would that change things at all?
