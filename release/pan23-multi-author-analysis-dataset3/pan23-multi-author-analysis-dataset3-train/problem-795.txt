The British have no right and never had a right to claim Irish territory,the unionists have every right to be British in Ireland and have British passports , maintained cultural links with great Britain etc ,BUT NO RIGHT to claim Irish territory as British and everyone in it as british.the unionists can only really claim 2 of the 6 counties as unionist majority.there are 32 counties in Ireland, unionists are the minority they always have been the minority.if you say unionists / British have a right to claim Irish territory then you should not reject Russia's territorial claim over parts of ukraine. I'm Irish I know what I'm talking about ,the native Gaelic Irish have more claim over the land than people who were planted from Scotland and england during the ethnic cleansing of ulster in the 1600s. I respect unionists British citizenship and they should retain it in a united Ireland,yet you call me small minded?
Someone needs to do some reading up on the Anglo-Irish treaty and the Good Friday Agreement then before you start spouting more small-minded warmongering that both British and Irish people rejected a very long time ago.
