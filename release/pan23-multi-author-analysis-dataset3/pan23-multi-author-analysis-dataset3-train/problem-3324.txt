This seems to be a common AirBnB scam with those who hold multiple places. The "listed" place, that looks nice and convenient, "isn't ready" so they send you to another place instead. The locks likely weren't changed when OP moved in, the coordinator guy still has keys, and the "renter" is unaware that their rental isn't really available.
I think what happened was a airbnb scam, and the your apartment was previously a spot rented, when the previous people moved out the landlord didn't change the locks, so the old keys worked. Put you own lock on save the old to replace when you leave.
I would change the locks (but also keep the old ones and put them back on before moving out, as someone here recommended).
Also, I’m not in the UK, but I don’t know how much leg your landlord would have to stand on. “Yes, [judicial official], I am suing my tenants for changing the locks without my permission after I previously gave out keys and told people they could stay there, and then wouldn’t change the locks for them when asked.”.
