This - itâ€™s a bit unclear from the OP. Is the dog being individually trained to perform work or a specific task related to your disability OP?
Yes, my dog is being trained to help me specifically with managing my disabilities. She's in individual training with people who specialize in service dog training. The accommodation was put in months early to account for time like this where I am waiting or need to fight for her. It was never set to start immediately though, should things get worked out, the time to start bringing her in would have been when her training is complete in the beginning of December. She is not currently qualified, however come the end of this month her training will be complete and she will be considered a service animal under the ADA. Currently she is task trained to help with the weeks she spends at my house and is working on public access.
She's being trained as a service dog. Task trained to help with meltdowns, PTSD, to provide medication reminders, and to keep me from hurting myself (Biting myself, hitting myself, digging my nails into my arms etc...) ((I have no control, it's automatic when I begin to have a meltdown)).
When I asked in the last meeting he said there was something in the Texas HR code or whatever that allowed him to go ahead and deny it. He said that she'd be a tripping hazard or that even if I were working in the stockroom that she could get mushed by a box because she's so small or she could run into something and cause a box to fall and hit someone else. I do not see how this would occur if she's on leash and at my side at all times.
Thank you for the advice, This is very helpful and I'm going to go ahead and see if I can demand that he come visit and we have another meeting on the matter. I genuinely feel that if I qualify and have all the supporting documentation that says I need a service dog, he shouldn't just be able to say it's dangerous and deny it just like that.
