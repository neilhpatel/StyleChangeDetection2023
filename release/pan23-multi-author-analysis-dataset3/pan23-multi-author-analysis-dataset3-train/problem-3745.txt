We also have an aggressive mental health policy, that you can request a single vacation day the morning of, just by talking to your manager and saying you need it.
It varies. In my company, we have 3 sick days which are added to our PTO. If we don't get sick, we have 3 extra days of PTO (that will even roll over). We are changing this on the new year, we are giving everyone an extra week of PTO, and turning those 3 days into legit sick days.
If you are out sick, you can’t retroactively use a PTO day to cover it? I’ve never heard of a company that doesn’t have a mechanism for that.
I think most other industries treat PTO for sick time in the same way as sick time would function if we went that way. Our position as shareholders of our own company are that people would rather have their sick time as PTO in case they don’t get sick. I think it’s come up maybe 3 times to go to actual sick pay and been voted down each time.
I think a lot of developed countries work that way. I don’t even mind the system we use so long as people have adequate PTO that builds up over years. Starting at none like you mention is crazy, but reading in to it, a lot of workers start at 10-15 days, too, but still probably hard to use them as you mention.
