Though, you also have to think about what "covered" means in this instance, it's not like they're violating any international laws by not observing the ceasefire since it's unilateral and not agree-upon. What they're risking is a response from Putin and the Russian military and government. Realistically, Putin could have any Wagner or separatist imprisoned or executed for doing it, but more realistically he wouldn't do shit even if someone in RAF did it.
If this is only Wagner/separatists, and I'm not sure that's known at this point, I suppose Putin can sort of claim that he has no authority over them and that the RAF isn't breaking the ceasefire.
I mean Ukraine didn’t agree to the ceasefire , it only technically happens when both parties say ok so the most logical scenario was for the fighting to continue ….
If Ukraine had said prior to that there wasn't going to be a ceasefire, can the Russians have even violated it?
It's likely Russia would've violated a ceasefire anyways, but in this case it's not fair to say they did.
It's not a ceasefire unless both sides agree to it, which Ukraine didn't, therefore there was no ceasefire.
