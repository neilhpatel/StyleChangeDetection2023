In addition to the small claims court route, don't forget about declaring a loss on both your federal and state income tax returns. You have an actual loss, a police report that should be enough documentation. If you take this to small claims court and are stiffed because there is no money - then this may be at least something to soften the financial blow.
I'd lodge the complaint in small claims court even if she said she has no money. With a judgement you will be able to levy her bank account. Wages can't be directly garnished in Texas except for child support, unpaid taxes, and perhaps a couple of other very narrow situations. As well, you'd not likely be able to put a lien against her real property if it's her primary home.
I take no joy in saying this, but if there is a next time I'd allow your husband to liquidate any animals which are molesting your livestock.
It's reasonable to assume that you don't know where she banks. You can contact banks around your area and ask what their procedures are for levy requests. They'll likely want to see the court order before talking about anything regarding a levy -- to include how much they charge for the service, even, in my experience. If you decide to move forward then they'll search their records and confirm or deny that she banks with them. If she is judgement-proof then you lodging this complaint will at least likely prevent her from opening new lines of credit for a few years due to the judgement being reported to the credit bureaus, so, in that sense, you'd help out others down the road and you'll also help yourself should she get a windfall in the future.
