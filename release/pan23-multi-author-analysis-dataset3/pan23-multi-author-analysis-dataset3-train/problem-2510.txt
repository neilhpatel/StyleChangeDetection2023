The consorts were the higher ranked concubines, and had generally not started their lives in the palace at that rank. They were the Emperor's favourites\. They were also usually the ones that had given birth to the older princes (that weren't the Empress's children). Since their sons had a possibility of acceding the throne, their mothers were treated with great respect. The line of succession in Ancient China was more complicated than simply older boy firstâ€”Emperor Gaozong, for example, was the 9th son of Emperor Taizong. Priority was usually given to the Empress's children, but not all Empresses bore sons. (During the Qing Dynasty, Noble Consort Yi \[later Cixi\] was able to become Empress Dowager after the death of the Xianfeng Emperor because she was the mother of his only son.).
\And the most powerful. While all concubines were women that came from good families, the consorts were also often the ones that came from the most powerful clans of the Empire, and also often had family members working beside the Emperor as ministers or generals.
As for how a concubine could become one without having met the Emperor, I gave an example as to a way that could happen in anther reply.
Just to check, you mentioned many of the lower-ranked concubines might not have even met the Emperor. Do you mean before they became concubines, or as in, they'd been a concubine for a few years but still never met him? If the second, why were they concubines at all? And I guess a related question, how were concubines chosen?
Not all concubines were chosen this way, however. Wu Zetian was the daughter of a man decently liked by Emperor Taizong. Harry N. Rothschild writes in Wu Zhao: China's Only Woman Emperor p. 23:
