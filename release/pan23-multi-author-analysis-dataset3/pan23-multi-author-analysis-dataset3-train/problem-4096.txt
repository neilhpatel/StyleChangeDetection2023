I’m not American, and obviously forced labour is bad and should be banned, but isn’t this technically unconstitutional due to the 13A? Or are the amendments not protected in the same way as the bill or rights? I’m curious to see if this bill gets challenged on those grounds.
And I didn’t realize the first two had special protections! That answers the amendment part of my question. Thanks so much.
I understand that it doesn’t mandate it, but a hypothetical prison owner could make the case that something like this would cause them financial harm, and like you said this Supreme Court is a loose cannon.
The potential financial harm caused to for profit prisons is the angle that came to mind for me. Not a great moral argument, but people engaged in slavery likely aren’t the most moralistic of people lol. But I looked it up and it turns out California banned for profit prisons a couple years back so it’s a non starter anyway.
I’m not a lawyer, but I don’t see how anyone would have the grounds to do so, besides for-profit prisons if they operated in those states. To bring a case like that, you need to demonstrate harm. i.e., you need to show that by the state banning slavery as punishment for a crime, you were harmed in some way.
Nice, an official on-the-books ban on all forms of slavery is probably overdue. Just accept volunteers and pay them themselves when there's a task to be done, ffs. It's far more elegant of a solution to the problem. Bank notes & fractional reserves, banking were literally invented to keep paying your workers even when you run out of gold coins, and most people accept them well enough.
