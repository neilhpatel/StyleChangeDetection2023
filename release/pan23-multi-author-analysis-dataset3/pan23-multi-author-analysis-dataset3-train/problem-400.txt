When I say close my friends saw them across the road from their apartment building and personally I saw one crossing the road, into a backyard about 70-80 meters in front of me. I'm going to presume them getting this far into the town is a big reason anyway.
Idk exactly why but I think it has to do with them overreaching their territory. For example where I live: both me and 2 of my friends saw wolves in 2022 very close to where we live (and we live close to the center of the town).
Got family that live in the most active area and Iâ€™ve gotten so lucky as to see a wolf on one occasion. Was an amazing experience!
Based on a report by Aarhus University thereâ€™s an estimated number of 30, rising by 14 in 2022 through successful breeding. So far more than 5.
Yes. Which seems to be based on ignorance rather than an enlightened approach to wild life. One shot a wolf and got a prison sentence. Other places theyâ€™ve been blamed for attacking livestock, yet it was determined through saliva samples to have been a dog (at least the one I remember). Itâ€™s a shame really ðŸ˜”.
Edit: should mention that wolves only returned to Denmark within the last decade. Hunting them is illegal and has led to prison sentencing.
