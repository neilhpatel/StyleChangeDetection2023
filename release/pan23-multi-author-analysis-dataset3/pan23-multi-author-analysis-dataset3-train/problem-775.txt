It's not a promissory note, but year-long gym contracts are pretty mundane and there's nothing obviously illegal about this one. Remember to give notice 60 days before the contract is due to renew, so that it does not renew.
A promissory note is an instrument with a specific structure, containing a promise to pay. They're important in loans and a few other contexts for documenting that a debt exists and documenting the repayment terms. A service contract, which promises a service in return for periodic payments, generally isn't a promissory note. However, the distinction is pretty meaningless in this context, as the gym's recourse is the same regardless - if you don't pay what you agreed to, for the time period you agreed to, they can sue you.
Without a state, I can't tell you much about that three-day cooling off period. You could be right, or you could be misunderstanding it. Would you be willing to name the state?
Yes but I stated that in my state. With gyms. If it doesn’t state you have 3 days to cancel it automatically voids the contract. It says that on our AG website. His contract doesn’t state that. Though on the top of what I signed. It says promissory note on the top! So is it a promissory note just because it says it is?
