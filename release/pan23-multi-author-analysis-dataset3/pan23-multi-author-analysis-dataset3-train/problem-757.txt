I'm sure there's more to say about it, but u/frogbrooks provided some great comments in a few years ago, discussing Muhammed's pre-Islamic beliefs and how they compared with other local religions.
You're actually on to something with your comment: Like you said, the word hanif is used within the Islamic tradition to refer to, like you said, particularly noble or righteous muslims. This can make it difficult to find scholarly articles on the pre-Islamic usage of the word and the exact practices of the tradition.
Regarding your question are the origins of the term, there are those who believe the entire tradition of the hanif was created by muslim apologists. W.M. Watt argued that the term was never used before the Qur'an. John Wansbrough likewise called stories about the hunafa' "a myth devised to interpret the spiritual, intellectual, and social transformation brought about by the mission of an Arabian prophet".
2. The term hanifiyya was used to refer to those in pre-hijra Mecca, where Muhammad likely learned of the tradition (and where he began to be influenced).
Most of the contemporary references that I have been able to find refers to hanif sort of as "faithful to Abraham", even going so far as to proclaim that anyone who is a true Muslim is also hanif. So, in these mostly blog posts but occasional semi-scholarly articles that I'm scrolling through, it appears that hanif is less of a religion in and of itself and more of a virtue of the religion.
