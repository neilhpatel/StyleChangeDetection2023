2) he might have been an abolitionist, but he wasn't a leader. To be a leader you need to have followers. A dozen guys plotting to take over a federal arsenal in the middle of the Antebellum South is not a winning strategy, especially when the people he was ostensibly doing it for had no interest in joining him. Otherwise he might have been successful. Newspapers and speeches from the 1850s all condemned him, and he accomplished none of what he wanted.
Two points: 1) being involved in Bleeding Kansas does not mean he was led slave insurrections. Few if any slaves joined him, and he mostly just led his sons and a few others on terrorist raids that focused on killing pro-slavery settlers.
Key was a slave owner and anti-abolitionist lawyer and was angry that the British offered freedom to slaves who fought with them. Key's third verse (which we don't sing) says "No refuge could save the hireling or slave from the terror of flight or gloom of the grave".
Taney's racist brother-in-law, Francis Scott Key, helped him get his chief justice position on the Supreme Court. We should get rid of Key's racist song while we're at it.
We changed his song to remove the racist bits and at no point are we celebrating his racist brother in law, FFS...
Back to my question, though: if a racist song has been changed to leave the racist part out, is the song still racist?
