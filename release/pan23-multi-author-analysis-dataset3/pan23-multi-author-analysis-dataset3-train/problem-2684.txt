To my knowledge, pre-20th century housing supply and density generally grew fairly organically. There are several pieces of Roman legislation limiting the height of insulae (apartment buildings). Likewise, a number of early-modern cities had height limits. But the current US housing crisis is almost entirely a supply shortage created by laws and regulation, so you would need a somewhat sophisticated and legalistic state to create a similar sort of crisis. But I would be eager to hear if there are historical parallels.
I will speak to the origins of the current housing crisis in North America. Because it is important history, and because your description of the current housing crisis seems to play into a narrative of the housing crisis that is not strongly supported by the evidence. I am going to focus on California because it is one of the most extreme examples of the housing crisis on the continent.
This Hugh resistance to new homes is one of the major reasons certain parts of California suffer from a major home shortage.
If you live in Southern or Northern CA, nearly every single attempt to build homes gets hit with massive resistance from locals who will fight to toe death to prevent any new homes in their town. This happens the most in The bay area and in the San Diego area.
