The officer is asking you to come in? Say nothing other than “I’d like an attorney.” If they had enough to charge you they would. They likely can’t ID the driver. You need to speak to a criminal attorney yesterday.
If at all possible, try to consult a criminal defense attorney tomorrow. You can speak with one for intitial consult without paying a large retainer, but if you wish to hire them to defend you on the case, it will probably be a couple thousand dollars.
Again. Do not attend the interview appointment. They do not have enough evidence to arrest now or they would. The interview is to obtain the evidence, namely your statements, that gives them enough cause. Do. Not. Attend. Or. Talk. To. Them. Call an attorney tomorrow morning, and keep calling around until you find someone to speak with about what to do next.
Speak to family about borrowing money if need be, but the most expensive route here is the one in which you speak to the police without a lawyer. It will make your case harder to defend and the chance you either confess or dig yourself in deeper than you are now by trying to obfuscate the truth is just going to make things messier.
If arrested you will soon be brought before a judge to be arraigned. At that time, plead not guilty and ask if they can assess you to financially qualify for a court appointed attorney.
