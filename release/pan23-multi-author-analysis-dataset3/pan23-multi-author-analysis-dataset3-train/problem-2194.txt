When we fight she threw a bunch of names while I did too . That’s how we fight . That does not make either of us psychotic We both have graduated from medical school and done rotations in psychiatry. We know what psychotic is You don’t use sweet talk when you are fighting … Do you?
Also in our home culture it is the responsibility of the older siblings to be in charge of their younger siblings after the parents . Most Indian older brothers and sisters are highly overprotective of their younger siblings . That is the norm . The younger siblings in return respect their older siblings . That’s how it goes . And yes we still maintain mixes of our home culture here in America.
She and the other sister have hit me so many times . I never called the cops on this sister . We don’t stop following our Indian Culture as Americans. Look at any Indian family around . They still live according to Indian culture . And yes women in their twenties have rules in our home culture even while living in America . I and the other sister both had to follow them . All our cousins living here follow them too. That’s where the jealousy in this case stems from . And yes as sisters we are always supposed to have love and empathy for each other . And We doctors are the ones who have studied psychiatry . Don’t be teaching psychiatry to us. That is our area of expertise I am here asking for legal advise . Apparently none of you have any empathy either.
Would you have empathy for her if she hit you? You seem to have lacked empathy for her at every turn here.
