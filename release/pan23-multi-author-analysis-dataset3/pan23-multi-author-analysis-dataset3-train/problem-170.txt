They could still take the gamble but it isn't really clear how many really want to given the benifits they already got during negotiations. Most of the unions already approved the deal. I believe congress is hoping that nudging a few members would be enough to tip the remaining unions into a yes vote.
Saying that most of the unions already voted yes is a little misleading. Yes, 8 of 12 voted their TA's in but the remaining 4 that voted no make up roughly 54% of the total workforce.
This bill would force an agreement that we collectively already voted down... the TA is NOT more than we originally asked for. This bill would also strip us of the ability to go on strike which is a fundamental tool of any union ever. I understand not wanting to risk hurting the economy but taking this right away from us is EXTREMELY anti labor.
It's not just locomotive engineers. You're looking at track maintenance, signal department and many more highly specialized fields. And if one of us strikes, the whole lot will honor picket lines... you'd effectively have to replace ALL rail employees in All fields.
So the railroad workers would be gambling that the railroad barons wouldn't be able to replace then then right? My understanding of the argument about why they can't be granted basic sick leave is that there is no one available to cover for them. Wouldn't that mean they have the leverage to just continue holding out for what they want, fired or not?
Are there consequences if you just quit? Aside from the normal economic consequences of not having money etc. Can they impose jail time on someone for just packing up and leaving the job entirely?
