I think one of the reasons marxist analysis ignores the revolutionary elements is because marxists don't perceive fascism as a revolutionary movement, but simply a response to the revolutionary movement. As paraphrased by wikipedia when talking about Bordiga and Trotsky in their definitions of fascism:
And Trotsky, highlighting the differences between Italian Fascism and the movement of Primo de Rivera in Spain:
Damn, u/commiespaceinvader really laid out how valuable the marxist analysis is when talking about fascism.
I thought about trying to write up my thoughts on Trotsky's and other Marxist definitions of fascism, but was forced to confront the fact that u/commiespaceinvader is . I broadly share their view that Marxist analyses of fascism are important - not least because they actually tried to come to grips with fascism as a theoretical concept in the 1920s and 1930s, decades before anyone else really tried all that hard. However, it's important to note that a class-based analysis has limitations here as well - it explains the reactionary elements of fascism well, but perhaps less the revolutionary elements. I don't think I'm contradicting the linked answer there - I would say that u/commispaceinvader is writing a defence of the usefulness of Marxist scholarship, rather than an assertion of its ability to completely explain all facets of Nazism, but they are welcome to set me straight if I'm wrong there.
Now, the reason you won't find Trotsky's or Zetkin's works referenced in scholarly works on Fascism – I mean, they are referenced, of course; and so are those of many other politically relevant figures who wrote about Fascism in the 1920s and 1930s, but you won't find them referenced as “scholarly sources” - is the fact that they aren't.
The reason why I believe this to be problematic, is the fact that their perspective on the historical function of socialism, Marxist thought, and the role of the organized labor movement can't be ignored in an examination of the development and affirmation of Fascism. Since the Bolshevik Revolution, with its influence on the international socialist movement – while it doesn't represent, like the Great War or the inflation period, a purely mechanical “cause” of Fascism – was certainly a central element, both ideologically and practically, in the process which led to its establishment as a mass movement and eventually as a political force able to take control of the institutions of the liberal state. In this sense, when one maintains that we should examine Fascism – as I certainly believe we should – from the perspective of a “national”, anti-socialist movement, it is impossible to ignore what the declared “enemy” of Fascism represented for Fascism itself and, more generally, for the public mind. And conversely we can't ignore that the perspective of a Fascist defeat in the early 1920s – hence, by extension the interpretation of its affirmation – had two substantially opposite meanings for contemporary observers: either the survival and restoration of the authority of the “bourgeois” liberal state over the masses, with the state able to secure their involvement and stable participation to the life of the nation, or its final and ultimate destruction thanks to the revolutionary action of those same masses.
It is therefore somewhat puzzling to see Trotsky ascribe the affirmation of Fascism in Italy to a betrayal of the social-democracy (which, I understand, is certainly due to his reliance on contemporary terminology, but still seems to me to equivocate the fact that the purpose of social-democracy may not be the proletarian revolution) while conversely advocating for the formation of a united front of the workers extending to social-democracy in order to safeguard the liberal system and its guarantees.
Trotsky's analysis was that this was foolish, calling for a 'United Front' of working class parties against fascism, criticising both socialists and communists for failing to see that this was where their mutual interests lay - even if socialists had enabled fascism by constraining proletarian revolution after the First World War, they had to now see that their interests aligned with the revolutionary left, given the choice between revolution or fascism. Equally, communists needed to turn towards building this alliance, rather than hastening the downfall of bourgeois democracy in the expectation that this would provide them with their opening.
Now, more than a few decades later, we can, of course, leave room for a third possible outcome of the conflict between Socialism and Fascism, with the affirmation of “democracy” and the survival of a transformed, improved “bourgeois” state. Yet, if we, like both authors do, agree on the premise that a decisive clash exists between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, of which the apparent forms of politics and social organization are mere manifestations, and can therefore be reduced and interpreted according to those substantial elements, then the consequent interpretation of Fascism is entirely and completely obvious, as Fascism ultimately appeared to perform and accomplish the exact same function of the liberal “bourgeois” state, that is to ensure the means to maintain the proletariat in its subordinate position, by varying degrees and forms of oppression.
Yet, the fundamental direction of investigation remains unchanged: the proletariat can only “become fascist” by mistake, as a consequence of the insufficient or misplaced efforts of the socialist leadership, as Fascism may be able to evolve into the historical instrument of the bourgeoisie, but could only establish an unnatural and temporary connection with the proletariat.
Whether the dictatorship of the proletariat was “an actual fact” is indeed a rather questionable assertion – which we may return to later on – yet, as you can see, the main issue with this definition is that the origin of Fascism is placed, strongly, in connection to the failure, due to the inadequacy of the leadership, of the organized proletarian to achieve its natural end. And the explanation can't therefore be really detached from its premise, that the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat and consequently the dissolution of the liberal state was the final and explicit purpose of the “enemy” of Fascism.
And how much easier it was for the fascists to paint the “class conscious organized workers” as “anti-nationals” and enemies, not only of the bourgeoisie but of the whole nation, when the aforementioned organizations openly declared their full rejection of national ideas, of the nation herself with her institutions (including those they were, if only temporarily, a part of), and proclaimed their intention to take advantage of the state's institutions only to pursue their exclusive class interests, to the explicit detriment of anyone else.
Under these premises, it's really no surprise that Fascism could earn – somewhat easily, and despite its violent endeavors, belligerent proclamations and unsettling undertones of social subversivism – not only the sympathy and favor of the “official” bourgeoisie, and especially of the agrarians, but of all those individuals, groups and organisms of the state which, to a lesser or greater degree, identified with the national values and institutions which the Socialists proudly and openly intended to violate. Or even of those who, indifferent to ideological appeals and reluctant to commit to revendications of political nature, were invested in navigating the perilous waters of social conflict without sacrificing their immediate means of sustenance, which the nation, or its closest relation, the state, were expected to provide.
