This really does sound like an unfortunate situation for which your son may have no real recourse. ...Do all the tenants pay equal amounts despite the fact that your son's room is larger and has its own bathroom?
For what it's worth, it would be bizarre for a landlord to assign rooms in a shared lease situation. It would be like if you rented an apartment with your spouse and children and the landlord designated which bedrooms you were to sleep in.
Is this apartment one of those type where students each rent their rooms independently of each other or is it a normal apartment with everyone on one lease?
If there are no assigned room assignments in the original lease, did you son know these other roommates personally? Or did the management company assign them together, if this is the case I find it hard to believe that no room assignments were made, and subletting is normally not allowed.
Your best course of action is to early terminate the lease based on the current issues, find someone for a lease takeover, or go through the roommate's sub-lease to enforce a room assignment. Sadly if the sub-lease has no clauses for your son or the original roommate to enforce a room assignment or enforce new rules, there is nothing you can do.
Is this not an issue between your son and his roommate (the one who is on the lease) and not the subletter?
The roommate is the subletter's landlord so to speak. If the roommate allowed the subletter use the wrong rooms, they need to address the issue.
The original lease that your son, and original roommates signed, should have clauses about subletting. It may say subletting is not allowed, and may also say that all subletting activities must be approved by all roommates.
