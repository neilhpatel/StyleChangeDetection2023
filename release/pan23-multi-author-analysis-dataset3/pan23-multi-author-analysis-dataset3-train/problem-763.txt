Unless you are doing inherently risking things like compiling and releasing short reports, or dealing with at least nine figures, I am not sure what specific risks you would need to worry about.
I'm not sure what risks exactly, I guess I'm just paranoid because this isn't my original field of expertise so I'm not as well versed in the risks involved when making money this way (besides possibly losing all of it if my strategy stops working)... I think I'll just keep my head down trading on my own and not go through the hassle of setting up anything else.
Thanks for the response, I'm about to break 7 figures so definitely not talking billions. Just paranoid I guess and don't know if there's a way to keep myself more anonymous or protected (besides using common sense).
There's no real reason to keep yourself any more anonymous that you already are and nothing to protect yourself from.
How much are we talking about here? Honestly even tens of millions in the stock market is not enough for any real player to notice you unless your trading patterns are really suspicious.
