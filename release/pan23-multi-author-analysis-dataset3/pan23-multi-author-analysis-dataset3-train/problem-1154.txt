Edit: I have a business that has been through partnership issues over the past decade plus. Half the crew just stopped doing everything. Myself and other partner are the co-founders and these guys wanted to try and come back and strong arm us. Their names weren’t on any contracts, ever and the first use of the name has me and cofounder as only names on contract. We got lucky.
if you want to control this thing you are going to need someone who understands the law and the stakes fully, and what is 100% legal and liable. You are going to absolutely need a lawyer to help walk you through this. You can often get a free consultation - but if you're making money you should not be afraid to spend some to protect your interests.
Gather evidence. It’s the only way to ensure your security. Screen shot the text messages and save all the emails. There is no clean way out of this. Lawyer first.
Find a business lawyer. Bring all the documents you and your partners signed. Bring screenshots or printed copies of the email correspondence. And then let him advise you how to proceed.
