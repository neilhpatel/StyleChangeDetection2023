You're only describing the same shit that loses minority women a lot of elections - they're minority women.
edit: ffs people, I was saying Abrams was facing the same prejudice minority women running for office everywhere face and adding what truly ruined her campaign outside of that swing. You can stop with the dms about being misogynistic, I legitimately pointed out that misogyny was part of why she was at a disadvantage in the first sentence of my reply.
The core issue was that this message of the Abrams' campaign was not really viable after Kemp rejected Trump. Georgia independent voters hence thought that Kemp was legit. Abrams' campaign could no longer square this argument, yet they kept pushing it.
The fact is that in Georgia, Kemp is seen as the Governor that stood up to Trump regarding 2020 election shenanigans, and Abrams' message was that Kemp shenanigan-ed the vote in 2018 when he was the SoS and oversaw his own election (which is, I believe, a completely reasonable and factually defensible claim.).
This. He over-reached with the Supreme Court and Roe was the number one reason Dems came out to vote in exit polls. He deserves as much of the blame for this as Trump.
Trump is gonna be so pissed. Not only that, but he’ll probably get kicked out of the party, and if he gets kicked out of the party, then he’ll run as an independent next election, securing a democratic victory by stealing 10-15% of the votes from the Republicans. Get fucked indeed!
FUCK YES. From a young Gen Xer: THANK YOU Gen Z and Millenials and everyone who came out to vote Now we need the Dems to cater to the young voters with action and laws.
