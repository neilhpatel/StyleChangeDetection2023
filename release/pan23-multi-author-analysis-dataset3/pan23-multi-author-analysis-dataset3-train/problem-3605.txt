I will also mention that late wage payments are often a sign of a struggling business. As they are paying reasonably quickly, this may not be the case in your specific case, however it is something to be aware of.
204 sets the rules for when valid paydays are, while 210 sets the penalties and means of collection. The penalties are $100 per instance per employee for the first violation, and $200 + 25% for subsequent violations (likely, only after a complaint has gone through, though the law is not 100% clear on that to me) and any willful or intentional violations, with any penalty is payable to the employee.
I believe that you can complain to the DLSE and there might be penalties of $100 or so per pay period (I presume that they are not providing pay stubs if they are not providing pay).
CA Labor Code 204 and 210 would be the applicable sections which stipulate that pay must be provided on regular paydays and the fines that may be levied against the employer for not doing so ($100 per violation and $200 for repeat violations). Section 226 is only applicable if the employer is not providing compliant pay stubs.
