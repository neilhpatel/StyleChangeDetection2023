This is just an old leak of phone numbers that have a WhatsApp account linked to them. It's not great, but also not that much of a big deal since we already know every phone number that exists, and it only takes a moment to check whether there's a WhatsApp account linked to it.
WhatsApp is extremely secure. Messages are end to end encrypted, so no one except you and the other people on the chat can access them.
But the encryption they use is and that's what I'm referring to in my post. What they do with it is another thing, and I do not trust them for a minute.
I know that WhatsApp uses same encryption than Signal does, so that's solid. But do you trust Meta for not having some sort of backdoor there? Is there any way for me to verify this?
Also I've read that Meta does not even need to be able to read contents of messages, the metadata is plenty for them to build profiles. Who you messaged, when and from where is quite a lot of information to give to a company that in past has sold your data to highest bidder.
