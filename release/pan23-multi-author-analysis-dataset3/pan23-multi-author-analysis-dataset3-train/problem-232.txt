A corporation is a legal fiction that enables durable contracts that are not void upon death of the contracting party.
And Corporations (aka their managers and shareholders) will FIGHT sanctions, laws, taxes designed to obstruct their making profit-driven decisions that are evil. So that means we-the-people must insist our elected representatives fight back and make them happen.
And for those who haven't been paying attention, the 'investment class' is a bunch of amoral parasites as well.
This is why Citizens United is bullshit. If a Corporation cannot be put in prison or electrocuted in Old Sparky at Huntzville, Texas, it is NOT a person.
This is why Corporations must be forced to 'do the right thing' by making it a losing proposition for their shareholders to continue doing business in Russia. Therefore, sanctions.
At the end of the day, are the sanctions necessary? Yes, Putin is a ass and deserved to be tried at Hague. But claiming companies only are greedy is a bit misleading.
Some companies get so big that the people who are in charge can pretend morals don’t matter anymore - like it’s a machine that runs on its own.
They shouldn't care, we shouldn't base our direction (social/ political) on hoping that some giant corporation will be nice on given day.
