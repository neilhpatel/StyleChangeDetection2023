I meant generally with my question. But I guess the Muslim fanatics are probably more of a problem in this case. I wouldn't preserve an oppressive culture like those forged out of Islam just because "all varieties of culture are good" or some nonsense like that. Some cultures are incompatible with modern society and act generally in ways that should not be tolerated. But, it's not a person's choice what they were born into, so I asked the question how to kill the culture but not the people.
You don't destroy a culture, that's genocide (UN definition), even if you think that culture is problematic. With culture, in an absolute sense there is no right and wrong, there is only different (Obviously my own opinion).
Problematic because they are Muslim, or because they are not han Chinese in a han Chinese controlled country?
If you want to change a "problematic culture", then you need to demonstrate how your cultures differing values are somehow better. That happens naturally with respectful interaction between different cultures.
