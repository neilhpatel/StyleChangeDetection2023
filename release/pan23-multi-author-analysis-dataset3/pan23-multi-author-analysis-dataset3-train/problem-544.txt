The three books that most immediately come to mind are all by Katerina Clark: The Soviet Novel: History as Ritual (Bloominon and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1981); Petersburg: Crucible of Cultural Revolution (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998); and Moscow, the Fourth Rome: Stalinism, Cosmopolitanism, and the Evolution of Soviet Culture, 1931â€“1941 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2011). I will be honest, all three can be quite dense, and more than a little difficult to read, which is probably why u/Dicranurus made the perfectly defensible choice of not recommending them. However, Petersburg is exactly about Soviet avant-garde culture and literature in the 1920s, and the other two books have large sections on the 1920s and go into great depth about cultural trends at the time.
This is an abbreviated reading list of what I envision would be useful for an introductory course on Bolshevik and Soviet literary culture; I have bolded the more important works.
Maxim Gorky, The Lower Depths (1902); social realist play and antecedent to Soviet literature, though--as the title implies--with a much more critical valence.
Alexander Bogdanov's Red Star (1907), with introduction by Loren Graham; socialist, extraterrestrial utopian sci-fi!
