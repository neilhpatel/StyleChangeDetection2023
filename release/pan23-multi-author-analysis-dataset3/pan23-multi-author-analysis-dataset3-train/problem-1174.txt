Yeah totally. We just had no reason to believe we were shown the wrong lot... first time homebuyer. I don’t think it’s uncommon to trust that your real estate agent has shown you the right lot or house for that matter. It wasn’t even something that crossed our minds as a possibility. Obviously hindsight is 20/20. But the real estate agent does have a responsibility to provide accurate information and that’s where my question comes in to play. It’s not like she just gave us some bad advice. It’s a misrepresentation of a material fact about the property.
I can understand that. There wasn’t a map included with our contracts and we honestly just had no reason to believe this would happen to us. It’s a mistake of putting too much trust in our realtor, but I do still think the error is hers and at least some of the responsibility should fall on her. We’re suffering the consequences of our mistake by settling for something we did not want, or by backing out and wasting months of our time. She gets off without having to pay for her role in this.
She initially blamed the builder, then she eventually accepted 50% fault. The other 50% being the fault of the builders secretary for providing her with the address. This is according to the realtor.
Isn't that what one pays a Realtor for? And don't they pay insurance to cover themselves for damages caused by such errors on their part?
I don't know how you attach liability to a third party if you were that negligent yourself. I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just giving you an honest assessment.
