If my copy has both our signatures and no end date and his copy has both signatures with an end date, which copy would be seen as most legitimate?
This is the fundamental issue that I'm worried about. Me having a copy signed by both of us with no date (copy A) and my landlord having his copy signed by both with an end date (copy B).
Your signed copy is the only copy you need to be concerned about, as the lease is a legal document that can be upheld in a court of law.
If you signed a lease and you have a copy of what you signed, you have a pretty good case if you ever get into court.
Then ask him for a copy of the lease you signed that included the end date. At the same time, forward him your copy without the date. Unless he can produce a real lease that you signed, and explain why you have a copy that doesn't include a date, you should be considered month to month.
However he might argue that leaving the date off was a mistake, and that both of you intended to enter into a full year lease. Generally both parties to a contract are obliged to cooperate with fixing typographical errors.
