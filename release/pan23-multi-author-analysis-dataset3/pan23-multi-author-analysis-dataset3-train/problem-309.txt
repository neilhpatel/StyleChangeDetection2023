I did notice that there are a lot less anti-Israel comments compared to before. I guess peopleâ€™s hatred of Russia supersedes their hatred of Israel loo.
I think, for the most part, hatred of Israel doesn't have much reason. It just was the liberal talking point of the moment because pro-palestine groups have somehow managed to turn unrelated issues (post 9-11 Islamophobia, BLM, LGBT pride, women's rights) into anti Israel conversations in a way Israel hasn't. I'm not totally sure how they managed that - ignoring the lack of correlation between racism in American policing and the Middle East, Israel happens to be relatively tolerant of gays and has pretty good gender equality. Yet saying that became "pinkwashing", while expressing a Jewish support for those causes was "triggering" and "anti-palestinian".
This is not ignoring the large amount of jew-hatred driving the talking points, but the people agreeing with it and demonizing Israel largely just have no idea what they're talking about.
I don't think on an individual level, most people are making the conscious decision to hate Israel because they're Jews.
There are plenty of reasons to dislike the Isreali government, one being the way settlers force palestinians out of their homes with the support of the IDF. Or how about when they murdered the journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh and then when palestinians wanted to carry her coffin the the grave Isreali police forces came and beat the fuck out of the crowd carrying the coffin.
