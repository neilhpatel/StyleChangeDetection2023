Another excellent way to see this (and how devalued drachma was before entering the Eurozone), is seeing the overall Consumer Price Index during those years [on page 11 of this pdf from the Greek Statistical Authority (page 12 printed on the bottom)] (.
edit; I misremembered, it was a familiarization package containing 45 euro coins of all denominations for 5,000 Drachma (14.67 euros), available from 17 December 2001 (01/01/2002 was the official conversion date from drach to Eur for Greece).
I did a little googling and I found from 2005 (3 years after the country converted solely to Euro)...
It has nothing to do with the Euro. Just greedy retailers seeing an opportunity to rip people off with overinflated prices in the confusion of conversion.
This has nothing to do with Euro itself, it's just opportunistic businesses using the situation to rip people off.
That said, shit like this happened in pretty much all countries that switched to Euro to various extent though, in some countries it was worse than others.
The general point is that the inflation is partially caused by adapting the euro, while most countries weren't really ready. They had no patience and forced everything in a relatively very short span of time.
