Yeah but they can't just charge my account as the card could be stolen and it's not me whose spending, they wouldn't know. Besides, I reported the card as lost or stolen so it's their job to completely shut it off.
In your post you said you made several purchases using this card after you reported it lost or stolen. There are 2 likely outcomes.
2. The bank debits those amounts from your account. If you report those charges to your bank claiming you didn't make those transactions, your bank will almost certainly investigate.
If/when your bank contacts Amazon and learns the transactions were made from your account, with delivery to your address, you may find the bank closes your account, Amazon closes your account, and you are arrested.
1. Your bank flags the transactions as potentially fraudulent and asks you if you made those transactions. If you say no, you have committed fraud.
Oh, sorry I misunderstood... in that case, I believe it would be considered fraudulent use. If you reported it lost or stolen, you should have stopped using it and instead used your new card.
Title: I closed my debit card and replaced it with another a while ago and yet I am still able to use it to make purchases. Am I committing fraud?
