Bell had a rule that 1-800 numbers couldn't be used for in state and out of state calls. So because of the surplus lines and low population companies opted to sell our of Nebraska because they wouldn't be losing out on much in the way of sales. Most Nebraska based 1-800 numbers decided to just say that offers weren't available in Nebraska instead of having a second number just for the state. These numbers required subscriptions that were payed monthly and had slotted amounts of minutes to use and overage fees.
Phone lines used to be controlled by a Bell monopoly. Nebraska is the home of the Stategic air command and they insisted that they had a bunch of lines available to them due to the cold war. So Nebraska had a lot of phone lines that no one was using because Nebraska isn't very populated.
So throughout the 60s, 70s, and early 80s, the offers were void to Nebraska callers because they literally could not make the phone call.
Windows was available in Nebraska. This commercial is a parody of other commercials that, for legal reasons, had to exclude Nebraska. That line in this commercial is a wink and a nod to that.
As dumb as this sounds, remember: until the government stepped in in 1983, phone companies wouldnâ€™t even allow consumers to own their own phone!
