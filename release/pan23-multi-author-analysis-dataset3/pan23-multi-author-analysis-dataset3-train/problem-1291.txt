I vote that we capture and imprison the traitors, and put Texas in the hands of decent, honest people who believe in democracy.
Yeah. Dual citizens are US citizens. There is no difference in the rights of dual citizens versus any other US citizen And it's definitely not for states to say that some US citizens have rights that others don't have.
And any right in the US Constitution that is said to belong to "persons" rather than to "citizens" is inalienable regardless of nationality.
The myopic view is reprehensible, bigotry notwithstanding, because it's essentially saying that anyone who holds dual citizenship within the US is not allowed to own property here, and citizenship in the US means nothing without being backed up with jus soli origins.
Similar, but not 100% accurate. It's nationalistic for sure, but it could only really be considered racist if they don't apply their bigotry to ALL foreign nationals, regardless of race.
I thought our motto was "In God We Trust." "Land of the free" is just a line from our national anthem. Anyway, we haven't been land of the free since day one, so I'm not sure why anyone would argue otherwise. It's always been a "land of the free for rich white people" since the beginning.
