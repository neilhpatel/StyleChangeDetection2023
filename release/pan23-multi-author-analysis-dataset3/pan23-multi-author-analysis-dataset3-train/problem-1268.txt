Off the top of my head Iâ€™m wondering what relation could the Spartacist Uprising have with the prominence of the SPD in Prussia.
The Spartacist rising was a national event, but centered in Berlin as the capital, and as one of the centers of the left wing political movement. Berlin is where the Spartacists met their end when Rosa Luxembourg and other leaders were killed by right wing militias. So the major effect on Weimar politics is usually considered that it poisoned the well of any potential cooperation between the SPD and KPD.
Also, as you note, the laws were applied to the KPD/communists as well as the Nazis, and usually in connection to political violence. What sorts of legal powers and restrictions did these laws have in the Weimar Republic, and how do they compare to the blanket powers after the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act?
How do Weimar restrictions compare to the ones the Nazis imposed in the Fire Decree and Enabling Act? They are so far different in degree that there is no comparison. Weimar laws reacted to specific incidents with (I would say) relatively restrained measures. The Nazis immediately, irrevocably, and totally banned all left-wing publications, political parties, and political activities. They invaded newspaper offices, confiscated equipment, and annexed it for their own use. They didn't just ban opposition speeches, they arrested members of parliament and tortured them in makeshift basement dungeons. It's not even a comparison.
