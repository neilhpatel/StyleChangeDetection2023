Yeah they’d definitely be in a better place now if we gave them tanks and aircraft since day 1. But hindsight is 20/20. Training people to use modern tanks takes time, teaching them to use modern aircraft takes even longer. There was also the initial fears that Ukraine would fall quickly, probably an opinion not held by intelligence agencies but probably by the politicians making the final decisions. You don’t want to send billions of dollars in tanks and aircraft only for Ukraine to fall before they receive them.
I know it isn't practical, but seeing A10 Warthogs being flown with Ukrainian flags and pblllltttt all up and down the Russian artillery lines would be something special.
I'm all for helping Ukraine as fast a humanly possible, but you can't just throw tanks, armored vehicles, and aircrafts at them just like that. You have to train the Ukrainians to operate and maintain this equipment, and you have to set up the logistics for it and make sure they can defend it.
The west has indeed been training Ukrainian soldiers since Kyiv managed to repel the initial Russian offensive. There are confirmed news reports all over the internet to that.
