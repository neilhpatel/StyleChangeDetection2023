Just proves this idiot doesn't understand the difference between Nazis (fascists) and Marxists (not Nazis or fascists).
"The former president compared the bureau to Nazi Germany’s secret police and suggested that it is led by “Marxist Thugs.”".
Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday compared the FBI to Nazi Germany’s secret police while also suggesting that “Marxist Thugs” were in charge of the agents who recovered classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
“Perhaps the Gestapo took some of these empty folders when they raided Mar-a-Lago, & counted them as a document, which they are not,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. “It’s also possible that the Trump Hating Marxist Thugs in charge will ‘plant’ documents while they’re in possession of the material.”.
Trump said he held on to many empty folders marked classified after he left the presidency because “they were a ‘cool’ keepsake,” glossing over the fact that the FBI also found documents with the highest levels of government classification, including material on foreign nuclear secrets.
