My understanding, and I could very well be mistaken, is that recall on the local/state level does lay with the people. I agree, the same should be true for Congress.
A mechanism for Congressional recalls should move forward considering the barking mad grifters that now hold positions of power.
And it wouldn't just happen to grifter weirdos: the howler monkey contingent would try to recall the Speaker, and every committee chair, and anyone who ran for Senate.
My concern is that every Member of Congress would have to stand for election, then defend a recall the next year, then stand for election again.
It is an oversight that states cannot recall elected officials to Congress. Perhaps that should change since no one seems to think due diligence is necessary for candidates running in elections. That includes Democrats that should have publicly exposed Santos before he even spouted his first lie.
They Democrat did expose him as an unqualified lying piece of shit. His lies about his background were reported before the election.That is why the Republicans elected him. That is their brand now.
