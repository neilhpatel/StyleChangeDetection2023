Religion is a poison on humanity. It exalts belief in fantastical, magical shit without evidence, sometimes counter to evidence. In every other context of life we call that what it is, stupidity. You call it religion and then we just say it's "faith." We should have the same respect and deference to religion that we do for flat earth bullshit. Yeah fine we can't make a law that says you can't believe in flat earth, but we should be mocking you mercilessly for such a stupid fucking belief.
Your goodness does not insulate you from valid criticism that your beliefs make no fucking sense and have no evidence to back them up. And anyone with a lick of sense and the tiniest modicum of logical reasoning would know that. But then those people also aren't religious so I guess that explains you.
Because unless you're in need or religious you won't realize when you encounter normal christians. For example, my church just did a toy drive and donated 100 toys or so, none of those kids, or their parents, know that those gifts came from our church.
But that doesn't make the news, what you hear about is the bad or the crazies, and those people are as far from Christian (in the sense of following christ) as possible.
