Thats exactly what they think. They believe that West has always been trying to destroy them (Swedens, Napoleon, Crimean war, Hitler, plans Unthinkable and Dropshot), and only nukes save them from getting genocided now.
They want peace, but have been preparing for perfidy by Russia since that is all they have ever gotten from those savages.
Let’s be realistic, Russia could not sustain a war on two fronts…they can barely hold their own against Ukraine….
I don't think Russia actually wants to escalate things, because it's not in their best interests, but there are things which can be done without going full on war. Of course, that's entirely up to Poland, but if it were up to me, I wouldn't let that pass. If Russia is afraid of escalation, they know exactly what they can do to reduce it, and it is none of the things they've been doing thus far.
Treat it as a declaration of war. That doesn't mean you have to invade Russia, because Poland didn't make the declaration of war. But you quadruple support for Ukraine. You station troops at your borders. You start hitting trade ships leaving Russia. You point all the weaponry you have towards Russia. You make it so that Russia has lost both military advantage and any reason to have made dumb pointless statements easily taken back..
Does the Kremlin not understand that making threats is either going to hurt their credibility or it's going to have the opposite effect? They're basically arriving at the same levels of absurdity as North Korea, threatening to drop a nuke from one day to the next, as if they thought this was the only reason they haven't been invaded until now..
In wartime? Do I need to give you examples of Russia doing worse? I don't know how someone that is not insane can defend Russia doing such actions.
