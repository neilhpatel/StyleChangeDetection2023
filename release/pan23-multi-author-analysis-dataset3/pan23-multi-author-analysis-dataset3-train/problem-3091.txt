It's the easiest substance in the world to smuggle. You take the illegal stuff and mix it in with the legal stuff and now it's either all illegal or all legal. No one is going to notice the difference.
In the case of Canada, it's the world's most expensive form of an internationally traded substance. Making Canada's oil viable would be expensive and require hundreds of billions of dollars in investment to make. All the while the Sauds produce a barrel of oil for 1/10 the cost.
Canada's oil is landlocked in the province of Alberta and the only customers for it are the US and China (a trade relationship we actually shun). Whereas the US, Russia, Britain, Norway have placed their oil producing facilities close to the ocean which allows them to quickly ship to anyone in the world.
According to yesterdays economic times, weâ€™re gonna use the russian oil in the country, and export oil drilled in India.
Well it is good for India and other countries that buy oil from Russia. Oil and gas are more expensive in the countries doing the sanctioning, just not as much as it would be since those countries are buying oil at full price from India.
If India were not buying Russian oil they would be buying oil from the same sources as the West. That increased demand would make the price rise even more.
