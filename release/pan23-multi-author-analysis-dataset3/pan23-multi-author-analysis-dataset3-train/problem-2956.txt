"Get a lawyer and don't talk to the police" is the answer to probably half the posts on this subreddit. It is almost never a good idea to speak to police, especially without a lawyer. Their job is not to get to the truth; it's to get enough evidence to charge someone with a crime. Detectives are very good at getting people to incriminate themselves, and it's basically impossible to talk yourself out of trouble with the police. So no, your advice was good: if he was charged with theft, talking to the detective could almost certainly have only made the situation worse.
Probably not a bad decision at all, as even if your husband had talked to the detective, he still would have likely needed an attorney. And talking to the detective might have made things worse for him -- there may have been criminal charges in addition to the settlement.
Your husband refusing to speak with the detective was likely not the turning point in the outcome of all of this. If he's thinking, "If only I'd talked to the detective, everything would have been better," then he's likely entertaining the wrong train of thought here.
At the time, I told my husband to not take calls from the detective investigating, so he did not. Ultimately a bad decision and he is still (somewhat) blaming me because we ended up needing to hire an attorney and settle with the company for $10k rather than continue to fight against a company with more legal resources than what we want to spend.
So after he quit, they went after all COD losses, even if they were offset by the parts/returns being in the warehouses.
But he is SO angry over my push to not talk to the detective (detective called once, voice-mail, then sent a letter, then retired...all quickly, like 3 mos. - and I told him to not engage).
