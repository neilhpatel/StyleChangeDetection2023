Not talk to them. You have already messed up by admitting to law enforcement that you broke the law. Call an attorney now or Monday. Don't talk to them until you have talked to an attorney.
Don't speak to the police? I'm afraid it's too late for that. I was called on Wednesday and told the same story I typed out here. My father, at the time, anyway, didn't mention a lawyer either. He still hasn't, in the days since. What would you say I should do about the call I'm supposed to be getting tomorrow, then?
I do try to keep to myself. I don't go out too often. The Six Flags trips was very much an exception. I'm really sorry for taking time out of your day with this.
Thank you so, so much. I really can't tell you how much it means to me if you think I should try not to worry.
Obviously I can't tell you what is going to happen in your case, but this scenario is very common. You're young, in college and, presumably, without a criminal record. All of that is in your favor. I wouldn't worry too much.
