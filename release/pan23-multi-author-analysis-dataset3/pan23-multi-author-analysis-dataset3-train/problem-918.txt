After he basically kidnapped him last July accusing me with all these accusations… durning the time he has had him i have evidence of manipulation and brain washing my child also , piles of evidence that he is alienating my son from me.
I hired first attorney when got served with papers July 2020 he wasn’t very good , I threw in the towel for peace and to shield my son from the courts , he’s only 8 , called ex husband and agreed to sign a fair logical order .
Order states after the 3 months of supervised visitation Is over the third party should re-evaluate and modify the order for best interest of the child that would start my standard custody.
The court found some cause to give you supervised visitation and order you to do a treatment program. They don't do that based on one parent's say so alone.
So you willingly signed an agreement admitting to drug use and the necessity that you were so unsafe you needed to be supervised around your child? You thought, at that time, that that was the fair custody agreement? OK. I seriously feel you are leaving a lot out.
