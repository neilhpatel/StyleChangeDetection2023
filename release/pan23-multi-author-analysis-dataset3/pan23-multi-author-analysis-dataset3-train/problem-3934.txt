Or a person that keep questioning will waste time and never get an useful answer, an answer that can be used to ask more questions.
To seek the truth you need to know when to stop if you find it. If you keep questioning, the truth will escape your logic as it will look like any other answer.
You think you can find the truth without questioning what truth is, and how we find it? That's very interesting. What makes you so sure you know what it is you're seeking?
It is only by questioning everything that we understand anything; and I choose to question the meaning even of the insults thrown by cattleherds, so that I may end up knowing more than you, an expert on farts.
So you admit that you question everything, even insults thrown by cattleherds or farts very recently aimed in your direction by comic playwrights. 'Everything', therefore is a broad category, broader than the clouds where you keep your head. Would you agree, therefore, that logically if there were even one subcategory of 'everything' where questioning it would make you an asshole, that you therefore would be an asshole?
