PiS in Poland, the ruling party, is somewhat ideologically sympathetic to Orban, so Poland and Hungary tend to use their veto's to defend each other. The new EU punishment mechanisms require unity on the part of all other nations except the nation proposed for punishment.
The reason this hasn't come up in the Ukraine crisis is because Poland hates Russia ferociously and is leading the European charge on doing more for Ukraine.
Basic cost benefit analysis. If Poland voted to strip Hungary's the EU would use those same powers against Poland about five minutes later and strip a bunch of funding from Poland.
Poland choosing to protect Hungaryâ€™s veto at the eu, could cost them politically at home, and that seems like the kind of soft power that could sway their position.
The polish government has been doing some pretty undemocratic things in recent years, like eroding the powers of the independent courts, and might have already been sanctioned by the EU if Hungary wasn't there to veto it.
So while Poland will use their veto to prevent Orban's veto from being stripped for pure realpolitik reasons, that doesn't mean that PiS isn't really really pissed off at Orban.
They could just vote to ignore Hungary's veto, and then to ignore Poland's veto in the vote to ignore Hungary's veto.
It was a flippant remark, but the EU has a nasty case of demi-dictator with what seems to be a universal veto.
