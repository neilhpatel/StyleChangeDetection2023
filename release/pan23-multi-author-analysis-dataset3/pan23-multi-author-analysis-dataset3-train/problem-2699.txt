Did you read the sentence you just posted? Did you see the words “social qualities” and “viewed as distinct within a given society”? Did you read the rest of the Wikipedia entry? If you had, you might have seen this sentence: “Modern science regards race as a social construct, an identity which is assigned based on rules made by society.[3][4] While partly based on physical similarities within groups, race does not have an inherent physical or biological meaning.[1][5][6] The concept of race is foundational to racism, the belief that humans can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another.”.
She's neglecting to consider the fact that Naziism was predicated on the notion that the so-called Aryan Race was superior: the "master race".
This is definitely true, he spared any obvious aryan “races” in his extermination of the country and surrounding areas, that would seem that at least socially the Nazis viewed the Jews as a race.
Even if Jews aren't technically a separate "race," the Nazis considered us to be one and persecuted us as such. Yes, we tend to have an advantage in that we can "pass for white," but that doesn't lessen the oppression. It means needing to live every day of your life as someone else - likely under a different name. (A "Joseph Goldman" wouldn't be able to give his real name and not arouse suspicion of being Jewish.) Just ask any LGBTQ person in a repressive society how "free" they feel having to "play straight" and hide themselves every second of every day lest they be discovered and persecuted.
