Thank you for this whole thread; I particularly appreciate how you clarified that cultural definition of rape is hugely significant in understanding this subject, and modern definitions can't be used.
Edited to also add: Because this post is about the historical view of rape and because rape has, historically, been legally and socially constructed as a crime with a male offender and a female victim, especially in the context of marriage, this reply focuses on female victims and male offenders.
The take-home message is that the study is from 2008 and it was of college students, who are already more educated than many people in the general population even without finishing the degree ... while not a "perfect" testament to the current societal perception of marital rape, I think this sort of story really captures the current state of perceptions about marital rape: that is, people today still don't always see marital rape as "real rape" because even today, people still define and construct "rape" as something that a stranger commits, not a spouse. A similar using a different analytical technique came to roughly the same conclusion with a few added areas for future scholars to study: for instance, much less is known about how people perceive homosexual marital rape - again, this is a brand-new social/legal construct, as gay marriage hasn't even been legal very long!
"Marital rape" is an entirely separate issue not because I believe the fundamental "crime" is different, but because the historical social reality was that marriage created some kind of fundamental "exception" to the "normal" rules for sexual interactions. Legally, it literally was not possible for a husband to rape his wife because of another old English hand-me-down doctrine called the doctrine of irreversible consent; in other words, the societal assumption was that agreeing to marriage literally translated to consent for sexual activity (; paywalled link). As such, under that doctrine, a wife can't be raped because she was assumed to always be giving consent by nature of being a wife. In sociological terms, the role expectation for wives was that they had sex with their husbands -- it didn't matter whether they "wanted" to.
