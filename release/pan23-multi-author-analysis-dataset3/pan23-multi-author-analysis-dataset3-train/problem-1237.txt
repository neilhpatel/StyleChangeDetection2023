A lot of Republicans see Russia as the ideal state. A hyper masculine (ha), mostly white, Christian, intolerant dictatorship. They want America to look like Russia in 20 years and Ukraine is showing the world how weak and ineffective such a nation would be.
What US and EU should be concerned about is Ukraine's fatigue in fighting against the Russian oligarchs and for democracy on behalf of US and EU.
Unhinged from supporting liberal Western democracy in Europe, the GOP has attached itself to anti-Asian racism with the focus on China which fits better with its white supremacist core beliefs in US.
Bizarre that the right wing GOP is so pro-Putin after being so extreme during the Cold War. GOP was always right wing, supporting Hitler prior to Pearl Harbor so perhaps there is some thread of continuity from the anti-Russian Cold Warriors to today's pro-Putin, pro-oligarchy white supremacists.
So interesting these Republicans are echoing Putin's line - namely the west will get tired of supporting Ukraine. I hope someone is keeping an eye on the donations going to these Republicans. I think there just might be some dollars coming in from Russia.
