I have posted in three "Saturday Showcase" threads. All of the answers were from questions previously asked in this sub within the past 6 months that I did not see. I understand that this is abnormal for a flair application, but I thought I would apply anyway, if only to get some helpful feedback on my answers.
(You can, alternatively, provide a fourth answer with the same -- again, we're just making sure for the purposes of a flair application you can draw on a variety of sources.).
- which articles from the Journal of Medieval Military History were you using on your knights surrendering in battle answer?
Hi Flanwaw, thanks for the response Unfortunately, we still can't accept your flair application at this time. (Please don't be discouraged We'll send a message privately with more information.).
Thank you very much for the reply. I fully understand the reasons you don't believe it's appropriate to give me flair at this time. That said, I'm not sure that I want to specialize, so I may just remain an unflaired dabbler for a while, though if I do end up with some more specific knowledge appropriate for a flair I will certainly reapply.
