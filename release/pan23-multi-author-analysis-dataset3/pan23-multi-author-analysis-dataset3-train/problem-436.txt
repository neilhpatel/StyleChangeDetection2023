So they switched from clear cutting to very carefully regulating when and where lumber in Canada is being cut down. Typically to prevent huge multimillion dollar forest fires.
When trees arenâ€™t managed carefully we end up with huge uncontrollable wildfires spitting co2 and smoke into the atmosphere.
By cutting down trees and then replanting them responsibly we are able to have a renewable resource.
Being environmentally friendly is about using ALL of the harvested resource. Sawdust being turned into pellets not only insures that it's not wasted, it also displaces other forms of more harmful energy like Oil, gas and coal. Coal in particular as its easy to convert a coal fired poweplant into burning wood pellets.
Wood pellets are made with residual sawdust, a waste product. When you calculate the entire carbon sequestration of a tree very little of it actually ends up being burned. The overwhelming majority of the carbon is captured.
And if the sawdust and wood are from sustainably managed forests than the wood pellets are carbon neutral.
