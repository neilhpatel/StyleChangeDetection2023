You don't even have to stick around for the duration of your notice. You can walk out right now as long as it doesn't violate any restriction on the contracts your signed. If you are sued winning is simply a matter of showing up for court.
The other advice is all correct, but just because he doesn't have a winning case doesn't mean you can't be taken to court. Keeping good records here would be responsible.
That doesn't mean OP should adhere to their employers demands, but if OP has reason to believe their employer might take an unreasonable path, it would be wise to start preparing documentation now while they still have access to all the information necessary.
The possible dilemma for OP is that, having mentioned a litigious employer, losing a lawsuit isn't the only negative outcome. The case isn't going to be automatically dismissed just because OP was in the right. Even in a win, they could lose the time they spent defending themselves, the money spent on representation, and could lose reputation in their career network in the process.
I don't know your duties, so it's hard to give tailored advice. If, say, you were a network administrator, and you changed all the passwords and locked people out of systems nefariously, that would be actionable. On the other hand, other people not being trained to use those systems is not your responsibility.
