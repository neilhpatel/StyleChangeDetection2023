This doesn't seem right to me- but I am not an attorney. Are we under a legal obligation to let the grandparents have access to our daughter- or just a moral obligation?
The mom seems to be under the impression that the grandparents have grandparent rights and that we could be forced to split custody three ways with them.
My concern is whether it is possible for the biological family to usurp my position as her father in a legal sense.
It has been far too long for a new father, even the biological one, to come in and apply for rights at this point, It's not seen as in the best interests of the child.
But be aware that your ex is free to allow the bio dad and his parents to bond with the child and there's likely nothing you can do about it as long as it's on her custody time.
As the listed father on the birth certificate and the fact that you have 50/50 custody for the last 4 or 5 years you situation is very stable. However you really should get a lawyer who will write up the custody agreement and file it for you.
