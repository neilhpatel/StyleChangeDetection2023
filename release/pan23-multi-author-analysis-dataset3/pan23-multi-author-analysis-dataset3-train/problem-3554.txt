Get a real estate attorney, but also contact your elected officials. They may be able to help you get in contact with someone that can fix it quickly.
You say you've been contacting the bank, but you need to be contacting the local tax authority and work it out with them to fix the delinquent tax problem - all the bank can really do is fix the issue going forward. You can probably stop the tax sale by paying the past due taxes and then working to get the tax payments applied to the correct lot, then get a refund.
You can likely avoid the tax sale by simply paying all (or possibly only a portion) of overdue taxes.
Pay the amount of taxes necessary to stop the tax sale and then demand that your mortgage company repay you for the misapplied escrow funds. Sue them if necessary.
This is for after contacting a lawyer. If you are paying the property tax for your neighbor, is he/she also paying? I would think you could make a point of either property taxes are paid twice or are you saying they have paid years into the future. Now if neighbor hasn't paid, there is your law suit.
