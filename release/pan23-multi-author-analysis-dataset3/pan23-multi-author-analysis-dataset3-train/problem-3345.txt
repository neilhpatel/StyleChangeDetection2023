Speak with your attorney about it. It is not unusual for litigants in a dispute to make excessively broad requests for documents and disclosures, but that doesn't mean a court would deem all to be within the scope of necessary in order for the parties to resolve a dispute.
Unfortunately, we also do not have a way of knowing to what extent the court will want to review any specific types of evidence. It really just depends on too many factors.
It's entirely understandable for you to want to better know what to expect, but unfortunately it's just not possible to guess. The legal system is slow and frustrating, but there's somewhere between little and nothing that can be predicted since every dispute is different.
It's entirely possible and seems likely in this case that not all of the requested disclosures are within the scope of what is pertinent, but we are not able to responsibly predict or guess what might be and what might not be. All we can say is to allow your attorney to guide you on what you need to gather up/answer for them, and what, if anything, the attorney feels should be disputed as overly broad or irrelevant.
You should discuss with your lawyer about producing only what might be relevant to the case and objecting to requests for anything else. If you object he would have to bring a motion to compel and there would be a hearing to determine if you must produce the items you objected to.
