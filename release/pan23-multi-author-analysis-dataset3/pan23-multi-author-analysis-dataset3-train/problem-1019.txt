The problem with writing off the red states like that is that most of the farmland - and therefore where the country gets most of it's food - is in those red states. So sure, they get a lot of blue state money, but blue states get a lot of red state food.
But a union made up of blue + purple states is going to produce mostly blue results. And a red + purple union is going to mostly produce red results. the "mechanism" you speak of is merely voting. it would be super unlikely for a union of, say, blue + purple states to elect someone like trump. A red + purple union is unlikely to elect someone like obama. E.g. a Cali, Oregon, WA, + Nevada union isn't going to produce the same results as a texas, lousiana, florida, + georgia union. it is extremely likely that the two would look very different bc:
And if we're using metaphors, this is how I see it: Our house has a fire in the living room that will destroy the whole house, and I'm suggesting we use using a blanket to smother the fire, but the family is complaining that it'll mess up the blanket and it's a precious heirloom. Meanwhile, the blanket and everything else will go up in smoke by the current trajectory.
I kinda agree. I think the US gov't is fundamentally broken and we should start over. I would love if all the states can agree to new terms (e.g. proportional representation in the senate; no money in politics; etc) and all come back together. But for now, I'd settle for the half of states that want to be sensible. Also, red states rely on blue states for funding... so I'm curious how long they'll go before realizing they fcked up.
Just a reminder that most of the red states get more from the federal government than they give in via taxes. Also, most of the blue states give in more than they receive.
does that mean the blue states dont have to carry the deficits of red states? that would be super awesome for fiscal health of blue states. the reds can go and fk themselves for all we care.
