Itâ€™s a shame that they let you pay code enforcement tickets through a similar looking .gov site : Makes it hard to assess the legitimacy of the .com designation.
If you go to the .gov website for miamidade.gov and got to traffic and parking then civil traffic infractions there is a make a payment button which takes you to the .com site listed above. Poor design imo but seems legit. Call the court house and confirm then pay the ticket or fight it. Cant help you with the fighting it part.
If it is just the fine, I still recommend fighting this. A ticket with that big a number will likely trigger a serious bump in insurance even if the initial fine is modest. You may not need attorney, but make sure to appear on the date that says you allows you to contest. Also find out what you need to do to get information from the police like any dash cam (which likely doesn't exist) and anything related to the method of how they tracked you. Another lawyer or LEO here will likely give you better info on this then me. It's been a while since I've done anything like this.
The two most most important reason to show up on that day is that the officer may not. And if you he doesn' show up, you might get to walk away. Also, on the day, you might want to talk to the prosecutor that day and see if you can negotiate this down to something else.
I would check the ticket again. Without knowing what jurisdiction you are in, a 100 mph ticket is usually not just a hand you a paper and walk away. In many states, that would amount to reckless driving and you are getting more than a fine. It might be a misdemeanor and carry bigger penalties and have long term effects. If it is more than just a fine, you should get an attorney. There are lots of lawyers out there who do this kind of work and will do it rather cost effectively. You do not want this to be any more than a fine.
