The solution is simple: pay teachers enough to make it a coveted job, protect them from crazy parents/admin, and make it a viable career path that new teachers want to begin.
Teaching should be one of the most highly paid positions we have so only the best of the best are teaching our children.
A lot of teachers who last in the profession have other income, such as a high earning spouse or old money. The math doesn’t work for someone on a teachers salary with college debt in any desirable place to live.
Low teacher pay and high university costs occur for the same reason. Government spending is a reflection of our societal values. There is no shortage of money, it’s a matter of how the money is allocated. Take Mississippi for example. It’s near number 50 in just about everything related to education, yet they find plenty of money to funnel to Brett Favre. That kind of stuff happens every day. Federally, Congress just passed a bill to send $850 billion to a never-audited department of defense, a one year budget. That could be cut in half and we would still be the world’s only superpower.
I almost did after subbing for two years, and my teacher mother warned me not to do it. She started right before the health benefits and retirement were made worse for future teachers, and we lived in a fairly low cost area, so it worked for her. A teacher today would have it much harder.
My partner was a teacher until earlier this year. He didn't leave because of the climate, but because he got an opportunity to help more children and to make sure schools are following the law, something I know as a teacher he saw broken all the time or had schools even ask him to break. If this job didn't happen, he would still have been in special education because he loved fighting for his kids and I know they loved having someone in their corner. We are lucky to live in a much more sane state though where the teachers unions are generally strong and supportive.
