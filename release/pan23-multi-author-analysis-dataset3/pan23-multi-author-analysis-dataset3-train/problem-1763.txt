Well, to put it bluntly, because it wasn't a civil war, it was a revolution. There were periods where certain violent revolts had cropped up against the central government (i.e. the Vend√©e uprising, the 'federalist' revolt that was never a single, unified revolt). These events are characterized as 'revolts' or 'uprisings' because they were never large-scale forces fighting, they were pockets of localized resistance that never had a unified group to other parts of France.
I'm certain points could be made for considering that a civil war, but the reason it's always referred to as an uprising is due to the limited scope-- it was only in one region of France, albeit a good sized one-- and the somewhat fluid nature of the troops, as men fought for their village before retreating. I've never heard an argument for it being a civil war, and I believe it fits the role of an uprising well, but you could certainly make a plausible case for it depending on how you define terms.
That's a reasonable argument to say that there was a civil war during/following the French Revolution. But when peoples talk about the French Revolution, they don't talk about those events, they mostly only care about what happened in Paris. The "Vendee civil war" did not have much more impact on France than the numerous other uprisings France had to deal with both before and after the French Revolution (contrary to the American Civil War, which wounds are still present today), while the events happening in Paris stand out as a "one of a kind" in term of their long term influence on France, eclipsing everything else happening during this period in France.
