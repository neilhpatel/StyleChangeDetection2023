Its meaning has been appropriated and diluted to refer to any injustice or power imbalance, as you explain here. But the anti-woke movement is historically and fundamentally open racism before anything else.
"Woke" used to specifically be a term used by the Black community to describe people who were aware of racial injustice and had an understanding of what prejudice meant.
“Woke” was specifically chosen to be used by Black people to indicate that we are aware of the systemic and systematic oppression against us. “Stay woke” is a term we’d often say to each other to continue to encourage being aware of our reality. Then it was stolen and bastardized by conservatives and then again by liberals. But honestly, it’s infuriating that it’s being misused because it had value to the Black community and is now being used to simply define “anything y’all don’t like”. But I’m not surprised at that.
It honestly doesn’t even matter who stole it first. The bottom line is, the term was taken from a community of people where it meant something and then was turned into a way to belittle and downplay the continued struggles of Black people in this country in addition to “anything y’all don’t like.” That’s it. That’s my whole point.
Sure. Parents wouldn't like it, so let the parents deal with it. "Your kid can't get AP credit and reduce the cost of college because a politician thinks he gets to dictate curriculum on a topic he doesn't understand for the entire country. Sorry, take it up with him.".
If they want their own kids to be unemployable rubes that's their decision, the same as the decision made by the dimiwtted parents of every student who went to Bob Jones University.
