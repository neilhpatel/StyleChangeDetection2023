They sure do exist to legislate. Those soundbites get blown up by the right wing media into looming, threatening, cataclysmic strawmen that "something has to be done about".
Then they write the legislation they want. To restrict voting. Or to setup public bounties on women seeking abortions. Or to grant their legislatures the ability to overturn public votes.
Why have the legislative branch legislate right? Just let SCOTUS make up the rules instead! Congress can, and could have, at any point update Section 230 to include/exclude whatever companies/industries they want. The GOP had 2 years under Trump to update it, even while crying about it, and didn't. SCOTUS should butt out.
Realistically, since Jordan used the word "collusion" here, which implies illegal actions, the likely response from any company would be something along the lines of "All interaction with government agencies followed the law".
And yet, even from Musk's own release of Twitter emails, this goes back to at least Trump's admin (and likely even further). But hey, let's cherry pick the data.
