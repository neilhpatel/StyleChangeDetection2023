I'm sorry to be rude here, it's not my intent. But I feel like what OP is saying is not difficult to visualize. There's one driveway, and at the end of the driveway, there are two garages, including OP's. The neighbor, instead of parking in front of his garage, parks in the middle, in front of both of them, blocking the entrance to OP's garage.
Just because he is parked in front of his garage does not mean that part of the driveway is his property.
You are saying that he is parking on his property but you are also saying he’s parking in a shared driveway.
he's parking on his property hence I cannot call a tow truck. at the same time he's block access to my garage since driveway is shared -- row of 7 houses with garages.
I think it’s more that there is a drive behind the 7 houses that is parallel to the row. Each house has a garage accessed from the drive. Rather than pulling into their garage, 5 is parking in the drive blocking 6 and 7 from being able to leave.
I think it is but there must be some kind of law where he or anyone cannot block regular access to any further garages bc its a shared driveway for multiple garages.
If his property allows him to block access to her garage then I’m not sure what OP can do because the design of this “shared” driveway and subsequent garages is fundamentally flawed.
