And of course there are rich Indian and Chinese philosophical traditions: Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and so on. Just to name a few. These traditions go back as far as Plato and sometimes even farther.
If North America, China, India, etc., having rich philosophical traditions makes you not exceptional, then the ancient Greeks were not exceptional.
(And as I said above, we shouldn't interpret the Greeks' exceptional status to mean that they were unique: China, India, North America's Indigenous cultures, and so on, all produced excellent and worthwhile thought.).
2. The examples I'll give you will include Romans because Greek philosophy was carried into the Roman world.
On top of this, that mode of cultural activity got spread to quite a large portion of the world through the Hellenistic empires. So instead of being "a weird thing that some smart people did in Aegean city-states," it became a mode of discourse that reached a far wider audience.
What I would add to the above is that the Greek "mode" of philosophy seems unusual. They not only wrote things down, but they attributed ideas to individual people (sometimes fallaciously, but such is how it goes), and saw "love of knowledge" as essentially a battle of wits with other people both alive and dead. This is why it is a big deal to argue with Plato, even though he's been dead for millennia. It's not the sort of anonymous mode that we see more prevalent in other cultures not connected in some way to the Hellenic ones. We know whose these people are, and they argued with each other, and produced a rich corpus of verbal dispute.
