Eh, not really. It doesn't matter if it's in writing or not if she's not willing to enforce the agreement. If she was, she would not only evict them, she would also sue them for not paying the bills they agreed to pay (assuming they're able to, so it's worth bothering).
Of course she can also have someone do this for her, like a lawyer or even just a family member. But if she's not WILLING to kick them out, then you have a more difficult problem. Is your grandmother mentally and physically capable of managing her own life? If so there may be nothing you can do, but if not, someone could try to get guardianship over her and make the legal decision to force the cousin out of the home.
Only your grandmother can force them out, and since they live there, she would need to follow the proper eviction process for her state to legally force them to leave.
Your grandmother can serve them with a notice to vacate according to your state's laws. If they still refuse to leave, she can proceed with the eviction process.
