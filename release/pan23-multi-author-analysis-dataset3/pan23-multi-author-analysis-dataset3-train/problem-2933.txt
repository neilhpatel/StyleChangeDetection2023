There's no legal problem with a process whereby they offer a discount to non-tobacco users, and require that you select and affirm that at each open enrollment.
If you fully read your benefits package, it’s there and it tells you about the discount, one of the first questions that is asked when you choose your benefits is tobacco status.
As another explained, it's a discount for not using tobacco, not an upcharge for using tobacco. Call an attorney if you want, but I doubt anyone will help you with this. A class action lawsuit because you didn't apply for a discount? Just trying to give you realistic expectations.
That’s what I’m looking for is realistic expectations. It’s not framed as a discount and just because it’s a discount does that make it legal? It’s literally a monthly charge deducted from my paycheck each month. Not a discount. It literally says Tobacco User and it’s under the post tax deductions on my payslip. Doesn’t sound like a discount to me when it’s a deduction. Or am I mistaken? I can upload a screenshot of my payslip if that would help.
It’s not about worth. I can afford the fight. I’m thinking about the other low income Target employees that are having their wages stolen because of this deceptive practice.
