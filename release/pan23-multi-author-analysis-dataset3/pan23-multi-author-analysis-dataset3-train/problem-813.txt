Did it ever cross your mind for no obvious reason that some rando likes kids more than they should? Or that some interest of some group different from you uses the interest as a cover for pedophilia? Or that somebody's different view is cover for pedophilia? Or did it ever cross your mind that children's genitals should be policed?
Actually yes, it did cross my mind that some random person is entirely too interested in children’s genitals. And at the rather young age of 12. But probably not for the reason you’d think.
And for what it’s worth, my family member has gone on to lead a pretty normal life in the 30+ years since it happened.
While this did not happen to me personally, a family member of mine was molested when they were 6. That “dirty old man” as was the common term used to describe pedo’s at that time, was caught red handed in the act. As it turned out, the neighbor who molested my family member had done something similar to another young person in the building not long before, and several other young children over the preceding decades. My family member’s legal case was cited and eventually lead to the creation of which created the sex offender registry in the state of California.
