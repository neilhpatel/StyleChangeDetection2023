It's probably why they are reporting it: They want to start priming the MAGA base to see DeSantis as their new Lord and Savior for 2024 and not Trump. Not that Trump will let them take the party from him without a fight.
Don’t publicize this we want a divided Republican Party in 2024. Biden is not a strong candidate but either trump or desantis will be much worse. Keep them divided. Get your friends to vote. Educate yourselves on issues. This is the way.
This will be the pivot. Watch conservative shock jocks start to shift support to a quote-unquote winnable candidate in DeSantis. However, what would be really entertaining was a party fracture over this. The Republican party has dogwhistled to the Trumpopulists for too long for this to go over smoothly. The party will want to push with all of their media power to get support for a more run of the mill Republican. Trump's ego will not be able to take this and much of his support base will not accept the pivot. Imagine if Trump runs as an independent/third party candidate, splitting the vote significantly across the entire country delivering the Democrats a strong win in 2024.
Wasn’t there an election where Teddy Roosevelt completely tanked the Republican vote? Trump running as an indi would have way more of a negative impact on 2024 than a Libertarian party candidate (lol) in 2020 or a Greens candidate in 2016. It would create a significant divide. Which tbh, the Republican Party deserves. They deserve to be in opposition for a very long time. They should reap what they sow.
As a purely uninformed outsider opinion, it’s almost better if the Dems don’t send him to jail, as this would not only make it easy for the GOP to select De Santis but also galvanise the Republican base. Let them fight and don’t interrupt your opponent while they’re making a mistake.
