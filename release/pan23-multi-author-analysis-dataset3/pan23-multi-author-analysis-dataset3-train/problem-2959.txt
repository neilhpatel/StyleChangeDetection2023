Not many people realize how important it is. If you think "special forces" that's what this unit is. 14th is the unit that was supposed to capture Zelensky at the beginning of the war. They are assigned the most challenging objectives.
If they are involved in Vuhledar it means that's the main push. Russia doesn't have anything better.
Thing is, Russia can't win by defending. They haven't seized enough of Ukraine to force a surrender, nor defeated enough of Ukraine's military to ignore the damage it's doing to them.
Add in the Russian propensity to adore artillery and put it on a pedestal as the solution to all problems on a battlefield that always works.... Ukraine probably didn't lose half that number here.
If Russia’s gets artillery is neutralised, do they have have a meaningful way to take take territory in Ukraine anymore?
Without overwhelming artillery, I really don’t see how Russia can make meaningful advances in Ukraine anymore.
If they try to dig in, Ukraine isn't going to obligingly attack where Russia's army is best defended... they'll just run around picking weaker stuff off with their range advantage, and Russia gets to slowly bleed out. They know it, hence the constant efforts to pressure Ukraine into a ceasefire.
