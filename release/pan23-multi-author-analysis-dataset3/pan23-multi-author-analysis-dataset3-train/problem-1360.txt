Their pet insurance might cover it if they have it. My dogs insurance specifically has a large amount of cover for if they are a really bad girl and cause hundreds of thousands in damages.
Yes, your homeowners insurance can cover the cost if your dog bites another dog and the other animal needs to go to the vet, or the other owner decides to sue you. Check with your insurer to be sure theyâ€™ll cover vet bills and related costs if your dog injures another dog.
If you got their contact details, write them a letter explaining exactly what was needed from the vets and any proof of price, and ask them to reimburse you.
Our dog was on the other side of this situation. Got of leash by accident, overly energetic and caused small bite to another dog.
If you were in a leash-required area, the dog off leash is typically considered at fault (other than like, ridiculously case specific situations). In my area, TYPICALLY a dog on a 6 foot of less standard leash is leashed and controlled, a "flexi lead" or other retractable is "under control but not leashed" and off leash is... off leash. Under control becomes purely situation dependent at that point.
If this were one of my clients, I would ask the vets if they can send an itemized, detailed bill (as detailed as possible, and certified so you have knowledge of the arrival and acceptance of the letter by the intended recipient) and then call the owners and let them know you've come across rather large vet bill, and would prefer to discuss this and settle it privately.
