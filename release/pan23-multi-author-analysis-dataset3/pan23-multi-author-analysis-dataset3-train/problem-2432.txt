Are they gonna prevent intermediary canadian companies from buying the homes FOR foreigners? Because if the 6% foreign ownership statistic in the article is true, this won't change jack shit.
And at 6% foreign concentration in BC as an example, it won’t do much for your average home buyer with regard to prices.
It’s not a uniquely Canadian problem, the US sees the same thing, and no one here has seriously suggested a foreign home purchase ban because it won’t drive down prices (it’s mentioned that only 6% of BC is foreign owned) and will just drive foreign ownership underground through domestic intermediaries.
Outside investors are inflating the home prices in Canada, so the government placed a 2 year moratorium on non-Canadian citizens to purchase houses in Canada.
I'm not an expert on Canada and their laws, but you just prohibited foreign investment that would directly or indirectly lead to housing construction and wealth accumulation by Canadians. That assumes that foreigners are actually fully prohibited by law from buying and building houses, which might not be fully true, but that's what the title suggests.
