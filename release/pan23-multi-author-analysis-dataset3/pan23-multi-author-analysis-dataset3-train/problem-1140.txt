Yeah fair play, is hard as I know they're just doing their job but that one session has completely ruined her life. But thanks for being honest and fair, hopefully in time things will get better.
I can understand that doctors only go on what they know, but surely they'd be able to tell my girlfriend wasnt sexually active? It's more how the whole incident was handled, my girlfriend was made to feel like a liar and put through something stressful without good enough reason. And also the unprofessionalism shown by calling her out after a complaint was filed I feel isn't really good enough.
First, It doesn’t appear that there was any malpractice so the complaint made against the doctor did not have merit. It sounds like your GF had an uncomfortable experience and her mother made a misguided, wrongful accusation about the doctor that could have threatened his career. At this point, move on.
Second, If a rather routine examination manifested into PTSD, your GF really does need serious therapy yet finding the proper therapist will be a major difficulty. Rape victims develop PTSD. An unpleasant, though totally ethical, medical exam is generally not a cause of lifelong debilitating PTSD. If a psychosexual therapist is not available, find the next best alternative. Anybody! Your GF would best be served with serious counseling as there are probably deeper issues here. I’m not a doctor, but what you described is someone who has a severe mental block that may go deeper than this one experience.
Lastly, I don’t see how you can call the exam a “cover up,” “vile,” or “disgusting.” A smear is not abuse. It’s a routine medical exam. Do you think young men feel good after having a doctor grab their testicles? No, it feels invasive, but it’s part of a proper medical exam. 16 is the age where young women and men get examined for sexual and reproductive health. That’s common and not reason to get emotionally worked up.
