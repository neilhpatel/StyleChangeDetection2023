The answer is probably yes, though there aren’t many recorded incidents of it happening. The story though illustrates just how commonplace Mummies were in Europe from the 15th-19th centuries.
Throughout this whole period mummies were unwrapped with varying degrees of care for the entertainment of crowds. Thomas “Mummy” Pettigrew became famous for his unrollings in the 1830s though the practise is recorded in England as far back as the 1660s. Some wealthy people even held there own private unrollings at home. The stories of burnings probably originated with these private investigations when collectors disposed of the remains which weren’t of interest. Mark Twain also records mummies being used as locomotive fuel in Egypt during the 1870s, though this is likely a tall story to entertain his readers. The amount of mummies needed to power a train would be astronomical. Rural Egyptians have burned mummies for fuel at various points in history, although the practise appears to be very rare. As I’ve established they were far more valuable as export commodities.
Mummy brown was last recorded as being produced around 1964, though had not been widely used since the 1920s.
Further question, was ‘Mummy Brown’ in the 60s still sold containing ‘actual’ mummies? I’m amazed it was so recent if that is the case.
