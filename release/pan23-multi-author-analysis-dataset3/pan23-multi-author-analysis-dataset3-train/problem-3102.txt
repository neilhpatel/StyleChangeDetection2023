Ok well that might hold up if there wasn't a family of 5 living in another unit across the way. Thats why I am absolutely puzzled. I paid by check every month and have proof he was paid timely. I can show the place was actually left in better condition than when I got it. Not sure what stick he got up his butt....
I agree but I am almost certain that regardless this kind of behavior isn't allowed by the landlord is not allowed. I cant imagine any landlord can scream at a tenant to get out and when they do, they keep an extra month claiming tenant didn't provide proper notice after he effectively terminated the lease.
Edit: Your landlord screaming at you and giving frequent notices to move out is harassment. This is super illegal, and not something that courts take lightly. Please document any and all evidence of your landlord harassing you, just in case you want or need to go to small claims court.
If that family is indeed breaking occupancy limits and the landlord is aware, then the landlord could get in some trouble if you bring the issue to light. It the family is breaking occupancy limits and the landlord doesn't know, bringing it to the attention of the landlord would make them liable for fixing that issue.
More to the point, by evicting you for the size of your family, your landlord may be discriminating on the basis of family status (illegal in MA). He also appears to be mishandling your security deposit. If he owns more than one apartment, he could be violating consumer protection laws by engaging in unfair or deceptive business practices.
