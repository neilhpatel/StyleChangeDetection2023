It matters, because when everyone calls to ban Russia from everything, and everyone is silent when USA and its allies do the same things, it looks very hypocritical.
Russia has nukes, we can not attack them and an offensive war against Russia is an impossibility, morally and practically.We are sanctioning them as a result of that, cutting off all ties that can be cut off.
It seems that not allowing russians into games would fit that idea of balance between our opportunities and the moral implications of the war.
If they fly the flag of a nation that's waging offensive war and they are accepted in front of the public eye, then they are ambassadors for the nation. If they didn't represent a nation and didn't film it and the athletes only did their disciplines.... Then they wouldn't have much to do with war.
This is an interesting subject, how many times have warring countries competed against each other in the Olympics? Is it a common occurrence? If not how often are countries barred from the games for being at war?
