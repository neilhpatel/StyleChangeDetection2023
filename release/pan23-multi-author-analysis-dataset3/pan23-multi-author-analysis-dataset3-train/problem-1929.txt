All federal tax forms are available for free on the IRS website. As ronnevee mentions OP would only need to file a 1099 if the handyman was doing work for a trade/business.
All you need to do is file a 1099-Misc form for contractor services within the year you employed him. You need to provide him with a copy and a copy to the IRS if you paid him over $600 total. You have to buy the forms at a local office store, costs about $15-20 for a pack - you can't just buy one.
He's not an employee, he's an independent contractor. Technically, yes, by paying him under the table you are not reporting payments and allowing him to cheat on his taxes. If he reports you, it will also bite him in the rear too - but he seems kind of dumb, so he might just go ahead and cause problems for you out of spite.
"Payers use Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income or Form 1099-NEC, Nonemployee Compensation to: Report payments made of at least $600 in the course of a trade or business to a person who's not an employee for services (Form 1099-NEC).".
Right. So unless this was work done for the Op's trade or business, no 1099 is issued. It sounds like this was help around a personal property, not that op was getting help with a trade or business.
