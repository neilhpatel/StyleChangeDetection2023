At this point the war is about nothing else but Putin's survival. He can't politically stop the war unless he gets something out of it so that he can spin it as a victory.
That someone else could try to spin themselves being a hero fighting against corrupt elite and wastefull war.
Putin knows that if does not have anything to show for his people after all of this loss of life that he is going to be killed by his people or by the elite.
Putin is a coward at heart and there's gotta be something in the back of his mind that knows that if he orders a nuke dropped it will result in his death.
Reading between the lines of what has been said I think the Americans have made it pretty clear that if Putin uses a nuclear weapon he will not survive it so hopefully that is off the table.
Russia views Ukraine as so essential to its long term security that I believe nuclear weapons will be used if it comes down to that.
Russia views Ukraine as essential to its long term security. It doesn't matter if you disagree with them. They've done the math and they view Ukraine as essential to their countries long term security.
And Russia views Ukraine as essential to their long term security. It doesn't matter if you disagree with them. They'll tolerate it being neutral, but they won't tolerate it taking steps towards allying with their enemies.
They will tolerate Ukraine being independent/neutral, but they won't tolerate it taking steps to ally with Russia's enemies.
