Criminals have mentioned time and time again that if they think someone has a weapon, they're more likely to leave that person alone.
Of course, it does depend on culture, too, but the inner city gangs shooting each other over every perceived slight aren't places controlled by Republicans. Or have loose gun laws, for that matter.
And what about the 10 year period of the assault weapons ban? Somehow people still weren’t turning to knives and cars, yet mass shootings were not only far more rare, but also far less deadly in general.
Why do you think other countries with strict gun control have substantially fewer mass killings? Clearly criminals aren’t just turning to knives, cars, planes, and explosives at anywhere near the same rate - at least not successfully so.
But statistically speaking, you are more likely to die by your own gun than to stop a violent criminal with it.
But what I cannot do, is ignore all the data and pretend it’s as embarrassingly simplistic as only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun.
Look - I value my right to self-defense by firearm, but suggesting gun control doesn’t work is simply ignoring the absolute magnitudes of data that indicate the exact opposite.
Either way, gun rights absolutists loooooove to cling to outlier cases like these while ignoring the fact that more shootings have been stopped by unarmed citizens than armed, and virtually none of those stopped by unarmed citizens appear on the top deadliest lists.
You also ignore shootings where more people end up hurt or killed because of armed citizens - like UT, for example.
So many small steps can be taken to reduce gun violence without infringing on rights but they(you?) aren't even willing to have a conversation about it. Delusional psychopaths.
