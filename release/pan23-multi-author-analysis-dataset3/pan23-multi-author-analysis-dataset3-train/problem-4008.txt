Do you live in NYC? In NYC there are lots of people who have legitimately right-leaning viewpoints. It's the only place where I've heard people who identify as Democrats say they think Biden is too economically liberal, lol.
First of all, chill out lol, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with ranked choice voting in general. But ranked choice voting can sometimes help moderates and sometimes help progressives based on the breakdown of the constituency. In NYC it definitely benefits moderates more because it frees up Republican voters to vote for the moderate Dem and NY Democrats tend to be more moderate so a lot of them are putting the moderate Dem as their first choice anyway.
The idea is over a significant period of time voters (in NYC) will see the inaction and/or harm that the moderate democrat brings/sustains and a further left voice is able to gain power/influence that hopefully leads to more elected representation.
The really useful thing about ranked choice voting is that it doesn't allow moderate Democrats to hold a gun to progressives' heads and say "fall in line or else" after they continue to fail in their support of the working class.
Third parties are the only peaceful way forward, and ranked choice (or other more representative electoral systems) allow people to vote for them while still having their vote count against those they don't want in office.
