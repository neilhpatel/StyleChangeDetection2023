The book is about European trade in India, beginning around 1500. The chapters are divided among countries, beginning with the Portuguese and then later the Dutch and British companies.
Is there a book you would recommend on European trading in India? Especially in the 16th and 17th century.
It is the Portuguese part of which I read some. It doesn't just describe their expansion, but also their attitudes towards India and how they were seen by the Indians. The Portuguese are described as people for whom violence was extremely normal and this is connected to their warfare in North Africa, which I think is talked about in an earlier chapter of the book. It also mentions that the Indians were sometimes surprised about how little fear of death the Portuguese seemed to have, fighting elephants head on etc.
Portuguese in India also includes a nice bibliographical essay, but sadly I wasn't able to find my book in there.
Hmm I read a book called the Portuguese in India: The New Cambridge History of India. But, I think it only talked about the Portuguese and didnâ€™t relate to other European powers, but it may be worth it to look into.
