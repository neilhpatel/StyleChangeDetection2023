Most of us who are hesitant on PAS were concerned that stuff like this would happen when we expanded it to the non-dying. And the fact that has happened is confirming those concerns.
What if she were in a bad state of mind when they offered it? Or if she was short on cash and felt like a burden to her family? Not to mention the toll it naturally takes when someone, perhaps even including your doctor, thinks you'd be better off dead.
Forcing someone who is in constant pain and will eventually die from a terminal illness anyways to stay alive when they don't want to is a human rights travesty.
How many more stories like this do we need until we realize that the Canadian government prefers killing their disabled population to helping them? And until those priorities are fixed, MAID is always going to be abused as a way to eliminate the "undesirables". Farsoud is only alive today because of private charity, a thing that the Canadian government then turned around and tried to punish him for receiving.
The problem with MAID to me is that it's going to be used by governments as a way to not have to expand out care for their disabled populations.
It also looks like one of the good things to come out of this debate is a light being shined on how stingy welfare for the disabled is and how the economics of being disabled can drive some people to MAID. Hopefully this leads to increases in disability payments (which is really what should have been happening before and it is only our squeamishness about the morality of MAID that is finally making us confront a long standing, horrific, injustice).
