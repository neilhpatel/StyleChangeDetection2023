Everyone always says "file a claim and let your insurance handle it", but they assume everyone has collision / comprehensive coverage, when most have liability only.
If you have no insurance, they will pay you directly, but with insurance, you can rely on them to deal with the opposing party, even if you just have liability. I'd contact them and tell them the opposing party is being unresponsive and that you'd like their help in resolving the situation.
Wait. Backup. Where is your insurance in all this? The proper way of dealing with this is that you contact your insurance, and let them deal with the opposing party's insurance. You should not have to deal with them directly. Or the individuals, for that matter. This is what you pay for insurance for, to deal with this crap.
I did contact my insurance. Unfortunately, I do not have full coverage so my insurance can’t do much for me. She was at fault for the accident so it’s her insurance company’s job to payout. I’ve been in an accident before where I had literally no insurance and the other person’s insurance company paid me because their insurer was at fault.
This is what my brother told me. I put in a claim with my insurance company as well (I have Progressive) and they asked me all these questions about the accident just to tell me at the end that since I don’t have full coverage they won’t be able to contribute anything and that they can’t control how fast the other insurance company resolved the issue. I swear to God this is exactly what the man told me.
