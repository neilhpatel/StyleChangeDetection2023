Feel free also to ask for a supervisor if you don't think the person you're talking to gets that there is a pattern of illegal practice here.
Every time it happens, file a claim. In every claim, explain that you haven't received your paycheck yet, and that your employer has a pattern of not paying employees on time, and list every single previous date on which this occurred.
The Department of labor can do more than just take a report - they can actually enforce the law. But you need to be tiresome about it and make sure they listen to and record you saying each and every time this issue has come up in the past and all the past complaints you have made to the Department of Labor about this employer.
As someone who’s overseen payrolls, I’ve never encountered an issue with an employee who’s routinely late with time cards and expects paychecks on time. Never heard of anyone seeking the law to step in on this, the reason this might concern you is maybe it’s not a hill to die on.
I realize that ultimately your employer is responsible to pay you on time. If they have a payroll service, it’s likely more about the service guidelines which have a cut off date.
