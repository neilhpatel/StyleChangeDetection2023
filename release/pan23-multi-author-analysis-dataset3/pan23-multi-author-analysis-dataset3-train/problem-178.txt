Plead not guilty and ask for time to get your license and insurance in order. No insurance should be dismissed and you'll have a fine on the suspension if you straighten out your license and get insurance.
No, that would not get you out of consequences, because you were still driving with a suspended license at the time. Where jail time is at issue, you're going to want to have a lawyer. Repeatedly and intentionally breaking the law in the same way over and over isn't often met with leniency.
So you had a situation for driving uninsured, didn't pay it, got your license suspended, and then continued to drive uninsured and unlicensed? You need a lawyer. You are not going to be able to get yourself out of the massive hole you've dug.
That would have been the right thing to do when your license was first suspended, instead of just driving illegally. But you chose the latter, and doing this now isn't going to absolve you of that. Also, I'd be willing to bet your eligibility to have your license reinstated through that program will be impacted by your multiple driving infractions since having it suspended.
I can try to go through ‘Second Chance Drivers Program’ it’s where they reinstate your eligibility to have a license and put you on a payment plan for unpaid citations. Which is the reason my license was suspended.
