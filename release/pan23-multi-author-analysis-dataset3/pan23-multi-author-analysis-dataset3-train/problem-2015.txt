And yes Germany needs all sources right now, due to current situation I'm even temporarily pro-coal. And it makes me sad .
Are you sure about this number? I was checking Wikipedia and if you introduce biofuels (which is burning gas that you have to grow as well) it's on 44% now.
And biofuels are like 10% of that 8-10%.. Its mostly burning trash and generating gas from waste food production.
Germany produced 25% electricity with nuclear and renewables do like 55-60%. I wouldn't call it replacing but yeah shutting down good low co2 generators was not a good idea.
Leave the reactors that exists on, maybe reactive old ones if they are save and commercially viable but building new ones is too slow ( especially in Germany xD).. And new reactors need longer time. Germany wants to reduce 65% co2 from 1965 to 2030. If they start building reactors nothing will change until then ( in the electricity sector ofc). In that time period PV got 50% cheaper and maybe 1-3 percent more efficient and wind energy got 20% cheaper and more dense in energy and Germany would have 50% more renewables ( and that with the building rate of the former government which was horrible)...
