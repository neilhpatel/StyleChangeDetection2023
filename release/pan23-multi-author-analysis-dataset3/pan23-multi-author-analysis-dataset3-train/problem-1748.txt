Won't lie I'm looking forward to go to Turkey one day and get an actual kebab. Not in Istanbul or touristy area, somewhere in the middle of bum fuck nowhere. The halal places near me do a decent job and taste good, but you pay western prices for food that is still in some way tailored to a western audience.
To be honest if the world is in such a state that Ireland of all countries is being invaded then we have some much more serious problems to deal with lol.
The Troubles were not an invasion but an internal civil conflict, and strictly speaking happened in the UK rather than the Republic of Ireland (which was a major factor in said civil conflict).
Likewise for Ireland, which is why we were the only European country besides Switzerland to not take part in WWII. It is also why we have spent so much effort since independence on developing soft power around the globe - despite not being a NATO member, invading us would be an absolutely grave error unless you fancy your chances against a mix of UK, EU and US military forces.
That's what soft power can do for you. Those multinationals aren't just for an employment/low tax mutual benefit, though it stretches back long before them snd even before nato.
