No you can’t sue your employer for having to cooperate in an investigation just as you can’t sue your employer for making you get out of bed and go to work.
If you believe you are suspected of criminal activity then it’s best to seek a lawyer. Because if the company and law enforcement believes you to be a part of criminal activity, you’re going to be fired whether you cooperate or not.
If you saw your co-conspirator commit a crime against your employer that you would benefit from good idea to keep your mouth shut and get fired.
However in this case the boss's forcing you to talk to the police skews that calculation where talking to them is in your best interest. An attorney may or may not be warranted depending on the circumstance.
You need an employment attorney. If you’re part of a union, contact your union rep and say your employer wants to conduct a witness criminal investigation. You, being the witness, not the subject.
I would tell them you’re seeking representation, then go seek an attorney or your union rep. Hope that helps.
Now, according to labor laws, you only need reasonable notice, and the opportunity to secure a representative to be with you at the interview. This is minus whatever collective bargaining agreement there might be with them company.
