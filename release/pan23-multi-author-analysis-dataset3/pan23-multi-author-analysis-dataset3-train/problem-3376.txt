Why would anybody with a permanent seat ever support that? Hate how it works as much as you’d want, but the UN’s primary purpose is to provide a neutral space to engage in diplomacy, and more importantly try to get major powers to play along with it. If major powers can have their special status revoked by the UN simply starting a new UN Security Council, then major powers will simply leave altogether.
It's a precedent (one of two or three) for the UN unilaterally deciding successors so either the UN can shuffle the security council and therefore Russia was legitimately on it but can be legitimately removed, or the UN can't alter the security council in which case Russia is already not on it.
Perhaps the UN should give the USSR veto powers to all of its constituent nations - like if all ex-USSR nations unanimously agree to veto certain UN decision, then they can together exercise the USSR veto powers, otherwise the USSR is assumed to be abstain.
The UN has been allowing Russia to use the UN security council seat as if it was the USSR but there was never a formal vote on recognizing it as such.
Probably. But China also knows this and can therefor use it as leverage against both the west and Russia to extract concessions. As ultimately, China will decide whether Russia remains part of the security council, not Russia.
The only country on that list part of the security council is China. Which defaults back to my point that China is really the only deciding member on the council. China is not a Russian ally, it's on its own side. It votes against Russia as often as it votes with.
