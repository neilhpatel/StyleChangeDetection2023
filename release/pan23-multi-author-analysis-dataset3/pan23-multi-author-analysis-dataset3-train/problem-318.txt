And if you block in a car, you have to wait there until the tow truck comes, or else your car will have to be moved by the tow guy to get the offender out, and that's going to cost someone money--and where will they take/put your car?
The only reason to block a car in is if that car is trying to leave, and if they're trying to leave, then no tow is necessary. And if they ram into you trying to leave, that's likely a criminal act, maybe even one on your part, and that would be a matter for the police, not your landlord.
Despite the legality (or illegality) of doing so, blocking someone's vehicle in is a horrible idea, and your apartment/rental manager likely has zero legal authority to tell you it's ok to do so.
How is this "billing" thing going to work? How will the landlord know how much to bill for? Is the landlord the one that's going to be doing this billing? Are they going to bill the tenant, then... what, cut you a check? Hand you cash? Work with your insurance? Keep the money? What if the tenant refuses to pay? What if they're not even a tenant at all, and merely someone's unknown guest?
