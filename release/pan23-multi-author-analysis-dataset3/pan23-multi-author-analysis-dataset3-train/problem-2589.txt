I am a lawyer but I am not your/your aunt and uncle's lawyer. My post does not constitute legal advice or a consultation. I recommend you/your aunt and uncle consult a lawyer if there are questions.
I will tell my aunt and uncle to consult with a lawyer about everything you mentioned but Thank You so much! This information was so helpful and put my mind at ease. I do understand you aren't my lawyer or giving me advice but I found your answer helpful.
Does the bankruptcy notification letter count as them being listed as creditors? If not is there a way for them to check? The lawsuit judgment was included in the driver's bankruptcy forms as a debt they are looking to get rid of.
If the award was for death or injury caused by a drunk driver, the debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. OP's aunt and uncle can certainly contact the bankruptcy court and can follow the case, but if the lawsuit was for what I stated above the judgment will not go away even if the driver is declared bankrupt.
If the case is actually filed and your aunt/uncle are included as creditors, they will be notified. If they want to contest the bankruptcy, they should speak to an attorney.
