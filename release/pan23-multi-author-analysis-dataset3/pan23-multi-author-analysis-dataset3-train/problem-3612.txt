Your friend should turn the letter over to his insurance carrier ASAP and let them handle. This is literally the reason he pays for liability insurance--so he doesn't have to worry about whether the guy has a legit claim or not.
You've already gotten good general advice that your friend should present this demand letter to his insurer: legal defense against liability lawsuits is literally what he pays them for.
Your friend's first step is still the same: inform his insurer, send them a copy of the demand letter, and ask their advice about how to respond to it (they'll probably just take over handling the correspondence).
Your mild insult suggests that the plaintiff is using a personal injury attorney; that does make sense for a scooter vs. SUV collision, even one where the rider was able to limp away.
Once your friend's insurance company lets the attorney in on some of the details the scooter driver left out, I have a feeling the scooter's attorney is going to drop the case like a hot potato.
If the facts are as your friend is telling them, there is a non-zero chance the scooter driver isn't being completely forthcoming to the attorney. Attorneys typically only take these kinds of claims on a contingency basis and only if there is a very high likelihood of getting a substantial enough settlement to be worth the effort.
In any case, let the insurance company worry about it. Forward any correspondence and it will get resolved.
