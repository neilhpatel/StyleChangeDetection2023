Like, just because evil^3 is an order of magnitude away from evil^4, it isn't suddenly good. We need to make sure that when we're discussing relative evilness we don't start thinking that evil^2 is suddenly a new normal.
The idea that 9/11 and "terrorism" is at all a moral justification for the Patriot Act is bogus bordering on evil.
That's 0.0005% of times the Patriot Act was used over a 4 year period it was used for terrorism. If knives were used 99.9995% of the time to stab people, and 0.0005% of the time to make peanut butter sandwiches, you would not be able to say "The purpose of knives is to make peanut butter sandwiches." 0.0005% means "essentially never".
I mean, WTF. Why? Where's the connect between "Foreigners might try to damage our infrastructure" and "We should invade our own citizen's privacy.".
And? He’s broken a kajillion laws and nobody ever does ANYTHING about it, e.g. Merrick Garland. America’s oligarchs are untouchable. Us? Not so much. We are the easy, middle/lower class folks with targets on our backs.
