I say this as a fellow homeowner in Florida living under an HOA, their HOA bylaws are binding and it's pretty near impossible to win if they fine you, they dot their I's and cross there T's.
No - HOA contracts always have a "we reserve the right to amend" in there, my HOA has only been around for 5 months and has already recorded two amendments with the clerk of courts. They could literally allow you to plant a "PLANT A" today and record a bylaw amendment tomorrow that it's against the bylaws and send you a notice to cure, it would be completely within their scope to do so.
If you are in violation of your HOA rules they have the right to fine you and worse penalties. As far as the law is concerned, if you are doing this in public view even in your private car port, that is classified as plain view (look up plain view and plain view doctrines for legal definitions of "in plain view"), I would say you definitely are in HOA violation and potentially legal violation.
OP may be cited under the law if he is in view of the public, but the point I was trying to make was regardless of the law, he may be violating nuisance or smoking bylaws in his HOA contract.
Beyond that, I’d be concerned that your smoking in a carport may lead to you being cited under the law and paying an attorney to make your argument - if she agrees with it which I’m not sure will be the case.
You misunderstand the application of the law to your HOA. They don’t need to care if they have an on-point bylaw (or vote as a body to make one).
