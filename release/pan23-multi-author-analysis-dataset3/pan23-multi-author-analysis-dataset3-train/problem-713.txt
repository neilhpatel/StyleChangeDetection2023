The interpretation comes from two sections below, and the article from lawny.org linked to that says “A tenant who decides not to renew at the end of a fixed term lease need not give any notice.”.
Section 3: “Any agreement by a lessee or tenant of a dwelling waiving or modifying his rights as set forth in this section shall be absolutely void.”.
This is the case in most states, but in all of them, if the lease contains a clause requiring notice, then that is not negated by the lack of a local or state law. Both those links are helpful but they are interpretations, the actual statutory language needs to be reviewed. Neither of the links seem to address a lease clause.
Regardless, if they are claiming something that isn't accurate, why haven't you sued yet? None of that may matter. It may be cheapest and easiest to file in SCC for $10,000 (or sue for more and get $10,000 max) but you can sit down with an attorney first. The simplest way to view this is that (a) you didn't violate anything, and (b) they are making a bogus claim to keep your money. Judges deal with this crap from landlords every single day, they don't get bamboozled.
