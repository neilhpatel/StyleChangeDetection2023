To be honest, no I DO NOT want to work for them full time as an employee. Also as hourly, I don’t wanna to have set minimum hours. I want to be able to pick certain things which I had responsibility for and I do well and do only those things or nothing at all.
With regards to the accrued leave, I currently have like a month and a half of vacation days. It’s a lot of money. However, they are claiming now that I should only get about half of that since when my wife and I got sick with COVID they didn’t use any of my vacation days and I was out for like 3 weeks. I don’t think those count as vacation though, do they?
No, they can’t take away earned vacations days because you were out. It would be different if they paid you for those days, but they can’t retroactively say “well, you were out without pay, so we’re taking your accrued vacation days away.”.
If you are determined to stay with this employer (which I wouldn’t suggest), you need to set clear expectations and please, please, just ensure you get the paid vacation you are due.
NAL but I am HR. This will not work out in your favor. DO NOT let them take any of your accrued leave. Those are hours you have earned. Your agreement states that they are to be paid out upon leaving employment, so you’d be foolish to let any amount of them go.
