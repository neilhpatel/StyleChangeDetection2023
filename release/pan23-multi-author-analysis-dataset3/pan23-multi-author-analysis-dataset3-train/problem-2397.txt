First and foremost, as always needs to be noted, we don't have any pagan sources from Ireland/the UK. Everything is written post-conversion. Our understanding of "druids" as pagan religious leaders comes from classical descriptions of continental Celtic society (and Tacitus' depiction of Britain) and not from any native sources.
It is absolutely possible that they were indeed religious leaders who were scrubbed of their pagan aspects by Christian writers, but we don't have any records of druidic or pagan belief, so it's difficult to say whether or not these characters were indeed a pagan inheritance or whether or not they were something else entirely.
However, the 'religious' angle does appear in some sources, such as Lucan and Tacitus who both present the druidae as religious-political leaders at the head of dangerous cults opposing Rome, though we lack evidence that either had any personal contact with such individuals and appear to be writing from a political perspective. Pliny the Elder makes it quite clear that druidae are not religious figures, making a clear distinction in his work between druidae and sacerdotes (priests) in his discussions, which are the sources for the popular images of druids with sickles and mistletoe come from.
So, that is all to say, 'druids' could be a lot of things if (and when The dru√≠d in 9th century Ireland might not have been pagans) that are not necessarily directly religious. But, ultimately, deducing exactly what they are, and at what point in time they might change function, we just will never know. (But, keep your fingers crossed we find a complete version of Posidonius' work and we'll see what we can do).
