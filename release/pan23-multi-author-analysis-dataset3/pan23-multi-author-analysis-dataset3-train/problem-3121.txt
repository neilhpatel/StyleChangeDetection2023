My suggestion is that you paying the mortgage on a house that she owns and paying for her car after the divorce is not a good idea. The goal should be to separate yourselves financially except for child support and alimony. Co-owning assets or being obligated financially on each otherâ€™s assets after divorce is likely to cause problems.
Seems to me that you were setting her up to fail. How is it that she has such terrible credit and you have the ability to carry this mortgage when the two of you have been married and managed to pay off your house in full together? A better plan might be to sell the current house, have her buy some thing she can buy in cash with her half and you do the same. It sounds to me like she canâ€™t afford the current house you are in by herself.
The house isn't worth a ton. Like $100,000 and yes I do have assets from before we were a couple. I've spoken to a couple of lawyers through an efap option and they suggest getting it drawn up by a lawyer. However she's stated she wants no lawyers involved short of the property transfer and mortgage/auto loans being written up ðŸ¤·. We're in Ontario and Common-Law so the first 31 items of the Divorce Act don't apply to us.
I don't know how to get a lawyer involved and keep everything civil is my issue. If I could, I would have already.
Sorry I meant I'll carry the mortgage and auto loan for her instead of a bank (Terrible Credit). She will make the payments to me from her child support and UCCB, and job if she ever gets one.
I sold my house from before we met for a large amount of money and we moved to an area where houses are a fraction of the price. I bought the house with the proceeds and put her name on it with me. She can easily afford the current house with child support, uccb and a part time job. She'll be netting more than I will be technically.
