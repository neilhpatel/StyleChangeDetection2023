No, no,no,no... if you can't get him to sit the election out or vote D, you should he doing everything in your power to keep him on the Trump train. Trump os ineffective. DeSantis is Trump with the brains to actually do real fascism.
What's your point? DeSantis has no shame either, but enough of an air of respectability to him that Republicans that couldn't stomach voting for Trump twice, might vote for him in a general. Let Trump be the republican front runner, let him lose a popular vote for a third time and the EC for a second, and if he actually does win, then realize that he's a less harmful form of cancer for this nation than DeSantis.
The only shot they have is if they somehow get Trump to both step aside for Desantis and not run 3rd party (good fucking luck and even then much of his base will feel betrayed), or get DeSantis to step aside in favor of Trump and wait for 2028 (but Trump lost 2020 and isn't likely to do much better in 24).
A significant enough fraction of Trump's base will stay home if he's not on the ticket. If they put him on the ticket, moderates will flock to Biden. You can't run two extremists and hope to win.
The ones who need to "get in line" if they want to win are the GOP. If they think they're going to beat Biden, they'd better find a way to make either Trump or DeSantis go away, because running both of them on one ticket is too extreme.
“Trump made me vote for Biden, even though I didn’t want to, but when a demonstrably worse candidate comes along who’s pushing actual dictatorship moves in Florida, we’ll I’m just gonna stay home because Biden doesn’t excite me”.
