There’s literally nothing Trump can say or do that will change the opinion of his supporters. They’ll always find an excuse for him, even when he calls to ignore the Constitution which they claim to love.
Exactly. I was hoping telling him about the situation without mentioning Trump would help him realize how insane it was. He realized it was insane, then immediately excused it after he found out Trump said it.
I told my Dad (a Trump supporter) that someone claimed the Twitter story meant Trump should be reinstated regardless of the rules in the Constitution. He called that person an idiot. Then, I revealed that Trump is the one that claimed that and sent him a screenshot of the post. He immediately said that it doesn’t seem true and someone else must have posted from his account.
I’m hoping it doesn’t get to that point, since my Dad is capable of not discussing politics, but I hate watching him act like an idiot and bend over backwards to praise Trump and other Republicans.
My family can go on tirades about any Democrat under the sun for even the most trivial things—they were big on ranting about the "disrespect" of Obama's tan suit or using dijon mustard when I was growing up, for instance—but no matter what Trump does or says, the biggest reaction I've ever gotten is a chuckle and, "He's something else!".
Yep. They don't want to find your information for you because they know they will only find information telling them they are wrong. They just hope you take whatever they tell you as truth.
