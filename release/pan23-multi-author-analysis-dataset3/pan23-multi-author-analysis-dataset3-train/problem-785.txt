The Constitution says, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.".
I guess. I am use to working within the constraints of the zoning ordinance but this one just seems pretty wild. I always thought the city was required per the 5th ammendment to compensate people for "taking" land which is litterally what they are doing.
It was designed using the CURRENT setbacks listed in the zoning ordinance. The setback did not change. No rules changed. We used CURRENT plats and CURRENT surveys. We are using current zoning code. Front yard setback was 30' and remains 30'. The only thing that moved is the front property line. This is not an increase in the setback. This is the city saying they want to widen the street someday in the future but instead of compensating property owners they want it given as a requirement to develop the land.
They said per the zoning ordinance it was a requirement to develop land on that property since there is a FUTURE master plan for widening the road IN THE FUTURE.
That future master plan, if it's referred in a current zoning ordinance, is the current law. It doesn't matter that the city is not using the 10 feet today. They passed a rule saying they intend to and that's what you need to follow.
