I don't quite understand how this is a "basic fact" question. Is it possible that the mod team misread the question? I was not asking for evidence on whether lesbianism was outlawed during Victoria. Instead, I was asking for evidence for the claim that the reason for not outlawing lesbianism was, as claimed in the source, that a ban would draw women's "attention" to the possibility of female homosexuality. This seems as a highly non-trivial question to me, and I could not find the evidence myself despite a considerable google search. On the other hand, the claim was raised by a highly respected academic, so I supsect this might be a hypothesis supported by some evidence or shared among the scholarly community. I would appreciate if you could help me in phrasing the question in a non-basic manner, since I am quite thoroughly confused on what a non-basic question would constitute.
Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a simple question about basic facts, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. If you need some pointers, the mod team is always happy to assist if you , but also be sure to check out this .
Finally, donâ€™t forget that there's many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).
I didn't say that it was a trivial question, or one that you should personally be able to answer with a google search - it's just one that's not asking for a substantial answer, the way that a question more generally on Victorian attitudes toward f/f relationships would be. This is a problem because it means that we'll likely have to remove any answers that tell you what you're looking for! If you simply repost the question in the linked SASQ thread, then it'll be fine.
