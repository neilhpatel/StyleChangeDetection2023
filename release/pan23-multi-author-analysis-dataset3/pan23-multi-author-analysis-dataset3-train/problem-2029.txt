Firstly in defining Fascism you're not alone, there is a lot of debate amongst historians and political philosophers over what Fascism is. Roger Griffin in attempting to define Fascism came up with the "Fascist minimum" because fascist regimes are divergent instead of listing all their qualities he saught to list the shared factors between them, and the minimum qualities a regime would need to be considered fascist concluding a "palingenetic form of populist.
ultranationalism." Palingenetic means cultural rejuvenation or rebirth. Now that is also disputed. Dutt argued "The whole outlook and ideology of Fascism is in short nothing but a ragbag of borrowings from every source to cover the realities and practice of modern monopolist capitalism in the period of crisis and of extreme class-war. There is not a single creative idea." and Umberto Eco who saught to define fascism referred to it as "fuzzy totalitarianism".
With this disclaimer out of the way, let's get to the fourteen points that define Eco's 'Ur-Fascism':
Tie-in question: Every time Fascism comes up, people always link Eco's "ur-Fascism" like it's this authoritative definition. How well regarded is it amongst historians, if that's an at all meaningful question.
