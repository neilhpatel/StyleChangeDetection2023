Not a lawyer, but I’m also someone who has moved around a lot and has lost documents in the past. The processes of getting everything set up can be so frustrating and the government offices that handle this stuff can be so frustrating. Try not to get discouraged. You need to find or request a certified copy of your social security card. A lot of jobs will want this and it’s another way to prove your identity as you continue to establish yourself. Do you have a drivers license or other government issued photo id? This is an absolute must, preferably before you leave Virginia. You will need it to get a job. If you don’t have one, it would be a pretty easy and non-suspicious way to convince your parents you need your social security card and birth certificate to get that.
Another thing, Sometimes proving residency in a new state can be quite difficult. In some states, junk Mail and subscriptions don’t work. They want a bill for a service attached to the address where you’re living. One thing that worked for me was buying a cheap landline policy and then immediately canceling it after I got my first bill in the mail. Another suggestion is once you get there, ask your friend if they can add your name to their WiFi or utilities for one pay period so you can show it as being in your name. A bank statement also works. Just make sure you check and look at how many proofs of residency Colorado needs and what they consider appropriate documents.
However, if you are seeking to legally change your name as mentioned in another comment thread, make sure to check out the process and fees related in the state of Colorado via.
If you know someone at that address already, consider signing up for some junk mail addressed to you at that address, like a magazine subscription or look book for a clothing company. That way you will already be receiving mail proving your residency which might help make the process of switching things over a little easier.
