That is what many of us don't realize -- putin will not be replaced by a peaceful democracy. We are also fighting the next few totalitarian dictators to come after him right now. All of Russia needs to learn to keep their pathetic shit within their own borders moving forward.
A lot of western corporate money will go to a more stable Ukraine, once it is rebuilt and fortified its borders, rather than risk this craziness that Russia is intent on causing.
The primary existential threat to the Kremlin is a bunch of Russians looking at an increasingly Western-aligned and prosperous Ukraine, decade after decade, and starting to wonder why things are so much better just across the border.
Never mind the cognitive dissonance that Russia is explicitly targeting Ukrainian civilians and that western "expansionism" is just their neighbors turning to the West because they don't want to be invaded by Russia.
plus I think that is what the world needs, if Russia is pushed back to what they negotiated in the first place it sends a strong message that the power of the pen is mightier than the sword, that nations will respect diplomacy but have no respect for military adventurism.
Russia's state propaganda is crazy and they have that kind of ability, it would just take a little time to massage the public memory and scrub old articles and they could easily redefine why they were going to war in such a way that they can confidently declare they won while withdrawing troops.
