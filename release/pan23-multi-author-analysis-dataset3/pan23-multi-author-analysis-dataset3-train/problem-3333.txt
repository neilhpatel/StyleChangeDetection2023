Are you an American living in Venezuela? It's difficult to believe any Venezuelan who knows their history would say something so wrong. Its not a secret that the US funded this coup just like it's no secret they funded the coup in '48. Do you know where Jiminez fled to safety when actual Venezuelans threw him out and restored democracy? The last American president openly put a price on Maduro's head and everyone knows about the USAID jackpot that awaited Guaido. Even if you pretend the multiple coups never happened, you can't escape the fact that the US was all too happy to be Chavez and Maduros most important trade partners-- whether it was toppling Venezuelas govts or supporting their dictators, the US has always been involved in Venezuela and you embarrass yourself saying otherwise.
Angarita was a populist, Jimenez was a dictatorship and got coup'd too, funny how you say USA weren't involved then but "actual Venezuelans" when the governments after him were really close with them.
Everything you mentioned is fairly recent. USA was never involved against Chávez, or even Maduro until sanctions.
Gotta lift the US sanctions against Venezuela & Cuba. No brainer call. Either they aren’t doing anything to damage those economies so lifting them would have no effect (not the case) or they are indeed damaging those economies & lifting them would ease the suffering of the people just trying to live their lives (the case). If someone is so confident that those economies would fail even without the sanctions then lift them & prove it.
