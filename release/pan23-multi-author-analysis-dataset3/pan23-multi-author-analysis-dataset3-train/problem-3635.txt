You can both work on drafting the agreement but will need to have the document reviewed separately by your own attorneys to ensure it meets all legal requirements.
Premarital agreements can be helpful in many ways. It provides financial transparency from the start; protects both parties in case of divorce; could be a guide to financial management, roles, responsibilities and expectations during the marriage.
Prenups are primarily about divorce, and deal with identifying and separating assets, and in some cases providing alternatives if spousal support would otherwise be appropriate.
A DIY prenup is not a prenup. If you don't each have a lawyer, you should assume your agreement relies entirely on good intentions and cooperation.
Without a prenup, assets held before your marriage and kept separate from your marriage, income during marriage, and any other marital assets can remain separate assets. It's dicey, though. Anything you commingle with marital assets will usually be treated as a marital asset entirely. Note that some things that might not seem like marital assets are - income from your job accrued during your marriage, for example, is a marital asset in most cases, and using it to buy more bitcoins that you then mix with your other bitcoins can turn that whole asset into a marital one.
With a prenup, the prenup will generally govern unless it's unconscionable or fails a number of other legal tests.
