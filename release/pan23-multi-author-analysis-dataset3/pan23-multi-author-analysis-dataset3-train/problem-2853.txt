Alexander's army reached the Hyphasis in 326. The army wasn't a static group of people; reinforcements were recruited several times during the campaign, both from the territories being conquered and from Greece. People were also left behind and sent home: all of the Greek soldiers sent by the League of Corinth were released following the death of Darius III (though many chose to stay on), and the cities and garrisons being founded along the way were being populated in part by wounded or old soldiers.
So the refusal to go onwards was probably an accumulation of fear and the kind of existential fatigue that anyone would have after being on the road for nearly a decade, not a response to some single factor that was more terrifying than anything they'd seen before. (What they should have been terrified of, of course, was dying en masse in the Gedrosian desert on the way home, but they didn't know that at the time!).
