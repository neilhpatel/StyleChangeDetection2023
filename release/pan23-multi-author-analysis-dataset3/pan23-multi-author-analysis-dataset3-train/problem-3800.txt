It's a common problem across world politics from what I'm seeing. It seems that people have accepted FUD and character attacks as being acceptable politics now and one party had embraced that. It's easy to look like a better option when you don't actually come up with solutions and instead just bash the other side. But they aren't actually making anything better because they aren't actually creating any solutions to the problems.
I mean, if she said it, it is probably true. I've never seen anything from her that doesn't seem genuine. But I'm also not a kiwi and haven't really been paying that close attention to NZ.
NZ is a relative backwater in the middle of nowhere (relative to the West), that's why NZ issues barely make news in the West. The only reason we hear about NZ news is because we share a common language, otherwise it gets dumped into the ignore category/major news only like we have for Japan/China/India.
That said, if you think it is bad in the Netherlands, it's worse in NZ. I know everywhere has issues thanks to a decade of historically low interest rates and an unwillingness to build, but at least the houses you can't afford in the Netherlands are high quality whereas in NZ you are paying even more for damp houses that are falling apart.
It’s indisputable that our housing quality (for a supposedly wealthy country) is very poor, and looking at different metrics of housing affordability compared to other counties we’re paying much more (as vulcanstrike said, relative to our incomes).
