How’s it irrational when 50% of elected offices trade Secutities that breaks their policies and puts them in conflicts of interest? They perform insider trading all of the time. Either ethics and integrity matter or they don’t. Right now they are all in collusion as they keep the two sides divided and no one watches them and if they do watch them they call it partisan. Jokes on us tax payers.
See if people act exactly the same way they should be called out. That’s why we have such shitty representatives. One side calls out the other when they act unethically but doesn’t police their own. The thing about liars is that they aren’t truthful people and we shouldn’t trust them. We will continue to get the government that we deserve when we do this, a shitty one.
We'll continue to get the government people can't be bothered to vote for. 27% of the youth showed up this midterm. With everything on the line, just 1 in 4. And it's being celebrated as a near record turnout FFS. Don't talk to me about the politicians. Talk to those who don't care enough to do the one thing that matters: vote.
Nah the problem is the electorate. Everyone hates Ted in Texas but he still gets elected. Andrew Jackson could run and they still would re-elect Ted. No excuse.
