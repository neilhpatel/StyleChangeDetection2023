It doesnâ€™t, but keep in mind there are also other factions within Sweden who, for various reasons, do not want Sweden to join NATO, so they are egging this behaviour on as well.
I don't know what the Swedish government should do, but I know what it must do if it wants to get NATO membership. It needs to show Erdogan face. A lot of face. That's his price.
Governments can be endlessly creative in finding ways to get around these issues, and they do so regularly even in the most "democratic" countries when it suits them.
Another is this: Ukraine's sad fate has shown that Western nations will not risk their soldiers' lives for another country if they don't need to do so. If Russia invades Sweden, you cannot count on very much direct help, especially from the US.
Sweden is protected by both the EU defense treaty as well as other non-EU countries like Norway, UK and the US who have pledged to directly intervene if Sweden is attacked.
The real reason Sweden has felt protected for the past 200 years and been able to play the whole "Swedish neutrality" card, is because Finland acts as a buffer against Sweden.
