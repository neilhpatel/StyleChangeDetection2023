Realize the Black population is something like 12-13%. Then realize the killed-by-cops stat means Black Americans are 2x as likely to be killed by cops as say, a white person.
Many will dismiss this by arguing Black people have higher rates of interaction with police because they commit more crime. Prosecution statistics are cited as proof of higher criminality rates. However prosecution/imprisonment rates don't reflect what percentage of crime is committed. Rather it only reflects the percentage solved.
The clearance rate for crime is an average below 50% across the board. Even murder only has a 54% clearance rate.
So the fact a higher rate of Black people are prosecuted for crime isn't evidence that Black people commit more crime. In truth most crime goes unsolved. Rather I think it could be argued that Black people are simply more heavily policed because of stereotypes. As a result of being more heavily policed Blacks are more likely to be prosecuted and or killed by police.
Also more likely to be victims and perpetrators of homicide crimes not related to police. Though police reforms are needed, it's far more complex than people like to believe. Don't have answers, just an observation.
