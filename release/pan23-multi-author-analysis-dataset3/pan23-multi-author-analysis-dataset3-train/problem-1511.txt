The debt ceiling is a dumb idea to start with, which is why nobody else has to even debate this, but a $1tr coin is literally just a way of circumventing congress on a loophole to print money to circumvent congress. Printing money has consequences, even if you just use it to pay off debts directly. It also requires the federal reserve, an independent institution, to not spend the $1tr you give them to pay off the debt. There's no way of forcing them to stick it in a box in the treasury forever, it's their money once you've paid. They can do whatever they want with it.
Taxes. The answer is taxes. Also, raising the debt limit doesn't make more debt. It allows for more deficit spending by the government, which increases the debt. You invest that money in the economy, increasing inflation but also creating growth. If you get more growth than inflation, congratulations, you aren't destroying your economy! You then tax that growing economy, and use the taxes to pay back the debt.
How do you think they are going to pay off the debt if they raise the debt limit other than by printing money?
So... Print money to pay off your national debt? What a great idea, I wonder why nobody has tried that before...
