California will only register people under . Someone who was not convicted in California is not required to register in California. (Edit: See below. Thanks to /u/usuallysunny for catching me on this.).
If you believe your grandfather may be in violation of California law, file a police report. Ditto if you believe he may be in violation of New Mexico law, though you'd report it to the NM police. That's all you can do.
Sex offender registration did not begin in New Mexico until 1995, so it's entirely possible your grandfather is not required to register in NM, either, or required by NM law to update registration when he moves. If your understanding is accurate, he was convicted and paid his debt to society a full decade before NM started tracking sex offenders post-release.
Sex offender registration is only required if he was convicted of a specified crime, not just someone believes it's appropriate. But if you have any evidence at all that he is legally required to register, feel free to file a police report.
California also has no blanket sex offender residency restrictions, and a prosecutor would have a hard time convincing a judge that someone who hasn't reoffended in 35 years is such a danger that they should be required to move.
I think I would ask myself, if this were me, why I was so obsessed about this? Whatever time he had to serve, he served. The registry is not something that solves every problem (and many would argue it creates more than it solves).
