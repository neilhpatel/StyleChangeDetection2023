Thank you This is an absolutely excellent answer You've really gone above and beyond to give a detailed account Absolutely fantastic.
Either way you've thoroughly patched up a big gap in my understanding of pre-colonial history. If only the Wikipedia article was half this informative..
One follow up question: is there archeological evidence of any larger scale trading infrastructure, like a large trading port or town? Or was the acquiring of spices at the Moluccas and Bandas done directly at the farms or in smaller villages?
Naturally, there were also traders who travelled to Spice Islands, hoping to buy spices direct from the source. In this, Banda held a significant advantage over the Moluccas, as the seasonal winds made the journey to the Moluccas much longer than the journey to Banda.
But to visit the Moluccas after Banda, they would have to complete the loading of their ships in Banda by May, while the winds still allowed them to sail north to the Moluccas. By the time they finished loading in the Moluccas, the northeast monsoon would have started, so they were stuck there until January when the winds changed and they could sail back to Malacca. The entire trip would thus take a year, much of which was simply spent laying over.
