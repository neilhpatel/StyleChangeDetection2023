They'd also crucify Jesus all over again because of his socialist ideals like "From each according to their ability to each according to their need" and "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven".
Let's completely ignore that the US isn't in the top 10 personal income taxes in the world. By a wide margin.
This is still easily disprovably as false with disingenuous identification of "income tax" indepenet of, say, "wealth tax" which is common in Europe. And other taxes that are common outside of the US oligarchy.
Very high tax rates are not about collecting money from the rich for the government. They are about stopping the rich from taking all the money that is generated. A 90% tax on upper incomes means that people will stop chasing (or taking) upper incomes.
Business owners think in post-tax dollars. Lowering the tax rate makes business owners greedier because it increases the post-tax dollars. Raising it makes them more willing to spend on expenses because it lowers the value of a pre-tax dollar. If the tax rate is 10%, then each dollar in profit is worth 90 cents; if it is 90%, then each dollar in profit is worth 10 cents.
