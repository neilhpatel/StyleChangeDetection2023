What’s not being said is some of the growing opposition will probably get funded by ex-Trump aide Stephen Miller’s legal offense funds; that little instigator being from Santa Monica .. so you know California progressives are in his crosshairs. He’s actually had success in crying reverse discrimination, so I wouldn’t poopoo this movement entirely.
As the article states, actually seceding would have slim to no chance (with slim just leaving town as the old saying goes), but being San Berdoo which is pretty mixed (and not, say, Shasta county), think this is some significant local opposition to the more progressive leanings of the California legislature.
> The November elections saw Californians continue to embrace progressive leadership, but voters in one of the state’s most populous counties are so frustrated with this political direction that they voted to consider seceding and forming their own state.
In case anyone's confused, a specific county is considering seceding from California to form its own new state, not seceding all of California from the USA.
