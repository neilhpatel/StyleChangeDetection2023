I’ve long since run out of the three hundred pencils I bought for this year. Now I walk the halls picking them up and so my students will have some tomorrow.
I have to be quick in my walks after school because I am one of two teachers who run the 3-5 PM after school program for students who have been suspended or, for lack of a better term, expelled. (They are really waiting for a space to open in a specialized school that can more meet their mental health and education needs and they are either a danger to themselves/other students or their needs can be fully met and they are harming not just their education but the educational opportunities of their classroom peers.).
Right. I’m also not trying to advocate for those people to make less. They do a hard job and deserve that pay, but teachers also deserve to make decent pay.
We need higher pay but we also need teachers unions that work with parents and administration to make sure we have good teachers. I live in NYC and have three kids and have been heavily involved in PTA stuff for multiple years. What I've observed is that because the teachers union has a hard time fighting for higher pay, they grab power in every other way they can. Principals can't manage schools because every little thing is controlled by the teachers union.
The problem is that it’s impossible to imagine teachers getting paid more without union bosses and administrators getting paid more.
Stop knocking on tax payers doors for money when you can tell a superintendent their salary is grossly disproportionate and needs to be adjusted, and do so accordingly.
The education system can solve this problem on their own with wage redistribution, the issue is that those people don’t really care about their coworkers, they need their 6figure bonuses.
