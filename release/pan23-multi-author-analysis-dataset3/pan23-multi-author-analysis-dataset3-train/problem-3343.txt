2. continuances or delays in trial due to the court, defense attorney, and prosecutor is common. unless there is some kind of statutory limit to bring a case to trial that is being met, there is no problem with the delay. a court may also deny a continuance if they believe there is no justification for it. this is not bias either.
What legal advice are you seeking in this scenario? Are you asking whether or not there could be an issue with bias because of the judge?
You generally cannot claim a judge is biased simply because they've ruled against you. That doesn't mean the judge isn't biased, it's just not considered good cause.
Moving trial dates because the prosecutor has personal conflicts is not uncommon. The judge would likely do the same for the defense. The only right implicated would be the defendant’s right to a speedy trial, but presumably that isn’t an issue.
The first trial, as far as I understand, was not deemed a harmless error by the state Supreme Court.
They’re considering moving moving the trial date for his personal conflict but they wouldn’t budge on the second trial date after the first was a mistrial. His first attorney had to withdraw due to health related issues and her associate took the case on top of her own and asked for the date to be moved because she had less than two weeks to familiarize herself with the case. That trial ended in a conviction that was overturned.
