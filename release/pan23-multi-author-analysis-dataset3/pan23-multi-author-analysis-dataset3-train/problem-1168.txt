I'm actually not exactly sure what you were trying to say , because you seemed to criticize a book called "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" for over-romantizing the era, and dislike mass media productions for over-glorifying.
Perhaps that is because they are all trying to appeal to the public as a form of entertainment rather than trying to be historically accurate?
The book is a 'Romance', stated explicitly in the title, you would expect it to be rather romantized compared to actual history. This book was also largely inspired by passed-down folklores and (made by storytellers on the streets entertaining others). It is really of no surprise that it is not the best at accuracy, or rather over-romantized ----- Nobody would be entertained and remember these stories if they are all about horrendous deaths and tragedies of war.
I think it is important to highlight, in any romanticised era, the darker truth but I don't think exaggerations like total genocide or worse than anything in WW2 helps do that. Such terms should be used with care to not cheapen the word or the suffering of those who went through it. I don't know enough about the entire history of China and its many civil wars to know if this was one of the darkest periods in their history.
