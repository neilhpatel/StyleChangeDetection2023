But again, you look at Cuban voters who are more conservative and contrast this with the effort the democratic party puts into other Latinos, or even other races entirely.
Even though Florida Democrats haven't done a great job in recent history, this isn't a Hispanic voter problem, this is a specifically Cuban phenomenon.
Not really an option on the FRS plans that this legislation is meant to target. You have a limited amount of choices to pick from. This is targeting all Florida government employees and removing Blackrock, the company that currently offers the cheapest and best options on FRS.
I just checked out of curiosity. There are 10 options, 5 of which Blackrock helps to manage in all or part. There is a self directed option, but the fees and requirements on that make it an unrealistic option compared to any other online broker. So this will be interesting.
Funny thing. An examination of ESG investment opportunities found little evidence of planetary good happening, versus traditional investments.
