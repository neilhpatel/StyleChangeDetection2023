Outside of some time spent this part isn’t that bad. You make some phone calls and some appointments. Sounds like for you the important thing is you want to look for someone who provides free to low cost consults (initial discussion about your case) and if they’ll work on contingency.
That's not what the user said. You can possibly find a private attorney who will take your case and if you win, they might be able to get their fees from your employer.
You should be, as noted by u/moneyman80, looking for a private law firm that might be interested in representing you.
As noted by u/reddituser1211, trying to litigate a discrimination claim on your own is challenging and unlikely to be successful. That said, there are cost shifting provisions in Title VII that will apply to many successful lawsuits. As such you may be able to find an attorney who is willing to take the case on contingency given the fee shifting provisions. You should reach out to your state bar association to see if they have a referral service.
