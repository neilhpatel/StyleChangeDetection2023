Reddit would either need to stop allowing user submitted content (which would kill Reddit) or stop moderating completely. All the spammers, scammers, off topic posters, porn posters, hate speech posters, etc would have free reign. Go to the "Aww" subreddit to see G rated photos of puppies and kitties? Well the "kittie" you just saw wasn't a pet cat and definitely wasn't G rated. Go to the "LEGO" subreddit to talk about brick building? Sorry, you need to wade through posts about herbal Viagra, links to phishing scams, and people posting about random stuff they did today that don't involve LEGO. (Also, more of those "kittie" photos because they would be everywhere.).
2. Reddit find a way to protect themselves, leaving moderators open to legal action, this wouldn't effect non-American moderators.
I believe Reddit asked the US Supreme Court for the right to provide anonymous Mod contributions, because the platform was concerned that Mods might be unwilling to step out from behind the online veil, especially on such a high-stakes issue.
Reddit asked Mods to offer submissions to the Supreme Court, not as experts in regulation of social media, but instead, as people who could speak to the practical implications of Section 230, based on our experiences moderating content at this platform.
for Reddit's discussion thread on what Section 230 means for Redditors, how the platform developed its amicus curiae brief to the US Supreme Court, and what is at stake in next month's hearing.
Because Reddit listed our usernames in the amicus curiae brief, the judges, clerks, and lawyers are able to review our moderation histories and draw conclusions about the nature, extent, and value of our experience. That, in turn, enables them to argue and decide how much weight (if any) the Supreme Court should attribute to our expressed views.
