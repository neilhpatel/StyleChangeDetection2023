If you’re under 18 you are probably legally required to be enrolled in school. You need to find a way to contact CPS or have someone do it on your behalf. Your parents keeping you from school is probably considered neglect.
Even if you’re remote learning, let a teacher or counselor know your situation. They are mandatory reporters. Your school’s counseling office might also have additional resources for you.
Even if you contact someone from the last school you attended or the school you should attend (the one of which you are in enrollment area for), they should be able to help you. Just reminding you that there are some free options where you can get help and aid/advice. Best of luck.
If you attend school, even remotely, please reach out to a teacher or adult that you know. Teachers are mandated reporters and should be able to connect you with someone at your school that you may be able to speak with anonymously and refer you to some resources. Be advised that there are some things that can't remain anonymous, such as a report of injury, abuse, or unsafe conditions.
