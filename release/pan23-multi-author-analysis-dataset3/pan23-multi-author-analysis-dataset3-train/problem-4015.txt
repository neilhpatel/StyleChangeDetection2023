Yeah, the wording like in most cases can be left for interpretation. As for your previous comment, I think the "electors" they are referring to are those of the electoral college given the context of the sentence its in. Though they should lose voting privileges but if I'm not mistaken, that's almost always left up to state.
"No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.".
I mean. From my point of view they should all legitimately be in jail but if asking them not to become our leaders of the best we got I might as well just leave.
