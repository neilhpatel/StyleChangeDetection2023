When he rents to you, he rents the house and the yard, unless the lease says otherwise. Legally he has no right to do anything in the yard until the end of the applicable lease period. If there is no lease, however, you have the right to move out and he has the right to end the rental agreement on whatever your state requires as to time for notice.
But, it’s possible that your lease says something like, this lease refers to the house at this address only, landlord reserves the right to use yard, driveway as he sees fit. That is a possibility, and would not be favorable to you. The housing board can help you figure out what the actual language in your lease means.
If the lease shows that the landlord does have the right to put a unit there, then he’ll build one and there will be more housing, cool.
If the lease shows that he cannot, but you and your housemates want to help enable more housing for folks, you can work with the landlord to modify your lease, or sign a new lease if the terms are favorable to you, where he gets to build a new structure and you could potentially get a rent reduction for “decrease in services,” since you don’t have that nice big yard anymore. So new folks get some housing, you guys save some money on rent.
Where in California? You don’t have to say specifically, but if it’s in LA or the Bay Area there may be additional rent control protections that keep him from modifying your lease, even if the original term has expired, and you’ve gone month to month. Seriously- reach out to your local housing authority or rent board, they are soooo helpful with this stuff. Good luck.
