Which could also be the reason why they haven't been shot down previously. They could've argued that showing China their response time was more valuable information than whatever intel the balloon might gather if left alone.
Edit to add: and not responding shows that China could try to disguise an attack as yet another balloon that doesn't require a response. So whatever you do, you're giving them some info.
Or just make them believe that our radar couldn't detect them in the first place. Then china believe an aircraft with that radar cross section is stealth, even though actually they can be tracked easily.
To spot aircraft, the radar system has to filter out all the noise from those other things. Which is why it's understandable how these balloons might not have been spotted before.
These balloons commonly fly at 100k+ feet, which is where the 3-bus-sized monster should have been, I would guess.
The balloon last week was enormous, visible from the ground, and from planes, with the naked eye. It's not likely it'd have made it the whole way across North America with nobody noticing.
