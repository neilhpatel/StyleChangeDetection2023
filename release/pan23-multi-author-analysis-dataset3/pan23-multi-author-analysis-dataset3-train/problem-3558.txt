Edit: nothing in the contract about credit card processing fees. Just sums we may owe can be taken out of our security deposit before it is returned. The venue is treating the fee as a sum that we owed.
I'm ok if they charge the fee, but shouldn't we as the consumer be notified at the time of payment that the fee would be assessed? Also, shouldn't the fee itself be part of the credit card charge?
Since Michigan has no laws regarding passing on credit card fees, you are better off just asking the business why they did it this way.
Starting in 2013, merchants in Michigan could charge customers extra if they use a credit card. ... Although surcharging is now permitted by credit card merchant contracts, retailers must continue to abide by state laws that prohibit or restrict credit card surcharges. Michigan does not have any such law.
Live in Michigan. The processing fee was taken out of our security deposit that we just received back today. We didn't know there would be a 3% fee until we were told that is why we didn't get the full security deposit back. No other reason for not receiving the full deposit back.
