Bigly represented by Faux Nooz whining about inflation and breakdowns in the aviation industry and dropping it directly in the laps of Democrats without any mention of 4 years of the lazy and incompetent Former Guy (who himself used multiple declarations of "Infrastructure Week" to cover up his regime's shady behavior), the garbage Republicon congresses he had, and the current Republican House's fascination with all things revenge.
Perfect example...giving away that they know right from wrong, but defiantly refusing to do the right thing--with a dose of defending one of the worst in their ranks thrown in.
Sounds a lot like their approach to domestic terrorism! Guess activated fascist clans and MAGA-allied hordes don't exist if you simply order everyone to not look.
It’s not like they’ve been subtle about wanting to become a fascist regime. And people who decide they don’t want to vote because democrats aren’t radical enough, didn’t vote even though they knew this would happen….
Low voter turnout is the reason why the American fascist party is abolishing the ethics committee and doing many other things fascists do.
They don’t represent the interest of the majority of people. The only reason they win over and over again is because their voters are more reluctant to vote. According to polls, less than 45% of the country wanted to be represented by republicans. Yet, bush and trump won the presidency.
Without an ethical compass, it’s a lot easier to exploit the people and radicalize them in order to prepare them America the fourth reich.
