I hope you realize I’m 19 and living alone and my boyfriend is way older. This is no easy situation for a woman who is a student and has not enough income to even support a child…. .
No he shouldn’t. He was drunk. We all do stupid things. Including myself. And the police didn’t care if I hit him first or no. They simply said he shouldn’t hit me. Seems as the system is unfair. I did not hit him btw.
But I was drunk too and I was yelling at him and getting in his face. It was a bad night and he slapped he across the head. Barely felt it. And I don’t think he remembers it. I love him and just don’t want anything bad to happen. I’m pregnant and it’s all impacting my mental health….
Of course it's impacting your mental health. Pregnant and drunk, with an even drunker boyfriend who is "way older" and who hit you when you argued. Why are you so desperately making bad decisions and defending this? It doesn't have to be this way.
It isn't. And you said you didn't hit him, which is why you're not being charged. If you had reported also striking him, you may be facing charges as well.
