Not really feasible. Blood components (red blood cells, plasma and platelets) go through a pretty involved process before they’re safe to give to a patient. There’s no set-up in most of the world to get that done privately or through the public/established system.
1. Non-registered donors (“new donors”) take a couple of weeks to process before they can donate blood for the first time. There’s no certainty any of them will be a match for the child or eligible to be donors, and even if they are, they can only donate one unit of whole blood every 3-4 months each. If the child needs further transfusions before the donors can donate again the problem just comes back.
This is dumb but if they don’t want vaccinated blood, then they should donate blood themselves and then if the infant requires a transfusion then their own blood can be used. I’ve had a transfusion before and using family’s blood isn’t an unusual thing.
Reminds me of the jehovahs witnesses who will let their children DIE rather than allow them a blood transfusion.
The McGill University Health Centre has been authorized to perform blood transfusions to treat a 14-year-old girl with cancer, despite her refusal because it goes against her beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness.
