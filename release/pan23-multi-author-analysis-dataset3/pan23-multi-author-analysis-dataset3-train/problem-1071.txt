Depends on the crews, to be honest. If they are crewed well, that is an absolute force to be reckoned with. They are very capable machines. If they're operated poorly, their addition won't mean much aside from soaking up a few Russian munitions, which, still counts for something.
It certainly won't be a cakewalk, but Russia isn't really capable of supporting a massive push of 500,000 soldiers.
The issue isn't their experience. It's the sheer loss of material such as tanks, missiles, and artillery that they can't replace faster than they lose it, and they don't have nearly as much backing as Ukraine.
As Ukraine gets too notch tanks delivered to them and them preparing for that atack for a while now chances are not that bad of untaine wining out the war of nutrition.
Right now, what Ukraine needs is long range munitions, cruise missile defense (patriot) and non-arms support (generators, consumables).
The scuttlebutt is that Putin wants a big symbolic push on 24th of this month, to coincide with some chestbeating celebrations at home.
Tanks will take months to arrive, the majority will probably not arrive until fall. Noone has comitted jets yet, but if they do it will take a year or more to get pilots, mechanics and logistics up to speed.
