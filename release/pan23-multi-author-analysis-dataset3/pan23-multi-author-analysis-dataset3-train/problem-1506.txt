It’s really fucking stupid that Republicans were/are bashing Biden over that whole thing. Biden obviously listens and respects what the top military and intelligence officials were telling him him after it was spotted, and he was going to take their recommendations and advice on it, which is what he did.
I’m not a fan of Biden at all, but from what I gather he waited for his briefing by intelligence agencies and then took recommended action.
I remember when it was Romney vs Obama running for president and I voted Obama because Romney seemed so out of touch. Now here we are in 2023 and even though I still disagree with Romney on so much, the fact that he is still a normal individual and not a mouth foaming culture warrior GOP member is, dare I say, refreshing?
Of course there’s no excuse for this crap, but really if you take a look at what the Republican Party has done lately this is small potatoes compared to what they did in reaction to Trump. Trumps base has practically got a stranglehold on that party and the results of that has been nothing but bad things for our country. You may not have liked the Republican Party previous to that but I can’t think anyone can argue it took an even more extreme turn for the worse since Trump.
There’s just no low the Republican Party isn’t willing to sink to any longer and Trumps base demands it. If a Democrat did it you can bet your life it was wrong.
Pretty sure he ain’t as bad as Pence however. I imagine Romney knows given the current situation he doesn’t stand a chance. Pence on the other hand is holding onto the slimmest of possible hope. Thing is when your own party is actually out to hang you, that should be a clue.
