Does she have a life estate? Who are the people in her will? Does she have a will? Who are her heirs?
The problem I see is if she "needs to sell it to fund her retirement." Well that could just meant the value will be gone totally. But an estate attorney will be able to get very clever here, I bet, and maybe everyone ends up happy... maybe!
If you feel like the current estate lawyer is impartial and is willing to meet with you that's also an option.
And should widow predecease you, does the entire trust revert to you or does her half go to her heirs?
Does the widow (who I'm assuming is not your grandmother) have her own children/grandchildren who stand to inherit her estate?
Either way, your best option (and what it seems like your grandfather wanted) sell the house (and any other assets covered by the trust) and split the proceeds with his widow.
Your grandfather's death owning the condo reset the tax basis at fair market value as of his death so of the condo is sold soon, you wouldn't have any (or much) taxable gain.
If you don't know already it's important to get a professional and formal appraisal as the value of the property at the time of your grandfather's death will become your tax basis (at least that's how it works in California). Appraisers will know how to back date the appraisal.
