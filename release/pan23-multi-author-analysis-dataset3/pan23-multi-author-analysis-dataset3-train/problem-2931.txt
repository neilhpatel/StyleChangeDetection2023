Highlighted for visibility: the 'discriminatory' practices which China has pledged to retaliate against 'based upon the principle of reciprocity' is something they already do.
So while China complains that restrictions applied to its citizens when they travel are "discrimination" and talks a bunch of BS about reciprocity, the reality is that China remains for all intents and purposes remains closed to the vast, vast majority of foreign nationals.
Since China does not seem to care to alleviate WHO concern, China can expect less understanding Western nations to impose measures to restrict Chinese from traveling to other countries down the road.
China needs to be walled in like Jerusalem in WWZ, or using that film to make another adage, Jerusalem is the rest of the world, the zombies are the chinese finally having the 'zero covid' policy removed and flocking to the airports.
Yeah not like china banned all domestic flights at the start of the covid-19 pandemic in december of 2019, but still allowed all outbound flights.
They stated there was no proof of it being spread human-to-human, so.. why would they ban ALL domestic flights? Because they're full of shit, that's why.
