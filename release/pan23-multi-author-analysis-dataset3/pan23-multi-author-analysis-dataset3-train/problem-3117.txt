I guess I got pat everyoneâ€™s crotch before I use any pronouns? On the plus side I think people would start using non-gendered language for fear of being fined since there is no way to tell every persons gender just by looking at them.
The laws they're trying to pass are so vaguely worded, the existence of trans and gender variant people is being classified as inherently sexual/"adult"/obscene/etc. And if they are able to pass these bans on "performers", they are absolutely going to use it to attack us in every other area of public life too.
This shit, the "drag bans", the "bathroom bills", the attacks on trans youth and now adult's medical care, the attempts to pull information about trans people from public scools and libraries, and everything else they're doing, they are systematically criminalizing our goddamn existence.
They don't actually distinguish between "drag queen" and "trans woman", or between "performance" and "just going about our lives". They see trans and GNC people's existence as inherently sexual, and our clothing and gender presentation as the expression of a perverse fetish. If we are anywhere in public where a child might possibly see us, even if it's standing in line at the 7-11, they are claiming that this is pedophilic grooming through forcibly exposing children to degenerat.
After all, if someone they consider a "man in a dress" is legally classified as an "adult performer" when all they're doing is reading Mary Poppins to kids in a library while dressed as the titular character, what exactly does that mean for the person whom they consider as a "man in a dress" who is just trying to go to her job as a 5th grade Math teacher? Or hell, just trying to go to the grocery store?
