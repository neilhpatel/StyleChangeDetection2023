This is the part the confuses me the most about people who say we should stay out of it. Anything bad for Russia and/or China is good for the US. It's truly that simple.
It's trendy to talk shit about US military spending and the defense industry, but we are able to supply Ukraine with large quantities of high-tech weaponry and supplies presciesly because we have a large military industrial complex and spend lots of money on our military.
The question is, now that people finally realize how much money the US spends on the military, will they care once the conflict in Ukraine is over or will they allow the US to continue to spend insane amounts of money on the military because talking heads are no longer complaining about it.
I’m glad conservatives are finally realizing the absurd size of the US military complex now that it’s helping Ukraine, but all of this money was ear marked for defense years ago, and then turned into missiles and tanks.
The other point of view is that Russia has run through their stocks of more recently produced weapons, and they are now fighting in Ukraine mostly with equipment produced before the Gulf War, so the stuff being sent to Ukraine is perfectly suited to the war as it is now being fought. In particular, Bradly light tanks are capable of killing any Russian tank now in the field an a range of 4 km. The big gun on Abrams 2 MBT is capable of the same out to about 2 km, and the smaller gun on Abrams 1 would not reach as far, though it is fine for the older model tanks Russia is now putting in the line. The worry is numbers. 50 + 59 Bradley FVs (light tanks with room for 6 or so soldiers in the back) is enough for one rather small battle, but not enough for the entire front.
