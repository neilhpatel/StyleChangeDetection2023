Title: Can children who haven't left the nest for an extended period of time claim squatters rights?
There is really not a thing called "squatter's rights." The name of the doctrine is adverse possession, and it is not at all relevant when the parents have been living in, and paying for, the home the entire time.
So in scenario 3, because the parents can claim they were aware that their child was living in the second home, that is enough to prevent adverse possession? I would think then that anybody could claim they knew someone was squatting on a property. Or are you saying that someone cannot claim adverse possession if the real owner is actually keeping up with property taxes, insurance, etc?
Very informative, thank you kindly for your responses. Someone doesn't like me, they keep voting down my comments. I thought it was a legitimate question. .
I'm not entirely sure that is true. I've read plenty of articles about people being unable to evict others who unknowingly occupied a residence. BTW - this does not apply to me. It just popped into my head earlier today and thought I would ask.
