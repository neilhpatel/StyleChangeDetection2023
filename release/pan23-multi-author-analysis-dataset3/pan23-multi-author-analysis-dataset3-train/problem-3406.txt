Thereâ€™s zero reason to support Russia right now yet Musk talks in a ways that is in clear support of Russia.
For example, perhaps Musk and Putin have been talking to each other in recent months. And perhaps Putin has been telling Musk to help him "end the war" (obviously in Russia's favor, right).
Now what he MIGHT be seeing is foreign intel from our ABC organizations that show some kind of questionable interactions that Musk may be doing with foreign bad actors.
Considering all the news of Musk being cozy with the Chinese and Russian governments, I'd be worried too. China lets Musk have more freedom than even Chinese companies do, but there's probably some private and very secretive strings attached to have such business opportunities for him. Musk reveals himself to be more of a GOP lover, loving conspiracy theories, loving Trump's antics, manipulating stock and crypto prices. Musk is a manipulative man, I don't see why his fans can't seem to comprehend it.
Not to mention Musk is, at the end of the day, a businessman. It's not like Trump who was actively running for president. I would expect someone involved in business in this day and age to have some foreign connections.
