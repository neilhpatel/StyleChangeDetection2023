NAL but have read through comments and it sounds like you have an uphill battle to claim retention of their deposit for several reasons. Yes, the lack of proper written notice- obviously the forwarding address issue, but you also had their email and didn’t provide the same itemized list there. More importantly, if you don’t have before and after photos actually documenting damages beyond normal wear and tear, it looks very much like you just don’t want to or can’t return their deposit. The burden is on you as the landlord. If your tenants were smart they took photos at move in and departure and will present that in court. If your only evidence is an itemized list with no supporting documentation/ photos to support those claimed damages on the list you’ll likely be ordered to return at least a portion of the deposit. Take this as a lesson learned OP. Do consult with an attorney of course.
A lawyer will know which, if any, of these questions are most important. They will know how judges tend to rule and on what grounds. A lawyer is your best bet for navigating this situation. There is also a great difference between 5K and 15k+. You need the help of a letter who understands local law and can represent your interests, ASAP.
Maybe they contacted you with an email address within what was feasibly hours of receiving your snail mail. Maybe they got your letter, looked up the law, and immediately furnished you with an email address. How long after their lease ended did they provide this info?
When was their lease up? How long had they been tenants? What sort of property required a $5K deposit? What sort of issues total $5K in damages?
