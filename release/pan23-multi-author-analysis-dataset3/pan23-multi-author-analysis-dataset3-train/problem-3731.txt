Unless you were discriminated because of membership in a protected class like race or disability, or some other reason covered by the law like making a complaint to OSHA it isn't illegal to single you out or fire you for a bad reason.
In 49 states in the US employment is at will and they can terminate you for any reason except a few prohibited by law like because of a disability. There is no requirement for a performance improvement plan. Terminating you for missing meetings is legal even if they do a bad job as a manager.
Why was this not wrongful termination; if the reason given was vague and can be correlated to missed meetings. Should other coworkers not be treated the same as I was?
I am in FL; the original company is in TX and the acquired company is in IL. It feels targetted because someone I directly manage in a similar position was given a performance plan. I was not.
No. You would have I prove it was because of a protected class... and it sounds like you can't because they have you a reason.
Your boss can fire you if they feel you didn't communicate well, missed work, or were blue pants on Tuesday. None of that is illegal. Maybe not fair but not illegal (absent a union or the rare employment contract).
