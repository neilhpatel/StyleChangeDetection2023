As for the nazi rhetoric, that is mostly just based on roles that (some) Ukrainians played during WWII. They did commit atrocities against Jews specifically, similar to how if some was to want to attack Germany/Austria today they would say there are nazi’s there (the sound bites of course would never speak to actual numbers).
Due to the complex history of the area, the “some Ukrainians” that you are referring to would probably not consider themselves Ukrainian. They would mostly likely consider themselves Russian, speaking Russian, on land they believe belongs to them.
The Russian Federation, which is only 31 years old - has no historical right to claim Russian language speakers abroad are under their jurisdiction. It is fucking absurd.
Both are NATO founders are aren't insecure about their languages. Article 5 applies. They would never war with one another.
Yes, Ukrainian is the official State language, but that doesn't mean Russian is being banned. Eastern Ukraine is mostly Russian-schools, Russian-language signage and Russian-language daily life.
