Your mom can not throw your dad in jail. Its going to depend heavily on what the custody order states. If the order states that your mom is the only one permitted to make medical decisions, then your dad could potentially be found in wilful contempt, and potentially face jail time, but that's highly unlikely. If the order makes no mention, and there's nothing relinquishing your dad from any parental rights, then you mom can't do anything about it. She can definitely take him back to court and try to accuse him of whatever she wants, if her lawyer is dumb enough to go that far, but it will be quickly shot down by the judge.
Also, im not 100% sure if this part will apply to you, but I know in some states, once you hit a certain age, you yourself have more rights and more of a say in certain things. In my state, its 16, and once you're at that age, you can choose to live with your dad assuming he's able to in the eyes of the court (financially able, has place to live, etc). Im not sure if that would also apply to medical decisions as well, but something to look into if the order does give your mom sole parental rights.
Unless there is a custody arrangement in a court order that gives her the sole right to make all of your medical decisions she has no leg to stand on. Your dad was well within his rights as a parent to make medical decisions like this for you.
