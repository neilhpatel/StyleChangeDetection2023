On one hand I don't think that's the worst idea, on the other hand if the military situation was so far out of hand that bombs and missiles were hitting the US mainland, I can't help but imagine the war would have gone nuclear before that point.
Most of the stuff the West sending shouldn’t be new to Russia, and if they were a real super power, they would’ve updated their doctrine and gear to the capabilities of their potential opponents, you know, before starting a war.
There will be nothing gained from doing that to Russia, retaliation should be directed at the invading force and military targets, which is actually going to change the fighting.
Russia is wasting expensive and finite (they can’t make them post-2014 sanctions) guided munitions on pointless attacks against civilians that only spurrs them harder against Russia (which is always what happens when you do this). Every cruise missile that strikes a transformer is one that doesn’t strike Ukrainian soldiers.
Turkish ships are all over the Black Sea and Russia doesn't touch them. A Turkish civilian vessel being attacked by Russia would bring Turkey directly into the war as a full participant. There is an enormous difference between hostile forces and civilian ships.
A solar installation for a single house uses about 2-400 square feet of roof surface, and costs about twenty thousand dollars. Powering an entire city with solar requires hundreds of square miles of panels. It's really helpful for stuff like emergency lighting and keeping road signals working, but as a general purpose power supply you have to spend a lot of time and money building very big. If it was a quick solution we wouldn't still be burning coal all over the world.
