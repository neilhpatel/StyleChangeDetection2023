Why do you suppose the Chinese government is even going to the trouble of an out-in-the-open global spying operation if they can't use it for influence? The American government can fuck you over if they want to, but the Chinese government will fuck you over if they can.
If you think the Chinese and American governments are equivalently evil and that the Chinese government can't reach you... you probably don't know a lot about China.
China is trying to fuck over America which is the governments problem. American companies are trying to fuck over ME which is my problem. To be clear I don't like anyone spying on me but if I have to choose between two evils China getting information about me is the lesser one. I have no value to them. If I was a Chinese citizen I would feel the opposite.
So is facebook Google, and Amazon. I try not to use any of those services but I'd rather have a chinese company that will never affect me spy on me than American companies.
People can defend these companies and say there's no evidence that they're going to use their equipment to spy. That's probably true but the threat is that the CCP can demand and force these companies to spy at any time.
And I've had to sign agreements with employers I considered fundamentally unfair as well. However, I signed. If I'd had some better idea, I'd have been doing that and not needing to sign the agreement.
Because you think millions and even billions of dollars in researching technology should just be free for some a-hole to come along and steal? Like, if you come up with a million dollar idea, anybody should just be allowed to steal your work?
