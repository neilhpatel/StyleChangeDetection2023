You can almost pinpoint on a timeline when the first units of volunteers and conscripts sent overseas to train arrived back compared to losses of Russian units.
There are still a lot of units training in the EU, UK and US on equipment more recently signed off for donation, once those systems and people start getting offloaded into Ukrainian territory we'll see even further escalations of relative combat performance.
I mean even if the west scales back support for Ukraine, at this point Ukraine has loads of battle hardened troops going up against essentially terrified civilians led by corrupt cronies with no military background and Russia is already reaching into museums for T62 tanks.
- Alexander recounted how he and his fellow draftees had asked their instructor in Russia what they could possibly learn about firing a gun and becoming soldiers in the few weeks before being sent to Ukraine.
If NATO legit got into this fight with our full tech and trained troops, it's no exaggeration to say every Russian unit in Ukraine would be dead by lunchtime. And that's assuming we stop at Ukraine's borders.
Are you from Ukraine? If so, I am sorry for what my country did, for what my people did – and I do understand that the words “I am sorry” are hollow and cannot help you. But that is all I can offer.
