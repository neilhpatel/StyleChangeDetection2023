20% seems high, but I appreciate the sentiment. The fact that we have executed innocent people was the detail that finally shook me out of the naive thinking that capital punishment could be otherwise justified.
Still, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, "The data show that for every 8.3 executions carried out in the United States, a wrongfully condemned death-row prisoner is exonerated." Their research and data on the subject starts following the Supreme Court case Furman v. Georgia in 1972. Their findings doesn't include several scenarios of innocence and is again plagued by the fact that more could be innocent but it just hasn't been proven yet. Perhaps must damning of all is the fact that the majority of these cases are brought about due to official misconduct or perjury. I highly recommend reading through their findings as it does have nuance and particulars that are hard to convey or mention here.
The data is a little difficult to assuredly quantify. Innocence of those that have been executed are found out over time so it changes over time, and at what point or year do you even start with the date? And what about those actually executed? After an execution is carried out there often is no further investigation and evidence is often destroyed, thereby making it harder to give a truly accurate answer.
So 20% is an oddly specific and rounded number that I'm not really finding specifically, but it is nevertheless a dreadfully high rate and a very real issue on a larger scale than people like to admit.
