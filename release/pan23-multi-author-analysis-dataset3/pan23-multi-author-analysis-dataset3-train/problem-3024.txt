The most egregious of that was when I read about how at the end of January 2021 all the deaths from here on out are on Biden. It had been a week.
That's when it all made sense. So what you're saying is Biden is at fault for the tax cuts made by the Republicans that haven't been repealed despite the deficit (that went way up under Trump) going down under Biden?
It's no use... they'll complain about how Biden has destroyed the country (member, to them gas was ALWAYS 1.50 a gallon under trump) and how "one day, when you get older, you'll start voting for republicans and stop being "woke".
Even if Trump got reelected, and it was still the price it is now, they'd be like "that's Biden's fault.".
It doesn't matter. They are threatening to not increase the debt ceiling unless they get those cuts. Without any concession, the government gets shutdown on Dems dime and it looks bad for Biden in 2024. And if he gives them those concessions, that looks bad. I bet they force a shutdown and then get some minor concessions, and both of those things come back to haunt the Dems.
Well if the alternative is cutting the safety net, the democrats will surely get the blame anyway. No, the solution is 100% for sure to make the republicans do it. At least then the democrats will be in the right. If people are too stupid to believe that, we're doomed anyway.
The post I was responding to expressed concerns that if the democrats allow the republicans to make good on their debt-ceiling threats, the electorate would blame them for it. I was responding to that concern.
