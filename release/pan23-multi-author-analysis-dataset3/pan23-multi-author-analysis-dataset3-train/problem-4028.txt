A seven-day demand to pay or quit is lawful in your state. You can void the notice by getting current on your rent. If you refuse to vacate and don't pay up, your landlord must file to evict and make their case to a judge; they cannot lock you out or physically remove you without a court order.
As you have no term agreement, your landlord can give you unconditional notice to vacate at least 30 days before the end of your tenancy. This notice cannot be avoided unless you negotiate a lease, although your landlord would still have to go through an eviction hearing if you refuse to vacate.
Assuming you were given notice to pay the rent (or he will say he gave you written notice), his next step after you don't move out the 19th is to sue you in tenant court. He can not lock you out or remove your belongings without a court order.
His written notice claims he gave you prior written notice to pay the missing rent. Since NH doesn't require certified servicing, it's essentially your word against his on that regard.
Working it out is best, but keep in mind he could still sue for back rent. As you could for unpaid work.
