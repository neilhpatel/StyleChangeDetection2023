The landlord's part in this is kind of irrelevant. If they need to take action against the bad roomie, they can do that on their own time.
A copy of the lease would be helpful, as would a copy of the receipts you got for paying rent (or the canceled cheques would be fine, proving that you paid and how much). An affidavit (or bring them in person) from your roommate that the person you are suing stopped paying rent.
what about something written that the landlord confirms that said renter refused to leave the apt after end of lease?
2. July 31/Aug 1 tell bad roommate he has 30 days to leave we're signing a new lease with another person that starts at beginning of Sept 2021.
Landord set up a new lease that me and 3 other people signed that should have taken effect Sept 2020 but because bad roommate didnt leave new 4th person didnt hang around and the "new lease" became irrelevant and unused.
So his proof for paying rent up until the last month was him taking a photo of the cash before he slipped it under my door and sending it thru facebook messenger. The photos all have a date stamp.
