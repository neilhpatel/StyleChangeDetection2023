To start with, let's talk about Old English. Old English, aka Anglo Saxon, covers the period until 1066, and the most famous surviving text is Beowulf. It looks like this:
Most modern English speakers find Beowulf pretty much completely baffling. Letters like Ã¾ are completely foreign to modern speakers. Even if they hear it rather than trying to read it, it's hard to spot much that is familiar. Plurals aren't formed by adding -s at the end. Word order is different (sentence ends in a verb). Grammar is different with cases. This language works a lot like modern German. But there are a few nuggets that are related to modern words if you know what to look for. Take that word cyninga. That's a plural - remember plurals don't get formed with s yet. So, drop off the a at the end and you get cyning. Still pretty strange. But spelling was less consistent then, and spelling rules change over time. C was a hard sound, so let's respell slightly clearer but mostly keep the pronunciation - kining. Just kind of mumble when you say it, and you get the modern word "king" with a syllable dropped off.
You are definitely good to go by about 1700, and pretty much completely lost before 1400 without special study. But it's hard to pick an exact date in between. It would be harder to understand the further back you go. Easier the later you go. Depends a bit on how good you are with modern English dialects, etc.
Speakers of Old English would have found it somewhat baffling as well: it was poetry, not prose. Both its syntax and its word choices are unusual in many regards.
