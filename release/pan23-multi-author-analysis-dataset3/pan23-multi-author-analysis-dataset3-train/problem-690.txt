Khrushchev and Gorbachev strike me as two men who deeply cared for the health of the entirety of Eastern Europe. I'm sure terrible things happened under their watch, but they were moral men. Both Ukranian.
Russia and the Soviets abused Ukraine so much... But look at the majority of famous "soviet" Engineers, scientists, generals... Vast majority were Ukranian.
This small nation is such an inspiring guiding star that all of modern civilization can learn so much from. I have so, so much respect for the people of Ukraine.
Ukrainians have proven themselves to be the kind of patriots we Americans tell ourselves we are in our mythologies.
Ukrainians are in absolute apperication of what America has given Ukraine. My cousin fought in Ukraine and on his last evening in Ukraine he had a meal with his commander and a few fellow soldiers and he was told he was now American/Ukrainian and he countered "but I don't even speak Ukrainian" and they laughed and said "most Ukrainians don't speak Ukrainian when they become Ukrainian" he looked confused and said "Babies, babies don't speak when they are born, but they learn".
