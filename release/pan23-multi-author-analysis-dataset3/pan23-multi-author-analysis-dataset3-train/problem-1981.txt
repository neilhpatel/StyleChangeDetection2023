You can talk this over with your parents and they can address it with the school if they disagree with this decision.
If you feel you didn't say anything that would warrant your discipline, you and your parents can bring it up with the school.
"Freedom of speech" doesn't mean "say whatever I want at school without fear of punishment." There are lots of things you can't say at school (much less anywhere), along with certain times you can't say those things, without fear of punishment. Without you divulging the specific words or phrases that this administrator or whoever had a problem with, no one here can possibly guess whether or not your rights were violated as you assert.
Every time you comment you add a little more to the story. At first it was "one question about his freedom" and then it was "we were discussing policies" and then it was "we were discussing policies and I asserted that freedoms were going to be taken away.".
But clearly there was something specific you said that made her react the way she did, regardless of whether that reaction was justified or unjustified. You're not sharing that specific thing or things, much less the context around them, so any advice beyond "talk to your parents and, with them, the school about it," likely can't be given.
