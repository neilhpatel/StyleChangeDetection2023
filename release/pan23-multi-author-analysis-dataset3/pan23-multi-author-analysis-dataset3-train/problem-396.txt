If republicans win tonight, it will solidify in their party and with their base that their approach and goals for the country are the right ones and nothing will hold them back.
My prediction: Republicans will gain the majority in both houses of congress and fuck things up so badly that we’ll then swing hard left.
It's incredible what Dems have been able to accomplish with their razor thin majority, and even more incredible that they're going to be punished for it.
There are people who are about to be elected that are openly saying that if they win, they'll guarantee their party never loses another election, no problem!
- They’re electing a bunch of people who are willing to refuse to certify election results and deny the results of the last election.
- In the next presidential election, if a democrat wins, they’ refuse to certify electors from 3-6 crucial states. Instead they’ll appoint their own electors. This will cause a constitutional crisis.
- Kamala Harris will refuse to count the votes of electors who were appointed against the will of the people.
