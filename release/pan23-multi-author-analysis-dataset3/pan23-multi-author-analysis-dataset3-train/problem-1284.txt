That said, Republicans have only themselves to blame for fostering the extremist populists in their party that led to this situation, and they deserve every ounce of pain now. Here's hoping this leads to reforms like rank choice voting that help moderate politics again to prevent future fascism.
I mean, I get the underlying idea. He won Republican caucus support, they're the majority, that should be job done.
Man, some of the quotes from the Republican congressmen do not inspire confidence. Gaetz saying the entire end goal is the defeat of McCarthy: indicating no real plan or forward thinking consistent with many of the other republican politicians. McCarthy still being optimistic. But at least rep Bacon has the wherewithal to understand that all the Republicans look bad. But I don't have confidence that he knows they look bad for reasons BEYOND this 20 member hold out.
McCarthy after meetings after 6th vote (so maybe he's a little more down on himself by now): "I crawl before I walk, I walk before I run... And I felt as though we had a very good discussion." Though I don't think he will outwardly put on shame at any point in time.
Finally, more Bacon: "For most of us, we work hard to get promoted in these positions by being a team player. To say, 'I'm going to vote for you if you give me a subcommittee chair'? We do not like that quid pro quo." - uhhhhhhhhh...
Bacon: "I think it's bad, bad for the GOP brand... Folks out all over America aren't going to say, 'it's that 20.' They’re going to group us together.".
Yup. I was thinking this would be a way to get it done without blatantly voting for Jeffries. But the ones that have to take bullet I’m not sure they exist.
