DO NOT DO THIS! I cannot stress this enough. 30 years is FOREVER in terms of a financial commitment that you dont know the outcome of. Your mother could get cancer, hit by a bus, fired, etc. Its not about your mother being able to afford it, its about you being able to afford it alone. With your current salary, can you afford a mortgage, utilitys, car payments, gas, food, medical bills, etc? Your answer is most likely no and you will only find yourself further in debt trying to keep up.
Cons: If your mother stops paying, you owe the mortgage and your credit score takes a hit. Even if your mother pays on-time, it may inhibit your ability to get a loan in the future (as this counts as money that you owe).
Along with all of the advice given (donâ€™t do it), one additional reason : you signing for this loan will hurt your ability to get a loan for yourself someday, even if payments are made on time. Banks will consider this your debt and you taking on additional debt would be a risk to them.
If her bank is asking for a guarantor, it's because they believe she's at high risk of defaulting. That doesn't change if you guarantee it - it just means you'll be on the hook if she does, instead of the bank eating the loss.
