A lot of times if it wasn’t installed by a certified installer the companies will just push back that it was installed wrong so no warranty and it’s more of a hassle to prove you actually did it right than the cost of new material.
You have a chance if you have the original instructions. With out that you would need to file a suit and subpoena the old instructions. But even that to do through a lawyer is a decent chunk.
Think about the cost to them to hire an attorney in your area, and have him represent them in court. It would after be cheaper for them to settle than to fight it.
No, any large corporations that operate nation wide will have local agent that represent the company and can be a valid location to serve the suit. Any process server will be able to tell you how to fill out the paperwork and serve them.
This usually puts you at the top of their to do list. I’d imagine they’d rather supply the new material than pay out ten grand. I suspect it costs them far less than that to provide the new material.
