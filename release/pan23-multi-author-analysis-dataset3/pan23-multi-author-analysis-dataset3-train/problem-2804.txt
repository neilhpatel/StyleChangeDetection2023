We do know that. There's cameras all over those halls. You can look it up. They talked about it during one of the hearings. They interviewed a woman who first reported the tours, when she saw them.
i ve seen enough interviews with her. I am a social worker . i have a relatively good grasp for people. this woman is an opportunist who knows what she wants and what she needs to pay to get it and keep it. and after her calculation, she is still good.
in this system ,there will never be justice for people like him. same goes for all the oligarchs like thiel and murdoch who pushed him to presidency.
being a first lady is more than just " the wife ". its a political office. she went into that office.
liberal corporate media narratives . there were so many stories during and after his presidency hinting at or claiming that she was unhappy, hates him, wants to leave him , has had enough. wishful thinking and utter bullshit.
Bullshit. As a man I'm more likely to give birth to a chimp through my nose than see this asshole held accountable. Our worthless justice department won't do anything when it is filled with his lackeys.
