Regarding that, let's just say I live in a 'Right to Work' state where pretty much the only workers protections come from the company itself or the FSLA.
I'm not looking for advice on how to file a UE claim, if that's what you're digging after. I already did that as soon as I got home and it will most definitely be approved. Lol.
Thats incorrect as far as I know, 'Right to Work' means the employer can fire you for any reason at any time... which is the same thing as saying 'Employment at Will' for both parties, because either side can decide to terminate their working agreement at any point.
The term comes from a belief that an employee has the "right to work" without having to pay union dues.
Right to work means employees cannot be forced to join a union/pay union dues as a condition of employment. It’s commonly confused with “at-will employment” which means the employee or employer is free to end the employment relationship at any time for any reason (except for an illegal reason) whether or not this was an illegal reason depends on your location.
