This man has had multiple rape and sexual assault allegations. He’s belittled minorities, excluded them from his buildings and mocked disabled reporters. He was pals with a known pedophile and sex trafficker and more than likely paid for his wife. He bragged about aforementioned sexual assault and is such a god awful businessman he bankrupted a casino and steak business, both of which LITERALLY sell themselves.
No, I don’t think hawking bullshit NFTs is his low point, just the next logical one for this absolute pile of shit of a human.
I don't doubt there are 45,000 chumps gullible enough to send another $100 to trumplethinskin, but I don't see his most of his followers as being in the crypto-bro/NFT demo. I suspect the crypto angle is there for money laundering, ie: to disguise the fact that the money is coming from foreign sources (probably payment for the classified State secrets he stole).
The puzzling thing to me is why bother at all, he could just money-launder some other way and then cry foul to the media when investigated.
That's the thing, all he did is announce a cryptocurrency but with this distraction to make us talk about the lameness of the images. He's using a public platform to put this crime up for 'public debate' so it's handled there instead of in the criminal justice system.
