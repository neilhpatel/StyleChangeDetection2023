...yet the collapse never seems to arrive. You'd think their followers would have follow up questions, like "hey why didn't things collapse?".
In this instance they said that. Yet I hope they would think different when there comes a party that openly espouses genocide and starts gaining votes by lying and preying on peoples fears.
Yeah but just cause it’s in the name doesn’t mean they were in any sense committed to any socialist ideals. The few in the Nazi party that were had been assassinated in the night of the long knives on Hitlers orders, they were openly and staunchly against socialists. East Germany took the name “German Democratic Republic” would you believe they were a democratic bunch just cause it’s in the name. A lot of political parties use terms in their names that no objective observer would say they adhere to.
But just hypothetically would you think it was wrong of Germany in the early thirties to disallow the nazis to run for election?
Are you saying the banned people are Nazi like or the government that bans political opponents? Australia at one stage tried to ban the communist party, it was defeated at a referendum. I feel that when ideas and movements are banned they become more dangerous. Expose them to the light of media and opposition scrutiny.
