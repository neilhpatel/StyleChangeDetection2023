He did this in public -- as a joke. They think it's okay to dress in drag when you're doing it as a punchline, but it's not okay when you're doing it as a sincere expression of your identity.
It's still an expression of identity, in the same way that wearing a football jersey to a ball game is an expression of identity. The statement is: I'm a person who enjoys dressing in drag.
But yes, I agree with the rest. It's just a clumsy way attacking trans people, without realizing (or caring) that being trans and wearing drag are not the same thing.
Conservatives use drag for ridicule, either to parody women or to diminish the wearer by parading them with less masculinity.
Difference is generally that liberals in drag are like ‘let’s all have fun’ and conservatives in drag and looking to be dominatrixes without safe words.
The thing Democrats don't get about Republicans is this: Republicans want to be able to dress in drag, and do lines of cocaine and have gay sex and low maortgages and get abortions and free healthcare. They just don't want you to have those things too.
