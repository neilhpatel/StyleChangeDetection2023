Yes, you can. And the car will be towed, leaving your friend without their car and having to pay to get it out of impound (which will require them to register and insure it first, in addition to the impound fees). Which means he's likely to tell the police that yes, you knew it wasn't registered/insured.
And, if you didn't get the car from a friend and the car turns out to be stolen, you're looking at a few additional charges as well.
Then you may actually have a defence to those specific charges, but the fact that it was also a stolen car full of stolen plates isn't helping you. You need a lawyer, not Reddit.
Now seeing the other posts, you need an attorney. You may have some defense based on the overall situation but it's absolutely not a situation where you should simply try to defend yourself.
You should get the best representation you can afford. The assumption that you cannot be found guilty of any of the criminal charges against you is a very bad assumption, no matter how innocent you feel.
'Not knowing' is not a defense for lack of insurance because it's your responsibility, as the vehicle operator, to know. You should always verify the vehicle has a current insurance card before driving it simply because you might be involved in an accident where that information becomes necessary to produce.
