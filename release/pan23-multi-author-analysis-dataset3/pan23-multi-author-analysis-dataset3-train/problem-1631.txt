You should establish a custody order with clear boundaries (like all communication between parents must pertain to the child and be done in writing). If you legitimately believe that your child is being abused then you can contact CPS. The photo is not a legal issue.
Info: what’s the problem with the photo? You seem to be suggesting there’s something inappropriate about this but haven’t described anything beyond a picture of a kid in their underwear? If that’s the case you are overreacting and need to stop sexualising your 6 year old child. How do you think it comes across to a child that you respond that way when sent a totally innocent photo? If the mother is genuinely taking sexual pictures of the child then you should call child services.
It's not like she was in the middle of doing something cutesy and she was caught in her underwear, she was changing and her mother took a picture of her. It's just freakin' weird. And my own daughter thought it was weird herself.
I'm not sexualizing my 6 year old child, the issue comes from the picture in the nature being inappropriate. My child has expressed discontent already with being undressed, and even chooses herself to wear shorts under her skirt because of "weirdos".
This is good advice. I have brought up co-parenting before, but it seems that no matter whenever I bring stuff up that involves my daughter's extra curricular activities and what have you, I am met with off topic conversations of essentially being either berated in some form; but a custody order with clear indications may help further this point of the nature in which I am contacted.
I'm trying to voice my concern given my own child seems uncomfortable. If that makes me someone to overreact for trying to be a worried father, then so be it with the labeling.
