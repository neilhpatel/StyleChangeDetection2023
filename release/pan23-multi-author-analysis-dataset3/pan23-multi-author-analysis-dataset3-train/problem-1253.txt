Asking them to keep the liability while also asking for more money is unlikely to end as you want it to.
And I suppose I will just try asking for more compensation but it’s unlikely they’ll give it. Threatening a lawsuit isn’t going to be much help then is it? Especially since I don’t actually want to go through with it since it’s so much time and money.
Gotcha thanks! I’m trying to figure out how to ask them to strike it but then they probably won’t let us sign the new house, which I don’t have much choice in. So I’m thinking I ask for more compensation now and keep that liability aspect, or ask them to strike the liability clause. Do you think that’s a good approach?
The carbon monoxide alarm was extremely quiet (though they did say it was checked/met regulations), it’s strange that the smoke detector didn’t go off for the hours and hours the beam was burning in our ceiling, and the wire that they think fell on top of the light that resulted in the fire was apparently quite old. Emotional distress? Perhaps I don’t have anything to file a lawsuit over? Honestly, quite unsure about how this all works.
I see. Thanks so much for your response Pretty much nothing to do here unless I can prove the fire was due to faulty wiring then?
It’s not enough to prove faulty wiring. It’s more than that. You’d have to prove landlord directly caused the fault or knew of it and failed to act.
Do you have evidence landlord did some specific negligent thing to allow this fire to occur? If landlord did something like ignore clear signs the wiring was dangerous, or made outrageous, incompetent repairs to wiring, there could be.
