... and here is a tabular summary of the candidates' backgrounds (as I posted earlier in another thread):
Children 2 Unknown - more keep appearing. Christian Walker: "He has four kids, four different women.".
Ok. I have a career in politics that tells me otherwise. Voting for or against the continued existence of democracy is a little more serious than buying a 6-pack of Pepsi because you’re sick of Coke ads. But we can leave this here.
It’s not really my faith in the electorate, it’s that I’ve done a lot of voter contact and I know that there are a ton of folks out there who feel they’re being oversaturated if you so much as mention an election in their presence. The same people who don’t wait emails also don’t want calls, texts, yard signs, canvass visits, tv ads, radio ads, or billboards. Plenty of people need to be dragged into giving a shit, and they (reasonably) complain about it, but they show up where they might not have if we didn’t yell HEY YOU SHOULD GO VOTE at them a ton of times.
We can either let the candidate with the most money/name recognition win every time, or we can make peace with being a little annoying. I’ve come to terms with it.
