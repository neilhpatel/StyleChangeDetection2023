Exactly. Now imagine if Sheriffs and Mayors KNEW that the protestors they're beating can't remove them in the next election: will they even bother with tear gas and knight sticks or will they go straight to assault rifles and vehicular homicide?
While I don't trust most Republicans as far as I can throw them, a minority at the very least support Democracy (either for ideological reasons, or because they're in swing districts and need to be seen by Dems and independents as not-evil). So in all probability in a lot of states you would need a Republican supermajority to actually override the election results, because some Republicans would join Democrats to uphold Democracy.
The problem is that the Senate is, by constitutional design, anti-democratic, and the only Constitutional method to change that requires the support of precisely the states that enjoy outsized representation because of it.
The US constitution was designed to include slavery after all and no direct election of senators, this is just one more of the antidemocratic bugs that need to be ironed out.
Hamilton admitted that the senate was merely a political compromise to get the slave states on board with the idea of a federal government. They wanted 13 individual fiefdoms. The senate was literally formed to give protection to slavers.
