By "countryside towns," would Lafayette be a good example? Why does Lafayette have a larger francophone population than New Olreans if the latter appears to have been the main francophone city in the region in the 19th century?
Because New Orleans attracted immigrants in greater numbers, and much earlier, than Lafayette. A major reason the pays des Attakapas / Opélousas remained so francophone for so long is largely due to their comparative isolation – until the oil boom, there was no real economic appeal in that area of the country for the masses.
So while there is not an exact answer to your query because the Midwest is not a monolithic entity, French has been very much a minority language since the turn of the twentieth century and has been in more or less steady decline since the transfer of Louisiana in 1804.
Not an exact answer to your query, but I wrote this some time ago in response to the question: "What happened to the French-speakers of the Midwest after the Louisiana Purchase?", in which the OP also asked about St. Louis. There might be some interesting info there:
