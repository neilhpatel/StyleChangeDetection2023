Can you pay a custom amount on the website? It says you owe $6000 for instance but you can put in a custom amount of $3000 and thats it? If that is the case then I suggest you do that with the rent amount that you actually owe and ignore anything that says you owe more until someone contacts you.
If you get an eviction notice for any reason due to non-payment. You can go to court and talk about exactly what happened and the eviction would get denied. However, i do not think it would even end up this far.
Make sure you keep every dime of the rent money in your checking. It still belongs to the owner. Once they finally decide to contact you (presumably when they see the text or a very large outstanding balance, they will get into contact with you.).
1. Transfer said deposits to the landlord's successor in interest and notify the tenants in writing of such transfer and of the transferee's name and address; or.
The previous property management did transfer the deposits with the lease so the new owner, and I have a voicemail from the old landlord confirming this, so hopefully that's all good. I'm trying my hardest to make sure everything is documented and I do everything I can to get in touch with whoever owns/manages the house now. Thank you .
"Thank you for your reply. All I am asking for is that you send a message to them asking them to contact me, that's all. Have a great rest of your day.".
And he is mostly right. At this point I would not worry about making a payment until they contact you. They will start noticing soon.
