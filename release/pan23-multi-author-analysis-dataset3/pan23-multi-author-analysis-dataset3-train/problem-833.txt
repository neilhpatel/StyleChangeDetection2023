So so so many 18-45yr olds are just staying here and hoping to not get caught on an overstay for long enough that when they inevitable do get sent home the war will be over.
It's cool I guess. The local economy needed the boost badly and I'm sure most of the Russians on an overstay are the ones that do not agree with the war.
Even Putin is not benefitting from the war, although he surely expected that he would be. The only reason it is still ongoing is because Putin and his closest allies think they will get killed if they retreat.
I didn't understand this myself until I started following YouTube channels that interview random people in the streets across various locations within Russia.
What you come to understand is that the average Russian has an extremely limited understanding of what the modern world is like. In fact, the majority of Russians appear to have never travelled abroad.
Most places will still allow Russian tourists, its a matter of picking a place that also will allow them to claim political asylum once they get there.
Or they could ease the regulations regarding Russians entering their own countries and claiming refugee status, y’know. Kazakhstan isn’t exactly prepared for large influx of immigrants be they temporary or permanent.
