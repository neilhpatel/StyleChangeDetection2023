What are you even talking about? If by "US Israelites", you mean American Jews, then no lol, American Jews cannot cast votes in Israeli elections based on our ethnicity. We're American citizens, we vote in American elections.
Are they now American citizens? If so, then yes, they vote in American elections, just like every other immigrant who has ever come to the US and achieved citizenship. If they are not American citizens, then no, they do not vote in American elections. I have worked as a poll worker before, non-citizens are not able to cast votes; if they try for whatever reason, their votes are discarded. Happy to elaborate on how the vote verification process works, if you want.
Israeli citizens living abroad seem to be required to physically return to Israel to cast their ballots in Israeli elections; absentee voting/vote by mail does not appear to be available for overseas Israeli citizens. Without any knowledge of how many Israelis live abroad, I don't know the answer to your question about a "center-left" bloc, although it is a compelling question. Even if it does exist, given the frequent nature of Israeli elections, I doubt this hypothetical "overseas center-left bloc" could impact most Israeli elections in a meaningful way.
I'm talking about the Israeli elections, not if Israelis with duel citizenship can vote here. I don't think Israel has an absentee system.. that could mean that their center left sect is actually bigger..
I've met several Israelis in my lifetime, all of which are oddly quiet about their views but seem to cater to the notion that Jared kushner is generally awful for the middle east, and definitely do not applaud netanyahu... I always wondered if things in Israel and Palestine would change if there was absentee voting? It seems like not all Israelites support this nor want to stick around for it...
