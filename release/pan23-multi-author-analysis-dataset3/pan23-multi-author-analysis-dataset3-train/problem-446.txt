its because everyone in politics didnt really follow the rule of law. Trump was just so blatent and shitty that he made it SO OBVIOUS to everyone because of the sheer level of disregard that he showed.
Obviously, this is not the same as Trump's "what documents kiddo" strategy, but this is terrible for optics.
Yeah, the optics of this look horrible, especially considering some of them were from his time as VP. There definitely needs to be a better system like you stated, but depending on the classification…I’d assume a lot of normal documentation is still classified because it’s for the President. Just all looks really bad.
It looks bad to people who don't pay much attention, which is most people. For most people what they know about Trump's case is: Trump took classified documents - which is bad, so when they hear that Biden also had classified documents, they'll assume the same, regardless of nuance or detail, because they won't go out of their way to learn the nuance or detail, unless they're weirdos like the people on this sub. Most people get their news from social media, headlines they happen to catch on the news if there's a TV on somewhere, or word of mouth. Which is why it's important to be the educatory voice in your social circle.
