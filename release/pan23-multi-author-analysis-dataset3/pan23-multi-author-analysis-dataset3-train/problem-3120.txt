To the people downvoting, why? All nations solely care about their self interest, the state department aligning the interest of the US and India will be useful in the future, especially in regards to China.
Negative. Russia has already lost in Ukraine. NATO is expanding, they're sanctioned and have been made a pariah state in the west, their military is being degraded. They haven't lost militarily in Ukraine yet but I think its obvious that Ukrainian identity and government isn't going anywhere even if Russia manages to hold some land in the east. Russias war is a huge net loss for them and they've been made and are now seen as a second rate power.
"India is trying to play both sides and remain as neutral as possible for as long as possible. Eventually they will have to make a decision when things "light off" but I don't think it's too much to assume they'll end up on the side of the U.S. and its allies when push comes to shove and they realize Russia isn't as reliable as the U.S. when it comes to securing their economic interests. India is sandwiched between two nuclear powers that don't like each other. Their situation is a very precarious one.".
Vice versa. Don’t forget that India aligned with Soviet Union because of the US’s continued support of Pakistan as well as threats and sanctions against India.
You're pointing out how India's relationship with Russia is going to push them further from US assistance. India's desperation shouldn't be an invitation for US vulnerability. I would love to see India develop a robust defense force independent of Russia and China, but that's not what they are doing. Adding US tech to a program that will likely wind up in Russian hands is dangerous for the world.
You also imply that if India gets some US tech, it’ll just go and hand it over to Russia. Which is pretty stupid. Why would the US do this if that was the case? And I’m sure they know more about what’s happening than your or my stupid ass.
