As for immediate action - your recourse is a civil claim against the parents of the children who vandalized the property. Civil suits are decided based on the preponderance of the evidence while criminal cases have to be beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a lower standard to meet and why civil cases often succeed when criminal prosecutions fail.
You can file a civil claim against the parents for your damages and make them pay for someone to replace the mail box. Get an estimate from someone who is licensed and insured to do the work and sue for that amount plus filing fees (if allowed). You may encourage others to file their own claims in a similar way; the financial loss and having to go to court repeatedly to face angry neighbors in front of a judge will likely result in them being more active parents.
Additionally, you can call your state Attorney General's office about the lack of enforcement from your PD.
If the police desk sergeant or responding patrol officer doesn't want to handle it you can escalate by calling and asking to speak to a lieutenant. If that doesn't get you anywhere, consider escalating to the next high police jurisdiction - like county sheriff or state patrol.
If the local cops or county cops do not want to get involved I would say escalate it to the County/State police. They have the ability to enforce those laws as well and may be more inclined to do so.
