The White House said that one showed “the ability to maneuver”, which makes sense since it was much bigger and likely had more capabilities than the other balloons.
Balloons have no real heat signature, they fly low, they follow the wind and don’t follow a single path.
You can tell who launched an ICBM by infrared signatures and you can trace the trajectory because they’re… ballistic missiles meaning they follow a ballistic trajectory which is quite traceable.
ICBM detection relies on a satellite network of infrared signature detection that detects the heat from a firing rocket engine.
Radar works by bouncing radio waves off of an object within line of sight. It only works on objects it can physically see from the radar station. The US wouldn't be launching balloons from the mainland, so they'd be using a naval launch or launching from another country west of China. Unless Chinese radar was less than 40 miles off shore of US territory and saw us launching a balloon from the mainland, how would they identify it as a US balloon?
I assure you I don't need to read up on this. My job in the US Military for 6 years was operating and repairing such systems.
