â€œWe are defending values, we are defending human rights and rights of everyone at the World Cup. Those fans and the billions watching on TV, they have their own problems.".
Of course. I understand that and have even watched a few of the games at watch parties. It's a lot of fun!
At what point do we look at this and say "This is just a sport, why are people's lives being ruined just for the world to watch a fucking sport?".
Yep. Qatar pretty handily showed that most folks have few morals or values when it comes to voting with their wallets, and that many people in the Western world do not care that 10k slaves died to build a one-use stadium in one of the hottest, and politically most regressive/medieval, places on Earth.
Amazing to me how low FIFA & the world cup can sink, yet the vast majority of people still brainlessly watch it and support it whilst pretending to care. Qatar pegged their audience well, and this is quite the propaganda win for them with very little oil/blood money investment.
