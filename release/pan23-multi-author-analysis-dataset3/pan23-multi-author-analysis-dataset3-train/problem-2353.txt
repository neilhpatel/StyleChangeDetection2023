They offer mediation, and it seems you got it. You said the computer was sent without a video card and the merchant said the shipping weight discrepancies show there's a difference and not what they sent out.
The merchant paid for the shipping, I'm not saying the merchant sent the computer without a GPU, I'm saying the computer I got was without a GPU, I think there is a difference.
I think whatever fedex is liable for it is really up to the merchant and fedex to resolve this issue themselves. Merchant won't go after the customer for a damaged package saying it's the customer who damaged the package or a undelivered package saying the customer is lying about the package. And for the missing parts the merchant is suddenly turing to me and asking me to cover their loss is just not acceptable for me.
There is actually another complaint on BBB, the customer used the merchant's insured shipping label to return a camera and the camera was stolen during shipping. No refund was honored of course. It's just the merchant not taking any responsibility for shipping in either way on their side and leaving all the frustration to customers that does not sound right to me. Anyway thank you very much for your advices.
