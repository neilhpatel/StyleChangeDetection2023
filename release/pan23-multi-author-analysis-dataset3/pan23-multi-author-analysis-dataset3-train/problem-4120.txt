tl:dr --- The US is noticing that some countries are beginning to falter in support for the Ukrainian war, with the majority of the rhetoric behind this decline being that Ukraine is not trying to do peace talks.
Basically this is just the US asking Ukraine to make a diplomatic gesture that Ukraine is trying every avenue for peace, the US knows these talks will not accomplish anything, but it makes for a good optics and makes it harder for people to stop supporting Ukraine since it's doing EVERYTHING it can, even if peace talks would be pointless.
Now we're seeing the US try to change the Ukrainian position from "hey we don't want to make deals with this genocidal and untrustworthy fascist currently mass murdering our people" into "hey we're willing to talk to the genocidal fascist if he is willing to be reasonable.".
This is it. The most delusional take I've seen yet today. Their suffering is worth it, for our sake Holy Shit can you stop sucking your own genitals for five minutes and look at what is actually happening, and correlate that to what you're actually advocating for?
