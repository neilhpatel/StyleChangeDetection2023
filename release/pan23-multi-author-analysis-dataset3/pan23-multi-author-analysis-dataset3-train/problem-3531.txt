It's super illegal. There are reasons that background checks and registration are required to buy guns, and by buying them under your name you're skipping this legal requirement. It's absolutely against the law. You could get in real big trouble.
Beyond this, even if it was legal, he can't force you to comply. You know him to be irresponsible with guns and were relieved when they were taken, so even if it was legal I would advise against it.
No, it's not legal, and you're not old enough to buy a firearm, anyway, so the point is moot. You have to be 18 years of age to buy a long gun (rifle or shotgun) and 21 years of age for all other firearms.
The vast majority of the US has no firearm registration, and Tennessee happens to fall within that vast majority. FYI.
If you don't answer yes the transaction will be over right then (they can't sell it to you if you don't answer yes). If you do answer yes you'll have committed a felony to help your dad (who has already lost his rights to own firearms for a good reason) continue to break the law. No is the only proper answer to your dad, here.
Advice: Use an indirect "no" with your dad to avoid more confrontation. Say you looked into it and you can't help him out because 1) you're under 18 and 2) the store won't let you buy a gun for someone else.
You would only be able to purchase a rifle but don’t do it. No one here is incorrect that you can’t and shouldn’t do this.
NAL, but you say that you're 17 and in high school? Maybe things are different in Tennessee, but I'm pretty sure that you're not old enough to purchase either on your own. I could be wrong, but I don't believe that I am.
