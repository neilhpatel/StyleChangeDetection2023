Even a responsible politician will sometimes not be able to fulfill all their promises. For example Obama wanted to close Guantanamo, and as far as I can tell did his best, but was blocked by Congress.
As such, you should not hate politicians for not fulfilling all their "promises". It is a promise to try, not a promise to succeed.
Or a politician has to compromise with other politicians, so that each get half of what they want. Rarely does one politician have absolute power to get everything he wants, even if you vote for him. You have to understand election promises as promises to try their best.
Most politicians try or appear to try to meet their campaign promises. It's something up in like the 80-90%. Even Trump pretended to do the things he campaigned on.
Her going independent is the best thing she ever did for the left. Now there's not even a need to primary her. She's independent, she's shown she's a traitor and untrue to her word.
Sinema is an incredible outlier and bad actor. The DNC needs to blacklist her from working with everyone affiliated with them. They need to make her so toxic not even the four seasons landscaping company would touch her.
