We are all 3 on the lease. I paid the original security deposit. When I asked the landlord why he didn’t send it back to the original payer (me) he said “roomate 2 was the respondent for all 3 of you” when I did not reply to his text asking if they should send the security deposit to me, as roommate 2 texted the landlord “you can just send the whole thing to me”.
If the landlord only had a duty to return it to somebody, but was not bound to return it to any particular person in any particular way, then your landlord did the proper thing, and your only recovery is from your roommates, who are in possession of your share of the returned deposit.
Then it's not as easy as I'd hoped. With nobody specific declared as the recipient, you have a potentially reasonable claim that it should have been repaid the way it was received, but the landlord could equally claim that he doesn't care which tenant the money goes to, since you're all equivalent tenants, so one's as good as another.
The landlord had a duty to send the money to the proper recipient as you were on the lease, your ex-roommate had to duty to properly distribute the money they received in whole even though inappropriately, as that is unjust enrichment.
If the landlord was required to return it to the original person who paid (you) or split it equally between the three of you, then your old roommates are irrelevant, and you should get it from your landlord.
NAL, this is an area where depending how you approach and handle litigation you can claim the landlord owes you the money or your ex-roommates.
Title: My landlord returned the security deposit to one of my ex roomates who refuses to return my portion. Who is at fault?
