My apologies I've clarified in multiple comments but never changed the OP. I was wrong when I wrote that, having since gotten back with her we were able to get most of it straight. He only ever asked her to submit to a swab, or some other test that he jumbled a couple real terms together to make sound real, but aren't real. He never asked for a field test, or I'm sure it's easy to believe that he wouldn't have asked so many times before arresting her.
First, if his reasoning for belief of possible intoxication is found to be unwarranted, what would that do to how his entire behavior now appears?
Or the behavior of an officer who believed she was intoxicated by something other than alcohol, and only wanted the blood test, without the distraction of an irrelevant 0.000 breath result.
The only times you have the right to have a lawyer present during this situation is during questioning incident to an arrest and prior to submitting a breath test if you’re suspected of an alcohol impairment DUI.
If I’m understanding this correctly, your girl was asked four times to submit to a test that determined drug/alcohol sobriety, said no, then refused to get out a vehicle when an officer asked her to. The arrest sounds legal to me.
So yeah it’s legal. You can argue that it was harassment by the cop but his response would be that he saw someone who he believed to be intoxicated operating a motor vehicle and that’s why he performed the stop.
