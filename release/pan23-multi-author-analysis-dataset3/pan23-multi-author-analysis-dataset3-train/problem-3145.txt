Biden’s forgiveness plan may well end up the best option political conservatives on student loans have.
Do I have it right that the act that allows Biden to forgive student loan debt is the same act that allowed him to forgive COVID relief loans? If the SCOTUS rules it’s unconstitutional, doesn’t that mean that all the other loans need to be paid back?
How the hell is “people who owe private loans” an excluded class when the DoEd doesn’t have the authority to forgive private loans? The DoEs didn’t selectively decide not to forgive private loans: it literally can’t.
If Congress authorizes student loans and requires them to be paid back, the Dept of Ed can't just unilaterally decide not to do so and just forgive them all whenever it feels like it. Regardless of how you feel about student loan forgiveness, executive agencies have to operate as Congress has authorized them to. If Congress didn't explicitly authorize loan forgiveness and the Dept of Ed tries to do it anyways, it gets challenged in court. Which is why these cases are working their way through since the question remains if the Dept of Ed has this power.
His argument sounds similar to the EPA case and executive agencies operating within the authority granted by Congress. Not every case is precedent establishing either, the SCOTUS has narrowed cases before.
No it doesn't. ACB just refused two emergency appeals for the SC to hear the case and pause the forgiveness. She refused both appeals in order to let the lower courts decide first, which is the normal judicial process.
