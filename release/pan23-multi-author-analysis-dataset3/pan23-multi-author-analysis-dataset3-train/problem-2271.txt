There are definitely some major issues with China and how it treats African countries, but they do approach them as more of a partner than a pawn, and that should be taken seriously.
With specific regards to African countries yes, to my knowledge China has spent more effort cultivating those relationships. But it is not a came that can be made globally.
Could you elaborate on that? How exactly does China wield soft power? Or I guess, what exactly is soft power in this context?
Beyond that, the US never has been very good at wielding soft power as compared to the Chinese for example. The US approach has always been a much more direct stick and carrot approach, and honestly you can't tell me that the average American has a single clue as to the cultural intricacies of pretty much any other country in the world you care to name.
In the case of the US, the answer is simple, you don't care and you just brute force the whole thing with no knowledge of, or respect for the other nation...
How exactly do you make foreign policy work if you don't have clue one as to the culture of another nation?
