Unless its promised in your lease that your packages won't be stolen, it is unlikely that the apartment is responsible for package theft.
You can have your packages held by the shipper for you to pickup elsewhere or rent a PO Box and have packages delivered there if you want to go that route.
I recommend getting delivery alerts their USPS, FedEx, Amazon, etc and try to be there when it’s delivered or have someone else pick it up. If you have a lot of packages delivered on a regular basis and can’t be there, look into getting a mailbox at a UPS Store or Post Office. One cost of a significant purchase stolen that the seller doesn’t replace can be recouped by the cost of a place that you can have packages delivered to.
We have a lot of package theft but as long as they’re providing secure location for packages, it’s not really their fault thieves know how to break in.
It already sounds like the packages are kept in a relatively secure area and the complex is willing to share the footage with the police, which is more than they are required to do.
