For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a single Commandment. It ran:
"My sight is failing," she said finally. "Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?".
Yes. There are criminal offenses the DOJ could prosecute. But, this post is about disqualifying a congressman from serving and that is not a criminal case. I suppose if they are convicted of sedition their disqualification should follow. But who imposes it or enforces it?
The way the Courts are these days, it would be a shame if someone filed 34 suits in the home states of each of those congressman, and some of them were removed or resigned and control of congress returned to the Democrats.
The US constitution states that it takes a two-thirds majority from both chambers of Congress to disable (stop) such criminal indictments from being applied to these members of Congress.
Thus, one-third of the members of Congress can't stop such indictments from occurring; it takes a two-thirds majority (in both chambers of Congress) to prevent such criminal indictments from taking effect.
