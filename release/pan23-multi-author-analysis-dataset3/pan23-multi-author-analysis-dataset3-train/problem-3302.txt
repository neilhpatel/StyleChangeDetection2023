Edit: The GOP's only hope is try to pivot away from him, and their best chance of that is if he gets indicted and convicted...
I would bet good money that you were in the "He can't indict right before the midterms" camp. Since the goal post is now moving again, may I ask how far this goal post will travel eventually? Will it maybe see all the wonders of the world? I can't wait to see a full album of the best goal post travel pictures, like in front of the Great Wall (China, not Texas..), or the Eiffel Tower.
He's willy-nilly ignoring subpoenas, and surprise surprise, nothing happens to him on that front either.
I feel like all these statements, same with the recurring "We got him this time!" headlines only serve to distract from the fact that the US justice system is evidently broken.
Where’s the criticism of the DOJ by the mainstream media for not indicting him by now? Shit should have happened months ago and we’re supposed to just act like it’s normal for a guy who almost decapitated our government to be running for office freely?
