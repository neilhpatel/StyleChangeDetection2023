IANAL. As you can see from some of the answers here, the legal question isn't 100% clear, given the facts we have. It's possible that you are entitled to break the lease under California landlord/tenant law, but it's not a "clear win" where you can point to a certain law and the landlord has no choice but to let you go.
The management does appear to have been in breach of the lease, so termination would likely be voluntary on your part (with all the penalties stated in the lease).
That may be enough to get the employee in trouble with the property management group, but I'm not sure it would be enough for you to break your lease without paying whatever fees are outlined in your lease.
You could try speaking with the company you rent from about mutually ending the lease early, but I'm not sure you have a legal leg to stand on to force them to allow the early lease break.
They may not agree to that, and your lease may not give you the right to terminate based on a single incident like this, but that's the first step.
