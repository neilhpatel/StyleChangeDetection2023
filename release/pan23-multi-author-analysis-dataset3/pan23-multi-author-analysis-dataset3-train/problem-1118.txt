Which is exactly what "the right to refuse service" has always been about. It was never a legal catchall for discriminating against everyone.
As someone that worked in the service industry for 16yrs, and had the liberty of invoking that right for several reasons, watching conservatives try to twist "right to refuse service" into a cudgel for discrimination has pissed me off to no end.
I personally don't like discrimination, and it bothers me any time that someone advocates for the withholding of service (in a service industry), but the owners of this restaurant make a pretty good argument (in their press release) for the withholding of service from this group.
Someone below wrote that "the right to refuse service goes both ways", and based upon the comments of most people in support of this business, apparently it does ...
The solution, unfortunately is probably to let businesses decided who they want to serve. I might get down-voted (a lot) for expressing that, but my solution seems to be completely in line with what most people on this thread are advocating for.
