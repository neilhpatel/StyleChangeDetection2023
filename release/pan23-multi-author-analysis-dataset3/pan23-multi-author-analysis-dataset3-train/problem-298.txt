If he can only prove that he told you to vacate on July 28th. Your rights under Wisconsin laws means that you have at least 28 days before you actually have to be out.
You also get 28 days in Wisconsin before you need to leave. Since he only just formally notified you that you need to be, you have 28 days to do so. Technically, you’re a month to month tenant right now. He has to give you ample notice to find a new place to live. If he signed a lease with someone else and they are due to move in before that 28 days, then that is the landlord’s problem.
Info: When did he first tell you to move out? Also, do you have in writing that he agreed to send a new lease to you prior to him asking you to be out by the 1st?
He needs to prove that this notice was actually sent to you. So he should be able to forward that email with the lease in there to you. I would ask for this to be forwarded to me if I were you.
The July 1st date doesn’t mean anything if that’s not the date he notified you that you need to vacate the property.
It’s tenancy laws. Show him the Wisconsin Tenancy laws. He has to give you 28 days notice of vacating the property just like you have to give him 28 days notice if you decided to move.
