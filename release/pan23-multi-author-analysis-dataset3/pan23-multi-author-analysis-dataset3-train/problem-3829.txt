Sounds like these are closer to slave labor and/or death camps than recruitment focused. Which i guess they can recruit from, considering they've already recruited people totally unfit for military service.
I mean it's both though. The tanks are what's defending the trucks from a frontal assault. No tanks = no trucks. So while Russia is logistically hurting, get their whole frontline caved in by proper western armor would seriously damage their organization.
Russia has shown they have trouble(potential for civil unrest) drafting troops, trouble providing equipment for troops, have had their tank and vehicle stockpiles decimated, are running low on precision munitions and have extremely limited ability to resupply themselves.
