I’m not Israeli or even a Jew for that matter but I think it’s because Israel dragged all of it’s settlers kicking and screaming from Gaza and turned everything over to the PA and still got no peace. What they did get was rockets. A whole lot of rockets.
Offering up nothing more then my personal opinion here I believe that if the Palestinians choose peace and play their cards right they could be enormously economically successful. I’ve never been but from what I hear about Gaza and their climate and beaches the place could be another Monte Carlo, and the religious tourism in the West Bank would be off the charts, if people felt safe.
Yeah well, the Tel Aviv beaches are gorgeous and the Gaza coastline is the continuation of them. With all the "publicity" of the conflict, a peaceful solution would be historic world news and will cause a huge financial bloom. There's so much potential to make Gaza truly a beautiful thing. Sadly, the population there is not very educated (lack universities, etc), but this can change with times.
First of all, Palestinians never had a country or official territory to begin with. Some of the Israeli offers were very fair in the circumstances.
Option two - accept defeat and a peace deal, build a country that's smaller than you wanted. The world will celebrate this unlikely peace - A truly peaceful Palestinian country will be immediately beloved worldwide and will be showered with donations. Palestinians have often worked in Israel and with Israelis. Over time, if true peace holds, the new country can benefit greatly from Israel's riches, jobs and technologies.
Since the 90s, the West has been trying to help build up Palestine economically. This then gets stripped and sold for scrap to pay for the lavish lifestyles of the leaders and to pay terrorists.
