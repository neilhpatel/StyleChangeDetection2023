I would have to guess it'll depend on how they organize afterwards. A lot of the equipment will also have gone through a tough war and most is older stuff. Probably a lot will be scrapped, some might be returned if working and still used in those countries inventories. It'll take a long time since I'm sure they'll want to reduce equipment variety and restart their own arms industry again.
Lastly, the post war military likely won’t want 10 kinds of tanks etc. So that may factor into things.
Also Ukraine does have a history of selling off surplus equipment, so destruction or giving back equipment may be part of economic grants used to help rebuild.
I believe a lot of countries are using the aid to Ukraine also as a way to offload dated or overstocked equipment. Essentially, the donation to Ukraine is a good excuse to replace them with newer systems.
Again, if for one second you’d actually read, you’d see that I didn’t say they are not dipping into their own stockpiles to supply Ukraine. That still doesn’t mean that they are not using the “oh look our stockpiles are running low” as an excuse to upgrade. Militaries always have to justify why they need the money for new equipment, and what better justification than “we generously provided support to Ukraine”.
My point isn’t to so much to say that stuff going to Ukraine is outdated and bad. Simply that countries are using the opportunity to justify buying even better stuff.
