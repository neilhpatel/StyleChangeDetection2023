Contact the police. You know what it's called when someone goes into your property and takes your things without permission? I bet you do, and that's what this is.
Yeah, I think that’s right. You got your guitars back, I wouldn’t try to pursue any legal action against the parents as some are suggesting. Let any anger over that dissipate, consider any costs your ex and her parents incurred over the abortion and move and pay what you honestly believe is fair. None of this is legal advice mind you, but this is one of those situations that you could regret in the future if you don’t make things right now.
He recovered the stolen property. IMO, filing a police report could needlessly inflame the situation and wouldn’t do any good at this point. They stole the guitars because they were already moving their daughter and saw the opportunity, emotions were high, breaking back in and stealing more stuff would be a major escalation in behavior on their part. I don’t see that happening from what OP has said.
