I have an additional question. I know some time in Carter's term as president he issued an executive order that forbid the assasination of foreign leaders. Did this have any impact on the CIA's operations that we know of?
Overall, while the CIA has a mixed history, I do not believe the CIA of modern times would conduct such an operation.
Questions like this are almost impossible to answer completely because verifying the facts is so difficult, but the partial answer is that the CIA likely did not try to kill Castro 638 times.
The list of 638 is further suspect because, in 1975, Fidel gave to a list to Senator McGovern detailing what he claimed were 24 attempts on his life by the CIA. However, according to Fabian's book, by 1975 there had already been 336 attempts. Why did Castro only give 24 in his list, then? Also of note, when McGovern provided this list to CIA, they responded that in 15 cases the CIA had no contact with the accused individuals, and in the other 9 they did have a relationship but not towards the purpose of assassination. This claim was confirmed by the Church Committee, which found no evidence of CIA involvement in these instances (Church Committee, 1975, p. 71).
