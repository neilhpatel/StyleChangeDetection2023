⚡️Ukraine, if it succeeds, will break the land corridor from russia itself to Ukraine during the spring-summer offensive of 2023.
It might not take liberating Crimea for this to happen, maybe just regaining the land corridor that goes there.
I think this is dependent on an additional major territorial loss/defeat in Ukraine. All eyes are on the war. If there's no red meat for the nationalists to chew on in the way of tactical or strategic victories for Russia and instead Ukraine comes on top again and again, it's over at home.
Right, and I wonder if what happened there is Ukraine waited to see which side Russia committed more resources to defending, and then attacked the other one.
One can wonder if Putin is so scared of the coming tanks and support from all the countries that he is forced to act now before they arrive in Ukraine?
Next months: Big siege coming with Putin throwing everything he got at taking Kyiv vs slow burn and deaths of Russian soldiers like they do now? What you guys think?
