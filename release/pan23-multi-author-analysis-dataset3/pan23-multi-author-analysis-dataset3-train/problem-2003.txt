It was my understanding that after the Pope excommunicated Elizabeth I (there by giving English Catholics explicit permission to rebel) that the most extreme anti Catholic legislation was passed and also accompanied with popular anti Catholic sentiment among the common folk.
When Mary I took power in 1553, she attempted to reverse the reformation undertaken by her predecessors, which involved a bloody campaign of suppression against prominent Protestants, which resulted in several hundred Protestants being executed by burning.
I think around 300 Protestant dissenters were burned during Mary's reign, and Elizabeth reigned for a lot longer than Mary did, and her regime persecuted Catholics pretty severely at various points, so I definitely wouldn't be surprised if the numbers killed during Elizabeth's reign were higher than Mary's.
Sorry if it's a little bit off topic, but I've heard that under the reign of Elizabeth I there were more executions of religious dissidents than in that of her half-sister's. Is it true ?
