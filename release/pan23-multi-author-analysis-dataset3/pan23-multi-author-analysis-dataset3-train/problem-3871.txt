Huh. All 5 Russian nationals I know are hard-core against the war, although tbf 3/5 were in the states already, and weren't really your typical pro Russia Russians.
The class of Russian society which has always been opposed to Putin for years and years (well before the war) is the college-educated upper middle class - and that is the exact same class of Russian society which make up most of the people fleeing Russia.
