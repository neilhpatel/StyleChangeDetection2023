If they thought there was even a 1% chance it was actually from outside our planet I really doubt we’d have heard about it. This is definitely something less interesting.
Oh I agree, it totally makes sense. But I can see why the military would prefer to use the scarier connotations of “device” as opposed to the more whimsical “balloon” when talking about it.
If they’re avoiding calling it a “balloon” it’s probably because they don’t want it to sound quite as silly when they say they sent in a hundred million dollar ultra sophisticated killing machine to shoot it down.
Wouldn’t surprise me if it actually is aliens and the whole balloon saga was done on purpose by China/US to distract us and make everyone think all these new disclosures are just more balloons.
They will take down this dummy balloon, which is not the same as the ones used outside China, to indoctrinate citizens and foreign countries with a report that will say this is a meteo balloon used by civilian. This is the classical way to fabricate proves for propaganda….
