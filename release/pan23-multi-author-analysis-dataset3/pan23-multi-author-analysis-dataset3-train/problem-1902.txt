We need to stop demonizing people who we have tensions with and trying to appeal to their more accommodating section of their population and let them lead the change. These people are willing to act as a shield. When the incidence of outrage reaches it's absolute point, it will reflect what kind of change they are willing to fight for. When young jews are ordered to shoot other jews in protest, how will the nationalists deny they haven't murdered their own. The schism is real there and obviously being on the correct side of history feels much more appealing. Let's stamp out all forms of organized fascist conspiracies.
"They want to kick out their own families from their own homes" is like saying "the bad guys always wear purple, now shoot those random purple shirt wearers. I'm not even trying anymore WHEEEEEE!" I don't think you understand the fascism of Israel and how based on insular loyalty it is.
The Israeli right, in my experience, is emotionally built by those with a deep, volatile distrust. Or at least, the cynical, self serving netanyahu uses their paranoia of the rest of mankind to keep a strangle hold of power.
One of the mistakes here is assuming that the victims of suffering come through that suffering as better people.
Compassion for mankind, or a deep, volatile distrust of mankind. Both are pretty easy to draw conclusions from being subject to that level of violence.
