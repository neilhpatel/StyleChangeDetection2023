To paraphrase a leftist political streamer: I'm a Super-Capitalist. I believe that the story of people owning their own businesses is so compelling that I think everybody should do it.
Universal Healthcare's an urgent priority, but the SocDem types are already on board - it's not 'socialist' policy any more than having a post office is.
The problem with socialism is that it's not associated in peoples minds with things like having a fire department or accessible healthcare, but 2 things: National Socialism aka Nazism by brand, and Stalin. It doesn't matter than the Nazi's weren't technically socialism and it doesn't matter that Stalin was a corrupt dictator. The power of the brand is just too strong.
Personally, I think the solution is something more like realizing what people actually want from socialism. IMO it's mostly just a cry-out for Universal Healthcare. So, maybe just start there and see where it goes.
I've said before and I'll say it again: Socialism has a branding problem and needs an entirely new name.
The average person is intelligent, but doesn't have the time or want to delve into the complexity of politics. They instead just see brands, like Republican or Democrat and have a general idea what they mean.
