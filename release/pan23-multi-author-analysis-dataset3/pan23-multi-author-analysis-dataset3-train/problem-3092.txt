The Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the U.S. Postal Service may deliver abortion pills to people in states that have banned using the medication to terminate a pregnancy, saying that the sender cannot know whether the recipient would use the pills illegally.
More than a dozen states have since banned or sharply restricted abortion, and more are poised to do so, prompting new efforts to preserve access to medications that can be used to terminate early-stage pregnancies at home.
While the 21-page opinion, posted online late Tuesday, does not change any state or federal laws, it clearly tells federal government agencies how the Justice Department interprets existing law at a time when many states are attempting to restrict access to abortion pills and crack down on providers who send them by mail.
From reporter Perry Stein: Legal opinion says existing federal law allows mail delivery because the sender cannot know if the recipient will use the medications illegally.
The U.S. Postal Service had asked the Justice Department to say whether its workers would be liable for delivering pills that could be used for abortion in a state where it is illegal.
It's more that they were questioning if postal workers would be held liable if someone did use it for illegal acts, since the postal workers would be the ones delivering it. Ruled that no, since they have no way of knowing if it would be used legally or not, and there are definitely legal uses, then they are not liable if someone uses it in a way that they have been told they can't.
