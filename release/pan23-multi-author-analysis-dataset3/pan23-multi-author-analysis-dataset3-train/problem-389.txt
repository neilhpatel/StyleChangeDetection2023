Putin's Russia simply can't be trusted. If they could be, they wouldn't have invaded Ukraine in the first place-- to which they signed in Budapest in 1994 when Ukraine (and Belarus and Kazakhstan) turned all of their Soviet-era nuclear weapons in exchange for 'security guarantees' from Russia, the UK, and the US.
I can also see Russia leveraging Turkey & Hungary to block Ukraine from joining Nato, so I imagine other nations will sign defensive pacts with Ukraine to ensure Russia doesn't get any ideas in the future.
If Russia really is in a shooting war with NATO, albeit a conflict being fought in Ukraine, why arenâ€™t they interdicting the flow of materiel crossing the border from Poland? Why are they letting NATO ELINT assets operate with impunity? Why are NATO member state electro-optical satellites being allowed to go unmolested without laser dazzling or being forced to maneuver to avoid unacceptably close separations with aggressively operated Russian satellites?
Moreover, does Russia think that the actions to date by NATO members represents what a shooting war between it and Russia would look like?
Fundamentally, if Russia truly believes that it is actively in a conflict with all of NATO, is this how it intends to run the war?
You lil shits are getting beaten by Ukrainians only not NATO if you ever think about invading us we would immediatly engage.
I don't see this ending until Ukraine retakes all its territory, then begins fortifying itself against future attacks. Even then I think it will be like North & South Korea, no longer actively at war, no official peace agreement, and a demilitarised zone.
