The plan was quite simple. It was to trigger a contingent election in congress, where each state gets one vote. They simply wanted to prevent the certification from happening, hoping Pence would simply halt it would have been the easy way, otherwise they moved forward with the bloody way.
Trump wins that "election" in congress. Then it would obviously go to court where (I'm sure this is where Ginni Thomas comes in it was probably pre-arranged) SCOTUS puts a bow of legitimacy on the contingent election and says yes this is all well and good. From there we never again have an election for President.
Oh, but let's say the contingent election happened. Then what? Well funny thing, the states get involved AGAIN and independently vote for who they feel won. This would typically match the popular vote and the previous electoral vote. Just as long as there wasn't a stalemate, the individual states are again the ones deciding. Again, the federal government, no single centralized entity has control over the election.
What you find in this system is that voting and presidential election power is largely burdened down onto the state level, not the federal level. By the time it gets to federal level, it's basically ceremony at that point, not a place you change the results.
The big problem with Jan 6 was the electoral votes were done, certified, and clearly defined Biden's win. There was nothing anyone could do about that during Jan 6th.
The whole point of this is a real effort to corrupt the election is nearly insurmountable. This is why the best effort towards this has been exactly the one Republicans have been doing for decades: gerrymandering, selective voter suppression, and a strong media campaign. They ARE the best moves to manipulate the vote, specifically because it's insanely hard to actually corrupt the votes or impede the election process afterwards.
