1. You should ask a lawyer for the details of common law marriage in Texas. I think that it requires two years of cohabitation and presenting yourself as husband and wife. Thus, there may be other routes to marriage if you cohabitated before the marriage.
Because the marriage did happen, and they almost certainly took actions that held themselves out as married. Also, divorce allows for an organized asset split.
I would suggest that you assume this is going to be an adversarial divorce since he literally started this game from the beginning, so make sure you have everything important (especially documents like birth certificates and the like) off site, lock down your credit, and take your half of the money once you pull the trigger (if you haven't already). This SCREAMS fraud.
Do you have any of this in writing? Because providing written evidence of these shenanigans to the judge handling the divorce would definitely help. It would also help set the tone if he tries to take advantage of you in the divorce.
