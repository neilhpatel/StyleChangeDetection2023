No, being based on reality or not really doesn't make a legal difference. They could fire her because her use of a cellphone exposes students to "5G radiation" and a risk of cancer, despite that being a nonsense conspiracy theory.
FYI, the school probably is right to be upset with her asking students about their medical status. While it's not a HIPAA violation, they probably have policies about this, and if they don't, they should write them now.
1. no, its not actually a HIPAA violation to ask if they are vaccinated. A health care provider could not give that information out.
2. She may have violated a specific university policy - some states and some university systems have already passed rules against asking this.
She may be violating the University’s policy on student employees. If the university policy is not to ask vaccination status when hiring students for on campus jobs, she may be in trouble for that. If the lab assistants are unpaid and just working for experience this wouldn’t be the case. Either way she needs a lawyer.
Then she needs an attorney to review her contract. Without reading it, there's no way to guess whether termination for this reason might have breached the agreement.
