How many divisions were there in one army? Depends. You cite AG North and AG South during the Invasion of Poland. These are already a good example of the vast disparities that existed between formations of nominally equal rank during World War II (something that holds true for all countries, not just Germany). AG North had a mainly supportive task in the Polish Corridor and in the northeastern passage between East Prussia and the Brest-Litovsk area, whereas AG South was to carry the main load of the invasion.
There wasn't. An Army Group, as you said, consisted of "a bunch" of armies. An army, in turn, consisted of "a bunch" of corps, whereas a corps consisted of "a bunch" of divisions. How much is a bunch? At least two. That was the plan anyway - some army groups,. like Heeresgruppe E (1943-1945) didn't even contain an army, but instead contained two army corps, three independent divisions, one independent brigade. There was no reason why HG E wouldn't be an army instead of an army group, except morale/prestige.
Okay, so you seem to have a mostly solid understanding of the matter already, but you seem to believe that there must be some sort of catch-all explanation of what makes an Army Group and Army Group.
Secondly, if I understand correctly, what youâ€™re trying to say is that there was no uniform structure at that level, and that army groups consisted of whatever those particular situations called for, right?
