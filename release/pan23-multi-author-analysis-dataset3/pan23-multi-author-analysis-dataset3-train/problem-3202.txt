The speed limit is just that, the fastest you can go. If you think that every vehicle is supposed to go the speed limit at all times then you need to go back to driver's ed.
Specifically to your comment about under speed limit travel- the only roads with minimums tend to be freeways with speed limits 55mph+ on which going below 40mph or other posted minimums would be dangerous. Which is why those roadways also tend to specifically be prohibited to low speed vehicles like bicycles and mopeds and also pedestrians.
There are exceptions that follow, including if the lane is too narrow for a bicycle and motor vehicle to operate safely side by side within the same lane.
In other words, if the bicycle, the car, and the minimum 3 feet of clearance between the two do not fit between the edge line and lane divider, the cyclist is not obligated to ride near the edge of the lane.
Yes, it is legal for the cyclists to use that road, and they are under no obligation to get out of your way.
Bicycles are supposed to ride as close to the curb (or edge) of the road as possible so they can be passed. If the road is too narrow for this then you just have to deal with it. Applicable laws:
