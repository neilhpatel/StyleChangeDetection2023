It's so weird, we went and visited some friends we had not seen in awhile and they kept saying Biden is a "Monster" but when pressed for what Biden has done that has cause them to think he is a monster, they have not answer beyond "He's just awful." or "He's just made everything so bad.".
Yeah. Man's been in politics longer than most of us have been alive, yet some people still act like he isn't capable of doing anything, or know how to get things done, or capable of coming up with his own ideas.
He got a decent boost with that infrastructure bill. He also started talking about the things he's accomplished, which I think made people take some notice. Before that, he was doing so many things without much attention, that I can understand why people would think he was useless.
I think he knows that for long term benefit, he needs to try and enact legislation for major policies related to the environment. He's also wrapping it up in infrastructure to help get it passed. EO can easily be overturned should he lose office, and in some cases, the money required just can't be achieved through EO. The more he puts these things into EO, the more it may hurt his ability to have legislation passed.
