Most Russian don’t give a flying fuck that Ukrainians are being killed. Just like they didn’t care when Georgians were killed, or Chechens were killed and so on and so forth.
Remember when the conscription was announced and a lot of men got the fuck out? Why didn’t they leave before if they didn’t support the regime? They just care about themselves.
Bullshit, majority of Russians support him otherwise they would fill the streets in protest. People just don’t want to accept the sad sad reality that most Russians are pieces of shit.
I don’t think that’s fair to say at all about the Russian people. They are held captive in an Autocratic government that kills and detains any dissenters. Also they are fed continuous lies through Russian state propaganda. Blaming the people comes across as victim blaming. The true wrongdoers are Putin and his cronies. Yes of course there are Russians who align themselves willingly to Putin and believe everything he says, but there are mostly just people like everywhere else in the world, who want a stable life for themselves and their family. I would like to think if I was in Russia that I would stand against this maniac, but then I think about what that would really mean for me and my loved ones. Putin kills those who oppose him. Would my loved ones lives be worth my honor and integrity as a human? I honestly do not know the answer, and my heart grieves for the hundreds of thousands of lives devastated by this despicable dictator. Thank God I live in the USA, where at least I know I’m free.
