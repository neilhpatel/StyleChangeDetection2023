The major credit cards have updater services that notify vendors of your new card information. This is legal. If you want to cancel a service, then you need to actually cancel it and not rely on the payment method not going through.
If the creditor you mentioned has already collected what you owed them up to the date that they charged you, I would strongly recommend that you cancel the subscription before they charge you again. Make no mistake: if neither you or your creditor has terminated the contract and the agreed-upon term for its duration (if it has one) hasn’t elapsed yet, that creditor is probably going to charge you again, even if the payment doesn’t go through.
Not paying for subscription services you haven’t canceled won’t make the debts go away—more likely than not, they’re going to accumulate until your creditors find a way to charge you for them. Depending on the terms of your contracts and the nature of your obligations, you may also be charged interests and late fees.
Your creditors may stop providing the services included in your contract after you default on a certain amount of payments, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re no longer obligated to pay them for the debt that’s pending or that your contract with them has been terminated. They’re gonna try to get their money back one way or another, usually through a debt collector.
Note that whatever temporary benefit you might derive from postponing payments on your subscriptions is bound to be outweighed by the harm your credit might suffer if those debts go to collection. It takes about as much energy (or more) to get your bank to stop approving future payments to your creditors as it does to write your creditors a letter saying you want to cancel your subscription.
