Let's go back a decade to explain why this was the case. The Volstead Act - the legislation providing the nominal teeth to provide a method to enforce Prohibition on the federal level - had a structural weakness that essentially doomed it from the start even if everything else surrounding Prohibition had worked: it required jury trials.
What this led to in turn was a shortcut: the vast majority of cases - which were misdemeanors anyway - were plea bargained out for a guilty verdict and a nominal fine, and if you were crazy enough to actually bring something to a jury trial, then as one prosecutor put it, "The fixers, he said, were found even in the menâ€™s rooms, attempting to bribe jurors hearing those few cases that made it to trial. In the courtrooms crooked lawyers encouraged perjury." In addition given the terrible training and miniscule expenditure on Prohibition Agents - presuming they weren't already felons when they signed up, where by 1930 almost 10% had been fired for lying on their applications for previous convictions, which doesn't even begin to cover those taking bribes - the police work was generally terrible and the courts often had field days with fourth amendment violations, and had legal implications that still exist today. Last but not least, at the beginning of the 1920s there were a grand total of three federal prisons throughout the country - so where exactly were you going to put all the miscreants?
Large scale imprisonment is a modern and new phenomenon, not something with a long history. For example, in 1932 about 200,000 Americans were incarcerated. About half of those in short term detention of some kind or another. That was less than .2% of the population. Today we have about .8% of the population incarcerated and only about a third of them are in short term detention. Incarceration began to grow in the 1930s, began to shrink in the 1950s, then began to grow again in the 1960s to 1970s. Then it doubled between 1980 and 1990 and then doubled again between 1990 and 2000, representing the vast majority of growth. Its growth then slowed before it started to shrink in the mid 2000s. It's since continued to shrink. So we have a pretty secure time period for the explosive growth of mass incarceration: 1980 to 2000. You'll note that starts fifty years after Prohibition ended.
