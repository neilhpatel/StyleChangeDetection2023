The hot water directly from the hot water supply must be at least 120F. With a shower or a mixer tap on a sink, that water is mixed with cold water from the cold water supply line to reduce the overall temperature; the mixture ratio is adjusted with the temperature adjustment control on the shower or tap. If you turn such a control all the way to hot so that only water from the hot water supply is flowing through without being mixed with any cold water, then the water temperature should be at least 120F, though.
You could use a water temp thermometer to measure it if you want but they may not be able to control hot water temperatures in a specific apartment .
But you're water needs to be 120FÂ° at the user end point, so that you can CLEAN and SANATIZE your home. Toilets, floors, dishes, your dogs pooper scooper, or whatever else you may need sanitized that might have been contaminated with bacteria or viral pathogens.
Maybe iv done a poor job articulating this...The water getting that hot is for cleaning things other than your body.
It has nothing to do with how hot you shower or bath. You can adjust the water down so that it doesent burn you.
It does. But it's not for bathing purposes. It's for sanitizing. Hot soapy water is key for cleaning and sanitizing stuff. Dishes, bodily fluid clean up, ect.
