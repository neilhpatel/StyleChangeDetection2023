If you signed a lease you are not squatting. If you have a copy of the lease that is best, because it has all the dates on it as well. (This also means they probably have no idea about your security deposit, etc...).
You would get paperwork if they were to attempt to kick you out. If you had your lease in court they would owe you money plus legal fees.
If they try to take you to court to evict you, your lease and evidence of prior attempts to pay will help you.
Even if you were a squatter, they would still have to formally evict you, which means providing you with a notice and then going to court after the notice expires. Once it went to court, you would be able to take the original lease (which is still valid even if the new company doesn't have a copy) to the judge.
There's 0 chance of you getting legally kicked out tomorrow. If the landlord tries, it is an illegal eviction.
Rent is owed to the owner of the property. The leasing agent is just that, an agent, not the principal (the owner). If the previous management company is no longer the agent you owe them/it nothing.
