However, he still has the residual love from the Olympics here - he is considered to have saved them. And there will be an announcement between now and his election about Utah possibly getting the Olympics again, which will generate some good feelings for him from Republicans.
I think you misunderstood what his comment and this thread is about, which is him talking about his chances of winning a US Senate seat in Utah, which is voted on by only people from Utah. You seem to have assumed that you were replying to someone talking about something else (like a national election of some sort).
We weren't talking about any primaries, let alone a national election. His anecdote is directly relevant to this post. You, talking about the national stage, especially in this thread, is irrelevant.
I'm saying that his anecdote is largely irrelevant to the national stage. Romney has about zero shot to win a Republican primary let alone a national election.
Romney never won the presidency, so he can't be re-elected as President. He has won a Senate seat in Utah, and in fact he currently holds that office, so a re-election bid would clearly be for the seat he currently holds.
You don't even need to read the article to know that he's only talking about winning a Utah primary for Senate. It's right there in the title: Re-election bid.
