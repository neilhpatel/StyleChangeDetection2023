This really hits the nail on the head. I feel like I’m going crazy sometimes out here. Both when I run into people with the antithesis of these virtues and when I myself fall short. Thank y’all.
So, no thanks from me. This thread does more to discourage interest in learning about history than any place on reddit. So, sit on your academic thrones, mods, doing your great work of crushing interest and discussion about history. Nothing but empty threads. Yeah, I need to unsubscribe.
Unpopular opinion. I don't like this subreddit at all. I get all excited about a subject, and even check ... 60 comments. Open it up. Nothing. Comment deleted. Comment deleted. Of 20 posts on this subreddit, 1 might have a response good enough.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind it if it showed zero comments on the front page. But I've opened up AskHistorian threads that say they have 60 comments, only to find nothing.
I am a little disappointed when I open the 28 comments for an interesting question, and find only a sea of [deleted]. But far more than that, I remain deeply impressed by the mods' tireless war against low effort posting, so that the door remains open for another great answer.
