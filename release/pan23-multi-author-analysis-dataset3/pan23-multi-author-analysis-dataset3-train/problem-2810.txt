“A Republican running for South Dakota state Senate was charged with felony child abuse Thursday for allegedly grooming and raping a young family member for years, according to local reports.
Joel Koskan, a third-time candidate for the state Senate, allegedly groomed and abused the young girl for at least six years starting in 2014, court documents obtained by the Mitchell Republic revealed.”.
I only post this comment about his political affiliation due to the fact that the Republicans are accusing the Democrats of running a pedophile Cabal that drinks the blood of children, even though I seem to read weekly about another Republican pedo.
Given all of the Qanon pizzagate bullshit about child molestors and pedophiles that has sadly seeped into the mainstream of republican discourse..... it sure seems odd that every single one of these stories seems to end up being a Republican.
For a party that seems to obsessively accuse the other side of being pedophiles and rapists, Republicans sure seem to have a lot of pedophiles and rapists.
