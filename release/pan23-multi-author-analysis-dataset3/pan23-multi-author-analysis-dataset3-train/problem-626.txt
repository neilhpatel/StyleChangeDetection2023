Texas imposes a duty to mitigate on the landlord, which makes this less risky than it would be in NY or other states that will soak you for the full value of the lease if you breach early. Like most states, a TX landlord has to take reasonable steps to find a new tenant, and has to let you off the hook once a new tenant starts paying.
As with any contract, a tenant always has the right to say "F--- it. We're leaving. Sue us." There's always a chance the landlord won't sue. If the landlord did sue, OP would have the right to swing for the fences and use this situation as their justification. It might even win.
It's an argument you can make, sure. There might even be case law or at least some general sense of how much leeway local judges give in circumstances like this.
You have legal recourse to sue for damages if you were damaged. If no one has broken in and messed with your stuff, you don't have monetary damages to sue for.
You don't have damages to pursue that you could sue them for. You can report them to the city if you wish.
