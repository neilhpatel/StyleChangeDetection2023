If it was in the original lease agreement that she paid, then she would have to amend the lease when she's able (based on Washinon laws with proper notice) and go from there. But she would also still have to go through the proper channels to remove them from the premises as well (usually give them proper notice and then if they haven't left go through the courts for a lawful eviction and then if they don't leave, police removal of the tenants and their property).
Tina needs to provide them with proper notice to vacate so that she can assume possession of her home, and if they do not leave, Tina needs to evict her tenants (and by extension her tenants' tenant) through the courts. If Tina's property is within Seattle city limits, it would be best for Tina to consult with an attorney who represents landlords so that she understands the process and approaches this properly. That's a good idea in any case, but especially within Seattle as she needs to be sure she properly presents and complies with the requirements for .
These people are not squatters by any means. Tina took them on as tenants, and they remain Tina's tenants with all their tenants' rights in tact.
Based on my experience with landlord-tenant disputes, I doubt the tenants will go quietly, so Tina should plan on retaining counsel.
I'm not sure about Washinon law, but in my jurisdiction, Tina would be obligated to serve a notice to vacate and let the eviction make its way through the court. She's the property owner, so yes, she has a right to reclaim her residence, but she did take these people on as tenants, and as a result, they have rights to occupy the property until a) they decide to leave or b) she notifies them that they need to leave. And that's in a state that, by custom, favors landlords over tenants. Washinon law is probably weighted the other way.
Questions: 1) Did Tina ever change her primary address (with the post office, etc.)? and 2) Did these tenants sign leases?
