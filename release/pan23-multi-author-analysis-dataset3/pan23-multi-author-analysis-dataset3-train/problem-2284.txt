The Thirteenth Amendment forbade slavery and involuntary servitude, “except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.”.
Oh Come on, there is a huge difference between slavery and involuntary servitude as criminal punishment. Having inmates clean up road sides is a reasonable and fair punishment.
1. The condition in which one person is owned as property by another and is under the owner's control, especially in involuntary servitude.
the enslaving and owning of human beings and their offspring as property, able to be bought, sold, and forced to work without wages, as distinguished from other systems of forced, unpaid, or low-wage labor also considered to be slavery.
tldr: slavery is a broad blanket term which covers a variety of practices, of which chattel slavery is a particular one. Forced/unpaid prison labour as a punishment is also slavery.
no, slavery is the practice of compelling someone to work without proper compensation. What you're referring to is chattel slavery, the most common type practiced in the US at least, whereby the slaves exist as a form of transferable property that legally belong to whoever has bought them.
I understand by definition they can be the same, but it is hard to argue “slavery” isnt being used in these articles and posts specifically for a reaction for its widely known racial connotation.
It is incredibly deceptive. Im against prison labor, and the ground we should be fighting on is really what we want prisons and reform to look like. Instead we have a bunch of “look at these morons voting for SLAVERY!” making a rational discussion impossible.
