The Marshall deal depended on it, but the resistance movement also made Indonesia less profitable. Fun fact: the parents of our current prime minister were kicked out of Indonesia. Until recently and only under immense pressure did he begrudgingly apologize for the centuries of oppression, murder and robbery.
My memory, I'm 46 years old. I must admit memories are not to be trusted. But it is in line with his behaviour regarding Zwarte Piet or the open internet. His own opinions are very different until there is absolute need for an official line.
After years and years. For years he didn't want to apologize saying his parents spent time in a Japanese internment camp. Well shit, they were caught robbing Indonesia! The PM before him was an even worse piece of shit, that is true.
And I think it's strange to criticise the current PM for this, when the previous PM's never did it either.
I have never heard he didn't want to apologise because his parents live in Indonesia. That's very strange, especially considering he is apologising on the behalf of a country, not his personal or family actions.
As far as I understand Indonesia attempted to kick us out, but we stayed by means of terrible bloodshed. Only after pressure from the international community, especially the US, did we end our oppression in Indonesia.
