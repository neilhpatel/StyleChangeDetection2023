Trying to judge this in an ongoing war is pointless, because there is too much propaganda on both sides to accurately assess losses. I trust Ukrainian numbers as little as I trust Russian numbers.
Right or wrong, there are no real neutral parties in this mess. Also, unless there are new numbers, the last US 110k number refers to casualty, which means injured or killed... So no, I will not try again.
Try again. 110k Russians are killed so far. 15k died in Afghanistan. US and neutral estimates are in the same vicinity. Not sure you want to challenge the time consumed on the calendar, but it would not surprise me.
Long run sanctions on oil field equipment and services probably mean russia's ability to produce declines.
Not at all. Looking through the comments and I can't really tell if it's mindless Indian nationalists or russian trolls pretending to be that, but it doesn't matter. No one had anything against India. The idea is to defeat Russian aggression and it's working. They are losing this war an in the most humiliating way, as they deserve to.
Are u sure they are losing this war in a humiliating way? I mean yea sure their economy is getting crippled but am pretty sure they still have a large chunk of Ukraine under their control.
People should realize that Russia's going to lose and Ukraine is going to get the backing it needs for that to happen. So anyone betting on Russia escaping its fate needs to seriously reconsider.
