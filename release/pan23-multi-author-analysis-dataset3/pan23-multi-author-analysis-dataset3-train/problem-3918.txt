So, chances are, your average citizen, even if they didn't take their duties terribly seriously, would already have experience with swords, and with at least a halberd or pike or a crossbow or firearm. By the end of the 16th century, halberds were likely to have been replaced by pikes, and crossbows by guns, but halberds, especially, were still used in ceremony and were still useful in firefighting, so they remained in town armories for a long time.

There is not less armour worn in the late 16th century as compared to the early 16th century, but the halberds still diminished a lot during that time. It probably mainly has to do with the switch of focus from melee oriented formations to ones focused on guns, which removes the need for halberds but keeps the pikes for anti-cavalry roles and the occasional melee.
My understanding is that halberds were most useful (as weapons, not props/symbols) when a pike formation was in melee combat and starting to blend with the enemy, ie. the melee fighting wasn't being done at the end of a pike and enemies were starting to get in amongst the pikemen who were ill suited for that kind of a fight.
