Withhold the rent and put it in escrow (or a separate account) so you can prove that you are able to pay all the back rent to the bona fide owner when they prove to the satisfaction of the court that they are the entity who is owed the rent.
You can speak to the attorney you all engage together about whether (s)he can be paid out of the rent that is collected from the resident community, or if you need to pay him separately, or if there is an organization that will pay that attorney. Even if the attorney needs to be paid by the residents separate from the rent, by splitting it between the 15-16 units, it should not be too expensive, and will protect the rights of ALL the residents.
Speak to that attorney about the issues and ask that the attorney hold ALL of the rent since the previous owner died in their escrow account. That way, it will all be accounted for, and an actual attorney can hold it. You'll have a good defense in case one of the possibly owners does start eviction proceedings.
