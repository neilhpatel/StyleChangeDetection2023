Makes me sad, as the Brittish came to Australia in 1770 and stole all the furtile lands around the edges of Australia and no treaty was ever offered to the Indiginous people, even now. Yet they can do it for the moon.
The moon is also kind of odd as far as a land claim goes because it has no oceans or body of water. So hypothetically it'd be like how a small group of people are trying to claim all of the Southern Sahara... a land mass the size of France.
That's hypothetically why an American planted their flag on the moon, to claim it American. But it has no relevance in international law. International law typically recognizes land claims for occupied areas. Which is why most disputes in the world are over unoccupied areas and it's why colonial masters went to such trouble in putting people on pointless islands.... like Miquolon.
In the context of America colonizing Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, Wake island, Midway, The Philippines, and garrisoning substantial numbers to troops in South Korea, and Japan— yeah it’s kinda fucked to call ANY country on land grabbing.
Kinda like how China has built islands to try and claim more territorial waters, you can assume a similar thing could happen on the moon.
China can do a similar thing by claiming space on the Moon by building structures. Maybe they'd builds so many cheap/flimsy structures so as to cover as much area as possible so that other nations cant really land in good spots without knocking something over (which would be a huge diplomatic fiasco).
Sure, just SAYING something is yours doesnt make it yours. But imagine if another nation went to the Moon and destroy the flag/launcher/rover we left their because "it was in the way".
Imagine another, even CRAZIER scenario: a nation goes to the moon and covers most of it with structures.
Imagine going to the moon ang building as many structures as you can. None of which are actually viable buildings, but they "could" be.
