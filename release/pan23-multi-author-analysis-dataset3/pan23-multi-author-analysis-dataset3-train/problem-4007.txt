Would it not make more sense to simply decline talking to the police, and tell them they do not have permission to enter your home?
If someone were foolish enough to call the police simply refuse to talk about your day. What does that mean? If police come to your house you don't have to open the door. If they ask you questions you respond "I don't want to talk about my day, get off my property." If they don't get off your property and talk to you from the street or public easement sidewalk then call the on duty officer at the station that supervises them. If that doesn't work call the sheriff, they won't do anything but in such a case the police are trespassing and the sheriff and deputies could arrest the police officers for trespassing (they almost certainly won't though).
Of course if you call the police, and again "big if", if they show up, don't engage anything about your dispute with home depot, just tell the police that they are trespassing and you want them to leave.
The police need a warrant to come into your property outside some very narrow exceptions, and unlike the police a judge is much less likely to try and trick you into waiving your rights. A judge usually doesn't want a specific outcome and won't be so belligerent. The magistrate is a much lower standard than a judge, but there will be a written record for actions taken by a magistrate and these have to show intent and basis, a lack of these things in itself creates a serious problem for the government (ie the police). Magistrates can issue some warrants in some jurisdictions. I mentioned this because ultimately if things go into abnormal land you will end up in front of a judge who can fix most all of this using money in a judgment.
