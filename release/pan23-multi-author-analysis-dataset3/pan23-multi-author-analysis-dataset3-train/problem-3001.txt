Removing books from libraries is far short of censorship. Your local library doesn’t have every single book written. They choose what they want to stock. Every library does it. Are they all banning books?
At least they aren't burning the books? But yeah, the idea that this war has "turned into a fight between democracy and authoritarianism" is just false given how dysfunctional ukraine is as a liberal democracy.
Lol people slowly realizing that the Ukrainian government isn’t the bastion of freedom that they thought it was.
Edit: I'm as much on the Ukrainian's side as anyone sane and decent, but I'm honestly surprised and disturbed that support for Ukraine has to be absolute in all things in some people's eyes. I think Ukraine is fighting a good fight and I will continue cheering them on in liberating their homeland, but when their officials pull questionable actions like this one it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. My support won't waver over this, but I will still call it out as wrong.
Would you be happy if we had burned German literature after WWI, because they were the enemy for most European/American nations? How about French literature after Napoleon?
