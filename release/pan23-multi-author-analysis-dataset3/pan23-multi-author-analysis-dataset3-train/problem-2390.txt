The pdf file covers the rules and regulations for swimming pools and lifeguards in the state of Iowa.
Yes, that is what a lifeguard does. They watch a pool to make sure people aren't drowning and that they are safe. You can't just ask someone to watch a pool if they don't have the training to rescue someone. The lifeguard had not shown up yet so they asked someone that isn't a lifeguard to perform that person's job until they arrived.
That doesn't clarify whether being asked to watch the pool automatically makes you a lifeguard. Not all pools have lifeguards.
They aren't asking her to be a lifeguard (according to the text of the post), just to watch the "pool area".
No, but it is another thing they can be cited for, and does indicate they intend to have lifeguards. (I used to be on our swim club board and lifeguard regs are deeply personal to me LOL--if we were supposed to have a lifeguard in duty, if there was no lifeguard, we had to close).
two lifeguards on duty, one of whom shall be guarding the pool at all times for up to 125 swimmers in.
times for up to 30 swimmers in the water; for over 30 swimmers in the water, there shall be at least.
