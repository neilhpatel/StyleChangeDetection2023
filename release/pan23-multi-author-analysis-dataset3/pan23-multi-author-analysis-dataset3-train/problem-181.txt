Yes to all of the above, absent an employment contract that would protect you from being fired for those things. They can make almost any rule they want, and fire you for violating it, unless the rule is illegal. And such things are very narrowly construed, within the realm of public policy, protected classes, etc.
There are a couple ways this policy could be unlawfully discriminatory, but it depends on specifics. How does it apply to men whose wives/girlfriend are watching their children at home? If they aren't required to put their children in daycare, then that would be sex discrimination. How does it apply to people with adults in need of care, like a disabled parent? Or even just people who have others in the house while they work, like a spouse. If they are allowed to stay in the house, then that would be discrimination on the basis of familial status.
But, if the policy strictly prohibits anyone other than the employee from being in the house while you work, that's probably legal, even if it is crazy.
