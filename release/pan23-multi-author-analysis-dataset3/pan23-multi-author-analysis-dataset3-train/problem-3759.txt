This is as much as US as it is Russian fault. It was central on policymakers that some state less terrorist group could end up buying Russian nukes from Ukraine for a loaf of bread. In one of my high school textbooks it was alleged some bicycle in Chicago is better secured than a Soviet nuclear base next to Kyiv.
Is it fair? No. But everyone thought 1990s was going to be "end of history" where US will now lead the new "mono-pole" world and neither Russia, China, Latin America, Europe, or Middle East have any kind of leverage/choice from "American leadership".
They've also strenhened the links between NATO countries, renewed people's interests towards NATO, and proved that it was still valuable when 5 years ago it looked obsolete and the US was on the brink of pulling out of it (well, the Russia-sponsored US president did at least).
The constant threats against non-NATO countries and Russia only invading non-NATO countries (but doing it frequently) has pushed Finland/Sweden towards NATO, and probably given some strong regrets to others who thought staying neutral to not offend Russia would be a good idea ... when it makes them easy prey for Russia.
They do say that a lot so I agree it is part of their national discourse but invading Ukraine and absorbing Belarus (whether the rumors of an actual takeover are true or it stays a puppet regime) puts them directly on NATO border.
And yet a large amount of their population has been brainwashed to accept it because they think Russia is effectively at war with NATO, contrary to every ounce of truth out there.
This support of the war we see coming out of Russia is mostly coming from people who are very far removed from any reality of what war means. Growing mobilization takes away that pretense.
