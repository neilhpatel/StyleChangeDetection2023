Hmm? What's that? They had a big banner over their heads that read "we are all domestic terrorists? ".
Well, yeah. They’re the most common extremists here. Kinda goes without saying, I’d think. We don’t have a lot of other types of extremists, like ISIS or militant leftist groups.
To be completely honest, I’m surprised at how many mass murders aren’t tied to extremism at all. The majority of mass shootings aren’t politically motivated or demographically targeted at all, just straight up killing for killing’s sake. For every Pulse Nightclub we have four Gilroy Garlic Festivals.
Not that one’s any better than the other, it’s just hard to believe how much violence isn’t motivated by any kind of specific hatred or extremism.
You just got shown evidence that extremist violence has been ramping up hard and you keep trying to pretend that isn't something worth talking about.
Considering that far right extremist violence, and white supremacist violence, are on the rise and have been for some time, yes. They definitely feel emboldened.
