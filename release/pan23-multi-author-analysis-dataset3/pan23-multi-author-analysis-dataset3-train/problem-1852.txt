Depending on your background, and desire to read more academic writing, I can make a couple suggestions.
A little more academic in style is Lightfoot's . I really like this book because Lightfoot weaves together archaeology, ethnology/oral history, history, and anthropology to tell the story of colonialism in California. By threading these different strands together a more full picture of colonialism emerges. It is a little denser reading, though, so start with the first book to get your bearings.
If you want a great, non-whitewashed introduction to the impact of colonialism in the Spanish Empire (and later U.S.) I highly recommend . While not focused solely on California, Res√©ndez shows the vast geographic and temporal spread of slavery throughout the Spanish Empire. This foundation, though, is vital for understanding what happens in California, and the end of the book focuses on the continuation of Indian slavery in the northern borderlands after transfer of California and New Mexico to the U.S. this would be a great place to start your journey.
How can I learn as much as possible about the history of California natives, especially during Spanish and Mexican rule, and shortly after U.S. takeover? I'll take anything, including film and novels. I know nothing but the whitewashed textbook from 4th grade history.
