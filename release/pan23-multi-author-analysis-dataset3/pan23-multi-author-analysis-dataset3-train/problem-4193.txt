Can't the upstairs neighbors start responding to folks on OP's porch? Meaning someone rings his doorbell or knocks and they start saying he doesn't live there anymore?
If the visitor actually rings the doorbell, yes. I’m not sure if the 2 way communication can be engaged without actually ringing it, I’ve never tried on mine. But you can get notifications when motion is detected, so they could definitely know when someone is coming or going, when packages are delivered, etc.
Ring doorbells not only record video, but also record audio and can be used for 2 way audio communication. Now, CT appears to be a one party consent state when it comes to wiretapping/eavesdropping, but from what I can find, that one party must be physically PRESENT.
And to be clear, there are situations where recording audio without consent in a public space does in fact classify as wiretapping/eavesdropping.
Finally, there is quite a bit of discussion going on in the legal realm regarding the legality of Ring type doorbells, specifically because they include the ability to capture audio. And even more specifically, there are conversations going on among landlords of multi-tenant dwellings out of concern over liability if they permit tenants to use such devices.
You should also familiarize yourself with state and local landlord/tenant law and your lease to determine your landlord's responsibility.
