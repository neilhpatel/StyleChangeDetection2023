I say this as a reform Jew that has literally been told I'm not Jewish enough by these very same people.
To be very, crystal clear: These "Jewish Allies" are not remotely representative of all Jews. Personally, I think they've betrayed the memory of our ancestors who lost their lives at the hands of people very much like Donald Trump in terms of political ideology and ideation.
Fuck these clowns. THIS was the breaking point? Not the literal concentration camps while he was president? Not the overt racism towards various non-Jewish groups? Not the wanton violence towards peaceful protesters? NOT THE FUCKING COUP ATTEMPT???
Whaaaat? So youâ€™re tellin me that the (definitely not a fascist we swear he just tried to do that insurrection for democracy I swear guys) also hangs around with openly anti-Semitic (and in one case openly anti-democracy) people? ðŸ¤¯.
This. I can't stand the news having round table do discussions about Trumpism being over and guys like Kemp, Pompeo, Haley, and all of them being "normal" Republicans.
Trumpism is the true face of the Republican party and all these clowns had no daylight between them and Trump until recently. They're just trying to put the mask back on now.
