Are they actually changing your time cards? I'm just looking for more clarification on your use of "shaving". Are they taking some hours away from you on one pay period to apply to another, or are they just cutting back your hours?
The bolded is what really matters. You would only get overtime on any hours in excess of 40 hours a week since you were working 10 hour days. It really comes down to what is considered a work week at your place of employment, that will determine how much overtime you are actually entitled to.
You say that they are having you work less hours this week, so the amount of hours you worked per week matters.
In terms of overtime, it all depends on when a "workweek" is, you can find that information on a past paystub. At the very least you are entitled to 20 hours of overtime as there would be at least one workweek with 60 hours in total for that workweek.
Title: Been working 10 hour shifts for 6 days a week the last 2 weeks and DM just informed me that only 5 OT hours will be approved.
