If your complex currently has the correct amount of handicap spots, they are under no obligation to install more. Moreover, you will not get an assigned spot as assigned handicap spots are not a thing save for van accessible spots and enforcement on those is zero. So even if you were able to get more spots, you could be in the same situation as you are today. Handicap spots are first come, first serve.
Now if you feel that one can reserve a marked handicapped parking spot, I'll bow out with my apologies and thanks for your citation.
Note in that example the person is given a reserved space in non-reserved parking. That is different from giving designated handicap space to a single user. Designated handicap spaces cannot be reserved.
You cannot designate a handicap space(s) as "Glittering-Mind-9003's Space". You can designate non-handicap space(s) as "Glittering-Mind-9003's Space". Custom parking space(s) is the solution sans any handicap designation.
The accommodation is giving you a reserved space (or spaces) that solve your issue and function like a handicap spot.
To clarify, the reasonable accommodation is not giving you the reserved handicap space. Then that space and the building would likely be out of ADA compliance.
