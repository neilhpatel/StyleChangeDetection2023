What’s your legal question? Police deal with noise violations. Your title seems to say there’s an issue with you being filmed.
You have privacy on your property covered by blinds/ walls. Outside that if you’re visible you can be filmed.
As long as they’re not bypassing normal privacy things you’re allowed to be filmed. Ie you have a fence and they used something to see what’s behind that that’s not legal. Being on a porch is visible.
Can neighbor continue to film me on the porch? Is he allowed to film me making a police report? He did this with audio and video recording without my consent and even harassed me about it later today repeating details such as my SS.
I live in a apartment building and he videotapes me and is dumb enough to keep showing me even though I have asked him and the landlord to remove it to no avail. He recorded my police report.We also live in the same apartment building.
You do realize a made the police report in person on the property right? The reason I keep asking if him filming a police report is illegal is because I used my personal information during the report such as my SS and he repeated my conversation with the police back to me verbatim.
