That's what I was thinking as he's listed similar new units for \$80k more than I signed for in terms of base price. I will contact an attorney today, thanks.
I am a lawyer. I am not your lawyer. I do not practice in Texas, and you should speak to a licensed attorney in Texas.
Also, will the completion of this house being delayed significantly impact me. For example, if you might have increased rent for your current location or end up having to rent a place if you've already contracted a sale on your current house. These are the practical realities that cost us even when you are legally in the right. You can collect these as damages. But, it's also can you bear that much financial risk.
Then you have the practical. Building materials and labor have gone through the roof in the last year. Lumber prices alone have made everything more expensive including furniture. So do you want the job done on time and right, you are going to need to balance that against what is fair to you under the contract.
