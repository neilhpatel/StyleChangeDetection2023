The Nazis actually didn't like Christians, as their failed attempts to implement shows, and there's some claims that they actually wanted to eradicated it from German society.
Other way around. The Orthodox Church was directly infiltrated by the state and used as a puppet for the atheist Soviet Union while they stamped out smaller, independant religious groups. The current and prior patriarchs were KGB agents.
"...Rosenberg drafted a plan for the future of religion in Germany which would see a Positive Christian Reich influenced by Germanic paganism conduct the "expulsion of the foreign Christian religions", the replacement of the Bible as the supreme religious authority with Mein Kampf as the holy scripture of Positive Christianity, and the replacement of the Christian cross with the swastika as the universal symbol of European Christianity in Nazified Christian churches.".
Eh not really. It’s said he’s the one true god. The Christianity essentially wiped out the Vikings. They also fucked up the muslims.
