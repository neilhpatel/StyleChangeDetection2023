Then around 2019 the Ukrainian national guard started rebuilding the unit as national guard military police unit and increased its personnel under national guard leadership.
National Guard is still under the overarching authority of the commanding officers of the Ukrainian armed forces and follow the same recruitment standards.
So you don't even know your own history, Nazism wasn't a new ideology, it just had a new name. It doesn't matter why groups like Azov existed, they were purged and are no longer the same group. You're arguing over the past, it is not a nazi group. With your logic the Luftwaffe is a Nazi group since they were founded under the Nazi party.
Fact: when they were founded and for a good portion of their history they were very much a Neo-Nazi organization.
It's kinda a self report when people care about 1 battalion that was neo nazi nearly 10 years ago more than an actual fascist country invading Ukraine.
These aren't equal, a battalion that was formerly neo nazi compared to a fascist regime openly talking about the legitimacy of a Ukrainian state and people.
If I check reddit user logs who complain about azov so much, do you think I will see them complaining equally about an actual fascist state wiping out Ukrainians as a people? I wonder.
