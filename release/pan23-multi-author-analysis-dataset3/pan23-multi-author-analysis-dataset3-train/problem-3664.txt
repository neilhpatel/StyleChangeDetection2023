No, they apply to harassment, promotions, firings, etc. You still haven't exactly explained where the discrimination is. For example, if someone were to only promote women to senior level positions and never men, if a man applied and was denied because he's a man. What is actually happening that is discriminatory? There very well may be, but there's a lot of vagueness in the answers.
Abuse isn't necessarily illegal. If every junior is being overworked, that's not inherently illegal. If only the American juniors are being overworked, and never the Indian, then that could be a legal issue.
It sounds like the problem is that they haven't hired enough people, not that they are discriminating against American citizens. In what sense is the company denying employment to Americans to pick Indians instead, and specifically due to their national origin (or not hiring Americans because they are American)? If an American believes they were not hired due to their national origin, they'd then pursue their case.

If the junior employees feel discriminated against based on their national origin specifically they can make an EEOC complaint.
