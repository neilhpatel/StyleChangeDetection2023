But Russians are suffering more. If Western countries were supporting Ukraine more willingly, Ukraine wouldn't have lost this much manpower and they might have had some resources to launch a counter-offensive.
And yet the largest battle in the war so far, with Ukraine sending more and more troops to hold and reinforce, but like you said “Bakhmut isn’t strategically important”.
Says the Ukraine bot, he’s not a bot and neither am I, literally American, just because someone says anything negative about the Ukrainian war effort doesn’t mean they’re a bot.
Nah it’s just the dickriding by a lot of you in this sub is insane. I mean don’t get me wrong I want Ukraine to win this war too but you guys are straight up ignoring facts and believe any positive statements about Ukraine.
Genocide fanboy? Soledar is about to fall I don’t understand people like you, you people can’t just ignore anything negative about the war in Ukraine, Ukraine is completely reliant on NATO for weapons and supplies, which they aren’t gonna supply Ukraine with forever. I’ll be back to this thread when Soledar and Bakhmut fall waiting to see what goons like you have to say.
