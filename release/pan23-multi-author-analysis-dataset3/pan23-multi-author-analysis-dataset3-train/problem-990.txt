Were you receiving, and paying, "[under] estimated" bills all along? Is this retroactive charge the result of the utility having access to and taking readings at a certain recent date? Or is there a separate large service charge for having the meter inaccessible for a long time? Is it possible that the meter was unable to be read over 2 years ago, and they are now catching up for underestimated billing including the previous tenant's time for who knows long? Does the bill have the two dates when the meters were last read?
1) what was the last time the meter was actually read? I understand that you were the first tenants but that doesn't mean that there was no usage before you moved in (contractors etc). If the meter was literally never read until now it's no surprise that your bill was estimated incorrectly as they would have nothing to go by.
Since you have electric heat and AC, it's not too surprising that you would have a huge bill on a 4-person apartment, and depending on what you were paying every month I'm honestly surprised it's not higher after 2 years. I'm curious what your regular ConEd bills were that you were paying?
It is understandably very frustrating to get hit with an unexpected $4k bill, but you can easily work out a payment plan with ConEd if you don't have the money immediately. Despite the general negligence of the LL, from the info here it sounds like ConEd is just asking you to pay for the electricity you used, which is not the LLs responsibility.
Following this line of reasoning, I'm going to suggest that your LL's unwillingness to allow CONED to read the meters for the past two years might have been purposeful. Had you received a high bill a few months into your tenancy, you would have known immediately that it was for prior usage. Now, who knows?
