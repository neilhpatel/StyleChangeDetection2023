Are they complaining that the Biden administration is subsidizing what people in the US are playing for oil, in other words the government is paying some of the price (and releasing some oil reserves) so that the people are paying less at the pump... and so they are complaining that the Biden administration is not subsidizing their people too? That's what I'm getting out of this, because the US government has no control over the price oil companies are selling it for. The government can try to go after them for unfair competition, collusion to fix prices and other shady business practices, but they don't run those companies. The US hasn't nationalized it's oil production.
The US government isn’t setting global gas prices. Also gas prices dramatically suddenly dropped right after midterms. Which means some other parties were jacking gas prices as a means to hurt the Democrats chances at gaining and or keeping seats in Congress - otherwise the opposition wouldn’t have been blaming Biden and dems for the high prices in the first place.
edit, and finally no one would be profiting off this war if Russia didn't invade in the first place. Or like, the west just let Russian slip in another genocide and cultural erasure in Ukraine.
