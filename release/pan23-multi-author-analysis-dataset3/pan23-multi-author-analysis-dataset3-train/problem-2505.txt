My dude keep in mind Russia is internally and internationally touting and western weapons supply as "NATO aggressive expansion and a justified existencial threat to Russia".
If Russia can sell oil through India, Germany can certainly donate anti air weapons through Poland in my book. Remember, Russia are actively targeting civilians with these weapons, still Give them anti air.
Theres no reason why Russia should be bombing the western half of Ukraine taking out civillians and powerplants. The close proximity to Poland and the fact we've seen missiles strike this soil should've encouraged us to set this up.
They're probably going to need it more than ever if we have tanks being delivered too and attacked during the handover.
Its a warcrime this purely defensive equipment hasnt made its way into Ukraine yet, this system could save so many lives and everyones dragging their feet.
Hell myself I'm a supporter of setting up a safezone within Ukraine, manned by NATO which wouldnt require training Ukrainians.
Ehm with the Iris-T system and the Gepards, Germany is already one if not the top country that seriously support the security of Ukrainian airspace. A Patriot system will be coming soon too, along with one from the USA.
