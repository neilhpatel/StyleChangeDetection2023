If she doesn’t stop, it’s possible they could prosecute her for wasting their time. I think you should continue to let her whine until she tires herself out or gets evicted. Escalating things on your end might make you seem like you’re also a nuisance. Keep everyone on your side by just going about your business. You could argue she’s harassing you but really she’s harassing the police more.
Funny she tried to claim harassment when she is absolutely harassing you. I'm sure those police would be happy to file a report on the harassment you are experiencing that is also wasting a lot of their time.
For OP, I agree, call the cops yourself and report harassment, every times the cops show up at your door tell them you want to file a complaint of harassment.
Basically right now it’s a he said she said, and the police etc will be annoyed with her for calling, but you show them time stamped evidence of what you were doing? They will now ask the lady more direct questions - like how long ago was the noise how long was it for etc - then look at your footage see it’s nothing and be even more pissed.
All you need is the right veteran officer to get pissed enough and start the ball rolling on his side.
Basically the video could be used to really get these cops pissed that this lady keeps calling them because they now see it’s not a he said she said but a “wasting my fucking time” thing.
Yea of course recording yourself and giving it to the cops isn’t great - but it’s hard evidence that every time this person is calling there is absolutely nothing goin hon aside from a toddler playing, if anything.
