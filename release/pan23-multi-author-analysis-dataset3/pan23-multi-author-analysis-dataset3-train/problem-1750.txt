That is incorrect. Student Loan Forgiveness was not passed by Congress. They are attempting to rely on a broader older law to OK it, but the forgiveness itself has not been approved other than by executive order.
Further, I have no idea why you are quoting an amicus brief from supporters of the forgiveness plan. That has no legal import whatsoever.
Not according to current court rulings. And we know the Heroes Act was for the military. If you think GWB approved a law enabling broad authority to forgive student loans, writ large, I have a bridge to sell you.
Biden forgiving student loan debt is one of those things that Congress gave the Executive the power to do.
Biden is trying to drop student loans via executive order not thru congress, and so the issue is its probably technically against the constitution.
Implying that Joe Biden setting precedent is why student loan forgiveness shouldn't go through kinda demonstrates how ignorant you are on this matter. Get over it, student loan forgiveness is legal because there's a law granting the power, student loan debt is regularly discharged already in cases of fraud and abuse, but that the GOP are being dicks about it because someone's trying to help common folk instead of corporations.
