3.) There is a rule against non-work discussions, but it is primarily enforced against people discussing pay. This could be a violation of the NLRA but may be harder to prove.
Note: There are 3 possibilities. Your wife is not covered by the NLRA, and has no claim, but line employees might.
You can report this to the NLRB, they can investigate and handle the employer if they are breaking the law.
But there are exceptions. The NLRA exempts certain positions and certain industries. Industries like rail road related jobs, agriculture, public sector/government employees that broadly are not covered, or may be covered by other laws. Specifically most management is exempt, the employer can prohibit management from talking about wages or from forming a union. If the company prohibits all non work related discussion that can be legal. For instance if they would prohibit you from talking about baseball or anything else, and not just talking about wages or other concerted activity then the prohibition could be legal.
And for the pay discrepancy, it isn't illegal to pay more for new employees, to not give large raises as a policy.
It is an important distinction and the crux of my question, I understand that you say that they're not allowed to discuss wages.
