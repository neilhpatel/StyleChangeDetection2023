since no one reads the article here is the important part "he crews of the two aircraft did not confirm the presence of the aerial target, neither visually nor on the onboard radars".
in other word just a blip in the radar you wouldn't here about if it wasn't for the spy ballons craze.
I mean, from a surveillance perspective, the balloons are nothing more than a satellite would see. Although, the lower altitude might allow for more electronic snooping than a satellite could, square cube law and all.
Remember also that clouds can provide radar returns too. Doppler radar maps you get for weather? Those clouds are providing radar returns and are at massive altitudes. I totally buy that they filtered the balloons out previously.
True but the stories saying that Trump admin didn't know says either NORAD kept national defense information from the president or didn't realize it yet.
It's a good intelligence tool. High enough to be unseen but can see well. Plausible deniability, you know, "Its a weather balloon, why are you mad?". Also high enough to avoid most military aircraft except for the most advanced. And given the number of Chinese bases that are popping up, they have a lot of appetite and ground to surveil.
