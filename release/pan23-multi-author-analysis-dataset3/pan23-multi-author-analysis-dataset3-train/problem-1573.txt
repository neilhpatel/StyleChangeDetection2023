Saddest part of this is that we’ve had the numbers to at least match boomers at the polls for years, but Millennial turnout just broke 50% a few years ago.
Especially in local elections where literally a couple hundred votes (or potentially a few dozen votes) could bring a 55/45 race to dead-even.
Even going from a consistently R+20/30 (Republicans typically winning by 20-30 points) to R+10 is huge in electoral politics. All that means is taking a 65/35 or 60/40 win down to a 55/45 win.
There are very few things that could swing a 60/40 race all the way to the other side. But 55/45? Any number of very common, run-of-the-mill controversies could push that election to the brink...
And it’s also assuming the GOP won’t destroy the vote in the next five elections. They’re trying their best. Or that they simply won’t leave offices they’ve been elected to, and we saw an attempt to do that in the White House on 1/6.
Unless their next coup doesn’t fail, and by the looks of what they’ve been doing in the judicial branch over the last decade, they don’t plan on failing.
