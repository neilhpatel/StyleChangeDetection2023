Because heâ€™s not actually serious about term limits. The bill is posturing for votes. He knows the GOP base is too stupid to understand the contradiction, and he also knows the bill itself has zero chance of passing.
I do think he might even be intentionally weaponizing the fact that he's universally loathed to forward term limits, because it tends to be Republicans who want them.
Eh, Cruz is horrible. That said, this is exactly the same as when I advocate for socialism and people ask me "Why aren't you giving all your money away now, then?".
This is my point of view. I believe a lot of things that I think should be institutionally implemented that I wouldn't necessarily do on my own (or at least not consistently) unless everyone else were held to the same standard. Some things because it may put me at a significant disadvantage in life and others because if I'm the only one doing it then it won't have the intended impactful difference. I don't think that makes me a hypocrite, but I would understand how people could come to that conclusion.
I think a lot of them are aware of the contradiction, they just don't care. All that matters is that their team wins. They hate liberals more than they care about integrity.
