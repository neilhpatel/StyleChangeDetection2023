Yes. You need to refund your buyer, even if that refund is occurring through the same ticket vendor. You can't profit from a sale you didn't make. You could have some sort of claim as to the ticket vendor if they weren't allowed to cancel the tickets. But surely they were.
It isn't plausible that Ticketmaster or someone is going to make you give your buyer $360, but isn't going to collect that $360 or give it to you. They're not "stealing" $360.
The "you must refund $360" implies you received that money. If that's so - that they're delivering the $360 to you here and asking you also to refund it, there's no problem.
Was it asking you for payment information to process the refund or just saying you have to refund the $360?
I sold the tickets for $360 and buyer needs to be refunded. I never received the $360 payment though since I was unable to provide the buyer with tickets.
Who is in possession of the $360 that this person paid to buy tickets from you that you didn't actually have to sell?
I never provided tickets since I did not have them so I never received any payment for the sale. In order to cancel sale I have to provide refund says website.
I will refund the buyer for sure by cancelling the order but I lose out approx. $110 since I owe buy $360 and my original order was only refunded approx. $250 my purchase price.
