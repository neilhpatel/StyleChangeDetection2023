Adding more relevant details is important to understanding historical events. Adding irrelevant details is Gish Gallop, attempting to overwhelm people disagreeing with you with a sheer volume of information.
In this case, much of the information you have been communicating is irrelevant. The senate vote is irrelevant to Clinton’s failure to veto. Him “focusing on universal healthcare” (which, unlike welfare reform, he failed to achieve) is irrelevant to Clinton’s failure to veto.
>However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with universal health care.
>Passage of PRWORA was the culmination of many years of debate in which the merits and flaws of AFDC were argued. Research was used by both sides to make their points, with each side often using the same piece of research to support the opposite view. The political atmosphere at the time of PRWORA's passage included a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate (defined by their Contract with America) and a Democratic president (defined by Bill Clinton's promise to "end welfare as we know it").
Sorry to hear you live in Portland. Seems like most people complaining about addicts and this article just don't have the money to move out of a bad neighborhood.
There are a LOT of low income and houseless people who aren’t on drugs, I feel they shouldn’t be punished because some people use meth or other drugs. The problematic meth addicts are the people who get the attention and are the ones noticed in day to day life instead of the vastly more numerous group of low/no income group struggling discretely.
Everybody raving about drug addicts in this thread and here I am a social services professional telling you how many actual low income families and individuals who are not drug addicted could use this help. It’s the age old argument that because we might be helping the bad crowd, we shouldn’t help anyone at all, which is bullshit.
