Trump is about as popular now as Nixon was then, and any GOP president pardoning him would be kissing any chance at a second term goodbye. And there's the risk Trump might attempt to primary them. Either way, I don't see it ending well for the GOP, always fun to consider hypotheticals.
Right, I was referring to the Senate Republicans not voting to convict. Because of those missed opportunities, now he is an albatross around their necks.
They deserve it for not impeaching him when they had their two chances to do so. I hope he loses the GOP primary, forms the Trump Party, and splits the GOP vote for a decade or more.
If something untoward happens to Donald Trump, I would look very seriously at those with the most to gain by taking Trump out of the game, and it won't be the Democrats.
The irony here is, some of the politicians still suck at his teat (Graham, Cruz just to name a couple) back in 2016, they said if they nominate Trump, it will be the end of the Republican Party. Their words, not mine.
