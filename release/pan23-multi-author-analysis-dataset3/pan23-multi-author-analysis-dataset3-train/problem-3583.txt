I have a feeling this is along the same lines of the non-existent “red wave” being predicted for months prior to the midterms. For the last week, we’ve been hearing how massive early voting turnout has been and how much it favored Warnock, but now we start hearing about how he only holds a “narrow edge.”.
Meanwhile, Warnock, who got more votes in the midterm, has done zero to lose voters since and Walker has only continued to prove himself as an incoherent, lying idiot who the GOP themselves don’t even trust and therefore have had Graham and/or Cruz “Weekend at Bernie’s-ing” him to the finish line for the last month.
What scares me is that, as over-the-top flawed Walker is as a candidate, he might actually not be the absolute worst that the MAGA GOP could put up for election and actually end up winning.
You really need to understand how appealing that is to the sort of losers that vote for Walker and Trump. They don't want to see someone qualified with power when they think that's the root of all evil in the world, they want to see an "average joe" win. Somebody that talks shit that they can relate to and will upset the balance of power that will otherwise always see them as "unqualified.".
Same. 1 1/2 hrs for me to vote early. I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes at my polling location before. I'm hopeful that's a good sign for Warnock.
My neighbor put up one of those large signs in his yard for him. He's definitely getting support in the suburbs from yt ppl. A lot of conservatives want incompetent people in office to hinder the government.
