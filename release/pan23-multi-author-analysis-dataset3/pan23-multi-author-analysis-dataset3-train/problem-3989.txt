For as diverse as the Democratic base is, the fact of the matter is they get extremely petrified come primary season and go with the “safe” choice every time.
Not that Biden has done a bad job, but if he calls it quits in 2024, D’s would be like a bunch of cats trying to pick a leader.
Biden is your 2024 Dem nominee, full stop. Take this year to accept it. He's done a great job despite whatever reservations you have about his age.
He’s not doing his job alone my friend. He has dozens upon dozens of well educated and experienced advisors, the cabinet secretaries, joint chiefs of staff, generals, intelligence analysts, etc… to assist him leading the executive branch. Good leaders don’t do everything themselves, they put experts into the correct positions, listen to their advice, and decide the best course of action on their recommendations. As W once put it, “I’m the decider, and I decide what’s best.” And Biden has done a phenomenal job of picking experts to listen to.
My point is that Biden is far more skilled than Bernie and his personal relationship with Manchin is what allowed Manchin to give the green light to Biden’s choices.
2024 would be a fear election with the prospect of a President DeSantis so I think Genz will turnout regardless. While Biden Republicans might defect to a non-Trump candidate, they might stay if we stay closer to the center.
You’re telling me folks like Deb Haaland and Kentaji Brown Jackson aren’t progressive? Give me a break.
