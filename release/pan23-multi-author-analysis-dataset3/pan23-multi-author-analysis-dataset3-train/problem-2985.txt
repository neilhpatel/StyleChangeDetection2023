That's one scenario but it's not happening right now. The smart move is to just say Ukraine now belong to US/Germany which make them NATO region right away. But no, his ego is too high for Ukraine and he want to keep fighting sacrificing millions of his people and future.
Russia invading Ukraine, to conquer them, add their resources to the Russian economy, and force Ukrainians to assimilate as Russians or be murdered, aka genocide. Is not the US invasion and occupation of Iraq, not how much you wish it were.
Why should I? I care about Iraq, learning from it, never denying it’s criminality, etc. Yeah, the US sucks.
So all I see here is just “USA bad”. Bad faith criticism of the US from 20 years ago, to defend against and deflect criticism from Russia trying to genocide and annex a peaceful, democratic neighbor right now.
Or it shows that he has a history of insisting that Russia's neighbors give up large chunks of their sovereignty and bend yo Moscow's will lest they invite invasion.
So in order not to admit how disgustingly hypocritical it is for a country terrorizing the middle east for 20 years to call out Russia we have now moved the goalposts to the last few hours.
Hey you win man, I guess Russia probably did kill more innocent people in the last few hours than "the west", shame on them!
