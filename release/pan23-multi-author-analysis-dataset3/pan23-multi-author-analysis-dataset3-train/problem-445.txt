I'd hardly count the opinion of 5 extremist Federal Society partisans the rule of law. Laws written by legislators elected by the people, where ultimate sovereignty derived from. They are much more legitimate than unelected politicians in robes.
I'm starting to think they've been lying to us all along, and are simply distracting us from the real problem: guns.
At this point, we just need to unfuck SCOTUS. Get some non Federal Society extremists in the court who will stop legislating from the bench and let the People write their own gun laws instead.
My view, and could be wrong, is you need to start enforcing the guns laws on the books to draconian levels.
So what other actions do you think should be taken that'd be as efficient if not more than gun control?
If the solutions aren't applicable (there is a reason they're not implemented yet I guess), then why not go for gun control that works so well worldwide?
“But Australia/Canada/UK/European country has gun control and it works great” What do those countries have in common?
