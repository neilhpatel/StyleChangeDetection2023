It's probably also important to figure out if he's designated anyone to take care of his medical decisions or finances if he's unable to handle those himself. That person/people need to get involved. If there is no one, it's probably important to contact a lawyer to help figure out what needs to happen with those arrangements and what, if any, obligations you might have.
In the meantime, stay very clear with everyone that you are not taking physical or financial responsibility for his care. Also, though, be aware that even "helping out while you can" means you have some obligation to ensure a minimum standard of care for him. If you cannot provide the care he needs, or if he refuses to cooperate with that care, you need to talk with adult services yourself and report that.
I would contact the local Area Agency on Aging and make it clear you are not legally or personably liable for his care, and what options are available to him and the social worker, to help him.
Besides attorney consultation for yourself, you should be able to contact Department of Aging in North Carolina.
