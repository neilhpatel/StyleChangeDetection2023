Whether you have an EAD or Green Card makes absolutely no difference whatsoever in your ability to receive payment for your work.
If you didn’t need security clearance, your EAD should mean no difference from having a Green Card. In terms of work it grants you pretty much the same rights. Also, only citizens can gain security clearance and I highly doubt it was a requirement if you’re in finance anyway. And if they employed you and contracted you anyway, that is absolutely on them.
They're not an employer (as you stated you're a contractor). Your immigration status has nothing to do with a contract.
You have a contract. The client is required to follow the contract. You are validly authorized to work, and the client cannot wiggle out of it by not personally liking your EAD.
If the former, you need to get hardassed with the client. If the latter, you should send them , and point them in the general direction of the "it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of citizenship" section, although since you are a contractor it is not entirely relevant. You could also just send them the USCIS page on what an EAD is.
In direct response to your question, there are two possible answers here: (1) your client is trying to screw you over, or (2) your client is misinformed and has no idea what a work permit is, and thinks there's some qualitative difference when it comes to payment.
