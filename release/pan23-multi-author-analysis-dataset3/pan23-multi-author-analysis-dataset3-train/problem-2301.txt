I'm in Christchurch on a university study trip from the US, and part of it was paying our respects to one of the mosques that was shot up. They are such incredible people and it breaks my heart that it had happened. (there's a connection between a mosque at my university that sheltered students during an active shooter, and so it's a tradition for those on this trip to pay our respects.).
Yeah. I definitely think she fell off towards the end of her term, but she dealt with some seriously heavy shit in a very short amount of time, and did so very effectively, speaking objectively.
Not to mention I've never seen such an extreme amount of hate for a kiwi leader. It's honestly insane just how many people were saying so many fucking awful things about her, all the damn time. I'm super worried about what comes next for us. I can't think of anyone in labour that has a chance to stand up and be a good PM, and I've been anti-Nats since I started voting. Even if they had a good leader, they've changed leadership like they've changed their underwear over the last few years.
As a person, she seems like a great human and I’ll miss her leadership for that. As an effective politician she’s had very big wins and very big failures, mixed feelings there.
Her initial path to party leadership was way more perilous. They brought her in weeks before the election.
