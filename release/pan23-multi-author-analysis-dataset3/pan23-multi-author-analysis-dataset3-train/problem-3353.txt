California also restricts how that notice may be given, and it's very likely that even if it contains every detail, a text message is not valid. California requires that even the initial notice be served, either in person, in person to another adult who lives with you, or by posting it at your address and mailing it.
In short: I think you jumped the gun by looking for a new home without having an eviction notice in hand. It was probably a reasonable choice, but I don't necessarily think you have a defence to paying for the 30 days' notice period (plus any outstanding rent or repair costs) at this point.
Not really. As far as you are expected to have known, you weren't actually being evicted. It's not really your landlord's job to explain your rights to you, nor are they in the wrong for suggesting that they will evict you if you don't remedy a breach of the lease.
Is there any kind of defense against the landlord’s usage of an eviction declaration as a way to manipulate me? I’m not sure how he even thought it would work when clearly it would only make me get ready to leave, but it seems to be exactly what he tried.
There was no breach in the lease, nor was there any suggestion for a remedy that could be made by me. The only thing that had been communicated was his intent to evict.
The eviction is not valid but I think you have a reasonable defence that he broke the lease by notifying you he wanted you to leave. The specifics of the requirement are to protect the tenant not the landlord. If you were challenging the notice, it would not succeed but from your perspective you accepted this at face value and proceeded on that basis.
