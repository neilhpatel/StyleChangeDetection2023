This is a topic which has been discussed under the term denazification. This policy was implemented by the Allied Powers after the war. Most normal Nazi party members without ties to SS or positions of power or the like were tested for their behaviour during the Nazi time. The standards were not very high and a lot did get their certificate of not having been true believers or worse (called Persilschein after a popular laundry detergent brand that had advertised with clean white towels).
Yes they did. Though some racist/anti-Semitic/totalitarian beliefs will still have been there. My grandmother for example wasnâ€™t a Party member and here parents neither. She was actually from a catholic family and her father despised the Nazis as unchristian rudes. Therefore he was conscripted right at the start of the war even though he was 40 and had four kids... but my grandma still had some racist and historic beliefs which were shaped by her growing up during the Nazi time (she was born in 1927). So it did not go away overnight - how could it have?
Also, some of the worst Nazis were prosecuted (though by far too little and too lenient) and the battered economy made it necessary to somehow arrange with the powers that were (the Allies). Politicians which had gone into real or inner emigration during Nazi times returned and most Nazi party members had joined during the Nazi reign - so many had prior politic affiliations they could fall back on (mostly but not only conservative).
So the gist is many were investigated to see what they may or may not have done and many former Nazi party members then took hold of traditional conservatism along w other positions?
