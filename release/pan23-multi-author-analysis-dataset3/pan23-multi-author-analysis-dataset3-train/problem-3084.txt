"Enough evidence" isn't your problem with respect to prosecution. That's the state's problem. You no doubt want to get paid back for the damages she caused. That is probably best addressed as restitution in her criminal prosecution. If she's acquitted or otherwise not ordered to pay restitution, then you might gather your evidence and sue her in civil court for the damages.
Your role is to leverage the civil justice system to seek repayment of damages you incurred as a result of this persons actions. Bills you had to pay (vet, new doors/locks, clean up costs, etc) are damages. You can seek to have a court order her to reimburse you for these costs.
If this is for a lawsuit, then yes you need a lawyer. If it is for the prosecution of her alleged crimes, then no, you do not need a lawyer, you just need to show up.
With respect to criminal charges, you should not need legal representation, but can discuss with the prosecuting attorney. If they need evidence, they will be in touch with you.
I'd have questions about your evidence at this stage. It only circumstantially establishes the damage done to the doors. This really may be better as a restitution situation than a litigation one.
