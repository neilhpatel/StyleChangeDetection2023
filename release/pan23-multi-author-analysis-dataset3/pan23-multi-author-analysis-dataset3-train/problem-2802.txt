I’m on business travel in Chicago right now- a yogurt granola cup is $9 at the hotel from a pickup counter. How can a damn yogurt cup be considerably more than an hourly wage!? America needs a real minimum wage.
The minimum wage isn’t to low the prices of everyday living are to high. Raising minimum wage.will make that worse for everyone including those who make minimum wage.
Raise minimum wage, cost of goods and services go up to even it out, and now min wage is too low again.
I'm not talking about solving greed using minimum wage. It's a simple question that I would like to hear someone more versed about explain. How do we ensure that raising the minimum wage actually improves someone's standard of living or "wealth" if that's a better descriptor?
Additionally, how is the person you're describing even renting? When I applied for an apartment I had to show gross wages that were at least 3x the rent. Let's assume 7.25 and 40 hours a week. That's 1200. 9003 is 2700. They would literally not qualify.
