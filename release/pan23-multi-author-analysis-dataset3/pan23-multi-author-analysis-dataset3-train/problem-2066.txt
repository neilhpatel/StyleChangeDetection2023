The Buran, the Soviet response to the Space Shuttle, was approved on 17 February 1976 by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The purposes (quoting directly from the decree) were given as.
So the report came too late for the Buran to be a "response" to thinking the Americans were using the shuttle to drop nukes, but in a way, the two were still connected; it wasn't too hard for rumors and the historical game of telephone to reverse the order of the two.
(Unfortunately for Sikharulidze and Okhotsimsky, the idea is ridiculous -- their idea involves bombing on re-entry, the Shuttle's flight trajectory was specially designed to avoid Moscow, and it had no door besides that could drop bombs even if they wanted to; the doors are on the top and had to remain closed.).
Ah. Got it. So the fear then was that the Shuttle might get into some weird orbit that an ICBM wouldn't take then release some nuclear payload that would strike in such a way that it couldn't be detected by normal early warning systems. Such an attack would reduce the amount of time the Soviets would have to counterattack, thus allowing the US to have the upper-hand and breaking the stalemate of nuclear deterrence.
Still, this establishes the idea that the Soviets liked the idea of being able to park a warhead in orbit and drop it from some novel angle, without warning, on the US. Having proved the feasibility of such an idea themselves, they'd have been well aware that the Americans might try such a thing too.
