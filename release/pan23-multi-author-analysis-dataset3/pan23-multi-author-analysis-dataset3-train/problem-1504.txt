Putin has to be severely desperate with the way oil prices are going. They were expecting a vastly different situation for 2023 and are getting absolutely annihilated on the front lines.
It's not a mystery why they have been trying to push Ukraine to 'let them win' through negotiations recently.
Russia's condition for talks in the first place presumes the Ukraine to admit some sort of defeat, as things are far from static, no?
But, if that is the benchmark to look for, Ukraine can merrily liberate Crimea, and Russia will have to accept the loss of territories for talks...
So Ukraine should accept total defeat in return for the talks that may or may not result in a peace treaty? This is despite the fact that Ukraine is still in the fight and is seemingly gaining strenh, while Russia is, potentially, looking at having to full mobilise its population, a politically unpopular outcome and one that the Russian economy can't sustain for an extended period of time. I mean, that seems like wishful thinking on Putin's part. But assume Ukraine want to entertain this idea, what, if anything, is Russia bringing to the table? What will Russia use to buy peace? What is Russia going to give up to see the end of the war? Nothing. So I fail to see how it is in Ukraine's best interests to negotiate at this time. Putin is trying to frame surrender talks as a negotiation, then blaming Ukraine for prolonging the war. It's political theatre for his supporters both at home and abroad, and nothing else.
