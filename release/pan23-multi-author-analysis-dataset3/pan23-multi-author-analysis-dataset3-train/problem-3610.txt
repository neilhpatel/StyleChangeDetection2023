I would consider identity theft protection for some time, and contacting your bank and telling them your account has been compromised so you need it changed.
I've seen this before, I remember it being common a few years ago when crypto was newer....Laundering money stolen from other people through your account into an anonymous digital currency.
I think in this instance they'll actually be receiving money from some victim's bank account and then converting it to bitcoin for the purpose of laundering it. That's why they want Interac e-transfer. It's not like a fake check.
This is a super common scam. The payment you will receive will take like 2 weeks to bounce, by then you’ll be thousands of dollars in the hole with your bank and you’ll end up barred from most banks overnight. Run far away — don’t accept any payments, don’t connect any accounts.
Ahh makes sense. Would come with the added factor of possible blackmail (e.g. this victim tries to leave but the scammer tells them they are part of it too now and will be reported).
