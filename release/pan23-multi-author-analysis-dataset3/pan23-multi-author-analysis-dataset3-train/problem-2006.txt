At this point, you can either ignore the letter, assuming it’s not a summons, and just a ‘lets talk’ letter. Or you can call them and see what they have to say and what proof they may have that it was your fault.
If you do call them, just ask basic questions. Don’t answer anything. ‘I’ll have to get back to you on that’ is a good generic response.
Understand that it’s probably not personal, either for you or the landlord. The insurance company may be looking for a scapegoat, or possibly another insurance company to pay the costs.
That will determine your next steps. You may not need to do much, if they find out you don’t have insurance. Or you may decide to retain a lawyer.
Need to talk to a lawyer, should be able to find someone with legal aide. The shelter may also have a list of lawyers that do pro bono work. You'll need to get a copy of the fire marshal's report (or whatever they call it in your area). If you had rental insurance, they should be contacted as well. Also, depending on what the firefighters found, the landlord may owe your mother, if it was found to be faulty wiring or gas line. Keep records of everything, take note of who you talk to, what was said, and when. Avoid giving any statement to the insurance company without legal representation. Simply deny fault and offer no further comment. Take it seriously, but not personally. Insurance company doesn't want to pay and will look for every loophole and twist every statement.
