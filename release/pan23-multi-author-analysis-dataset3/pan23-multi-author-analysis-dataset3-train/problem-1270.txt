This might be a little beyond the scope, but do you know if the conflicts in the late 1800s and early 1900s were influenced by European universities? I've always been under the impression that the US higher education system became modeled on the German one in the late 1800s.
For most of the nineteenth century, American universities did not have graduate programs as we think of them now. Anyone who aspired to be regarded as a real scholar, or hoped to develop a reputation as a professor or university president, studied in Germany. The PhD degree itself, in its modern form, came from the German educational system. Around nine thousand Americans studied there over the course of the century, until graduate programs at places like Johns Hopkins, Harvard, and Clark University offered Americans the chance to do graduate work domestically.
This is a great question. In the early nineteenth century almost all higher education in the United States was run by Christian denominations. By the late nineteenth century there was still a generally Christian orientation towards education, but this declined and became relatively uncommon by the early twentieth century, with a few religious schools holding out.
