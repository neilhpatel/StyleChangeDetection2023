Title: How do you prove residency for public school on a home you own, if you do not pay any bills?
Proving residency is a galling problem for parents and for the district. There are plenty of people like you who have their own individual living arrangement but who have a hard time documenting it. At the same time, there are more parents than you might imagine who want to sneak over a district boundary line to get a more enviable school placement, or get their child on sports team, etc. It's this second set of parents who inadvertently make documentation more troublesome for the first set of parents.
This is a bothersome thing, I'm sure, but be patient and persistent and the school will help you it squared away.
The affidavit sounds like a great solution if the school district will accept it. There's no obvious risk to you or your partner so long as everything in the affidavit is entirely true. Just stick to the one sentence that the school requires and you should be fine.
