The problem here is that while we have definitive evidence that abortion was known and practiced among the Aztecs, the details are a bit hazy. Women's issue, in general, tend to get short shrift in historical works. Something like abortion, which was a crime among both the Aztecs and the Spanish, doubly so. That most of the early Spanish chroniclers were friars does not help either. So I could rattle off a dozens of different herbs that Sahagun's General History of the Things of New Spain says can help with everything from gout to fever to diarrhea to UTIs, but the primary sources are mum on the specifics of abortifacients.
Mendieta is, of course, a generation removed from pre-Hispanic Mexico, but he was a student of Motolin√≠a, one of the original 12 Franciscans and the one who took the most interest in Nahua culture. The fact that this is a transmission from Spanish friar to Spanish friar does introduce it's own risk of bias, since they did have a tendency to lean into interpretations of pre-Hispanic society that portrayed the Nahuas as virtuous people ripe and ready to hear the word of Christ (see also writings about Texcoco from F. Alva de Ixtlilxochitl). So there's always the possibility of sympathetic Spanish clergy writing the Nahuas as seeing abortion as abhorrent, because that's what how they believed a righteous culture would see the practice.
Interesting, did abortion get explicitly covered in the pre contact religious philosophy or did the religion never say anything about it and it was added later? How exactly did they co opt the belief sysyem to be more in line with christianity?
