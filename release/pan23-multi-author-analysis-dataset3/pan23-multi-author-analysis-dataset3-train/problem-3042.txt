If your aunt isn’t listed as a beneficiary and she isn’t in the will, as her father’s trustee what she did is completely legal because those accounts now legally belong to her.
If your aunt’s stepdaughter is the legal trustee, those accounts now belong to her. Shes only required to give money to your aunt if your aunts late husband specifically mentions it in his will/legal documents.
This is something your aunt needs an estate attorney to look into. It's certainly possible that your aunt's step-daughter is mis-handling the estate, and that's an issue that estate attorneys handle every day.
I presume the bank told you that they had not been provided with death certificates and that the accounts were not "joint tenancy with right of survivorship" or "transfer on death" accounts.
The bank had not been given a death certificate and since they were joint accounts with my aunt, the bank says if she had gone into the bank to try to take and transfer the money she would not have been able to do it. Thus, logging in a her deceased dad she took and then transferred.
