Giving it to rich people? My guy, there's an income cap of $125,000. That means no one above middle class is getting any relief, and the biggest relief is going to Pell Grant students who have to be poor to receive in the first place.
Additionally, the US government gives billions in handouts to farmers and oil companies every single day, as well as the forgiveness of PPP loans. Why would you not be upset about that, but mad that the government is actually trying to directly help the people?
This is probably the most unjust action Iâ€™ve seen our government do in decades. People need to pay off their debt.
Lastly, people need to pay off their debt? You never heard or seen how the rich specifically abuse tax loopholes or bankruptcy? Don't make me laugh.
I'm well aware it's not fair to the people that have already paid for their loans or didn't go to school. But I'm also aware that it's not fair that I inherited a world where I couldn't pay for my college tuition with a summer job like my parents could have. It's not fair that tax loopholes make it to where there are millionaires and billionaires that pay less in taxes than I do as a lower middle class citizen.
And so you'll vote Republican - the people who want to cut taxes for the billionaire and millionaire class further. That reduces inflation and doesn't enhance wealth inequality?
