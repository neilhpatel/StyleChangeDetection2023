That is very complex question indeed I'll narrow it down to one major difference: survival of institutional frameworks. When the last western Roman emperor was knifed in 480 CE, the governmental apparatus of Late Roman Italy was still intact. Fifth century emperors had prioritized the welfare of Italy above all other western provinces. Hence there was still a substantial bureaucracy that could organize taxes and keep the cogs of government (not to mention the army) running. Ostrogothic Italy also witnessed something of a literary Indian Summer, as in the writings of Ennodius, Boethius or Cassiodorus. So in short: the emperors were gone, but the imperial pillars survived until Justinian's Gothic Wars.
Why were the "barbarians" in Italy and North Africa able to insert themselves atop the political and fiscal infrastructure of the Empire without destroying it while Justinian proved unable to do so in his Gothic Wars? Surely the Emperor would have preferred a tax generating province over a tax-spending war over the broken Imperial bureaucracy, just like the "barbarians" often wanted to gain wealth and power within the institutions of Late Roman government rather looking to reign over the ruins of the Empire.
It might be a bit of a simple question, but I’m trying to understand why during the reigns of the more successful “Byzantine” emperors (Justinian etc) instead of making sustainable territorial gains, shoring up the borders etc, many pushed for reconquest of regions they didn’t really have the ability to control? It seems as if a lot of the decisions made by Roman emperors of the late period were made with a sort of wishful optimism, or is that a combination of hindsight and modern knowledge?
