I wonder how they will get passed the states that are trying to make it illegal to cross state lines to get an abortion.
How do you square this argument with the Texas abortion bounty system? It seems clear that the GOP is willing to pursue avenues that can be turned against them (as Newsom is attempting with the CA version of this law re: guns). That, to me, indicates some level of confidence that the court system will work to enforce the results they want and hinder the ones they do not.
If the law causes a chilling effect on abortion seekers, why would an identical gun-targeted law not cause a chilling effect on gun seekers?
There was already a case that was largely blocked because of standing issues, so it's working as intended: reduce abortions with an unenforcible law, but it keeps people scared enough to get the outcome you want.
Unless there is a federal law that bans abortions, or a vote in Congress that specifically bans abortions in the DoD, the DoD is still within it's rights as an organization to allow it's members to get abortions.
Hell, we had training shortly after Jan 6 explicitly calling out the extreme right and saying "DO NOT OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.".
Yes. But we do also have the obligation to uphold the Laws of War, IE, if we are told to fire on civilians we know for a fact are unarmed. We have the obligation to refuse as that order would be unlawful.
