None of it really made sense, and Greenwald came very close to explicitly advocating for Putin seeking out a final solution to the Ukraine problem. So they cut to footage of the chaos in El Paso where the invading brown vermin are climbing over border walls (with footage showing how easy it is to climb; only a total moron would rely on just a wall to keep out migrants) and pretended the speech never happened.
A few minutes later, proud bigot and anti-civil-rights pro-terrorism propagandist Glenn Greenwald sleezes his way on screen and spends a few minutes oozing a word salad about how Putin is right to kill ethnic minorities and try to take over the Orthodox church through puppet proxies to control religion in Ukraine.
Then... he AIRED THE CLIP. Huge mistake. I've no idea who in the newsroom allowed that to happen, because the clip instantly contradicted what Tucker just said. Now, I know most viewers won't notice because they can only understand what Tucker tells them to think. But I was sort of dumbfounded.
Why so surprised? As the Constitution says, there is no more fundamental American value than a total unquestioning adherence to a single national church, especially when it is operated by one's enemies beyond one's borders.
