We don't currently have one on you, but before you had an 'Interesting Inquirer' flair, you very well might have one that said, for example, "inky?" (once you have the flair, the modnote would often get removed because, well, you have the flair now!). And yes, we have also been known to use them to officially label someone a disturber of the peace.
More or less it has been consistently enforced, I would say. The ones that we would leave up are ones that, despite that they are asking for examples, are really basically asking examples in quite a limited time and place. These ones could potentially be answered by one person, so we're fine with it. Alternatively, sometimes you see questions where it's a little ambiguous as to whether they're seeking examples or not, where one mod might interpret it one way and remove it, and another might be okay with it. There's also, sometimes, more historiographical questions that sometimes might look a bit example seeking, but are really more about how to do history more generally than really about seeking examples.
Is that to assert who deserves the "Interesting Inquirer" role and the various Historians flairs as well as spot trouble makers who might consistently be asking questions to push an agenda or something?
