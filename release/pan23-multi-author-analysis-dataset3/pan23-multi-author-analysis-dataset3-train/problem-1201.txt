We've all seen the trends in porn searched. Conservative states tend to have the more interesting searches....
It's funny because there's always been these 2 competing factions of conservatism. The ones they actually want "trad" families and 2.5 kids and to go to church every Sunday.
And the 4chan/Steve Bannon type trolls. Where they embrace decadence and hedonism, drinking, porn, video games, strip clubs, just pure pleasures with no discipline. It's just somehow in their broken minds, a gay kid going through pain has been registered as pleasure for them. These types of conservatives would flip their middle fingers at anyone telling them to go to church.
Conservatives are the most perverted group of us out there. Fat chance quitting porn will happen. They're out there right now jacking off to gay porn and trans porn, not washing their hands, and then going out to protest the very people they're obsessed over.
Same reason why they want to rip away the rights of trans people; a LOT of right-wing figureheads are into trans porn. Gotta love that institutional dehumanization.
