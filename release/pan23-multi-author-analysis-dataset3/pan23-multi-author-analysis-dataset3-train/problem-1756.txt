They will never get what they want aka Kiev. They are trying to flip the script and get anything at all just to boast it as victory. Except they aren't in the position to demand anything. And Ukraine knows it.
There's a theory Putin has a grudge with Ukraine because of historical reasons and Ukraine defiance. He still sees it as a russian territory and Ukraine turning away from(or maybe not being controlled by) Russia is ideologically unacceptable for him.
No, Putin wants control of Ukraine so it doesn't fall deeper into the west sphere of influence and ultimate a NATO member which is not something Russia wants on their doorstep.
Russia wants to annex the Donbass, Zaporizhzhia, Crimea and Kherson and leave the west of Ukraine as a vassal border state to act as a buffer between Russia and NATO.
Russia is going to end up losing Russian territory to Ukraine/NATO in the form of a DMZ on the Russian side of their border, if anything.
The converse is true though, that once Ukraine takes the strip of the land that connects Crimea to the rest of the Russia the war will be half over and Crimea's fall will be inevitable. That is undoubtedly how things will play out.
