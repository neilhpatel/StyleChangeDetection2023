Unfortunately protecting democracy and womens rights isn’t as high up on people list of things to vote for as… democrats are ruining the economy worldwide?
Eh I’m expecting 2 more years or the same. Big talk from democrats being hindered by the filibuster and now the loss of the house. And then anythjng that doesn’t happen gets blamed on the democrats because they’re in charge and not on the republicans for obstructing.
If republicans win, then it’s just natural and obvious but if democrats win, then it’s rigged. (But they’ll also still vote even though it’s OBVIOUSLY rigged.).
Idk. Yes the red wave didn’t happen but paying attention to these last calls, it shows yet again how divisive we are. If abortion, Ulvade, 1/6 riots, didn’t have that impact for yesterday, nothing ever will. It should not be this close at all. Dems should be holding house senate by wide margins yet won’t due to republicans not knowing what’s best.
If Dems run the table on races that haven't been called yet they can hold the House. But the most likely outcome is Republicans ending up with a 1-5 seat House majority.
It's not set in stone yet. We probably won't know for days, need to know if there is enough mail votes left in NY to save several Dems and also will be waiting on mail votes out West.
A GOP House majority of less than 10 seats is going to a be a clusterfuck for whoever ends up in leadership (knives are going to be out for McCarthy). MTG and co will have a veto on basically anything.
