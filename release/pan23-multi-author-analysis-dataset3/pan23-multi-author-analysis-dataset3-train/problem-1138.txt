That article describes the legal immigration process, it doesn’t in any way refute the notion that people smuggling is a thing. You think a boat load of people just snatched a baby for laughs?
Sending children back to their parents, what else can be done? Shrug and say “ok the baby belongs to us now?” The US is a country, not an adoption agency.
People say America is shit, and they shouldn’t be the world police, but then turn around and say they should be the world adoption agency. While, in the same turn, saying people want to get out of America, but then want to get into America. At the end of the day, people don’t like America, but honestly they don’t really know what they want.
America is a collaboration of multiple shit shows, combined to create one of the biggest shit shows on Earth. Source? I’m an American.
All of these constant “drop offs”, like mentioned in the article above, create a weight on the system, meaning more tax dollars needed. In turn, the rich push that onto the lower classes…. Which these kids will most likely join, creating a never ending cycle of need, with no positive outcome. I’ve seen it, and been there done that.
