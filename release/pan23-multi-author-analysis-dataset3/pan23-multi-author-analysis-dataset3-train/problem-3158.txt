Which is why he will appeal to the same sort of people who Trump did, but I don’t think will find a wider audience. Look at the browbeating that TFG-backed candidates took this cycle. Appealing to the same vein of crazy is clearly not a winning strategy, and I don’t think DeSantis has much more appeal across the aisle or to undecideds than Trump did.
He's Trump without the over-the-top egomania, which for the purposes of shuttling a hard-right agenda is good - but I very much doubt that DeSantis has that same ego-driven charisma to whip up a voter bloc the same way Trump was.
Maybe intelligent isn't the right word, but if you took Trump and removed his truly one-of-a-kind intense pathological need to exaggerate and self aggrandize to comical degrees, you could end up with an odious character that could be packaged by right-wing media in a way that has more mass appeal. I've heard conservative fans of trump irl say they just wish he didn't constantly tweet, brag, exaggerate or say stupid shit so much.
