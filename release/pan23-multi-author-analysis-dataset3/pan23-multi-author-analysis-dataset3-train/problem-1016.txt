The Mighty Ducks hockey team was the result of two things: the success of "The Mighty Ducks" film, and the efforts of an owner of the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, Bruce McNall. Arguably McNall was even more important.
Lastly, I’ll note what happened to Bruce McNall. As I noted he pocketed $25 million when the Ducks joined the league, which some analysts think was his ulterior motive all along: you see while McNall lived the live of a wealthy individual, he was a fraud. He had built his business empire on a series of lies and fake bank statements, getting loans from a series of banks and using that money to further get more loans and title. There is speculation that by this time he knew he had to do something to right himself, and thus a quick $25 million would help calm things down a bit. But it didn’t, and in 1993 he defaulted on a loan, which led to his eventual arrest and conviction of defrauding $236 million over the previous decade. He had to sell the Kings, of course, and ended up serving 70 months in prison. He’s out now, and openly admits he was in the wrong. However he has no reservations about helping expand the NHL, and has maintained that they should have kept on track with his plans, rather than fall back again (but that’s beyond this question).
