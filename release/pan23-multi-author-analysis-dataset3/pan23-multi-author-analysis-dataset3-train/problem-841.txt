Look, we all want to believe that is how it would go and we would all be celebrating afterwards. But when he decided to run in 2016, everyone laughed. John Oliver apologized quite a while back for encouraging Trump to run in a 2013 Daily Show segment. Like most of us, I'm sure John thought he had a snowball's chance in Hell of even reaching the primaries, let alone the Republican nomination.
Our best hope is certainly that Trump and DeSantis will divide and destroy the GOP but just look at the election this month. Look how tight the Senate race has been these last few years. We NEED to widen the majority over the GOP. We need to retake the House with younger politicians that care about moving the country forward. We cannot depend alone on a possible splitting of votes between Trump and DeSantis. It's too dangerous.
Which is pretty scary. That sounds like a war cry. And as someone who lived through war were neighbor went against the neighbor, I learned how hate can consume the person and what they are willing to do for their fascist ideology. We live in scary times and people shouldn't get too carefree, we need to be on our toes and vote, vote, vote.
I haven't watched it. I try to stay away from films and books that are too triggery for me. Depending on the mental space I'm in (cptsd), sometimes I can watch it or read something, but I need to be careful, if I do it at the wrong time and it hits me I cry for days. Living through something like that leaves big scars that never fully heal.
