Brazil's previous president was deeply tied to the U.S. government, and our current president has only been in power for a couple of months. It's not that Brazil was neutral neutral, it's just that the U.S. never pushed us into conflict, but we'd still 100% get in a war if they pressured us to do so.
geopolitics is not black and white as you describe it, and Brazil shouldnt be completely alligned to the US, it should do whats best for it and not the others.
To be fair how can you talk about people having values when the US has been financing the saudi destruction and genocides in Yemen and US does nothing (in fact it continues giving the saudis weapons).
Dude the US finances the Saudi dictatorship and provides weapons to massacre the yemen, the biden a few months ago was kissing the Saud house to ask them to increase oil production. Now tell me, what morals do the Americans have to point the finger at Brazil when they are so involved with absolutist dictatorships?
That very much is a negative comment about Brazil, and it’s not something Brazil should be proud of.
Look how bad Japan fucked over Korea and the Philipines. Now, they’re at least smart enough to put past differences to the side, and cooperate in the face of having the CCP on their doorstep.
South America stayed neutral and played footsies with the Nazis in WW2. Now they’re “staying neutral” and playing footsies with Iran and the CCP.
