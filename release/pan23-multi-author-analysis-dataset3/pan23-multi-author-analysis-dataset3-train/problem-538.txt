It's federal law and applies in federal court, not in state court, and it does not apply where the defendant has failed to appear.
In any event, 1) it's still federal law that doesn't apply in state courts and 2) until you provide a legitimate excuse to the court, as far as they know, you simply failed to appear.
If you try this the next time, expect to be told to appear the next day with proof of the medical emergency. If you don't, it will be considered a failure to appear and a warrant will be issued for your arrest.
If you fail to appear the court is likely to issue a bench warrant. If you appear on that warrant the court is very likely to vacate that warrant and set you for trial on the underlying offense.
To issue a warrant they need "probable cause" which would be nullified by the submission of proof to the contrary. The court can't say "no, you have to show up" if it's impossible for you to willing do so.
It's not the other way around - the court isn't going to figure out why you weren't there and then issue a warrant...
