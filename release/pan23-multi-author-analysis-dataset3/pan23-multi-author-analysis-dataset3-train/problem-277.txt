In all seriousness though, Ted Cruz's dad is also a piece of shit. Here's a bit from his Wikipedia page:
This is heartbreaking. And also a major goal of the people who vote Republican, hence the attacks on libraries that stock books which show LGBTQ people as actually human.
Because the 14 year old is queer and her father is one of the five most prominent Republicans in the US, the party supporting terrorism against queer people.
But even if she doesn’t, watching him spread hate and talk about LGBT people like they’re evil child molesters— that’s still dangerous talk coming from him.
Every time he says something bad about gay people or the LGBTQ community, that daughter hears it as an attack on her. She must be hurting so much. That’s terribly sad.
I have loved enough people who do self harm that I have nothing to add about her father. It’s none of my business and it’s not a weapon to wield against him. I just hope she’s ok and I hope if she needs help, she gets that help.
I truly hope the daughter is ok. But, Cruz does not deserve ‘private family matters’. This is the same dipshit who has called out every other ‘family matters’ of is democratic ‘enemies’. He is delusional as usual!
