I am attorney, but not in Pennsylvania. It's easy to say that an inheritance is nonmarital property, but without reviewing the case law and the specific facts, I certainly couldn't make that assertion in this case.
I know you said that she received the home as an inheritance, but that you also lived there. Depending on your state and how they view property, they MAY consider the home a marital asset. I would not rent the home without consulting an attorney in your area, as your actions may waive your argument that it is a marital asset.
It would be a really good idea to get a consultation with a lawyer ASAP, because the decisions youâ€™re making now will affect the distribution of assets in a divorce.
For that reason, unless you get an iron-clad lease agreement that a lawyer has gone over, and your divorce attorney also gives it his/her ok, I would find different accommodations.
There's a good chance you will be in an adversarial legal proceeding with your potential landlord. If things get heated, as they often do, the fact that she is your landlord will give her leverage and power in the situation.
