Well I tried to cancel it before it shipped, and Walmart said they would try to contact them on my behalf, but if I didn’t hear anything from the third party within 48 hours, they’d provide a refund theirself.
But I put in the request to cancel it and get the refund BEFORE it even shipped and I asked Walmart over the phone and they said if I didn’t hear back from them within the 48 hour period, then they would be responsible and issue the refund.
If it has already been shipped, Walmart is not going to give you a refund just because the seller didn’t respond. The seller sending the item counts as a response in and of itself. Clearly, the seller is not going to issue you a refund if it has already been shipped. Like I said before, what you need to do is wait for it to arrive, and then open up a refund on the item, then mail it back. Once the seller receives it, within a few days they will have to give you a refund. There’s no way for you to just stop the package now that it’s already been sent. If you look on the Walmart website I’m sure it says something about “order cancellations after a certain period of time are not guaranteed”, or even “ order cancellations quests from a third-party vendor are not guaranteed”.
At this point it’s too late to cancel the order. You’ll need to wait until it arrives, then open up a return. You may have to pay for return shipping, but as long as you don’t break the seals on the box the console comes in then you should be able to get a refund.
Okay, then when they said they "would be responsible and issue the refund" they probably ship you a UPS label to return the XBOX and then issue your refund, easy peasy!
