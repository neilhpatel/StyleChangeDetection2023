>Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.
In the end anyone can do whatever they want. However, if you deny entry to someone with a service animal because of allergies you open yourself up to an ADA lawsuit, one that it seems likely that you will lose based on the explicit guidance from the Department of Justice. You are required to make "reasonable accommodations," which in this case could be as simple as a HEPA air filter and a dust mask while the dog is present.
You need to provide reasonable accommodation for the service dog owner. How severe are the allergies? Are there reasonable accommodations for that? This question is a legal minefield. Reasonable is defined very broadly and anything short of life threatening allergies is unlikely to negate that. Consult an ADA lawyer, you almost certainly will find that this favors the service dog owner.
You will definitely need to speak to a lawyer. You should also get a copy of your medical records regarding that hospital stay. A service dog can be excluded if it constitutes a “Direct Threat”. It’s probably still an uphill climb though. Unfortunately life threatening allergies are not something that was well thought out in passing the ADA. Even the guidelines are written as if you are actually allergic to the dog, guess what, you aren’t. You are allergic to their hair/dander/whatever else. That makes this a major source of conflict for people that otherwise would be explicitly covered.
