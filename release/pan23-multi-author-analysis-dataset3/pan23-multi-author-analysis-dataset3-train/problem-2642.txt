NAL, but a former insurance agent. The fact that his insurance company doesn't cover his property off his premises tells me it's a bad policy. Everyone leaves their home. If he gets robbed out in town and his items are stolen, would his insurance company deny them because he wasn't at home? Some policies have limits on construction materials since they aren't attached to the home yet, but I'll bet he didn't look into it.
You have no legal duty to pay for his stolen goods. In fact, he had a legal duty to remove them from your property and it could be considered trespassing for him not moving his property off yours.
How do you know for sure they were stolen? A buddy of his comes to pick it up and he attempts to recover claiming it was stolen. This could even be a poorly executed attempt at insurance fraud. I mean, he clearly doesn't understand insurance if he thinks he can recover money from you and your company for his property.
Insurance agent here - your policy won't cover his stuff anyway because you don't own it. There is an exception for borrowed or rented items, but this does not apply here. Sounds like his insurance rep was just trying to get him off the phone by playing the blame game.
Most likely something got garbled in his conversation with the insurance company. He probably said something that implied that the materials were delivered intentionally to OP's driveway, in which case OP's insurance might well be liable provided a whole lot of other assumptions are true.
