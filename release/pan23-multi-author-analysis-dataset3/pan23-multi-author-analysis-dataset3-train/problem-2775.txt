It’s a bit weird. On one hand, people ARE calm; you won’t see us running around all scared here. On the other hand, so many people had actual real life discussions on “okay - so where do WE go if the time comes to go? Do we have a house with separate water supply? How about food? Can you get with a car to X and Y house?”; over and over again people - young, old, middle-aged, highly-educated, etc were discussing were to go, what to take and what to leave in case Russia decides to come in.
Many in Eastern Europe are probably even more anti-Russia now than they were before and that is saying something.
Post war Russia is percieved to be a threat to Eastern European countries and they just invaded Ukraine. XX-century GB has already given up all o fits Empire and they don't pose a signficiant threat to other countries like Russia does.
Russia wasn't America's problem to solve, only Russians can do that, but we needn't have callously made it worse.
If Russia invading your country you wouldn't be asking such dumb questions, like.. well what about this country or that country. What about WW2 Germany, what about Ghana's Kahn!
