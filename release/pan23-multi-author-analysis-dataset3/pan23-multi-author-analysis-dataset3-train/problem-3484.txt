You ignore one important factor: many of our intelligence agencies are compromised with MAGA republicans. The Supreme Court is about to abolish “affirmative action” entirely, which means when two candidates are equally qualified for a position, that race—even in the pursuit of diversity—cannot be a tie breaking factor. If this is extended to military and intelligence agencies, it’s a major national security issue (if it isn’t already).
Finally, it seems highly probably that every competent intelligence agency on the planet has plants in every major social network, with the American services not only working counter-intelligence, but probably super-entrenched in all kinds of ways.
Short of meeting in person, privately there is no way that they aren't monitoring things. As an executive, Musk can't do things on his own, so every action needs to be communicated to subordinates, who must also be under surveillance.
Is there any chance at all that the US Intelligence Community isn't monitoring every bit of communication that Musk is up to nowadays?
