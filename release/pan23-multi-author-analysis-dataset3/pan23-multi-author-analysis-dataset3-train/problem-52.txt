Don't worry though, one of the pipelines in Nordstream 2 is still intact. Purely by coincidence I'm sure, but it's nice that Europe can rely on the Russians for gas if they decide to approve NS2!
At the time the article was written, that's a price of $64 per barrel. There were reports of Russian crude going unsold for $67 and even $66 per barrel, so we may see the Chinese and Indian purchasers get a lot of leverage to drive prices down to the cap regardless.
Of course, because neither India nor China need an oil price cap, they get oil at a discount to the market thanks to Russia's desperation to fund their war of aggression.
the kremlin is assuming that the oil purchases by those countries would be required by their economies, and that by not selling, it's pressure to not participate in the price cap.
They're already having to sell oil and gas to India and China at prices dictated by the buyers, prices that barely leave any profit for Russia. China and India are then selling the energy to other countries for a profit.
