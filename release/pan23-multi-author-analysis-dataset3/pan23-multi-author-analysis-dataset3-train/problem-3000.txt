Yes, but if anyone who participated in union activities with no prior record of disciplinary or performance issues suddenly is getting fired or the stores are being closed that is a pattern that can be demonstrated in court.
No company, publicly, fires someone for union organizing (public being the important bit), they instead fire them for some non-sense reason (in this case leaving early when their own rules say to issue a warning instead of firing) and then hope it doesn't end up in court. Here the employee contacted the National Labor Relations Board and they took them to court to prove the firing was because they were involved in union organizing.
From the article: "Firing workers for organizing is already illegal, of course," said Starbucks Workers United, the employees' union, of Goldsmith's order. "But this decision is HUGE for getting speedy justice for those retaliated against.".
This. I now boycott Starbucks and either make at home (has been over a year so the espresso machine has easily paid for itself) or when on the move find a locally owned shop to get my coffee. Fk Starbucks and all similar union busting companies.
