I guess the thing I never understood is. Why don't they just find an area where the oil is located, and build the refining facilities closer, so there is no need for a pipeline.
But mainly train because it is multi-purpose (similar to truck...nothing like pipe) and because as we decrease our addiction to oil the cost of putting in train lines will not be lost.
The article i posted states that the 'best' idea is to build bigger, new pipelines. But it also presupposes in the opening paragraph that "Oil is going to keep moving, in increasing volumes due to our new energy boom" (granted this was written in 2018).
First off we can just discount ship for north america. If you are planning on canadian sand oil then ship from BC-Houston-wherever is fucking stupid, may as well build refineries in BC.
And they’re so stupidly expensive that building a bunch of new ones would tank the commodity price of oil and gas for explorers and producers upstream of processing.
sigh refineries are so god awfully, stupidly expensive to build that we haven’t built a new one in like 30-40 years.
