There isn't much specifically concentrating on Gongsun Zan in western scholarship but what does cover him shows no signs he was insane. I'm not knowledgeable in eras that came before in terms of precedent so more answers focused on that are certainly welcome. I do however believe I can help explain the warlord actions to some extent.
It is difficult to diagnose people thousands of years ago. However, while Gongsun Zan as a ruler was severe, arrogant, brutal and frankly not someone I would describe as a pleasant character, his decision making as a general then a warlord seems rational enough. There isn't a suggestion of insanity in the texts in the way Liu Yan (the Shu-Han officer, not the warlord) or Liu Ye was and I haven't seen modern historians questioning his general sanity.
The Liu Ye mentioned to have been insane, was that Cao Cao's advisor Liu Ye (Ziyang) who either the novel or more modern fiction credits with finding a solution to Yuan Shao's siege towers during Guandu? I think while defending the main camp if I recall correctly.
