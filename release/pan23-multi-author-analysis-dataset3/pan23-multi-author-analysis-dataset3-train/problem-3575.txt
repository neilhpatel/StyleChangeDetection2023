The reality is that somebody wrote down a standard set of bond conditions for your court 20 or 30 years ago, and those standard Bond conditions are used in 98% of all the criminal cases in your area. Even if they are modified, that's the starting point. Refrain from drug and alcohol use and submit to drug tests, don't associate with felons, don't commit any crimes, don't have any contact with any victim or witness, stay inside the jurisdiction unless you have permission etc.
The wealthy don't get better outcomes because they get special treatment or because they bribe judges or whatever. They start from a position of privledge and have the ability to afford lawyers who can advocate for them, whereas people who don't have that tend to be worked through the system.
That bias is both due to how the system is structured (e.g., being able to afford bail or high-powered lawyers) as well as implicit (e.g., subconscious preferential treatment towards the wealthy at all levels of the justice system).
Edit: this provides an good read on how implicit biases impact the justice system (albeit centered around race rather than wealth).
This was another good read on socioeconomic bias that agrees with you that it tends to be more implicit:
I would argue that more explicit wealth bias exists in the system, but that is hard to prove from implici bias.
Is that due to a bias towards the wealthy, or the fact the wealthy have more resources than the poor to oppose those steps at every turn and cultivate their appearance to the court room? I would guess the latter, more often than not.
