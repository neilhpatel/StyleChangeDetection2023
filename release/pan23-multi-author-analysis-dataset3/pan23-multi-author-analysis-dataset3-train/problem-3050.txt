Oh shit, I have MassHealth. I didn't know he was partly responsible for starting it up. I know the ACA funded it dramatically later on but that's very cool nonetheless. I enjoy having a $35/mo prescription cap and having no monthly premiums meanwhile maintaining basically full coverage. I love this state.
Romney is a classic republican, he still has wacked out political views, but he has at least a modicum of integrity and he knows crazy bullshit when he sees it.
Romney is the old school Republican that I just strongly disagree with on policy, not the new breed that I nearly universally disagree with and goes out of their way to be terrible people.
After Romney lost, his concession speech and actions over the next few months convinced me he has principles and reasons for them, I just disagree with him on most major policies. He's the last Republican I think that's true about.
The term I have heard here is ‘hall pass Republican’. They let him on occasion go out and vote or speak against the party line, as long as the issue doesn’t really matter or his vote will have no effect. This balloon issue will be yesterday’s news very soon, except on Fox.
