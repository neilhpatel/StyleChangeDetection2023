I was thinking more you'd look it up online / on whatever papers he has, take some time to do your research and understand what it means, and then call.
Depends on his coverage. If he has it for this situation, he needs to focus on going through his insurance company.
Submit the claim to your own insurance, not the other person's, and then point them at the other party.
If your friend has collision coverage they should claim through their insurance pay the deductible and make it the companies problem.
So just to clarify we should call my friends insurance company and have them tell him the coverage he has and how much, then call back and bring that up with them? Or would you just continue to move forward with the same person on the phone? Thank you x 100000 for the reply btw.
The witness was independent, it was a random guy on the side of the street where it happened. The guy stuck around and gave his statement and info to the police and my friend, i don’t think he would have bothered to do that if he only saw it “after” it happened which would be irrelevant, he knows what he saw happen in that moment which was that my friend had the green light. The other persons insurance said the witness statement wasn’t good enough because he said he “saw it right after it happened when he heard the crash and turned his head” but obviously it takes 1 split second to turn your head and see that the light my friend has was green and hers was red, they’re acting like he didn’t look for minutes or something. He didnt claim to see the accident occur the exact moment the cars collided, but was able to say with confidence who has green and red in that same moment upon hearing the crash and immediately looking. The insurance’s logic they’re applying to that statement doesn’t add up because they’re acting like the witness was probably too slow to see the accident happen in real time, despite him standing right there.
