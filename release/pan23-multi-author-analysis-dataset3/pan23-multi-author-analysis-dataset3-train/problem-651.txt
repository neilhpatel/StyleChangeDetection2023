Until Russia complies with that document which it signed in 1994, its signature on a new 'peace treaty' document is worthless.
Even if peace was inexplicably declared tomorrow, Russia has proven time and time again that they don't respect treaties.
I suspect lasting peace in Ukraine will be achieved by first kicking Russian forces completely out of all Ukrainian territory, then second Ukraine joining NATO to keep Russia honest.
As long as Ukraine gets continued support from the West, I think Ukraine will be able to recover Crimea and all the occupied land to the east. The real question is whether or not when Russia finally gives up, will Ukraine be able to reparations?
Negotiations will be about the future of Russia, not the future of Ukraine. Russia can improve its outlook with hostages on the line.
I bet that might become part of negotiation. The war can be over while there's hostages, but not while Russia is still occupying parts of Ukraine.
There's no way Ukraine is going to actively continue war to return the hostages. They won't attack Russia. It will be fully a political thing.
