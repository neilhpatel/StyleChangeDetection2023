Unless they're trying to push their "Republicans freed the slaves and Democrats founded the Klan" rhetoric, then it was a good thing.
You've got it backwards: the proclamation only freed slaves in areas still in rebellion. Lincoln thought it was the most he could do as president since it was within his war powers as commander-in-chief.
At the very beginning of the war, slaves were sent back when they reached the Union Army for fear of angering the slave states that remained in the Union. Then the Union Army began employing runaway slaves as "contraband of war," but their legal status was unclear (and it was unclear what would happen to them after the war. The Emancipation Proclamation did two things: 1. It turned the Union Army into an army of liberation; and 2. It proclaimed that the slaves in areas still in rebellion were "forever free" (there was fear that after the war they would be re-enslaved). It needed the 13th Amendment to solidify it and to permanently end slavery, and Lincoln knew that and fought for the 13th Amendment. But it was a vast change from the early war when many unionists were explicitly fighting only to save the Union and didn't want to see the end of slavery.
