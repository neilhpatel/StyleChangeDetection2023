It is doubtful that you will be able to recover anything. It is extremely difficult to "de-anonymize" wallets.
There is a basis for crypto to crypto tax. According to the IRS (and tax code) "Virtual Currencies" are considered property instead of a security. This means all property laws apply.
The basis for the crypto-to-crypto(/NFT) tax is the same as it is with real estate. If you swap a parcel of land for one that is worth more you have a gain in value that is taxable. No fiat is involved here either but that's what the laws state.
It'll take getting crypto reclassified to either a security (not ideal) or, even better, as its own thing for the tax code to actually make some sense.
But the best thing is definitely to be reclassified as its own thing , since crypto is its own thing after all. Agreed with that.
Well crypto is closer to stock/precious metals or even better, a currency. If they are reclassified to something else they should be considered currencies or legal tenders (like USD/EURO/YEN etc. Converting a fiat currency to another, isn't taxed right?).
