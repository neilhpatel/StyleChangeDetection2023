Generally yes. It depends on what is written in the CC&Rs. Incidentally, I have reviewed thousands of HOA docs and have never seen an outright prohibition in tenants. Usually, if there is a restriction, the HOA has the ability to screen the tenants and / or approve the lease.
First off, you have a contract with your landlord, not the HOA. If the HOA comes knocking or tries to talk to you, tell them to speak with landlord and leave you alone. Don't answer questions. Don't engage.
You don't have to move out. This is your landlord's problem. You have a lease with the landlord. Stay. If the landlord gets sued by the HOA, or foreclosed on, that's the landlord's problem.
Tenants rent properties in HOA's at their peril. It probably is not true that a tenant can just willy nilly ignore governing documents because, after all, their only rights to possession flow through the owner and therefore their rights are the same as the owner's.
This isn't true depending on state law. In Michigan, tenants and non-co-owner occupants can be evicted by the HOA for violation of the documents. If the documents so no leases that's a violation.
