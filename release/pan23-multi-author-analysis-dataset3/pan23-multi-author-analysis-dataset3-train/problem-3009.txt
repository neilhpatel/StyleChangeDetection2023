Understandable. Well by western I mean the global powers such as Britain specifically, as well as Germany, France and eventrually America. I can link you to the original post where I flesh it out a lot better? If you have a chance I would be grateful.
It is, but the more you think about it it's not. I have gone into a small analysis which I recommend seeing. Overall I just find it slightly odd how Japan was not exploited as much by Britain and imperial powers but India was by corporations such as the EIC, which essentially made an monopoly of the entire sub continent. Could Europe have made an monopoly of the Japanese island?
I read the discription but what do I do in this exactly? Do I link my post and hope for a response or do I scroll until I see something resembling my question?
If you have a question yourself, you post to the sub like everyone else and hope it gets answered. If it doesn't, you can wait a day or two and then repost it.
If you're just looking for evidence that there are historians on the sub, you click links to answers that sound interesting to you.
