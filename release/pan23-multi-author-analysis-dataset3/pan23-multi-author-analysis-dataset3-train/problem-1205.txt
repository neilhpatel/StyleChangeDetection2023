If they want to play ball and take what I can give them along the way, I will just work that out with them and leave by Oct 1. From what you're telling me, it doesn't sound like it would be worth it to them to go through the significant time and money required to collect 7-8 months of rent through the legal system.
If you don't have a way to pay you are FAR better off talking to your landlord and working something out vs getting a judgement on your credit and potential garnishment.. Tell them you will be out by this date and will pay them $X/month until the total amount in paid off.
go to housing court for non-payment, go there, get a stip to pay x$ for rent going forward (staying current), plus your old rent by date or be evicted. If, you get a good housing attorney, they could write the stip so that if you don't pay 100% (negotiatd settlement) of what you owe (past due) and surrender apt, there's no money judgement, just a surrender [[this is when the ll wants possession more than taking a chance you're good for the money]]--or you can--.
First, no problem at all. I am happy to help you "flesh thngs out." I've found the best solution come from the discovery of many different view points.
