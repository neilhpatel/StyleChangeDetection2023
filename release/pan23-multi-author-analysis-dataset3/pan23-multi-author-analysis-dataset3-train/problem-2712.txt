That being said, I would call him and verify that the email actually came from him. People have been known to hack business computers and send fraudulent emails to get money from vendors and customers. Also I would check to make sure his calculations are correct.
NAL. This may not be a legal issue because it doesn't sound like the manager is going to sue you. If it was me though, and he legitimately made a mistake on the sales tax, I would pay it. This is different than saying "I accidentally charged the wrong price." When you bought the laptop, you probably assumed you would be charged sales tax, but he made an honest mistake.
Does it not become the company's problem if they are misrepresenting the price as including tax? Under collecting means they were "collecting" from customers and I would think that it would be the company to eat that cost, not the consumer in such cases.
If you bought it under the impression sales tax was included, and the price was final, would think that legally it is their problem. You should call a lawyer, though, because this is interstate and a tax issue and definitely past the point of just using Reddit for advice.
