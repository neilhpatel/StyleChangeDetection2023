If your child is not on the educational track for a standard high school diploma, then they should not be required to take the standard FSA or face being held back. The bit about it being a "new state law" is somewhat odd, because this is the last year the FSA is being given, and it is being phased out next year.
I'd also suggest asking for testing accommodations as an addition to the IEP, including getting an assistant to act as a scribe for your child.
I would suggest asking your child’s case manager or the administrator for the school who you can speak to about opting out of the testing. Also ask what retention rubrics are used and if there are differences for the retention decision making process for students with an IEP. If you do not get answers or a name of someone that can give you answers, call the county office and ask to speak to the director of special education for the county.
I do not work in Florida, but in my experience, retention decisions for students in special education would be an IEP decision based on whether or not it is in the best interest of the child.
As a last resort, if you cannot come to a resolution, you can always just keep your child out of school on the testing days and the testing make up days.
Finally— can you just keep him home on the days the test is given (including make up days)? I know absences that aren’t “excused” aren’t ideal but it happens here all the time with our students with IEPs.
