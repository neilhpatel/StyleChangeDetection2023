Over a million Cambodians were executed by their own government (at the time, the Khmer Rouge). Another half-million or more died of starvation or disease. Since the population before this was under 8 million, this mass killing had a big impact on life expectancy. It also had a large impact on the population of Cambodia:
The high-intensity civil war had demographic impact too (as seen in the graph above) - over 1/4 million Cambodians were killed due to the war, including the genocidal killing of over 50,000 Vietnamese-Cambodians by the government.
As a result of both of these tumultuous periods of war, food instability, population movements, bombing, exposure to disease, overwork and government sponsored mass killings, even genocide, the life expectancy of the average Cambodian person dropped significantly. While the figures are based on estimates, somewhere between 200 - 500,000 people died during the civil war, and between 1.7-2.2 million during the roughly four years that the CPK were in power. Perhaps half those who perished under the CPK was the result of execution.
