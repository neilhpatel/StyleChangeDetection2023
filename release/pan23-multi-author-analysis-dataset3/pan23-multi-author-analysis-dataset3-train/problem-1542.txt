No that is quite the same comparison the person was already breaking the law in your comparison, op situation is like you telling your neighbour if they donâ€™t stop doing x that you will call the police and say they were breaking into your barn.
The difference between your example and what is happening is that if you tell someone "never come back, or I'll report you for trespassing" is that you're telling someone that if they commit a crime, you're going to turn them in.
It is blackmail, though, isn't it? She's basically saying if OP doesn't break up with their boyfriend, then she'll report OP for a crime they haven't actually committed (even if she might think OP did, she's only threatening to report them if they don't do as she says).
Actually, even if OP did give their boyfriend alcohol, Boyfriend's mom would be committing extortion by threatening to report that if OP didn't break up with their boyfriend. Because the implication is that if OP does break up with Boyfriend, then the report would not be made.
OP dating their boyfriend is not a crime. Boyfriend's mom is saying, "if you don't stop doing this perfectly legal thing that I don't like, I'm going to say you committed a crime already.".
Huh, TIL. Merriam-Webster has a United States/American English definition for "full of beans" that reads: not correct or truthful : full of nonsense.
