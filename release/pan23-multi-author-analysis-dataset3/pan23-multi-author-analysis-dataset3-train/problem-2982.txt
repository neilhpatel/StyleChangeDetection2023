In a private care system, that isn't the conversation. The conversation is all about the baby, the parents, and if they're prepared to bring a kid into the world that'd have to overcome those odds.
It doesn't. But the flip side is, in a socialized system things like rare cancers would never get clinical trials because a much more marginal potential improvement in, say, breast cancer, outweighs even incredible gains in something rare.
Infants born with severe heart defects. Some of these cases the baby can need millions in surgery immediately following an early birth by C-section. You see these kinds of cases advised to terminate pregnancy in countries with socialized medicine because of the resources the baby would consume with still super low odds of surviving, much less being able to live healthy and fulfilling lives.
Ah yes, all about concern for the baby and parents, not at all about how many operations can these schmuks be convinced to pay for, how many overpriced drugs can we convince them are necessary to buy for the child's life. How much can we charge for skin to skin contact?
