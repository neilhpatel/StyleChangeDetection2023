I'd love to see them spend some time looking into foreign interference into US elections. How much money are Russia and China spending on this and who are they giving that money to?
If the House isn't going to be passing any legislation, then the Senate has nothing better to do than hold hearings as well.
Republicans already had the House & Senate. Democrats actually gained seats in both houses and a governorship.
Sigh. Dude. You aren't even pointing out the relevant scandal to Gore. (China fund raising scandal). Clinton was MORE popular because of the scandal, not less. The people who had their knickers in a bind over it were never going to vote Democrat and getting a blow job from an intern was not considered the scandal it is today (more of a wink nod nod who wouldn't). Literally - "it's the economy stupid".
Gore lost because he ran from his accomplishments, used 100 words when Bush got it across in 5, and because George Bush had Karl Rove.
Al Gore lost because he ran from his record as VP (and Clinton) and was a terrible candidate. It is the economy stupid. Bush appealed more to people - he was a guy you wanted to have a beer with.
