In the open, he could not force contact with Suren's army with his infantry - Suren had no infantry he needed to slow down to cover, and could freely fall back before the Roman infantry. If the Roman cavalry attempted to attack his cavalry, it would end badly for this - Suren's cavalry was more than double in number, and also better. Crassus's light cavalry was vulnerable to Suren's archers. If the Roman infantry tried to turtle up (i.e. use the testudo formation) for protection against the Parthian archery, they could be (and were) attacked by the Parthian cataphracts, which forced them into a more open formation, making them more vulnerable to archery.
It is likely that if Alexander's companion cavalry had been committed to the left wing early (rather than being held in reserve to break the Persian centre), the Macedonians would have won the cavalry battle on both wings. Whatever the numbers of the Persian cavalry, Alexander's cavalry was stronger (in effectiveness, if not in number). The cavalry battle was not a walkover for the Macedonians; they lost about 1,000 horses, and fewer but still many men.
In summary, it much safer to march across open cavalry-friendly terrain when your cavalry is stronger than the enemy cavalry. As Crassus demonstrated, it is potentially fatal to march across such terrain with a slower force with inferior cavalry. (This was something that the Chinese discovered and re-discovered in their wars against their northern neighbours.).
Thanks for the answer. Do you know how Romans dealt with the Numidians, not exactly horse archers, but very light, skirmishing cavalry force? I seem to remember it was a slugfest around Sulla's wars.
