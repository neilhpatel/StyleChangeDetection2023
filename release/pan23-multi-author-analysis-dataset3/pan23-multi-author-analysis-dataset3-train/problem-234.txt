She has the Democratic Party in a bind. If they nominate a different candidate and she runs as an independent theyâ€™ll split the vote and a Republican will win.
Unlike Sanders, he really runs as an independent, taking on both major party candidates and winning. 4-0 between his gubernatorial and Senate runs. In 2012, before King was an incumbent, the Democratic apparatus just ignored the Democratic nominee and went after the Republican. King had the full backing in 2018, as an incumbent, and will again in 2024.
It's not a factor here. The DSCC supports incumbent members of the caucus, which King, Sanders, and Sinema all are. The DSCC supported King before the RCV referendum in 2016. They supported him when the government overruled the referendum in 2017. They supported him when the new referendum was passed in 2018.
It would be a bind if there wasn't such a clear standard. Then you'd be like "oh no what do I do?" The standard here is clear. The DSCC and the Democratic Senate Caucus as an institution in itself supports incumbents. They're going to support her because they're also going to support Angus King, who is going to run in a three way race, and Bernie Sanders, who is going to win the Democratic primary and run as an independent anyway. This would be true in any year, but it's even more direct this year because all three of them are running.
