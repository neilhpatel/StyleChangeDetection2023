Itâ€™s because they allow mail in ballots to get there after Election Day as long as they are post marked on or before Election Day.
The election laws of accepting ballots post-election day absolutely comes in to play. Florida's process/laws gets their ballots counted quickly and Florida has probably around 7x more ballots to count each election cycle.
Like Florida has nearly 7x the population size and their results were largely wrapped up on election night.
Crap like this give Rs more excuses to block expansion of mail-in ballots that increase turnout while also giving them cover to keep the 'big lie' going if they don't win.
Bullshit, nothing I've read says this has anything to do with "election laws", but due to Nevada election officials being unprepared to count so many mail in ballots. And because the vote is super close mail in ballots will be important to the outcome. If it had been that close in Florida the same thing could be true. Mail isn't instant, take a chill pill and stop repeating Republican talking points.
