Europe isn’t strong enough to diverge from the American agenda too much, but it can play a very important moderating roll while the U.S. takes a hardline approach to China.
While I'd like a stronger stance on China, I can fully understand that the EU is currently more worried about the belligerent zombified husk of a superpower next-door and doesn't want to pick more than one fight at once.
It's mostly a difference in rhetoric I think, everyone knows that the US and China will be the opposite poles in the new world order and Europe is on the American side when things heat up.
I think that up until recently, people were seeing that the two new spheres of geographical influence in the world would be US sphere vs China sphere. But it’s also recently been becoming apparent that there is more minutia and there will be more smaller geographical spheres of influence. As France stands right now it appears that they will be able to etch out their own sphere of influence in Europe independent of the US and is acting more as an independent actor in a lot of regards right now especially including rhetoric.
