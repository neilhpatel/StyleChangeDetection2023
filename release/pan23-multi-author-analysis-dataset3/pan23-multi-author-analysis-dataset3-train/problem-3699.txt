No two wrongs don't make a right. But, a wrong person pointing out fingers at another wrong person reeks of hypocrisy. Especially at a time when the US along with Netherlands, Italy, Belgium are increasingly buying refined oil from India.
Also, Since EU started buying more from the middle east (where India usually buys from) the price of middle east crude is higher.
If it mattered so much, European nations would be buying expensive oil and selling it for cheap to poorer nations like India.
There are other nations that European countries could buy oil and gas from. But they won’t, because they want to save money. Or they want to have lots of heating in their homes. India is already below that level. Asking a poor nation to stay poor, but the richer nations can stay warm and toasty.
Giving money to Russia by buying Russian fossil fuels is what’s killing Ukrainian children right? So by that measurement, the EU is the largest funder of these killings of Ukrainian children.
India is murdering Ukraine's children. They must be so proud of themselves. India has abstained from every vote in the UN condemning Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.
