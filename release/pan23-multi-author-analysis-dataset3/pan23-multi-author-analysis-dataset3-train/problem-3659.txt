Are you a US citizen? Assuming so, does the company think you are located in Colorado OR are you actually a resident of Colorado? (If you are a US citizen, you are a resident of a state even if you live abroad, but again, where the company is located has no bearing on your residency.) If not, there’s no reason for them to withhold Colorado taxes. They should be withholding taxes for whatever state you are a resident of.
The law that matters is the law where you are physically performing the work. It makes no difference where the company is located. So Mexico’s labor laws apply in this case.
Well I'm in Mexico so there's no way I'm making less than minimum wage here. So, even if the company I am working for is located in Colorado, I am a paying Colorado state taxes, etc., that has no relevance to how much they pay me?
They told me I would be making about 2.5k a month and it's been about a third of that, for the entirety of my tenure. And they cut my base from 1k to 800 after a training period. But I'm guessing that doesn't matter either. Thanks for your help.
Forgive my ignorance, but how am I playing fast and loose with regulations? I work full time and don't make what I thought was minimum wage. My initial thought was that I should be held to US regulations, so if that is not the case then I don't have a leg to stand on and won't pursue anything. Not trying to fuck anyone over here.
