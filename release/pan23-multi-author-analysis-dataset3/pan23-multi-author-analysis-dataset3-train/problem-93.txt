To be honest when they claimed they owned the tank the very first think you should have said to them was “prove it”.
If they can’t produce paperwork signed by the previous owners saying they own the tank then you tell them to pound sand and do what you want with the tank. If they sue you your evidence is nothing in your paperwork for the house has any mention of said propane company as well as the company being unable or refusing to produce the contract on the tank. Make sure to get any communications on the matter in writing and save it/make copies. On the off chance it goes that far and they show up to court with a signed contract claiming every right to the tank you produce all your evidence that they would or could not produce the contract when asked.
The contract that company A supposedly has would spell out what happens and who is responsible for what when it comes to removing a tank or discontinuing service.
If the company does in fact own the tank and you don’t want to use their service any more but they won’t sell the tank to you...just leave it? I’m not familiar with your area but could you simply have the tank disconnected and a new one installed from company b in a currently accessible place? Then you just inform company A that they are free to collect their tank at any time so long as the only damage to your property is the hole that the tank is coming out of.
If they can't produce ownership records for the tank, then it would look as if you would own the tank and then you can use any company to refill the tank.
Ever since their claim to be the tank owner and our service provider, we've paid them for tank rental every year. Our understanding of the law, only the company that owns the tank may fill the tank. That law was amended a couple years ago to address a propane supply shortage.
