Youth today are complacent. They don't speak up or speak out . They don't display the interest in government that is required to assure the democratic process.
They don't think that being an elected official means you should represent your constituents. They believe they are elected into a position of power, to tell people what to do, and make laws banning the things they think people shouldn't be doing. So if they won the election, that means more people wanted their ideas to be enacted and put into law. If they lost, then they don't believe it.
Democrats believe that they are voted in to actually represent the people that voted them in, which -- yes, sadly -- does require them to speak up for the minority (see: conservatives) sometimes, as they are still people and still fall under the purview of "should have representation". They don't boss people around, they aren't browbeating the minority into "shutting up and accepting the loss", they aren't one to turn around and say "here's the new laws that you have to follow, so deal with it or else the cops will be all over you".
One side thinks they're elected to be boss people around, the other side thinks they're elected to lead.
-- after all, how could my clearly better ideas now sway enough people to vote for me? Must have been cheating!
You do realize it's still possible to beat a cheater if you try hard enough? They're still cheating and should be punished, doesn't matter if they lost.
