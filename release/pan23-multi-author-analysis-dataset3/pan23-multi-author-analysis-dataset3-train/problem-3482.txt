The landlord can’t just change an existing term lease without your approval. Term lease, meaning like a 1 year lease that’s still within the year. Assuming you had a 1 year lease, it likely changed over to month-to-month automatically.
Generally, If the term of the lease is up (whether month to month or a longer term ) both parties must agree to all of the new rental terms. You can always walk if you don’t like it. The ‘I’m only renewing for month to month’ by the landlord is concerning However.
Assuming it’s month-to-month, the landlord can change the lease terms with 30 days notice (or not renew and have you move out in that same timeframe). The lease terms could involve a rent increase, and/or a security deposit increase.
If your deposit was 1 month’s rent, many landlords will demand more security deposit when the rent goes up (e.g., rent went from $1000 to $1100, they will demand and extra $100 in security deposit).
So a landlord can just make you pay a new deposit even if you’ve already lived here and paid your original deposit years ago? It just seems totally unheard of.
