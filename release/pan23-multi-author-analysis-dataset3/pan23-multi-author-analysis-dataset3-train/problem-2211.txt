Ascribing a whole lot of reaponsibility to the guy that isn't his. Are we really blaming him for global supply chain failures, Southwest airlines being dicks, and an obscure bit of code failing? Really? Let's focus on his response to the issue. That's his job.
There are certain jobs that when you take them are going to require you to actually be in them. You're welcome to disagree with that, but this is a gross tactic and the kind of thing someone does when they aren't confident in their arguments.
There's nothing wrong with paternity leave, but there's also context. Would we want the president to go on paternity leave, especially while there's a large shipping crisis? Would we want the VP to? Secretary of Defense? People and roles are not interchangeable, and something like a CEO stepping out can have massive impacts on a company. There's nothing wrong with it, but if you accept a job like Secretary of Transportation it's not a normal job.
How exactly has he been a useless transportation secretary? He at the very least says all the right things when I've heard him being interviewed which seems like its often because the media loves talking to him.
He’s been doing a fantastic job with messaging lately, so I’m hoping he does or says something similar to this. That’s really all the Democratic Party has to do at this point for the next two years to win the media messaging game. Simply say, “This is what we have tried to do and the GOP said no,” and then they can just go highlight all the bullshit they’re doing instead of what they claimed they were going to do during the mid-terms.
I’m not talking about how all the GOP wants to do is be as obstructionist as possible and try to pin all of the problems that stem from that on the Democratic Party.
