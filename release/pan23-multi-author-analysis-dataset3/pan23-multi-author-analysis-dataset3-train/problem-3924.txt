So lightly wounded soldiers who could theoretically fight if needed are still included in casualty numbers.
If I’m not mistaken they’re functionally the same thing though in situations where a soldier is wounded to a sufficient capacity. A soldier that’s missing a leg and a dead soldier are about equally as good at being soldiers.
Key words are rejoin the population but a severely wounded person won’t be much use as a soldier. When I say they’re functionally the same, I mean in the sense that they can’t fight anymore. However someone below correctly mentioned that casualties can include people who aren’t horribly wounded and can sometimes be re-integrated into a fighting force. Admittedly that’s something that I forgot about so they aren’t necessarily functionally the same, but many casualties nonetheless arepeople who can no longer fight. I’ll say I jumped the gun in saying that they broadly are the same.
It isn’t quite that easy. First matter is Putin has rigged just about every election he’s been a part of, like it isn’t even really a secret. Second matter is that protestors will either get sent to jail, drafted, or sent to jail and then drafted. I think it’s something like 13 years in prison jist for calling it a war instead of a special operation. I personally don’t know what I would do in that kind of situation, and really I don’t think anyone ever does until they’re put in it. I truly truly don’t envy their position, but I don’t think I can say it’s the fault of the citizenry.
I don't envy them, but that doesn't make it not their fault. Putin should get the lion's share of the blame, but everyone who enabled him deserves some too, whether knowingly or apathetically.
