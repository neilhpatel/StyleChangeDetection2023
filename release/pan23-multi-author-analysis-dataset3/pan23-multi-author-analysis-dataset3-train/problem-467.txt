You can't move a suit from big boy court to small claims.. if the statute of limitations has already expired, you can't start a new suit in small claims.
You can file a new action in small claims, but if the limitations period has passed, that action will be dismissed. If you withdraw your superior court action, you probably won’t be able to reinstate it because the limitations period has now passed. You’d need a procedural rule to enable transferring your existing case to another court, and most jurisdictions don’t have one for moving a case to small claims - only out of it.
California codifies limitations periods in . The headings are informative, not normative, but the phrasing there is suggestive: "The time of commencing actions …".
This is, ultimately, my point: "the clock stops" is a metaphorical explanation of the law, and while it is a useful metaphor in a lot of cases, the actual text of the law is clear that the limitations period is not stopped when an action is filed.
“The limitation period stops when an action is filed” is a common lay explanation, and it works well enough, but the actual rules are around whether an action can be dismissed based on the limitation period or not. The clock does not actually stop - if you file on time, that specific action cannot be dismissed this way, but other actions filed after the limitation period expires can be.
