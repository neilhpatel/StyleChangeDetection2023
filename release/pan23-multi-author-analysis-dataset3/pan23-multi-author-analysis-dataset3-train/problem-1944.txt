That's the reality Taiwan has to deal with. They can't just use force without really asking themselves if it's really worth the risks, because if war breaks out the survival of their nation is not at all guaranteed.
As for water, Taiwan's air and sea forces are far smaller than China's. Aquatic invasions are not easy, but Taiwan doesn't have to keep off just Cold War China. The Chinese have had a lot of money and time to work on this, and unification has been an open ambition of their leadership. Certainly I've never heard of any serious consideration of Taiwanese victory (meaning successfully defending national sovereignty) that doesn't include a minimum of American intervention.
On the contrary, most of the world has (reluctantly) excepted the One China Policy long ago and officially recognizes Taiwan as Chinese territory, even if they unofficially support Taiwan.
Yes, they unofficially support Taiwan. But they don't maintain official diplomatic relations, nor officially recognize Taiwanese territorial claims and Taiwan was removed from the UN. So these countries don't necessarily officially recognize that China owns that territory, but they also don't officially recognize that Taiwan owns it. In reality most countries try to maintain good relations with both sides and avoid the issue, but as far as international treaties are concerned China unfortunately has the upper hand.
The question is, whether the threat that China poses is enough to force the other regional actors to cooperate with each other.
The rest of the world colloquially implies those with the military and economic might to make a profound impact against Chinese aggression. Latin America and Africa relatively are in no position to do, regardless.
