This is not housing discrimination or even close to it. Any guest staying more than 14 days in a six month period can be considered a resident in MA. You will either need to limit the time your son spends at your residence or add him to the lease.
32 to 48 hours per week will have added up to the 120 hours in under a month so unless you lease calls for 120 continuous hours that adds up to another resident per your lease conditions.
MA housing law says if he stays for a total of 14 days (336 hours) in a six month period, then he has tenants rights. While children under 18 in MA aren’t technically considered “tenants”, they are considered “occupants” and additional occupants can be grounds for a rent increase. So even if he doesn’t stay for 120 hours consecutively, or non-consecutively, per month, the landlord can re-assess your monthly fees once that 336 hour per 6 month period cap is met.
Some states specifically state overnights are required but MA does not, at least not that I found. Usually when this is not specified, things get very fact specific and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If your kid is with you anywhere close to 50% of the time, it’s somewhat likely that the courts would consider this to be his part-time residence and not merely look at it like visitation with your child. On the other hand, since you’re taking care to make sure the kid never spends the night, you’ve got some facts on your side that help you characterize it more like visitation. Other facts might come into it too, like if he’s caused significant wear and tear on the property that normally wouldn’t happen just from guests. Overall they’re going to look at the big picture and see if it “looks like” your landlord needs to plan on there being another tenant/occupant residing there. In the end, it might depend which judge you end up in front of (if it comes to that).
