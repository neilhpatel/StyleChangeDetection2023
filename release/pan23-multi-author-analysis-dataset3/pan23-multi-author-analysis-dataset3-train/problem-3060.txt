You may have to pay some retroactive bills. You might be able to play dumb and say you don’t know when the hookup was completed.
Often the sewer bill is included with the water bill. You should be able to check public town documents on what the rates are. You can use your water bill to calculate what your sewer bill should have been.
Most MA towns include sewage with the water bill. You said she had the house hooked up to the town. Was a permit pulled when you did this? It looks like it wasn’t so the town doesn’t know to charge you. MA doesn’t meter sewage it’s basically the usage of water times the sewage rate.
Yes her estate is responsible. But also since OP is asking about sewage municipality can’t exactly turn “off” sewage service for unpaid bills. I mean maybe they can but I highly doubt it.
It’s the same in MA towns that provide municipal water. They bill for sewage at the same usage as water but different rate. I was just saying there isn’t a way for the town to keep your water on and but sewage off.
