Who would have written about Native Americans on the Philippines? Probably not Spaniards, at least judging from my readings of the Spanish-Aztec wars. The best known Spanish accounts like those of Cortés and Díaz mention their native allies only in passing -- and we're talking of roughly 200,000 allies in 1521 here. So I doubt that the much fewer Native Americans in the Philippines would figure in their accounts, though I am not a specialist on the Philippines. At least one later report I read by the German Heinrich Martin (1609) does not mention indigenous people there.
-	Plus c) Slavery and forced labor was going on between asia and the Americas already by the 16th century -- while in much smaller numbers then the African slave trade it's a process that is still often and should not be overlooked.
I didn't realize so many asians were brought to the Americas as slaves, and this helps explain the reason there are populations of ethnic asians along the west coast of latin and South America.
So we have forced migration and enslavement of Asians going to Mexico, and the same thing going the other way, especially for captives. I haven't found concrete numbers for transports yet but we can assume that they were relatively low. Spanish control in the Philippines was mostly confined to Manila and it was not a popular destination for Spaniards. Priests of the religious orders preferred very much to stay in the Americas rather than head from there to Asia. Essentially, from the Spanish perspective Manila figured as a connection for trade between mainland Asia, onto Mexico, and from there to Spain.
