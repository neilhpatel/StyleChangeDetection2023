Milo wanted to grease up Trump' diseased asshole and dump a steaming load of flaming hate - felt that his loose bowels were drying out and so he injected a bit of Mexican incel magic together with a slug of creamy Yeezus and when he buttqueefed his Santorum it was more shitty and hateful than ever! Trunp is now the pathetic rube, worked over and buttfucked by a dlist has been piece of shit performance artist then left in the sewer behind Merde a Lardo, bleeding from his rectum and whining that he was tricked. "I took the money but I didn't want to suck that hairy bigot prick" as filthy Klan semen dribbles down his fat floppy chin and turkey neck. Sad but funny.
The fact that it is not obvious, is kind of sad. Too many seemingly normal people have revealed themselves to be as hateful, unbalanced, irrational bigots as Trump.
I know That loser, Milo, had access to Trump at Mar-a-Lago - where Trump was keeping classified records. JFC.
Maybe Trump offered Milo a job in exchange for saying Trump didn't know who Nick was, or that Nick would attend the dinner.
To all those Republicans saying Trump moved the documents to Mar-a-Lago to keep them safe - yeah Fort Knox has nothing on Mar-a-Lago. Safest place in the world.
What's Milo Yiannopoulos trying to accomplish with this interview? By saying Trump had no idea Nick Fuentes was going to be there, he's helping Trump. Is this Milo's pathetic attempt to get back in Trump's good graces? Is Milo trying to prove his loyalty to Trump by saying he orchestrated the dinner and PR nightmare? Which implies Trump is the innocent victim.
