I have a wife who has been in the hospital for mental health treatment, both voluntary and involuntary. I can't even fathom leaving the country while she was in that position. While she was in the hospital my entire life revolved around helping her through that situation, as it should have.
Agreed. It's really an awful situation, and I hope the best for Fetterman. As I get older I really have come to appreciate the importance of family/community/loved ones. I know it sounds obvious, but surrounding yourself with good people who care about you and that you care about in return is absolutely key. It's what we do for each other in moments of need that I think really define who we are as people.
It's hard to remember that people in spotlight are still humans. Plus I think Fetterman was one of the real honest good guys out there.
It really isn't. It is, however, a good reminder to have empathy for people who are going through struggles. It would have been hard enough for the kids if their dad got a new job as a US Senator, but he also had a life altering stroke. The family is just learning new ways to cope and be there for each other.
