If you are serious about your skeptiscism, it would be best if you start out by reading the actual papers referenced, as well as the book of his travels. The translation by Henry Yule does not just translate his travels, but adds commentary to it, regarding the (in)accuracy of certain events, timelines, locations, etc.
This is not how fact finding works. You seem to use the comment by u/Imgig as the primary proof that marco polo went to china, and since you can find discrepancies in his linked examples, you dismiss the entire idea.
If the details Marco Polo gave are supposed to be evidence that he went to China, I find these discrepancies to be really confounding.
If I receive answers from non-experts on this topic with comments like “He did go to China” that makes me feel less confident because the hagiography of Marco Polo for the last 500 years has been a series of non-experts saying that exact same thing.
That would be because I was quoting u/The_Jackmeister's more learned opinion: "The modern scholarly consensus is that he is actually quite reliable" - ie, that our second-favourite Venetian merchant did go to China.
