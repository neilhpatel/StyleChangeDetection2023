Yes, this is allowed, for the same reason they can charge smokers more: there is a significantly higher cost associated with medical care for young woman compared to young men. The fairly obvious reason is the sky high cost of maternity care. The ACA mandated coverage for maternity services, but TANSTAAFL.
Another source I looked at may explain the ambiguity even better, in a way I wasn’t thinking about. The ACA only regulates to conduct of the insurance companies to the individual or the insurance company to the employer group plan. Really, what matters is the offering of benefits from the employer to the employee, which is governed by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (aka Title VII). So even if the ACA permits the insurance companies to charge employers more for the women employees, companies aren’t allowed to pass those direct costs on down to the employees themselves without violating Title VII.
Based on her other comment, on the plan. Essentially they’re organized as a large group plan, when in reality it’s a bunch of small businesses banding together. Now I’m wondering if the AHP allocates the cost to the small businesses on a gender rated basis, and they were getting away with it because they were under the 15 employee threshold for Title VII to apply (or under 8 employees for Washinon states version of the EEOC).
Smaller employers which predominantly have (or only have) female employees - since otherwise the employer could be charged more for the female employees' premiums and despite the company not being able to charge their female employees more than their male employees for the same plan, a direct result of a largely female workforce would be the females would pay more than they would if the employer's workforce had more men in it.
