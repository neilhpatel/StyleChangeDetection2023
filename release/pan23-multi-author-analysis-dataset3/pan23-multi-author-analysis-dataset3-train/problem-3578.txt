What is your concern with a police report? Failing to report the incident to police is not going to make the DM suddenly go away or lose access to your personal info. Do you want to live in perpetual fear with no justice served, or do you want him brought to justice?
Even if lawyers will not take your civil case, the actions of the DM are criminal and you can file a police report. You can include the contact info of any corroborating witnesses in the police report.
If you are unwilling to contact police and no lawyers will take your case then there is not much that anyone can do for you.
Without a police report I don’t see any way you would win in court even if you got someone to take the case. His lawyers are going to paint it to be an extortion attempt, the photos won’t prove that it was his phone ( just that it’s the same model and color) let alone prove that the phone was recording, the ex-employees only have second hand or circumstantial testimony, the clerk has first hand testimony but they didn’t actually see the phone either just your reactions. The only lawyer that would touch this is going to want cash up front and they are probably going to get nowhere and go no contact when you run out of cash.
