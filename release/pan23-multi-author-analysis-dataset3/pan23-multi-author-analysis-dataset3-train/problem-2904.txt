How is what to do confusing? Get medically taken care of and call the police - that should have been done immediately, not after you “had a concussion all day”, but you can’t change the past, so do it now. If you want to proceed with a civil suit, find a lawyer to do that too. There’s obviously more to this story since you keep trying to justify not paying because your key still worked and because it’s clear that anyone in their right mind would’ve called the police already otherwise. But whatever, call them anyway if there’s any semblance of truth in your post. Also how did they “go through” your phone if it was dead?
So, your phone was dead, but they also managed to "go through" your phone, see that you had money (by hacking into your accounts?) and sent themselves money?
The history of drug use evidenced by your post history leads me to believe that there is WAY more or way less to this story than you have laid out.
Generally speaking, hotels are staffed at a minimum and don't just keep a gang of knee breakers around in case someone doesn't pay.
