This should be qualified better, because there's a lot of misinformation on this point that leads people to believe Congress is actually spending social security funds on other things.
In fact this has been the answer every time Republicans start their lies and fearmongering over Social Security becoming insolvent, it's numbers simply need to be adjusted.
Actually it does not require this at all, most workers and small businesses need not pay a penny more in payroll tax.
All that is required is raising the income cap. As of 2023, no additional income beyond $160,200 is taxed for Social Security. Meaning whether you make $160,200 or fifty million dollars+, you pay the same amount into Social Security. If you are rich you automatically get to pay less than everybody else, because of course it is that way because 'Murica.
There's also other social safety net revenue streams like capital gains taxes etc that can be tapped into. Lower income brackets could pay even less in Social Security taxes if the wealthy paid more of their fair share.
