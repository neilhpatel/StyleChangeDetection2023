So US companies have announced about $200 billion worth of stock buybacks so far this year. By end of the year, let's say that's 1.2 trillion on same pace.
Ultimately, all wealth over a certain amount should be taxed almost entirely to avoid this comic book level wealth inequality we live with and create a livable society for all.
That 4% is $40 billion dollars in tax revenue. Not a small amount of money by many standards, but the actual question is not if 4% is the right number, it's if 4% will cut into or negate the value of the process of stock buybacks in the first place enough to discourage it?
Yeah the thing about buybacks being such a delay in the taxes being paid by the shareholder are why I don’t mind a small excise tax on buybacks, I’m just pushing back on some of those comments about buybacks being purely stock manipulation.
Buyback artificially pushed up the price of the stock, allowing the shareholders to delay paying their taxes until they sell. It’s essentially just a tax dodging loophole with no real value to the economy.
Look at US GINI index, a not small part of that is caused by shifted money around like this to avoid taxes. There is a reason the average billionaire has a tax burden of something like 8%. Look up "buy, borrow, die".
