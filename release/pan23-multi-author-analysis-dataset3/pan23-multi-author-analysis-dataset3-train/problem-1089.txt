When their committees produce nothing of substance and are compared unfavorably with the January 6th committee, they'll have their reward.
Once upon a time a politician being in proximity to a scandal would loom pretty negatively on that person. After 4 years of trump what qualifies as a scandal has been seriously altered. If Hunter Biden has pictures of little boys taking meth and him partying with them, it will be sensationalistic to be sure, but it wont affect President Biden at all.
I get the sense this will be another Whitewater investigation, full of hypocricy, and going to drag Hunter Biden through the mud as a means to hurt Joe Biden.
This is where our tax dollars are going for republican losers, to chase fairies for something that’s already been investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing and nobody really cares about Biden son. It won’t change nothing.
It’ll all be for naught though. Unless something is really illegal, the House Republicans need DOJ to follow up specifically the AG.
