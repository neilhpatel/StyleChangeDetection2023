His family is disfunctional as hell. Wife left him, one daughter hates him (and gave signals she supports Navalny), his other kids try to not show any connection to him.
Your version is more likely, because this already happened once after fall of USSR. New leader (if it's not Medvedev) will turn propaganda machine against current government.
Nah, people from reddit definitely knows everything about Russia and Ukraine. They predicted default in Russia with 100% accuracy! It would happen any day now (it's still spring, right?).
this is very true. honestly, if he isn't assassinated by the Wagner group, or a guard of his that decides to be a martyr, this is most likely how it's all gonna end.
yeah, which is why i included that bit. some countries might willingly give them, die-hard Russian states definitely won't. Whatever group fills Putin's power vacuum won't give them up without a fight, though i doubt they will be able to use said nuclear weapons.
I wouldn’t exactly call that “good news.” A power struggle in Russia could easily become Russian civil war 2, now with 6,500 nuclear warheads.
Yeah there is always the threat of nuclear war, but with no clear successor to putin, there is no clear answer to who would be in control of those nukes.
If things were to escalate to the point of a civil war in russia, the us and china would most assuredly step in and take control of russias nuclear arsenal.
And again, a second Russian civil war where nobody knows who controls the nuclear arsenal would be a threat to the safety of human civilization and the entire world. Not a scenario we want to end up in.
