Hi! I'm really sorry to do this, but, could you please supply a little more information? I don't have either Beaune book in front of me. What year(s) are the registers from, and what is the context of the reference to Joan hearing St. Margaret's voice?
>There are three voices \[talking to Joan\] : the archangel Saint Michael, Saint Catherine and Saint Marguerite. Michael appeared to Joan first and tought her to "govern herself". He is her guardian angel, but he doesn't come often: "It's been four months since I last saw him". The archangel is the protector of the kingdom of Bourges and has appeared on the flag of Charles VII since 1420. But Joan sees him rather as an angel (he appears as such on her fanion) than in combat, therefore different from the flags of the king, where Michael wears the armor. Catherine of Alexandria is the daughter of a king who, like Joan, refused to marry, only to find herself in a prison and fighting against an assembly of fifty doctors. Are not Joan's judges fifty at certain sessions? Catherine, whose relics lie in Western Europe, mainly in Rouen, is the patron saint of all those who are mistreated or dream of escaping. And Jeanne dreams of it. Marguerite of Antioch, who remained a virgin and was a shepherdess, is the most discreet of Jeanne's voices. She is the protector of women in childbirth, a heavy responsibility at a time when one in four women dies while giving birth to their first child. The voices comfort, heal, advise hze. In a sense, they are the true family of Joan, her brothers and sisters in Heaven, who will never abandon her.
