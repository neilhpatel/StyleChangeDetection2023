A Murdoch newspaper in the UK (_News of the World_) went too far with their ‘news reporting’. The fallout was such that the paper doesn’t exist anymore. In a just world, FoxNews, or at the very least its anchors, would face the same fate.
Though I wouldn’t be opposed to turning all major news networks inside out, this case is Fox News’ alone.
I mean tv networks have been forced to put disclaimers before and during their programing for some pretty minor stuff compared to what Fox News is guilty of.
And that was what initially cost them a lot of viewers which is why they were so concerned if they didn't perpetuate the lie what would happen to their bottom line and their network.
It's not for nothing that Trumps base has a good amount of folks without any college education. Not saying it should take much grey matter to figure it out. But typically this is true when it comes to most if not all strongmen that first get elected to office.
Thing is in my opinion they had been perpetuating the very thing that put them in this position in the first place. Conspiracy theories and enabling Donald Trump was just coming to fruition if you ask me. Their audience had been vulnerable to this kind of thing for years even before Donald Trump but frankly I believe Fox had always just been taking advantage of it. But then came along Donald Trump, the very guy known to ruin anything and everything he has ever put his hands on.
Edit: I just read he's the only President to lose money upon exiting the Whitehouse since at least President Johnson. This is Donald Trump. This is who he is.
