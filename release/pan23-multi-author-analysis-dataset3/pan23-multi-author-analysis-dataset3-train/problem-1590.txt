If all 5 people inherited equal shares, and one person wants to buy out the other 4 in order to own the entire property, then ALL 4 need to agree on the sale. Any individual can sell their own share to one of the other heirs for an agreed upon price by those two parties.
It sounds like your aunt wants to swindle her siblings out of their equal share of their inheritance. I would recommend letting your other aunts and uncles know that if the go through with the sale, they’re cutting their inheritance in half.
Yea so best course of action is to talk to the other beneficiaries and tell them to not sell to aunt for this low, you likely can't stop the executor but they do own that 3/5s of the house right now.
Luckily there is no pending sale yet, but the Aunt who wants to purchase told the Executor Aunt about her intention to buy and the Executor Aunt has told everyone else that they should let it happen.
I think it was that the property was left to all of them, I’m not sure if it stipulates it being sold and split.
Did the will stipulate selling the property and then dividing the money, or is the property to be left to the 5 siblings? Does the executor have a connection to the aunt that the others do not?
