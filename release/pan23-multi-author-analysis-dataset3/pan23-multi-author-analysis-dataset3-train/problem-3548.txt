It depends on the language of the lease but it's likely a pretty broad clause- some are as broad as 'police activity.' If it is that broad just the act of the husband being arrested by the police at home or the police searching the property would allow her to be evicted.
Because your friend and her husband are surely "joint tenants", they must both be evicted to remove him from the house or apartment.
If your friend received a notice to terminate the lease or of eviction they should talk to a tenants rights group or a lawyer that handles eviction defense. Virginia Poverty Law Center and Legal services of northern VA both can help.
In short, it is possible everyone on the lease could be evicted if one person breaks the lease, and certain criminal activity can be a lease violation that can get everyone evicted. Whether that applies in this case would depend on the specifics, the local court.
is the applicable law. As you noted, a conviction isn't necessary, only a "preponderance of the evidence" that the crime is a threat to health or safety.
