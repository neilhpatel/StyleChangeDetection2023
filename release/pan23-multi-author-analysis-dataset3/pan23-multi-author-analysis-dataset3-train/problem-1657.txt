Wow I actually had no idea about that. Yeah we haven't had any sort of real medical issues or lost time (aside from 1 night at her unpaid internship for school) come up from it. The only thing is what I said which was the soreness (probably whiplash) and the pain meds. Makes a ton of sense that we wouldn't get anything from trying to sue (as I have been telling my parents) but this helps give me more information on how to educate them on why we can't just sue like they are telling us to.
See this is exactly what I expected to see. I still don't know where they came up with that figure personally. She did miss one day of her unpaid internship for school but nothing else. I think the sensationalized stories are what is giving them the idea that we could sue like that.
I feel like he is going to say what others in the thread have said so far which is about what I expected to see which honestly makes me smile. I hate the idea of frivolous lawsuits like this which is why I'm trying to educate myself as much as I can on the current situation haha.
I'd still keep your consult with a lawyer to see if there are things that would merit a lawsuit, but don't get your hopes up. Thanks to sensationalized stories and Hollywood, there's the idea that any accident results in a massive payday lawsuit for the victim. While it is true that you can file suit against anyone for anything in the US, if the suit is meritless (that is - you're just suing to sue, you don't actually have any grounds to sue them), the suit won't go anywhere.
