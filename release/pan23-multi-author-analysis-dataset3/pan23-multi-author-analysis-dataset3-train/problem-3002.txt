Ultimately the truth is that unless you get lucky and the LEA can’t produce calibration or training information, radar is very compelling evidence.
A lawyer improves your odds of a positive outcome. They don’t change the fundamental of the officer’s competent testimony being enough to convict you.
You don’t have to prove or disprove anything as a defendant. You have to go to trial and create reasonable doubt to the judge and or jury. The state’s burden is to prove you guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt,” so create reasonable doubt. The state is going to present their case by having the trooper testify to his training, equipment, experience, and the events of that particular stop. Your only real chance is to file for discovery so you can see the evidence they’ll use against you, and find something wrong. I.e. the trooper didn’t check the calibration of the radar before and after the stop, the calibration records not existing, etc... like the previous comment said, a radar is very compelling evidence. These are not easy cases to beat.
Idk what to tell you, man. It seems like paying the ticket is a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a lawyer even if you are found not guilty. The benefit is that you can pay the lawyer to do all of the digging on the records and asking all the questions in court.
Mobile means he was moving. There are two basic types of radar use: stationary and moving mode. Speed is a prima facie offense meaning they don’t have to prove you were going 70mph in a 55mph zone, they have to prove you were going faster than 55mph.
