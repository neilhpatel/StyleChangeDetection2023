I don't know much about economics-if China has a lot of silver, and the US government is buying silver at above market price, why is that a problem for China instead of a good thing? If they can sell it for more than it's worth?
I know this is kind of a tangent now but-if silver is just being used as a standard, if there's less silver doesn't that just make it worth more? If half of the silver has gone to the US, can't you now buy twice as much real goods with the same amount of silver, so it only becomes a problem once you start reaching the smallest divisible weight of silver (whatever that is)?
That example only makes sense in the context of an abstract problem where the silver has gone into a black hole instead of the US, and there is only one market where everything is transacted. In a world where there are multiple players with multiple currencies and multiple production functions, it starts to fall apart.
Generally speaking, inflation and deflation aren't really "expected/unexpected" per se: if an increase in the money supply is completely predicted, depending on the economic expectations model you are using, there may be no inflationary impact at all. Deflation, however, is in general bad for a growing economy.
This is a bit of a rough example, but that's essentially what happens to an economy drained of currency.
