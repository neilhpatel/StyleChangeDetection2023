Things I plan to discuss with the real estate agent and the seller are the timing of everything, especially since my apartment lease asks for 2 months advance in breaking the lease early. So, I know there will be a little bit of massaging in this to get timing that works our for both parties. Although, the seller said they aren't in a massive rush, they just bought their new house and in his words, "it's not like we will be paying two mortgages" (he paid of the house I believe already and their new house is their retirement home).
We are not in a rush at all, it's more about the seller (who I know professionally/personally). When you say, "wait to purchase" do you mean in terms of signing or when we plan to "close", on the house?
When I say "wait to purchase," I only mean that the end of the eviction moratorium is likely to have dramatic repercussions on the housing market and economy as a whole.
While this is entirely speculative, history has an extraordinary track record of repeating itself... and we are probably in for a WILD few month.
