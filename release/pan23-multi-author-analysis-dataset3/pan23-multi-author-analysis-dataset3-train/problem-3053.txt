Of course she has, but they don't ask for taxes, that's FAFSA stuff. Keep in mind, I'm obviously a Florida resident, USF just wont recognize me as such.
I was born in Florida to US citizens and lived there for my whole life except for three years when we lived outside the US. I did 1st grade in FL, 5th-12th grade in FL, dropped out in the 12th grade and got my GED in FL, sent in my Florida high school transcripts including the AP exams I had passed and the SAT/ACT scores I had earned in FL, had worked and paid taxes as a teenager in FL, had a FL driver's license, had a car titled, registered and insured in FL.
She needs to get a FL driver's license. She needs to file taxes. The issue here by your own admission is that you want the benefits of being recognized as an in-state resident meanwhile your mom doesn't have an in-state license, isn't paying taxes, etc.
Because my dad moved a year and a half before I tried to enroll in Miami Dade CC, they refused to accept my residency. I may as well have been from Outer Space. At 18 years old I ended up having to get my father's ex-wife -- the same woman who abused me throughout my childhood and had not spoken to in five years -- to sign as my "parent" to get those fucking bureaucrats to accept the incontrovertible fact that I'm as Floridian as Co√±o, Carajo, y Pan Cubano.
