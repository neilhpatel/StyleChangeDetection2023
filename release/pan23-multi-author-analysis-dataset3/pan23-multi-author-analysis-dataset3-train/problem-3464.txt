What they're saying is how it should be, yes. You have an existing lease and that cannot be unilaterally changed.
Correct, because it is not half. It is the full rent on your lease. It would only be half if both you and the roommate were on the same lease, but you've made clear that is not the case.
They would be within their rights to re-rent the other room, however because it seems they want to get all of their new leases onto a per unit basis, it sounds like they will not attempt to do so.
When we signed the lease it was two separate ones we are each paying for our own room and then less then a month ago the complex changed it to where they charge by unit however we are still paying by room.
Was this before or after the change, did you sign two one-year leases for two bedrooms, or did you sign together for a unit?
If you are both on the same lease, both of you have to make sure 100% of the rent is paid, even if one of you doesn't live there. He's still responsible. You may have to pay it all and then sue him. But please confirm what sort of lease are you on, a joint one? What does the lease say about sublets?
Then that lease should still be enforced. When does it expire, next year? They can't just break a lease and change everything. If you are paying for one room, and renting one room, then I don't understand why what the complex does with other rooms matters?
