I'm going to make a somewhat unconventional suggestion, Survivors: An Oral History of the Armenian Genocide, by Donald E. Miller and Lorna Touryan Miller.
The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies edited by Richard G. Hovannisian is a collection of writings by various authors, numbering over a dozen essays. I realize that anyone with an Armenian last name might not meet what you are looking for, but while Hovannisian is the editor, the contents reflect a wide array of contributors on many topics relating to the genocide.
Another good source might be Hrant Dink's articles collected in books by the International Hrant Dink Foundation for an Armenian perspective on the genocide and living in Turkey as an Armenian that is more emotional and journalistic and less academic.
As I have read every book I can get my hands on on the subject of the Armenian Genocide (It started with my trying to find out how in the world the Holocaust of WWII could have happened) I can honestly say, there is no way to read a book on the Armenian Genocide that WOULD NOT demonize the Turks.
"They Can Live in the Desert but Nowhere Else": A History of the Armenian Genocide by Ronald Grigor Suny is a bit more basic, but great book for someone looking for a less hefty read, so probably more accessible a read than KÃ©vorkian.
