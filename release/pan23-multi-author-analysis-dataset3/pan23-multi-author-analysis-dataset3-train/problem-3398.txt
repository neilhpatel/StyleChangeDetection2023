A question that sprang to mind when you talked about the pseudo-Seneca-- have there ever been busts that were caricatures, basically insulting the person whom they were purported to depict? Ones that may have depicted the person as uglier than they were, or even less heroic and godly than classic busts tended to depict great men?
There were certainly sculptures that represented figures in a non-heroic way. Satyrs, for example, are often shown getting shunned or beaten by nymphs (there's in the Naples Archaeological Museum). And there were also sculptures of non-heroic or undignified subjects (the springs to mind). But typically, Romans set up busts of distinguished figures because they respected them (or, equally importantly, because they wanted to project the impression that they respected them). So there was little demand for, say, a comical representation of Scipio. There are Greek vase paintings of gods in various compromising myths, but that reflects a genre with different expectations.
Some statues were misidentified in the middle ages (the famous equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, for example, was thought to be Constantine), these errors (and any later inscriptions) have been discovered and exploded by modern scholarship.
On a slightly related note - when marble statues are confidently described as Roman copies of Greek or Hellenistic originals, how is that determination made considering that so many earlier Bronze statues no longer exist? Is it primarily based on analysis of the art style, literary references, etc.?
