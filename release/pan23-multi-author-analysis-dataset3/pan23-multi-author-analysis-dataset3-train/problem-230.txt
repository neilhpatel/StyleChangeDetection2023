It is also a fact that the CCP being assholes is not a justification for maligning Chinese history and culture.
It is a fact that China are extremely aggressive now and need to be called out. A 'phobia' implies irrational fear, and there is nothing irrational about being afraid of what the CCP are up to.
You might want to read up on the Guptas, Mauryans etc and the various Southern empires. For over 2000 years there were indigenous empires, some of where were more powerful than the Mughals.
There was never an Indian empire. It was always muslims ruling the subcontinent. The Mughals ruled it for 1000 years after that the British took over. So there was only the muslim and British empire in subcontinent no Indian empire of any sort.
What is modern day Tamil Nadu and Kerala was never part of the Mughal empire - either as territory or as vassals. They were only conquered twice by outside forces in their history - by Malik Kafur in the 13th century and by the British.
Extremely ignorant comment. The Mughals were not even the first muslim empire. Northern India and present day Pakistan were under muslim rule for over 300 years before Babur.
