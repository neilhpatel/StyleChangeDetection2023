I’m not so sure. I think there were plenty of ways their feet could have been held to the fire then. Instead, Obama and the Democrats expected them to he reasonable and got burned because the GOP made up their minds ahead of time.
Interesting how in his book he basically spelled out how Obama could have cemented his popularity and destroyed the Republicans by embracing big infrastructure projects……. just like Joe Biden has done with this Congress.
Especially when you consider how Senate Republicans have been successfully pressured into supporting so much bipartisan infrastructure and industrial policy legislation during this Congress (and were then subsequently steamrolled with the IRA after all those bills passed).
Blaming everything on Republican obstructionism, I think, erases some serious miscalculations made on the part of the Democratic establishment at the time.
That the buddy buddy relationship Dems had with so many Republicans is indicative of the ultimately conservative and establishment goals of the Democrats despite their posturing.
On the other hand, this may be an indication that the GOP is going to further alienate everyone but “the base”, thus strenhening the Dems showing in a couple of years.
