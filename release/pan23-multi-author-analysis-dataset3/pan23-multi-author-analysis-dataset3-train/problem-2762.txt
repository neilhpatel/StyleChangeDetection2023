The media are super mean to Black conservatives and there are enough racists on the East half of the country (both north and South) that it would guarantee a loss. A Hispanic running would turn the fastest growing part of the population to the right, especially as their values align closer anyway.
The DNC wants Biden out. It wouldn't surprise me if they didn't through him under the bus to prevent him from running again. The small loss they would take from that would be nothing compared to the loss if it were Biden vs anyone other than Trump.
I’m not saying Biden didn’t store the documents better than trump. I’m saying that he didn’t obstruct justice by knowingly lying about turning them all over like trump did.
FWIW I don't think anything should happen to President Biden because of this, but to say what has occurred is not illegal is disingenuous.
Second just to play here... Biden's 15 docs isn't Trumps 350 ripe and current national top secrets. Biden followed process immediately upon discovery.
