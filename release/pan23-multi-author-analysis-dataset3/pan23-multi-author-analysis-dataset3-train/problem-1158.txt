They're not terrified. They're finding groups they perceive as weak and unable to defend themselves and using the power of government to go after them. They've about done what they can against trans people so now they go after "gender studies".
And I've come to think all these scapegoats: critical race theory, trans something, gender studies, african american studies. It's all a stand in for what they're really against - education, all of it.
College is not job training, and a degree is what you make of it. I know plenty of folks who got degrees in philosophy and renaissance art appreciation who went on to build meaningful careers, and plenty who went for medicine and engineering who did jack fuckin shit with their degree, and plenty in between.
Education in general is a building block for upward mobility, I've come to think a college major doesn't matter as much as it's given credit for. Just having a degree of any kind is a certificate of being an educated person.
Also, any of them going on about this either never went to college or didn't get anything out it it.
