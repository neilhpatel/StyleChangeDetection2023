However, if your uncle did have insurance with only your eldest cousin as the beneficiary, then the money is hers to do with as she pleases, no matter what your uncle wished. Insurance is a contractual issue, and the terms of the policy will override any other statement, including your uncle's will (if he had had one) and your uncle's personal wishes and requests.
I would question whether or not the policy was in the names of all three (3) children and if so, did older sister sign on behalf of them (other minors) to obtain the insurance proceeds.
IF IF you really think all three (3) children were named as beneficiaries on the life insurance policy, you MAY MAY be able to get the insurance company to confirm whether or not that is true.
IF he named the one (1) daughter as a beneficiary, then she takes all 100% of the insurance proceeds.
Assuming her claim of being the sole beneficiary is correct then the eldest daughter is completely correct that the money is solely hers and she has no legal obligation to share it. The life insurance payout transfers directly to the beneficiary on death. It completely skips the deceased person's estate/will.
