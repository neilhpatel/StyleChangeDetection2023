I mean no offense with this potentially offensive statement, but the United States really shouldn’t be comparing itself to any of those countries and should be taking responsibility for the administration of our territories. We’re supposed to be operating in a different geopolitical league, we shouldn’t pride ourselves on just barely beating out this list.
Sure, we're economically different than those examples, but there are very strong cultural associations with each in many parts of the US.
Why shouldn't the US be compared with countries that are our geographic neighbors and who immigrate a significant amount of people into the country?
1) A middle class person in Brazil wouldn't necessarily have a better life just because they packed up and moved to the US.
On average, if this person has the option to move, they are better off than the average Brazilian. Lots of folks live fairly well in Brazil, just like lots of folks, given the same income they are making right now in the US, would be better off in Brazil.
I mean, on average you’d have a massive jump in standard of living going from Brazil to the US so you aren’t really basing your opinion in logic.
I know it’s easily confused with the brazil in Europe but we’re talking about the one in South America.
For example, here the US is at 163 while Brazil is 100, you’re literally below even the worst of the worst Eastern European nations.
