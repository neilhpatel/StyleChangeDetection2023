NAL. Georgia has specific laws on surveillance in the workplace. Cameras in bathrooms aren't allowed.
Since this could go multiple ways legally (civil suit, etc), I would recommend consulting with a lawyer first before taking any further action.
Maybe a more creative (and experienced-in-Georgia) attorney might be able to think of civil claims for you.
There could also be civil remedies if that is what you’re after (money from your employer), but you’d need to consult an employment attorney. And as someone who is fairly experience in employment law generally speaking (particularly on the defense side), I don’t think you would win any kind of civil case, as inappropriate as your employer’s conduct was, especially given the apparent facts of this case. Maybe you’d get a settlement, but I’m not sure what the basis would be, as I think wrongful termination is off the table for you. (I’m assuming the photos showed that you were doing illegal drugs at the workplace during working hours.).
Your employer could potentially be criminally prosecuted for illegal surveillance… and maybe some kind of indecency law. But that would be up to the police and prosecutors, if and only after someone (maybe you?) files a report with the police. Note that criminal prosecution for these particular crimes will not get you any money—any fines they pay (if they are convicted or plead guilty) will go to the state, not you.
