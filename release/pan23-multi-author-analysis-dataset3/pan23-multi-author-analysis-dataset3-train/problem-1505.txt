It's a shame she gave her notice on the day of direct deposit. You only have 48 hour window to initiate a direct deposit reversal before the bank tells you to go pound sand.
If I were them, I would ask in email why the funds were taken back. Someone in payroll might be dumb enough to give a reason that they were given to do it that is not actually legal. By any chance do you get paid for the upcoming two weeks as opposed to the previous? This isn't very common but I suppose it could be the case for an entirely salary workforce.
thank you for your response, the fact we are salaried doesn’t affect the amount of hours worked? I could understand if we were hourly. I’ve also just been told they were not intending to pay her for Sept 1 or 2, which were days worked. They only agreed after she went to HR.
I guess I should clarify that “on recess” was a company-wide recess. We are a school that was on a short summer vacation. Sept 1 restarted the school year. She did not take a personal recess or use PTO.
