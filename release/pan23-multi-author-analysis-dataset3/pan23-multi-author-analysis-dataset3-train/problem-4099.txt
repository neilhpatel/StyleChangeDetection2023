You need to look at what the standard pay period is, but it would be normal for pay to be “delayed” a week. Assuming pay happens every week you would normally have your payroll processed the which would then take a few more days to result in checks being issued or direct deposits being made. For example, in your case I suspect what has happened is this:
This still sounds like its legal. It sounds like you started right after a pay period ended, the pay then took several days to process. So yes, it will likely be three weeks from when you start until you get paid, and at that time you will get paid for the first two weeks you worked.
I'm not trying to make a point with the only one day off thing just saying how many days I've worked, I'm completely ok with only having one day off but we do get paid every two weeks.
In many places, payday can be in a range, sometimes up to two weeks after the final day of work for the pay period. What's your location and what is the set workweek and set payday and payday interval?
