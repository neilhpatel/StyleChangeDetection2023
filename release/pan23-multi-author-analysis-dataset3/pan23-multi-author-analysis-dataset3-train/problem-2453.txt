This is all in addition to the real hero in Finnish defense, the geography, which is rarely mentioned for some reason. The terrain is incredibly difficult for an invading force to make progress in.
Not sure how the food hate came to be, maybe has something to do with salted licorice and blood sausage? Finnish baking is amazing, food is mostly the same as Sweden etc.
I see you even had to resort to using pancakes to defend Finlands kitchen. I am sorry, but all is lost (in that specific area, the rest is top notch and should be made into a text book).
It is absolutely wild how planning a new building takes into account far more aspects than just living or working there. Finland is like a more refined versioning of Germany of Skandinavia.
Yeah, NATO will be extremely fortunate to have Finland on our side. Fantastic air force and a huge and well-equipped ground army. Really glad the USA sent that warship to Helsinki right away as a show of NATO support. I'm not sure Finland even needs NATO to fend off Russia, but NATO is certainly a lot stronger with the Finns on board.
After being threatened, Finland called putin to tell him that they were going to join NATO. Wish i could have been in that room to see his face as he realized his dumb ass idea didnt work.
