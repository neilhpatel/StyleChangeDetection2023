Isn't one's "fair share" what the tax laws of the US government say you owe?The issue here is the tax code and all the BS loopholes wealthy people like Trump can rely upon to pay next to nothing. Ultimately the government is supposed to dictate what everyone's fair share is via the tax code and that has clearly failed here.
I can all but guarantee every wealthy American (republican and democrat alike) have tax returns that look identical to this. If it takes the mainstream's hate of Trump to actually do something about this - great. But I sadly expect all the high level Dems will clutch pearls about his (and possibly Musks) while doing the exact same fucking thing in their own returns. At least the Republicans are honest about it and don't try to virtue signal like they give a shit about paying in for the common good.
Would be nice if something positive would actually come from Trump's existence like galvanizing support to eliminate the types of tax loopholes he exploits....but I won't hold my breath.
Let’s be honest, don’t be mad at Trump, he followed the law (questionable for sure), but we really need to evaluate the “tax laws” and all the loopholes that never seem to be closed.
No, there is probably not another tax return in the country as complex as Trumps, this isn't just taking advantage of the rules, this is tax fraud(hasn't been proven yet, but that's what the author is talking about).
Oh yeah but I don’t think anyone knew he deducted it as a business expense like Cohen is saying (or maybe he did atm, Trump’s crimed so much I can’t keep with all of it).
