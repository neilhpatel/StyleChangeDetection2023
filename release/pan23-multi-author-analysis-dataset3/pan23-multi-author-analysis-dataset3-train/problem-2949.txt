Part of my concern is that the provider did not say "yes, this could be lymphoma, go to a primary care provider", but specifically told me to not do anything about it at all and to wait until swelling subsided. But lymphoma travels from nodule to nodule, and the swelling just moved location deeper into my chest, where it was not visible.
The thing is, though, there are plenty of reasons a lymph node might swell up for reasons other than lymphoma. Infections, a secondary response to inflammation elsewhere, etc. The fact that you were likelier to have lymphoma doesn't mean it was likely in absolute terms, and (speaking from personal experience) I can say "just wait and see" is a fairly common response to lymph node swelling--horses, not zebras, after all. So it doesn't seem like the standard of care was violated here, which is the bar for malpractice. Now, if you have time and money, you can talk to a malpractice lawyer, but don't expect it to go anywhere.
Getting an opinion from a malpractice lawyer is the right thing to do, although the.answer you might get is not the one you hope for.
You would have to talk to a lawyer that specializes in Medical Malpractice. It's extremely fact specific and no one here has enough info or knowledge to give you a real answer.
