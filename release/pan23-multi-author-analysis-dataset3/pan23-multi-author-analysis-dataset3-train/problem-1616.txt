Keep in mind that the this could get quite costly to resolve. Any issues with the trust or trustee adhering to their duties, will use monies from the trust to defend.
You could then file a complaint with the courts that the trustee is not acting in the beneficiaries' best interest, besides from your brother. You could demand the trust dispose of non income producing interest.
Its not uncommon for a trust document to require the trust to hold income producing assets. This, of course, is not. My only thought on the trust not including this provision is BoA is the trustee, and being that they arent fans of litigation against them (for not performing their fiduciary duties), they probably wouldnt have allowed it for this long of time, but its definitely worth asking.
As far as your brother, maybe there can be an argument of unequal distributions. I have seen this before, and generally any expenses paid by the trust for the personal use of an asset by a beneficiary would be treated as a deemed distribution to that beneficiary.
You need to see what the language of the trust actually says about distributions to beneficiaries before you assume that someone's lifestyle is being subsidized. It will probably have standard language in there about payments being given to the beneficiaries for "their health, education, maintenance or support" and the payments are issued at the absolute discretion of the trustee.
