There is an interesting book, "How Civil Wars Start" by Barbara Walter (not Walters .). She's a political scientist who studies civil war. She lays out some criteria that often lead to civil war (and mentions that civil wars are less about geographical divisions than they are ideological or other divisions.
And she does make a point that in many civil wars people think "no way that would happen here" up until the moment it starts.
Personally, if there's going to be another civil war, then we've anyway seen what it looks like. Individual armed demonstrations. The next Civil War is America vs domestic terrorists.
Is a civil war in the sense of militia vs military etc. the real worry here? My worry is the person decides to act alone (doesn't even matter who, what, where, why) and that leads to someone else countering and so on.
Laws.Ideas Debate.Peaceful dissent. Anything beyond that is unacceptable no matter who, what, where, or why.
We apparently can argue about whether it can or can't happen. We can point to Jan 6th and we can point to riots after George Floyd was murdered. The argument some are making is essentially"well my violence is not as bad as your violence." (That is reflecting on the discourse you'll find right here).
