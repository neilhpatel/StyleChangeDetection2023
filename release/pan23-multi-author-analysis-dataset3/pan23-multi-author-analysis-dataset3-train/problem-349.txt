There is no urgency. Powerful NATO countries like the US and UK have already given Finland and Sweden defence guarantees, and the countries have enough friends (Hungary and Turkey should try that, friends), that they will get plenty of support if something happens.
Finland and Sweden provide a large area from which to attack Russia if they ever did attack NATO, Russia's NW is an important strategic region, I would say that adds to the deterrent significantly and they lock down the Baltic sea.
Finland being attacked and NATO defending them is more probable then somebody not deciding to attack a NATO member because they are scared of the might of Finland. Some country, lets say a country that borders Finland, might delude themselves into thinking NATO won't protect Finland and attack, not really an impossible scenario.
I think youre underestimating the military strenh of Finland and Sweden, and I'm not just worried about Russia, I'm more worried about a scenario where China, Russia, and their allies all attack the west.
If Finland or Sweden is invaded and they aren't in NATO precisely 0 Turkish or Hungarian soldiers will die for their sake.
How dare those barbarians in Turkey and Hungary not immediately agree to send their countrymen to suffer and die for the sake of Finland! Don't they know that their lives are worth less than swedish lives?
