As for that promotion, I think you'll have a hard time proving anyone in particular was denied the job based on the OSHA report, so that likely won't be considered retaliation.
Unless I'm reading this incorrectly, in regards to the suspected loss of a promotion: OP doesn't have standing to assert a claim, even if that could be considered an adverse employment action. Meaning OP can't file the claim for somebody else. Top post is correct in saying that OP should document everything and begin looking for jobs. Until the company takes some type of adverse employment action against OP directly(Not a co-worker), a case can't possibly be brought yet.
Sure, report to OSHA definitely, but OP canâ€™t file a claim (I.e sue the company) directly unless he himself is injured.
Edit: let me clarify, OP could file a claim against the company, but any claim based on "intimidation" because his co-worker was dismissed would be considered frivolous and any reasonable Court would dismiss it immediately for lack of standing.
