Zelenesky is also way younger. Putin is 70 and zelenesky is 44. I've never heard of those two age groups fighting and the older one winning unless he's heavily engaged in fitness already, which vlad absolutely is not.
It's more like a geriatric with a little judo background and military training vs a middle aged man who is in good shape, Poutine would be done in seconds.
Yeah well a 70 year old Poutine being "well documented" as a success in anything over there doesn't hold up well considering noone in their right mind would dare put up a fight against someone who will kill their whole family over a hit to his ego. We're also not talking about 3 skinny teenagers who have never been in a fight before either Zelenksy is a full grown man. Granted he was an entertainer, calling Puotine a Judo expert is a bit silly.
It wouldn't even be fair, Zelensky not only is in way better shape than Poutine but he's like 20 years younger.
As for your post, I love the idea of Klitchko beating Putin to a bloody pulp, but I highly doubt Zelensky would be able to do much.
Honestly I think that’s what Zelensky’s aiming for: piss putin off as much as possible. He’s gonna keep poking at putin until he fucks up, and hurting his ego and making putin feel powerless is the best way to poke him.
There’s only so much escalating putin can do before the world steps in or his officers and generals are sick of his shit.
