I have a separate diagnosis from my active therapist for PTSD, however. I would be willing to share my mental health records with the property management company.
It is a duplex home without central AC and it has a private fenced-in back yard. I do not believe allergies would be an issue and I also think the two neighbors have a few cats and large dogs are allowed in the lease, so I do not think any allergies would apply.
If the landlord's insurance, for example, prohibits shepherd breeds (which might be uncommon or unheard of, but I dunno), then the accommodation may not be reasonable.
While it's true that the FHA allows for any breed to be an ESA and does not allow for direct breed discrimination by the landlord, it has been fairly well established that if the breed creates a hardship for the landlord due to no fault of the landlord's own, this can be used to argue the requested accommodation is "unreasonable".
You should generally disclose the animal and your FHA accommodation letter before bringing the animal into the home, to allow the owner/landlord to assess whether the accommodation is reasonable (which, most of the time they are, but the landlord should still be afforded that opportunity).
If you can, I recommend not bringing your dog home until you have given your landlord the opportunity to examine your medical provider's letter and their own obligations under the FHA.
