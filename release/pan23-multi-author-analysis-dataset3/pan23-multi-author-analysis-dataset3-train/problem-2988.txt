But also because Chinaâ€™s homegrown alternatives (Baidu and Renren) were growing at that point, and China wanted less competition for those.
This attitude came much more recently, about a decade after these platforms were banned. They were still fine with Amazon and others holding Chinese user data until the end of the 2010s.
Google and Facebook were more likely pulled because both gave Chinese people access to see things China wanted censored, and both platforms reversed their initial agreement to blocking or filtering such info.
Thats not entirely true, the main reason social media Google etc is banned is because the CCP can't censor information about Chinese government actions from its people, meaning it's much harder to propagate the 'everything is fine, the government loves you, just don't look out the window' rhetoric.
The CCP banned Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube and most recently ChatGPT for their citizens while their elites gets free access to those websites all in the name of "National Security". What in the flying fuck are they talking about?
