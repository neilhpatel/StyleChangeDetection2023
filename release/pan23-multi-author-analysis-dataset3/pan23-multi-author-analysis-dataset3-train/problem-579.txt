So voting "present" is just a vote to continue the vote-whipping, deal-making, pizza-delivery process.
I think that voting "present" allows you to fulfill your obligation to participate in the vote, but doesn't add a vote to the Speaker candidate's tally. Because you were present, the number of votes necessary for a candidate to win the Speakership does not change.
Over half of the members must select a speaker. The GOP has like 51% of the seats, and 2% refuse to vote for McCarthy, the obvious frontrunner and person the old GOP and most of the HFC (MAGA folks) voted for.
I’ve been hearing that the votes are because the far left wing has some super extreme concessions they’d like McCarthy to make, and that’s the reason they’re not voting him in. I heard there are 25 of them in total who will be changing their vote in subsequent votes to embarrass him - one each vote.
That's worse than losing a vote, it's like losing 2 votes because the threshold for majority drops. It only takes 11 present votes for Jeffries to win.
