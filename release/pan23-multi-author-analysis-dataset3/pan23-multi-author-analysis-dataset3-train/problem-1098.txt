Lease doesn’t directly state it. Just says that the landlord can enter the property with 24hr notice (which they have already broke since they sent a text earlier this afternoon and entered tonight). They did however send us an email titled “Notice for all new tenants” that mentioned the monthly checkups.
Are there laws in your area that require monthly detector checks or are your tenants vulnerable or something? I could be wrong but I didn't think it was standard to check things so often and that it really would only happen in special circumstances. Also do you let perspective tenants know that's how often you do checks before they sign a lease or as part of the lease?
This is true, if the tenant sticks to his guns the landlord may say "OK" and then not renew the lease when it expires.
Fixed term, but the lease grants the landlord to renew the lease if we do not give them 3 months notice that we want to leave before the end of the term.
If the landlord comes early or texts you saying that he/she while be by in less than 24 hours then you could tell them to abide by the lease and give a 24 hour notice. However, there is a balance to making boundaries. Balance between compromising and not being a doormat.
