Could also be that Putin fears Wagner and is shunting their largest and easiest pool of potential mercs.
I'm curious if this was Putin's plan all along. Use Wagner to hire convicts and send them to the front as cannon fodder to wear down Ukrainian troops and supplies while Russia attempts to train thousands of new conscripts.
Could also be as Prigozin says. Wagner and it's convicts having more success than the Russian military, against elitist ideals etc.
"A certain number of pro-war functionaries decided that if they recruited convicts, they would be able to become famous as the Wagner Group.".
Details: This information was sent by Prigozhin to a Sverdlovsk [a Russian-occupied city in Luhansk Oblast – ed.] deputy as a response to his request to assist in the recruitment of women from the colonies. The deputy posted a screenshot of the businessman's answer, although there is neither a signature nor a mention of Prigozhin or Wagner Group.
"Excessively high efficiency of task performance, which puts a certain number of authorised persons in an uncomfortable position, as well as discredits the work of some units in other areas of the front. [Their – ed.] logic: ‘Too bold for the army and harmful, they don't let you sit it out in a hideout.’".
Bottom line: he was making the army look bad and told to stop. It’s not because Russia cares about Russian men dying or releasing criminals into the general population.
