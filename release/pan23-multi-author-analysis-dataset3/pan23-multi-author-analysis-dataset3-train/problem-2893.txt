Even before reading this far, it occurred to me that migraines are a common reason that people take intermittent FMLA.
Do you have specific triggers for your migraines? Maybe they’re loosely tied to your menstrual cycle, for example? Or they typically occur after X hours near blue light? Or Y hours after you’ve been sitting? A break during the day or a shift in your hours earlier/later in the day is likely to be a reasonable accommodation, depending on what you do. It’s possible that 2-3 days working from home per month may be too, but that is less certain. You may just need to use FMLA in that case.
The first step here should be to try and tough it out with their offered accommodations. If/when those prove to be insufficient, you should try again and ask for different accommodations. They technically don’t have to offer you any further accommodations until you try them and find them to be insufficient and/or your doctor says they will not be sufficient.
I think you have a good point about them not having to provide further accommodation until it's proven what they're doing isn't helping. Thank you. I appreciated this perspective.
