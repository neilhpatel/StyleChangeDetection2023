This is a fantastic answer. May I ask a follow-up? Where might I read a "history of the historiography" of Egypt/the pyramids? ie, when were the turning points in our understanding of the Old Kingdom, and what spurred each of those transitions? Did we jump straight from thinking the Pyramids were created 1200 BC right up to 1800, and then suddenly realize they were created 2500 BC at the time of Napoleanic interest? Or did the consensus of European historians at some intermediate medieval date slowly begin to shift, dating them older and older?
On a similar note, there was an actual New Kingdom pharaoh who WAS concurrent with Helen of Troy, or at least when Herodotus would have believed her to have lived - Ramses II, famously. Did Herodotus also misplace him in time, or did he think Ramses II was involved in the construction?
Herodotus talks about a warlike pharaoh named Sesostris, who seems to be a corrupted portrait of Ramses II. But neither he nor later classical writers associated this figure with the pyramids.
Greek and Roman authors knew that the pyramids were tombs, but tended to assume that they were much younger than the actually were. To quote my older answer, which focuses on the Great Pyramid:
There seem to be two sources of misinformation in the sources quoted here. First, Herodotus, whose work was a widely-read "classic" by the Roman era, had established an account of Egypt that some authors (and especially those who never visited Egypt themselves) regarded as definitive; Herodotus and other members of the literary tradition he established were simply imitated. Second, and I think more importantly, the Greeks and Romans (but especially the Greeks) had a habit of explaining every other culture's history and norms with reference to their own. Fitting Khufu (as Cheops or Chemnis or some other name) into a familiar Greek chronology as the descendant of a figure referenced in Homer may have simply been too intellectually tempting to resist.
