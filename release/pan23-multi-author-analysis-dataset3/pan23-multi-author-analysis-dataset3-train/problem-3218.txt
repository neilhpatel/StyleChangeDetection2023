considering that was the whole reason he bought Twitter it must have come as quite a shock and a bitter blow. A $44 billion miscalculation. Trump and Musk are as dumb as each other LOL.
It took me till this tweet yesterday to realize Musk is acting in bad faith. I finally left twitter, not sure whats gonna replace it but something better show up soon.
I’ve deleted Twitter and now mostly use Reddit for my news, though it’s not as easy to parse through big and small events on here. Not just because of Musk but it’s just a cesspool of really unhappy people.
Much like Trump, it's kind of irrelevant if Musk "believes" this or not. He's pandering to a faction of people that are easily manipulated because he wants social power over them.
It's also a convenient red herring for a group of people that were unimaginably WRONG about COVID-19, including Musk's tweet in 2020 saying COVID would magically disappear "by April".
- Fauci did not lie to Congress. NIH to this day has never said their research constitutes gain-of-function research.
