Only 369 billion was allocated. Check your facts. Of that, a significant amount is going to consumer incentives for solar panel installation and electric vehicles purchases rather than, y'know, actually solving the problem with mass transit and competitive production. Meanwhile, the US is actually expanding oil and gas extraction and the transit systems of Boston, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, etc. continue to deteriorate.
But then again, why would the US build more trains and buses when it can just prop up its automotive industry with rebates?
I mean, if America wants to send a consistent message, maybe they'd start manufacturing renewable technologies instead of relying on supply from Asian manufacturers?
To clarify your comment, the pledge is that western powers and latin american countries have to switch to renewable sources starting now while India and China dont have to start or reduce emissions until 2030.
