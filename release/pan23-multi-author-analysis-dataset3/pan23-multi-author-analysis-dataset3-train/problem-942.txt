Does the woman have a job? A house? Just because she claimed at the side of the road not to have money doesn't mean it's true.
Do you mean she had no uninsured motorist coverage, no collision coverage, etc. just the liability coverage required by the law?
Realistically, it may be hard to find a lawyer to sue the other driver, because lawyers don't like to take cases on a contingency fee basis against parties that have no insurance and no money to pay a judgment.
Unfortunately, if the at-fault driver has no insurance and has no money to pay a judgement if your friend sues, there isn't a third option unless your friend has collision/uninsured driver coverage and her own insurer cover the repair or total loss payout.
If the at-fault party had no insurance and your friend doesnâ€™t have uninsured motorist coverage she has no coverage. She can sue the person that hit her and proceed to get a judgment.
She can sue the driver. How does she know that this driver has no insurance? Did the police confirm that.
