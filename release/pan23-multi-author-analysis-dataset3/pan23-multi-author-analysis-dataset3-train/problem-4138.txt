When there’s increasing political and economic divide between young men and young women in America, they’re very possibly going to find even less in common with each other and have even less sex/committed relationships, which eventually does present serious issues for the global position of the United States and its ability to address problems at home.
This could be for a variety of reasons. One explanation might be because men are more likely to say that the patriarchal society doesn’t benefit them generally the way it’s often alleged to. Another could be that they’re generally fine with social equality, and have been for some time, but are not trending one way or another politically because they don’t feel like either option actually renders a more equal society than the current one. It’s certainly a very complex issue.
I do agree that these are complex issues with a lot of factors. And definitely that many women are watching their rights being taken away, which has to make anyone more liberal.
That is exactly it - plus add in being lgbt and female, two groups whose rights, choices and lives are being taken away or limited on the whim and will of those with the power to do so.
