I would not stay in the same place if you can help it. Tell him you are moving and to get his stuff. If you stay, he is a tenant and has rights to the apartment until you evict him.
This is in part a landlord-tenant issue but really more of a family law issue. An attorney specializing in landlord-tenant might not see the whole picture, so call a family law attorney.
I hope you don't have joint accounts in checking, cell phone, other utilities, and credit cards. Again, a family law attorney will help you sort through that.
You need to talk to a family lawyer, unfortunately. There's enough hypotheticals here that any "broad-strokes" advice might not apply to your specific situation. First you have to decide, lease aside, what it is YOU want. Do you want reconciliation with your husband? Do you want to be able to move on?
Having said that.... GENERALLY, any property that either of you acquired after you got married is considered "marital property" and is considered co-owned by both of you equally unless/until it's divided up in divorce. So if your husband bought a shirt the day after you guys got married, technically it's both of yours equally.
