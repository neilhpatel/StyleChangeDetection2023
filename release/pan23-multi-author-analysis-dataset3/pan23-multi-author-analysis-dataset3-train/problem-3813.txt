"ever heard of the Shah? How about Ferdinand Marcos? Or Pinapple Face (AKA Manuel Noriega),? Castelo Branco? Pinochet? Rhee? Islam Karimov?".
Wow. Does Putin think that Macron will say, "Okay, it's fine that you seized Crimea in 2014 and invaded Ukraine in 2022 because of the actions of one dictator who happened to be French? Cool, cool.".
P.S. Check out the Czekoslovak legion. They were volunteers from Czech and Slovak prisoners and formed the legion to fight Austria-Hungary in the hopes of getting a homeland. They get caught up in the Revolution, decide to go home by crossing Russia, the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and continue the fight in France.
Regarding the Romanovs, while it was true that Kerensky was not letting them leave, it was also true that the British government would not let them in. The killing of the Romanovs was clearly something the Bolsheviks did not want to be formally associated with. They denied it at first, and tried to obscure what orders their jailers had. And even killing them would not end the Romanov dynasty, if they lost the civil war, there were others. There is a current head of the Romanov family today.
