I left out a lot of the dealership portion because it is difficult for me to explain, and most of that feeling relates to my interpretation of the laws what should have been done differently on their end.
I got no confirmation with anything dated, only a payment confirmation with the 18th date that came in after I was already dealing with the situation, and I didn't check it until I was requested to forward all emails relating to the initiation of the policy.
It didn't return me anything other than a confirmation of purchase and contact information for a local office that would be my contact for the policy. I have never had an experience with insurance where a policy starts at a later date, so I didn't even think about that. I realize my fault in the situation, and I understand that ignorance is nobody else's obligation but my own.
Normally yes, however we had no vehicle and no insurance policy prior to purchasing this one, as I cancelled it with the sale of the old van.
In most instances your wife's policy on her old van would afford coverage to the new van while you arranged for coverage on the new. Are those the same insurance carrier? Have you tried to raise a claim under the policy on the older van?
