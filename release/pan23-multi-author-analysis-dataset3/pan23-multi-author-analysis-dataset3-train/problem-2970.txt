I found this whole thing super interesting because the YouTube video is a wall of pro President Xi and anti PM Trudeau comments.
Thereâ€™s a second YouTube video entirely with Chinese characters and all the comments translated to English are pro PM Trudeau.
Regardless of what you think about China, this situation will unfortunately undo any good that might have come from Trudeau directly speaking with Xi.
Maybe the "good" that there is to be had is with how Xi and Trudeau could signal to their respective populace.
Maybe Trudeau could ask about how Hu Jintao is doing to throw some shade back. Use the language barrier to slowly morph the discussion into a "Who's on first gag".
Xi gets to show how he's a strongman to a populace facing a burgeoning real estate collapse exacerbated by a demographic shit.
Seems we're talking more about the rebuke than the leak. Either the rebuke was intended to move attention away from the leak, or there was no leak and Xi is fucking around with us to keep us destabilized.
