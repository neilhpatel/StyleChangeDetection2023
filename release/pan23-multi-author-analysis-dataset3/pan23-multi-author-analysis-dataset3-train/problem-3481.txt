After the midterms I just can't see how they slowly start to turn from Trump. Trump was a huge part of why they lost and it's very obvious DeSantis is their future.
Trump's sphere of influence after the midterms is only now seen with far right people and I feel even with them he is split with DeSantis.
The insane seesaw with Trump has always been that he motivates a lot of angry, poor, stupid people- but alienates pretty much all the medium- and high-information independent voters.
They definitely had written him off, but Republicans developed a seething hatred for the guy which was most definitely amplified by Trump. I've always had the impression of "Bush was so bad that he gave us Obama" fueling a lot of that.
Anyone here remember how George W. Bush went from the most patriotic, bright and shining example of modern Republican values until it became clear that his total incompetency lead to the election of a black President? And then suddenly he became a traitorous, shining example of a modern RINO when Trump got the nomination?
And don't even get me started on the longest serving Republican Speaker of the House. It's almost as if they just "forget" how strongly they supported one of their own when it's time for the narrative to shift. When was the last time you heard one of the "SAVE THE CHILDREN" Q folks mention Ol' Diddlin' Denny Hastert?
The true traitors present that day thought they could sneak through the rabble and use them as a distraction. But unfortunately for them the well trained and well armed Neo-Confederates that had been waiting for that moment for generations were stopped from executing Congress and pulling off a full blown coup because they were overwhelmed by "protestors" who figured they could overturn an election with poop stains.
