I had a flair a few years ago, but then I didn't have the time to keep posting frequently (some of my replies from back then: , ). I am now able to devote more time to posting answers to questions, so I'd like to re-apply.
So while not granting flair yet, we definitely would want to see you reapplying soon with a one or two more answers which allow you to really show off. And while obviously real life gets in the way of even the best questions, we wouldn't want to leave you high and dry, !
Approved, although would you be OK with combining it into 'Late Ottoman and Modern Turkish Intellectual History' for better clarity of focus? We'd be happy to list them separately after a flair expansion App, but would want to see some posts that reflect a broader coverage of Intellectual History beyond the Ottoman/Turkish sphere.
I have one book and several academic articles published on the Ottoman Syriac community in the early 20th century which I can link to if required.
I'd like to apply for a flair in the Middle Eastern History category with a specialty in Early 20th-century Ottoman and Syriac history. My academic work was on Syriac journalists during the late Ottoman period; this meant a study of identity, nationalism and their role in a short-lived second constitutional period immediately before WWI.
