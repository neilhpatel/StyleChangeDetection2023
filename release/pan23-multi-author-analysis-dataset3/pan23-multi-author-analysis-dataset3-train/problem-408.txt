Zero covid was a strategy that some nations could use. The trick is that most of the nations that tried it also had backup strategies in order to ramp down once it became untenable. Things like stocking up on treatments and hospital beds while running thorough vaccination programs.
Shit spreads fast when you drop all of the containment measures at the same time in a country that's about to start travelling for the holidays and where natural immunity from previous exposures (which is noted to be more effective than vaccines) is basically nil.
China's vaccination rate is way to low to achieve any kind of herd immunity and if it's a new variant, what protection they do have is pretty much limited to preventing death, not the disease.
Well as far as the rest of the world goes they basically have zero immunity so it's unlikely whatever mutation comes out of china will evade western vaccines.
The only nasty thing that could come from this for people not in China is new variants that are somehow more severe and/or evade our existing immunity too much.
