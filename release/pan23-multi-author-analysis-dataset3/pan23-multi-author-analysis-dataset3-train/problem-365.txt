From personal experience I can safely say that it helps immensely to have a specific subject in mind when reading historical texts and books. It helps you focus on what information is important and what information isn't. What I see a lot of people doing "wrong" is that they try to soak up all the information in a book or a text, without criticizing what is important or not. They want to know everything. While commendable, it makes reading historical texts and books near impossible.
I am mostly speaking as an ancient historian here however, so I am unsure if this approach translates 1:1 to more recent history, but I don't see why not. Should you want advice in where to find specialized literature for ancient history, I can give some pointers.
I indeed read alot of generalized works to "fill in the historical timeline". I also would like some advice on where to find specialized literature for ancient history, since this is my favourite subject.
