Then, I requested the attorney's office for the court's document that says my fine is $300 and got the below reply:
For hiring an attorney, do I simply start googling for my county or is there a website that you can recommend?
Highly recommend you hire an attorney in the county that you received the ticket and let them handle it for you. The attorney may be able to handle everything from a distance for you so you don't have to appear in court.
When the officer issued you a speeding citation he entered essential information on the foreign drivers license/passport into the system along with your speeding ticket.
While I can't 100% guarantee how NY will deal with this I can tell you what I have seen in other states. NY is a party to the Interstate Drivers License Compact so it should be similar.
Essentially this is now your drivers license number in that US state. When you go to get a drivers license in any state that follows the the Interstate Drivers License Compact this control number will be associated with your new drivers license information.
