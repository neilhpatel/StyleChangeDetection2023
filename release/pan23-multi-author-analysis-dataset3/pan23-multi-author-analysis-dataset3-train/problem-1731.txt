Thanks for adding this - based on reading the parent comment, I had assumed that SHAPE's entire existence was a matter of debate or conspiracy.
A quick study of SHAPE's history doesn't leave me entirely clear on what its purview was back in 1961, beyond saying it was the NATO Allied Command. Would it be fair to say that SHAPE was a unified command structure for national militaries, and did not officially have its own forces or intelligence services?
My understanding is that SHAPE is a NATO military formation that exists to oversee and command NATO's operations in Europe (and, since 2003, the rest of the world). Military personnel don't enlist in SHAPE, but are attached to it from their own country's forces, and remain members of them while they work there - so my coach was a British Royal Engineer.
I should say that this is very much not my field, and that I am not an expert in SHAPE, NATO or Cold-War military organisation. The reason I was so confident in vouching for SHAPE's authenticity is that one of my old coaches was attached to them in the 80s and had a photo of himself in their shooting team on his wall!
Just a very quick one - your answer sounds a bit sceptical about 'SHAPE'. 'SHAPE' is \- it definitely exists and is a real military formation, though it's not an agency and doesn't have much to do with UFOs.
The most obvious member is SACEUR (the Supreme Allied Commander Europe) - under his command are a number of headquarters units which, during the Cold War, were the commands that would take charge of NATO forces in the event of war with the USSR. The initial answer made it sound like a shadowy, MI6-like organisation, which is a bit far from the mark. It's a military command that exists to (be ready to) co-ordinate very large amounts of conventional military assets.
