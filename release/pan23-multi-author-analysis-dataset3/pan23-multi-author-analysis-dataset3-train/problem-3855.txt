Since people have decided to get cute with fake verification cards, no, not really. The CDC cards only prove you have a CDC card. Clear verifies through state databases that keep records of actual vaccinations as reported by the provider that administered them.
You aren't required to give it permission. That app has a specific function just to provide COVID vaccine verification.
The only thing they're going to have access to is the vaccine record in electronic form. That's literally all the app is for.
If you're in the US at least, yes. Millions of employees are "forced" to download apps that they employers tells them to download. By "forced" that generally means, you can choose not to but be fired for refusing. What is location? If in the US, is the argument that Clear isn't ADA complaint? What is "MyChart"?
From what I’ve been told by coworkers it requests access to your MyChart. If I give it permission to that then it does indeed totally have access to all of my medical records.
I got vaccinated well before the vaccine was available to the general public because I’m very high risk. My Work has had my vaccination record for nearly 10 months. They’ve had it since before people were faking cards. They’ve even had record of my booster shot since before that was offered to the general public too. I’ve already jumped through all of their hoops. You’re saying that they can endlessly demand more and more access to my medical records.
