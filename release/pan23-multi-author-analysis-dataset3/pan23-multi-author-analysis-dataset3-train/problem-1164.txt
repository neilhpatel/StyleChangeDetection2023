Any agreement with the co-owner of record (sister) is a private matter between the two of you. The County Assessor, Tax Collector and Sheriff could not care less and would lose their jobs if they cut anyone any slack not provided by law. Even though Assessors, Collectors (or Treasurers) and Sheriffs are elected officials they can be jailed for contempt if they refuse to obey the lawful order of a court to uphold the law. Or removed by the Governor. Particulars vary among states.
I'm trying to get the point across that if you, or someone (who else but you), don't pay the property tax and any late fees, penalties, interest, sheriff's fees if things have gone that far, you WILL lose the property in two or three years, whatever the law says.
Let's say that you're unwilling to actually pay the property taxes yourself, as others have correctly suggested.
In case it wasn't clear by the other reply, if she isn't paying the property taxes, you'll probably want to start paying them yourself if you want to keep the house.
