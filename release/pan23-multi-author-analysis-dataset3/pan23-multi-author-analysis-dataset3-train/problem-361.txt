I remember watching that play out live back when I would still watch the news on occasion. I was so depressed at the outcome because I thought that the secularists were actually making a strong move for control of the government. But then it all fizzled out in just a couple of hours. So I’m happy to see this headline and I think the Turkish people have a lot to contribute to the world without the yoke of religious oppression.
Which is wild because any abroad living Turk I’ve met HATES Erdoğan, but these are all young progressive people, so I imagine the support comes from the older traditional crowd.
And its good to add that Erdogan is losing every election when taking only the In Turkey votes, but the diaspora massively votes for him.
82% of around 4 millions turks voting in Europe voted Erdogan despite not living in the country, im always blown away by that fact.
In the same vein, in this post people are talking like Türkiye before Erdoğan was a "EU worthy" country but in reality they wouldn't let us join even without Erdoğan. Yes there are differences between now and then but not as much as people make it out to be.
People talking about PKK like they are some noble freedom fighters and Gulenists like they are the victims is another one. In reality PKK is a terrorist organization and Gulenists are a cult. They were very close with AKP until they had a falling out and also responsible for fucking up this country. And if they had their way we would've been even in a worst state. They are not liked by opposition too.
