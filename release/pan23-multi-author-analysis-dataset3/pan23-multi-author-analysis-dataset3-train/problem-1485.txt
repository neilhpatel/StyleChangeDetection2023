For anyone is the key point. It wasn’t until Andrew Jackson that my white ancestors could consider having any positions or sway in governance, until then it was run by the wealthy families generally of Anglican descent.
Our history is nothing but a constant quest toward our stated value of equality, knowing it’s an ideal and not a practice.
I think it’s more about setting up an equitable system for all and to ensure that everyone’s best interests are in mind. With the history and context of American racism - it is not appropriate to have a court system appointed by white people, in a different socioeconomic class than the majority, represent a majority black and working class populous.
So to be clear you don’t think the centuries of racism allowing the laws to be structured entirely in favor of white people, including changing voting districts to give the white republicans a massive edge, is the “entire reason”, but do think that the majority black population being loud, uninformed, and lazy is a noteworthy issue?
No one is asking for an all black group of people to decide anything, they are saying let the district vote to appoint their own people rather than have a handful of white people decide the fate of a district that's population is predominantly black.
This is literally the only district in the state they are doing this for, removing the ability for the constituents in the district to vote for their own judges and what not, and it just so happens to be the blackest district in the city. This district would have definitely voted in different people. And if you don't realize that white people and black people have different life experiences then you are living in denial.
Ok what the actual fuck? This is the only district in the state they are doing this for. "We need to help stop the black folk from hurting themselves !".
