My kids and I were watching something with cannons attacking a beach. Not sure of the timeframe but think wooden ships, pirates, 21 cannons on the port side, etc. Master and Commander type stuff. When the cannonballs hit the beach, there was an "explosion" with sand and bodies flying. I explained (hopefully correctly) that there wasn't anything explosive in the cannonballs, it was just the force of impact that caused the tumult. Is that correct? When did it begin to change that the thing you shot could go boom upon impact? Was that ever true with cannonballs? Thanks!
Ahh Thankyou so much! I will definitely have a look at google scholar and the articles you suggested.
A good way of answering these questions is to go to google scholar and look up Academic review articles. Reviews of new academic books are one of the major genres of scholarly writing, and these reviews not only to give an evaluation of the work, but often summarize other recent scholarship on the topic, or give a synopsis of the historiography.

Antony mostly talks about the period 1780-1810 but is a good introduction to the general dynamics of piracy in China.
