This is a party without many big ideas. They do like power though and whatever you may think about it, culture war grievance issues have been a remarkably successful strategy for them in the past.
A leading member of this party just proposed disuniting the United States of America. The staff and leadership of a major news network was just revealed to be actively and knowingly lying to its viewers in order advance the interests of this party. The billionaire who just bought a major social media platform is using said platform to create wholly manufactured “controversies” to push this party’s talking points.
Does it improve our educational system, reduce inflation, or strenhen our domestic labor market to have these little wannabe fascists banning drag shows, creating incentive programs to turn in people helping others get safe abortions, criminalize speech they don’t like, or use the power of government to punish companies who speak out against them?
Aren't some states tossing around the idea of using child labor to combat unemployment, instead of raising wages, improving living conditions, and education?
