To answer the legal question, yes. it's perfectly legal for them to do this, as long as OP gets refunded.
This is completely legal. If they didn't want to spend the money to make the repairs, they are not obligated to, regardless of whether or not you've already paid. They (and you) have two options: they can either void the sale and refund your money (which it appears is what they are going with), or you accept the car with all of it's potential problems, understanding that they have disclosed everything and are obligated to pay for none. They are most likely choosing the first option because if they were to sell you a crappy car, then it would look bad on them as well.
1. "Car needed to go through their safety inspection prior to me getting the keys. During the inspection, they found repairs that need to be made. Received a call on 11/29/21 that they weren’t going to pay for the repairs as it’s too expensive and they are voiding the contract. ".
Um. Because the law is the law is the law.... Whatever jurisdiction allows a cooling off period, it must be honored but there are many which don't provide for it. All jurisdictions jn the US allow dealers to cancel contracts for various reasons. Sounds like clearly the co tract had a contingency based on this scenario. Better that the buyer knows now what the issue was.
Otherwise the dealership has usually up to 30 days to refund your down payment, but I would reach out and ask about the timeframe as well as discuss the potential to continue with the purchase under new terms.
How is it that the dealership can cancel the contract at will, but the buyer has no 'cooling off period' in most states?
