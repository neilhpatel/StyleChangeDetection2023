This probably means that they realized that the state of their current nuclear arsenal and infrastructure is not what they thought it was.
This means that they're current nuclear infrastructure is not actual capable of launching nuclear strikes, and Putin's nuclear rhetoric has all been a bluff. NATO must launch a full-scale preemptive strike against Russia as soon as possible to prevent them from developing this nuclear capability.
The only logical help nukes would be if Russia had enough to destroy NATO before NATO has the ability to launch a counter-attack. But of course if it ever appears Russia is getting close to that kind of capability... they would be nuked immediately. (Likewise if Russia thought NATO was getting close to be able to launch a successful first strike, then Russia would be forced to launch).
The way things have gone I think if russia could use nukes on ukraine without risking a full blown nato invasion or nuclear retaliation, yes, absolutely.
Thatâ€™s definitely a consideration. At some point the balance will shift however and it may still be worth the risk, especially if we have an action plan in place to take out/seize all or most of the sites quickly, or otherwise mitigate the risk.
