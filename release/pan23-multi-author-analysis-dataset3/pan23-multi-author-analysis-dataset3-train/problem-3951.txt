Giving the other parent the chance to mess up is absolutely a real thing. Unless there are real indications and reliable outcries of sex abuse. Definitely talk to other attorneys. If others give you the same answer, it may be because the evidence you have is unreliable somehow. You're taking the right steps by talking to your attorney and reporting it.
What does your attorney say? A child making a valid outcry is not something that should ever be ignored. If you don't believe your attorney is helping you protect your child, it may be time to get a new attorney.
I think those are valid concerns, but I'm also not your lawyer. Your lawyer knows the whole case and the context of how this info came out. If you don't trust your attorney, definitely seek more advice.
If you feel your lawyer isn't listening to you, you can always seek new counsel. You could also represent yourself but not recommended. Assuming you have shared custody, I'd also encourage you to put child into therapy yourself; at the very least it helps them, but it also gives a paper trail.
