Me personally? Persia is the eastern edge of "the west", which can of course be divided up into several different areas depending on time period and category.
What you're describing is what would more typically be called the _far East_, as opposed to the _Near East_ (Eastern mediterranean + Mesopotamia) and the _Middle East_ (generally includes Iran and some of Central Asia.
Well, obviously, these are the stories of martyr saints who suffered at the hands of the Sasanians and so they are decidedly negative in character. There are also scraps and mentions of Greek writings in Byzantine sources; generally, these are anti-Zoroastrian polemics. Remarkably popular in Christian sources is the story of Zurvan, a primal flawed creator, said to be the father of both Ahriman and Ohrmazd. This story probably owes something to the Gnostic notion of the flawed demiurge who creates the universe by accident, though the degree to which it was construed as a strawman (versus reflecting some version of Zoroastrian beliefs) remains controversial, and relatedly to conflation with Manichaeism. Manichaeism is a syncretism of Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Buddhism dating to the 3rd century CE; it was once favoured by the Sasanian court, but fell out of favour as the Zoroastrian clergy gained power under the high priest Kerdir.
The thesis of Payne is essentially that despite these negative portrayals, Syrian and Armenian Christians still worked within a culturally Iranian context heavily coloured by Zoroastrian worldview, and they were an integral part of a diverse society (not a mere oppressed minority).
