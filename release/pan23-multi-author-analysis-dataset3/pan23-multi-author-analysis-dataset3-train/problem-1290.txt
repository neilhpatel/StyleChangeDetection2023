I’m not a fan of the advice you have been getting. It is likely just a post office snafu, but under no circumstances should you show up, present an ID, and claim an illegal package.
The legal consequence/possible outcome of buying illegal drugs through the mail is possibly getting arrested at the post office when you go to pick them up. (I personally, not anecdotally or second-handedly, know people this has happened to, but with more mainstream drugs.).
(The real legal advice is probably do not go to the post office, do not admit to anything if police arrive at your door, and obtain a lawyer if they do.).
So you have to decide which is more important to you: getting the drugs or getting arrested. (That said, if there really is some local sting and they really want to arrest you, they can also do it at your house.).
Again, I am NOT a lawyer. I do know that drug busts happen over mailed drugs. But unless you’re in MI and just aren’t saying, I’m not seeing a lot of state-level uproar about tianeptine yet. Unless you were ordering some huge amount? (Don’t answer that.).
