Bakhmut has significant strategic value to Russia's desire to push northwest. There are also many supply lines through Bakhmut that would be necessary for Russia's northwest push.
There are a lot of useful supply lines running through Bakhmut. We cannot discount the significance of Ukraine losing this city in relation to preventing Russia from taking more of Donetsk..
Like or not, Ukraine will eventually lose, that's just the reality no matter how we wish differently. Best case for Ukraine is the loss of the 4 territories occupied by Russia, worst case is Russia manage to assasinate Zelynski.
Best case is russia gets to exterminate or enslave anyone who considers themselves Ukrainian in four territories? Your either a nazi or a vatnik imbecile. Disgusting.
The longer this goes on the more likely they will get more advanced equipment like advanced missiles and aviation among other things.
Thousands of armored vehicles, IFVs, tanks and missiles will eventually be given in the following packages if required.
Itâ€™s not just the tanks, the IFVs are an enormous step up on Russian equipment too making attacking but also defending easier too.
