Im in the forces myself , i have followed the situation in ukraine since feb24th . I am fully aware of the reasons for this attack and what we need to do to support ukraine .
The majority of people in our country are not aware of the reasons ukraine fighting off the russians is so important and understandably would be annoyed at the prospect of giving away money in large sums to other countries instead of funding out nurses .
I'm not against supporting the war in Ukraine, but it's getting harder and harder to see our extremely wealthy leader gives hundreds of Â£millions to a foreign country when average people in the UK are freezing and starving.
For the record I'm not pro-russian or pro-ukrainian, I'm anti-war and I feel like this war could have been avoided if NATO stopped putting Russia in a difficult position.
I don't agree with Russia invading Ukraine but I do believe many of their reasons for doing so can be understood. In the 90's NATO agreed to not expand eastwards, yet over the next two decades they did. Russia even applied to join NATO, but they were denied because NATO needs an "enemy". Imagine Mexico joined a military pact with Russia, do you really think the USA would allow this to happen? The Cuban missile crisis is an example of what happens when a country close to the US mainland befriends Russia. Yet, Russia was just expected to be fine with it.
The war in Ukraine is likely now to go on for decades. Russia, despite what western media has you believe, is not struggling. Countries will continue to buy their natural gas because they have to, they have huge stockpiles of weapons and manpower to continue this war for as long as it takes.
