It is not just gender apartheid that the Iranian regime enacts against its own people, it's also a wider picture of cultural apartheid aimed at erasing all Iranian culture in favour of forced islamism. There is a reason Iranians refer to their own regime as their own ISIS. They have routinely tried to destroy non Islamic heritage sites or ban secular ancient Persian traditions like nowruz and Persian religions like Zoroastrianism just to name a few examples or ban ethnic Persian names in schools.
It's now an ever more complex web, as Iran imports islamist militias to kill people in Iran, while simultaneously exporting personnel and weaponry to kill Russia to kill Ukrainians. If the world didn't care about what Iranian people have been enduring for the past 43 years of this brutal regime, maybe they will finally start to care now that the regime's tyranny has spread as far as Europe.
It’s difficult to change the perception from the outside because every time we see the name Iran it it either their government threatening the west or protesters being shot. Hopefully the Iranian people can change the country so it represents how they actually feel and not just what the elite want.
Please do not make the mistake of believing this islamist regime in any way represents Iranian people.
\[You are trying to bring America down to the level of Iran which is a horrible way to perceive things.\].
Your government killed you by refusing the compromise that led to the Iran/US relations being poisoned in the first place back in what, the 50’s?
