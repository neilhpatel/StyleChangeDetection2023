Members of Congress (house and senate) have to serve at least 5 full years before they are vested for a pension and there are age restrictions based on time they spent as members that determine when the can draw on it.
>"Members of Congress are eligible for a pension at the age of 62 if they have completed at least five years of service. Members are eligible for a pension at age 50 if they have completed 20 years of service, or at any age after completing 25 years of service. The amount of the pension depends on years of service and the average of the highest three years of salary. By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary.".

They’ll always find a way to blame someone else and trust that their voters don’t look into it too hard because they don’t.
Guarantee that the message they are receiving isn’t that 20 (or however many it is) MAGA republicans are holding things up. Seems much more likely the message they are getting is that the democrats refuse to be bipartisan and get a speaker elected so they are holding government hostage.
