Restricting access to a portion of the property is is problematic and could be construed as being a constructive unlawful eviction. Tenants have a right to the possession of all portions of the property named in their lease.
It doesn't matter how "antsy and angry" they may be with you. You are the landlord and you are welcome to instruct them to remove the lock because it is not permitted. You are also welcome to tell them that you may pursue an alternative measure for handling the other tenant and their pet, but that you need to remain in compliance with the laws.
Now when it comes to the 1st floor tenant with the pets and the issue of dog poop, what's the best measure to go about it since I did not have a penalty written in the agreement? You said since it was a breach of the contract, I may ask that they remove the pet but what if they don't want to lose their pet after all this has taken place?
A violation of the pet agreement addendum would generally be grounds for either a full eviction for material breach, or a demand that the pet be removed from the property.
