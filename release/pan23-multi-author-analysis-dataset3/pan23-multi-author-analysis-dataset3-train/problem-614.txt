Every poll showed that the bigger group wants the reform. The smallest one was always the protestors, and it changes between idk and supporting as the bigger group.
First of all - mass protests are one thing, but it doesn't mean they represent the majority in any way.
The protests are estimated to be at best around the 100K people. That's 1% of the citizens in Israel, and 4% of the people who voted in the last elections. By no means do they represent the majority of Israel.
Israeli here. Most recent polls have shown that even if a majority want some sort of reform in the judicial system, the current reform is very unpopular in israeli society, even in ppl that voted for the likud (bibi's party).
Here's a quote from the article you've showed: "But a recent poll by Israel's Channel 12 found that only one in four Israelis supported the judicial reforms". Your article is from yesterday. Which means that he's talking about the latest poll made by channel 12.
So I've sent the latest poll made by channel 12. It's not "attempting" to discredit, it's actual discrediting.
