I'm not insane and well aware of court proceedings. I simply choose to represent myself at this stage and for the Judge to say that I can't is against my rights, I guess I just don't understand how she can tell me no. I will of course appeal it immediately. I will also file a petition for recusal.
I probably will get a Lawyer at some point. What I want is discovery, just to know what I'm up against. It's procedure plain and simple. I don't have to have a law degree to exert my rights.
I don't have to have an electrical engineering degree to rewire my house. But I still have to follow building codes, and it's possible I could electrocute myself.
If you want to be your own lawyer, you have to follow all the rules that lawyers do. If you don't want to follow the rules or if you don't know the rules, then you need a lawyer's help.
You don't have to have a law degree to exert your rights, but you still have to follow the rules. If you don't, you can do the legal equivalent of electrocuting yourself by losing your case in such a way that you can't appeal.
I'm waiting too long if I hire an electrician after I've burned my house down; you're waiting too long to hire an attorney if you wait until after you hear "the court find you guilty".
Discovery is part of the process and involves many procedures. But it's not just something you can request at any point; you have to do it in the right order and at the right time.
