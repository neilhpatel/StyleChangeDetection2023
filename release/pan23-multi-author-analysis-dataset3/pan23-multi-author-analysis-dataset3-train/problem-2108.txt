Insurance agent here most renters policies don't cover things that aren't your personal property renters policies are only in place to cover your personal property in the event of a covered loss so a water heater that doesn't belong to you wouldn't be something that would be covered neither would fixing the ceiling or any other damages.
Some renters insurance policies do have very limited liability insurance, but OP's case wouldn't fall under anything that is covered because she's not liable for the equipment in the first place.
This is not a liability claim though, it's a faulty/worn out appliance that wouldn't be covered under the renters policy. If she had damaged it then sure, she'd be liable.
Their owners insurance covers structural and their appliances. It's on them. Even if you filed a claim, it would be denied.
Your renters insurance only covers your personal property. Basically anything you'll take with you when you leave. If you're not taking it with you, then it's not your responsibility to maintain.
