Keep in mind the second question (which is the important one as any fool can lie to the first), isn't as much about a "right" answer as it is about a "wrong" answer. My favorite two wrong answers are "emotional support" (not a valid task and specifically excluded by the ADA as a service animal), and "you can't ask me that!" (again, anyone with a legit service dog knows you can).
Also, if the dog is acting out (out of control), such as jumping up on staff, that is a valid reason to exclude even a legitimate service dog. If it happens one time, I wouldn't (dogs mess up sometimes, they aren't robots), but if it's happening often, keep in mind you can (although, again, supervisor is safer).
If they decline to answer, you can exclude the dog (although as another poster mentioned, probably better to let your supervisor do it to cover yourself). Anyone with a legitimate service dog is (or reasonably should be) aware of the 2 questions (after all, they are the only two questions you can legally ask), and will be prepared to answer them.
Under the ADA, you get to ask these two questions only: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform?
