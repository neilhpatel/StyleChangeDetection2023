This is kind of funny, because I was actually thinking about this exact issue about the same time you wrote that. And you're right. Unification of the Korean peninsula will require a great deal of support from the international community, because South Korea won't be able to do it by themselves. Food and water supplies need to be addressed, access to medical care, access to what we see as basic services. And that's just the beginning. Outside Pyongyang, much of the country is effectively living in the 19th century at best. It will require a great deal of time, money, and resources to bring them up to a modern standard of living, even if there isn't a war that would leave much of the peninsula in ruins.
I was really just referring to the government. You have to separate the North Korean government and the North Korean people.
Does North Korea even let their citizens leave? How are we supposed to fear someone that would never come fight us? They can only shoot mediocre missiles for so long.
