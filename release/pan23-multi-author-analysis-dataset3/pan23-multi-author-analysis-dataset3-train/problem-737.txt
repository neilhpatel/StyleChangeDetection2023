Actually, it makes sense. Trump's Charles P. Rettig's reign ended last month, and now Douglas O'Donnell has been appointed. A lawyer for tax avoidance firms has been replaced by a career IRS employee.
It's ironic since the GQP already subverted the IRS during the Trump era with the current IRS head, but I guess any form of accountability is too much.
Given that they are looking at my poverty tax bracket ass this hard while letting shit stains like trump get away with shit, I think I'm justified in saying fuck the IRS.
Typical republican: IRS cuts mean theyâ€™ll ignore me and I can shave a couple thousand off my taxes by being sneaky.
While defunding the IRS does help wealthy individuals and corporations increase a crime wave that Republicans are unconcerned about, it also delays refunds to working class guys like me....that Republicans are also unconcerned about.
I discovered a deduction that I did not take for my 2020 Tax Return and I was able to file an amended return, per my accountant. He tried to submit the form electronically and received a message that due to increased activity, no submissions will be accepted until January and I can expect my refund of $1,300 six months from date of filing.
