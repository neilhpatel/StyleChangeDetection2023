Good luck to any middle Eastern country being considered to host a major sporting event in the future. This move will be remembered for a very long time. Liquor sales and sponsorships are a huge part of sporting events. Take that away and Muslim countries will simply not be considered for hosting. If they want to have booze illegal in their country that's fine, but don't pull a bait and switch.
I hope AB InBev and every other sponsor pulls out and sues for breach of contract. Fuck Fifa and Qatar.
Fuck you FIFA. You forced Brazil to sell it in stadiums but hey because it's Qatar, fuck your own rules right. Bunch of money hungry fuckwits ruining the world cup.
Not saying Fifa isn't shit or corrupt. But the problem is Qatar that they chose a country where they have very little recourse or control and just have to play along at this point. They aren't "letting" Qatar do it - they have no power in Qatar.
I didn't say anything about Fifa not being shit in anyway. Just that in this situation the fuckup was putting yourself under the control of an authoritarian regime, not being more respectful of Qatar's requests re: alcohol than Brazil's.
In Brazil Fifa could probably sue the govt for that, fund an opposition party or run ads against the government.
