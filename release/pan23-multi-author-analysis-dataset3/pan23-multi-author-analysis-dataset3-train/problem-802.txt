It does mean the same, and that's what they used to say here too, until they finally got comfortable enough to say what they really meant. That's the real effect that Donald Trump had - giving people permission to openly be their worst selves. His implicit message, which they all understood, was "you don't need to be ashamed of the awful things you think anymore.".
??? Then people can just retire when they're 70 if that's what they want to do, no? Trying to justify changing the policy by saying it's what people want to do anyway is stupid.
This is painfully stupid to even think of as a legislator. But as we should know, stupidity costs everyone including the stupid.
Damn, that must’ve been phrased as “you got your social security, it’s time for the younger generation to earn their living?”.
Unless Boebert and Greene actually hate their elderly constituents (which is a slim, but real possibility), they wouldn’t vote to cut Social Security or Medicare spending. But well, if they do, say goodbye to any chance America prospers in the future again.
And by the way, I foresee republicans raising taxes on the lower and middle classes too, in exchange for the debt ceiling increase. It’s the upper income ladders that get the tax rate cuts under them.
