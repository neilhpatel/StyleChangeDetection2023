“Merry Christmas to EVERYONE, including the Radical Left Marxists that are trying to destroy our Country, the Federal Bureau of Investigation that is illegally coercing & paying Social and LameStream Media to push for a mentally disabled Democrat over the Brilliant, Clairvoyant, and USA LOVING Donald J. Trump,” the former president wrote.

i want to wish everyone a happy holiday, including the America-hating MAGAloids that nearly succeeded in destroying our country, the FBI for steadfastly investigating the former president who stole top-secret docs and tried to overthrow an election ensuring that a mentally stunted Russia-loving Donald Judas Trump cant run for office again, the department of justice for appointing a special prosecutor to investigate our criminally traitorous former president, and who couldn't possibly "hate 'trump' more than any person on earth" because that person is me.
far as i can tell there's at least some portion of the population that hears what trump says and just repeats it ad nauseam.
i mean, he called himself a stable genius and the best president in the history of the country (despite doing nothing but golf and whine) probably figures he might as well keep shooting for the moon.
