Yes. They started to transition to NATO standards after 2014 opened their eyes at how weak and unprepared the Soviet structure made their armed forces. The US military advised them about institutional reforms and NATO trained them to be more mobile and less rigid.
Right. Some people are stuck in the "they are saving their better army" stage. And we've constantly heard it since Russia first invaded. "Just wait until the real army arrives.".
That's not what we're talking about though. A kleptocracy is a distinct political group that extracts money from entire industries, not the populace. This isn't about the Russian people; it's about Russian industry. Wealth inequality in the US is not the same phenomenon as an oligarch saying, "Let me just take a lot off the top.".
Same. The villain in every action movie I watched was Russian or a poor impression of them. To see that they are a paper tiger has been one of the most amazing things to witness unfold in real time.
And yet something always told me they were a paper tiger. Just a nagging suspicion. Maybe for no other reason than I had read Mig Pilot: The Final Escape of Lieutenant Belenko. That book really showed the USSR for what it was: A basket case.
