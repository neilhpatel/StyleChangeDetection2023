That's not strictly true in all medical and recreational marijuana states. But it is in Colorado: the CO Supreme Court's ruling in is still good law and says that Federal illegality of marijuana overrides the "lawful activities" statute in Colorado.
But because cannabis is so popular in Colorado, and because they don't want to be mentioned in the same breath as Dish Network, most Colorado employers don't test for it except in safety-sensitive or Federally regulated (truckers, pilots, etc) jobs.
Probably not. Most employers will clearly describe their pre-employment drug test requirements so folks who won't pass don't waste their time and money.
No, there is no such requirement for a warning of pre-employment or during-employment drug testing.
> Colorado employers may drug test employees, by random drug screening tests or a scheduled testing program. Employers may also drug test prospective workers during pre-employment drug testing, even after making an offer of employment. Employers can fire employees and disqualify job applicants who return positive test results, even for the use of marijuana.
