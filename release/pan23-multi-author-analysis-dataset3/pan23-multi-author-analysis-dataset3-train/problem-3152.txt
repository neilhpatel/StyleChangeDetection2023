How did the USA come to have the kind of influence that you speak of in India, Australia and Japan. Second Q: what was the nature of american influence in india etc.
Great answer. Though i think that communism in in India is not relevant to communism in all the places where America intervened. You hit the right note equating communism with independence. During the cold war, the US was intervened by stopping independence from the USA in countries where the USA had influence. This was to prevent more important countries to get ideas about independence. India is not relevant to that.
India is perhaps the most interesting part of this. Jawaharlal Nehru was in some ways influenced (in economic and planning terms) by Soviet models, but was less keen on Soviet ideology. India found itself in something of a tug-o-war between the USA and USSR over the decades. It was the largest and most populous of the non-aligned nations, and both sought to bring India closer to their camp. But in foreign relations terms, India's most pressing concerns were Pakistan and China. These two nations - over time - developed friendly relations (despite Pakistan being a US ally), something that New Delhi saw as a threat.
OK, that's the basics laid out for everyone and anyone who is interested! So back to the question: was it just propaganda or was there actually something behind the 'domino theory' It's crucial to consider some immediate, short and medium-term context for all of this.
