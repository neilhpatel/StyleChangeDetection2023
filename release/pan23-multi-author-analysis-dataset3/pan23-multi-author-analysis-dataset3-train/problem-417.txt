Given the decapitated head was mounted on a church, is this a suggested source for the name of the architectural features? I had always believed they got their name from the Old French word for 'throat' - gargouille.
As you noted, the word gargoyle comes French and even older Latin roots. In all likelihood, the name was simply one of convenience. The beastly faces were a design choice to cover for a practical purpose, so the name "throat" arose from the observation that the runoff water was going through the beast's throat.
But essentially, when we say ‘gargoyle’, we’re talking about any building facet that is spouted. This is because (to answer your first question), gargoyles serve a practical purpose in Gothic and pre-Gothic architecture, which is to convey water off of the roofs of buildings.
So while gargoyles have seen (and might yet still see) some revivals in neo-Classical and neo-Gothic architecture, they’re simply not the most practical solution for the problem they were meant to solve anymore.
