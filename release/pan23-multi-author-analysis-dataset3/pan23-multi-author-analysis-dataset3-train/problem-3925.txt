That's not true unless you're already in the lease with your partner's stepfather as guarantor and if you're not you might consider backing off and getting into a different arrangement. If you're already in the lease there's no benefit to you to sign this later agreement.
Has your guarantor already signed the lease ? Have you and your partner ? If so, that obligation from him may be set in stone and he cannot retract it (at least, not until the lease ends).
In general, this is called an "indemnification agreement". You are explicitly agreeing to pay him back for money he has to pay as a result of guaranteeing your lease with your landlord.
And it would be uncontroversial if he was asking only for the rent he would be obligated to pay as a result of his guarantor role.
A demand that you pay "all" costs to support your partner and their child (is it your child ?) that your partner's step-parent expects to incur if you leave the relationship is less straightforward. Does the proposed contract specify rent, food, medical costs, educational costs, etc ? Or just basically "if you stop taking care of these dependent people, you will indemnify me for doing so" ? And for how long ?
If you're committed to being legally obligated to provide regardless of your partner's ability to contribute to the household, marry them and adopt their child.
