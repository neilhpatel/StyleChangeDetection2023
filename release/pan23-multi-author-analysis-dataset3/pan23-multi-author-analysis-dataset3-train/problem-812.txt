Seconded. Iâ€™m an attorney in an adjacent field. With all of the protections tenants have right now, especially in King County, this landlord could be facing some serious shit.
Typical first-glance appearances in these situations is a shady landlord is trying to coerce you to leave with threat of legal action. Until it becomes ACTUAL legal action, you can (but shouldn't) ignore it. IANAL so I am uncertain if threatening additional financial charges to someone who doesn't share first languages counts as extortion, racial harassment, etc. You might want to give a quick call to an immigrant harassment legal hotline for your state/location to see what sort of help you can find.
However: If yours is very large, like the landlord was hiding things in the "Legalese", there is software that "converts to digital" scanned or photographed text. (It's called 'OCR'.) You can scan your entire document, then search for relevant terms to make it super easy to find.
Most leases are pretty standard (called 'boilerplate') and cover 'typical' agreements. Yours should have a section clearly denoted for 'early termination of contract'.
