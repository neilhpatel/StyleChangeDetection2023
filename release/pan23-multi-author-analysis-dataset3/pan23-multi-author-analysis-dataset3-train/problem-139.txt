Hi, I used to work for the FDA as well. You can find a blank copy of the beneficiary form below. It was my understanding that there are many options one can choose when it comes to designating the beneficiary and it is possible that your sister selected an option that allows for the child to be the beneficiary under certain conditions.
I am not sure that it is being done correctly. The root of the issue appears to be whether on not the person had the SF-3102 on file to designate beneficiaries separate from the accepted "Order of Precedence".
The instructions on the back of SF3102 state " It does not affect the right of any person who is eligible for survivor annuity benefits." So if your sister had a child who is eligible for an ongoing annuity then there would be no lump sum to distribute. I don't know how OPM pays an annuity to a child - it probably would go to the kids legal guardian or other legal caretaker but you should discuss this with OPM (or the child's caretaker should discuss this).
