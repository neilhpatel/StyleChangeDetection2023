How do you know they changed the lease? Do you have a copy of your current lease? When is your current lease up?
My lease will be up Feb 28. They have a clause that I have to give a 2 months notice and I canâ€™t break my lease between Nov-Feb so I feel stuck here until it ends.
If you have a lease for a specific term, like a year or six months or whatever, they cannot unilaterally change the terms of that contract without your consent. If the lease isn't yet expired and they're trying to do this, you should be able to hold them to the terms as-written.
Your protection would come in the form of a defense to an attempt to evict you for not complying with the new terms. You'd show up to court with a copy of the original lease and show the court that you are in compliance with its terms, and (presumably) you'd win and the eviction would be denied.
At the end of the analysis, though, if you live in a place with a very competitive rental market (IDK how Nashville is), it's always good to avoid even having a landlord attempt to evict you. In the SF Bay Area in California, just being the defendant in an eviction case and winning is enough to make landlords not rent to you. TN is probably not quite that bad, but it's still a consideration.
