Ok thank you. I have been calling the court and they tell me to call back on Tuesday to see if I qualify for a court appointed lawyer. Im just getting worried because i dont wanna go back to jail or even worse prison, let alone 2 years or any time for that matter. Besides this, never been in legal trouble before. So there is a chance it can be knocked down from a felony??
Edit: basically, is the only way i would face any form of further incarceration would be from violating bond terms?
I just want to know, why would they potentially take me back to jail or prison if i was already released on PR bond?? Basically im asking if there is a possibility im facing more serious time than a few days.
You are absolutely facing more serious time than a couple of days. As the other poster explained, felonies have long reaching consequences both in Texas and federally. Further advice on the disposition of your case is going to be something you need to discuss with your attorney and is heavily fact dependent. You absolutely need an attorney to navigate a felony case. You should not discuss it further here as it can waive privilege - the ability of your attorney to keep all conversations between you and them private - and police detectives WILL try to track down social media accounts if necessary.
