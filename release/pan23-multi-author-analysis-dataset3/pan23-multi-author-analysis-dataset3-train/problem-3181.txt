In the paper that he gave us, giving us 15 day notice he did not state why we were terminated. When i questioned him in person, he said he did not have to give us a reason.
So yes, he does have to give you a reason. There are other rules to which notice must conform, so please read that chapter.
You need the lease because it shows that you didn't refuse to enter into a written lease. Because entering into a written lease is a requirement for the both of you and you've been living there for 3 years, he'll have a hard time claiming a written lease doesn't exist. He might not comply with your request for a copy of the lease, but you'll be able to show that you asked for one and he unlawfully refused.
...so if you demand a copy of your lease and he claims there isn't one, that's a problem for him. This is important because you can actually only have your tenancy terminated for very specific reasons, one of which being refusing to enter into a written lease. So first thing in the morning request a copy of your lease in writing, you can hand deliver this request, but also send the request via certified mail and keep a copy of the letter and the receipt.
