I’m pretty sure that’s not how it works. There needs to be proof that he did it, not that he cannot prove he did not do it.
Other than the fact that he was there do you have any other form of proof? Did someone see him with the cat?
Might be impossible to prove without surveillance because there’s no way to prove nobody else was in your apartment at the time, while a maintenance person was there it doesn’t mean nobody else came in or he left the door open.
Not really legal advice but in this scenario he could easily claim it wasn’t him and it was someone who entered after him because he didn’t property lock the door. Since the burden of proof in a criminal Matter is beyond a reasonable doubt, it can be enough to instill doubt.
I wanted to point out that the burden of proof for a conviction is "beyond a reasonable doubt." With the information you provided, you have a he/she said - he/she said situation. His word is no stronger than yours. So, we look at evidence. Did the employee have scratches on him? Did the cat have any skin/blood on the nails? I don't know if you checked but that could be evidence to help beyond the scene you documented. At the end of the day, circumstantial things don't get a conviction alone.
