My academic path was strikingly similar to yours. I earned my Master's, originally intending to go on for a PhD and teach (Religious Studies, in my case) at the college level. Life intervened, and with a young family another move across the country and several more years of school just wasn't in the cards. After a fellowship and another Master's to get a teaching license, now I teach high school, a career I had originally considered and rejected all the way back when I was an undergrad. So I definitely get where you are coming from. I happen to (mostly) like teaching high school, but I'm not sure that's it's my forever job, either.
I'm an undergrad, but my parents my parents work in academia and I am doing my field experience to become a high school teacher, so I understand your question.
You sound pretty unhappy--do you think that is purely due to your lack of PhD? You might find that a therapist could help you to parse out your thoughts and figure out what exactly would make you feel happy and fulfilled.
My first suggestion is to look into museum work--it's also pretty competitive, but you might find that it's more intellectually rewarding to you than teaching.
