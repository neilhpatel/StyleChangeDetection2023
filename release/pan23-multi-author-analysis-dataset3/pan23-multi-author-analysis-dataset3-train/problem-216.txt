Risk adds up. If I decide I'm okay with a certain amount of potential exposure to Covid, and I prefer to allocate that risk to fun and fulfilling stuff, it doesn't mean I'm wrong or disingenuous when I refuse to spend that risk on work stuff.
It's silly to think of Covid risk as, "aha, you took a risk in this one scenario; you're a hypocrite if you don't take the same risk in this other scenario the very next day.".
for where I first heard this. The specific part about efficacy is at 1:54. And the source they site is Lancet.
Edit: Actually it's the 1 and 2 doses with the difference in preventing serious infection or death. Only the 2dose+Booster is equal effectiveness to the west's vaccines.
And their vaccine was crap apparently. Something like 60% effective against original strain and delta. And probably less people actually taking the vaccine.
Is their proof that asymptomatic people can still spread it to fully vaccinated people? I thought it was a fairly low probability even back when people were unvaccinated.
