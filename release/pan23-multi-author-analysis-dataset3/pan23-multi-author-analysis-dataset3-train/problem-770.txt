I think you misunderstood the officer. As you probably assumed, going 3 miles over the speed limit is still speeding. From what I can see from Washinon State law, it looks like the lowest bracket is "1-5mph over the speed limit", which looks like it carries a $93 fine.
Definitely not, assuming that I was correct above that the fine is only $93. If it's a really expensive ticket with a lot of points on your license you may want to reconsider?
Just a few last tips - just be super respectful in court, as you probably already know. You could offer to do driving school, but that seems like a stretch. Alternatively community service, etc. You basically want the judge to understand that a monetary fine would be unfair as to you specifically, even though you were caught driving over the speed limit. Even at 5mph.
If you go to a judge and say "I was 3 over the limit," you are basically pleading guilty. What you might want to do if you are trying to get out of the ticket / get it decreased is to ask the judge for some leniency based on your own personal situation (have you lost a job due to covid? Lots of bills to pay? Have you received speeding tickets in the past? etc) and demonstrate that in the officer's report, you're only accused of being a few miles over the speed limit. However, some states charge court fees, so even if the judge cuts your ticket in half, for example, you might end up paying more at the end after court fees.
The attorney fees would cost more than the ticket/deferral and are unlikely to get any better results.
