There are several exchange student programs both in High School and College you can apply for, but as far as I know they would all require someone to financially sponsor you (whether an individual or a organization) unless you can secure a scholarship as a source of funding.
There are certainly private scholarships that are available, and there are a number of exchange programs that cover the costs for the students participating in the programs. Often foreign governments will sponsor their citizens to attend schools in the US and can lobby for a J visa, which contains a requirement that the person has to return to their home country for at least two years before being eligible for any further US immigration benefit. This cuts down on the foreign government paying for someone to go to the US, only for them to get a green card and stay in the US, promoting a brain drain of that country's brightest minds.
Generally, it's the reverse. Not only do they not offer scholarships to international students, but they also force international students to pay tuition to attend even public high schools (since their parents do not reside in the district and pay the property taxes which support the schools). Colleges are the same; international students pay full price to subsidize the cost for other students (with maybe a token scholarship for International students to deduct from the high cost).
Yeah, i've looked into many news outlets and they all said that International students had to pay the Maximum amount of Fees, because they're considered to be out-state student.
I've also tried applying in Student Exchange programs but nearly all of didn't let 9th graders into the programs.
