Many progressives, led ny Bernie Sanders, have been advocating and pushing for everyone to receive 'free' health care. It would save the government, corporations, the economy as you point out. And individuals would save thousands every year by eliminating the insurance industry which serves only as a middle-man to scoff up billions and billions...bleeding people to death.
So we should continue the "Healthcare for profit" system just because people in the past didn't have free healthcare and had to orient their lives around the inhumane for profit system?
Just to clarify, the healthcare shouldn't be classified as "free" but paid for by tax dollars instead of the current backwards system where private for profit companies have inserted themselves into the process along with employers.
Ah, yes, who could forget Bernie's calls for incremental "Single Payer Lite" that doesn't achieve universal healthcare, doesn't cover all medical services, and requires 20% co-pays.
It probably would, in the long run. None of the projections say it would save a lot or cost a lot more. But it would be super disruptive. It's super weird that M4A advocates are so intent on making it cheaper that they turn away options that would make the transistion easy.
