Russia is choosing to destroy Ukrainian Infrastructure. Russia is choosing to send human waves into the meat grinder. Why is the obligation on Ukraine to surrender but not on Russia to stop their invasion?
There is not one 3rd party organization that says Ukraine was shelling civilians. That's Russian propaganda to justify their murder of civilians. If Russia is justified in their invasion then Ukraine is justified in fighting back when Russia uses the Neo-Nazi Wagner Group, and is targeting civilians in Bucha Massacre and the Mariupol theatre bombing.
The Minsk agreements were doomed to fail from the start. They were broken by both sides almost immediately after they were signed. They did not include Russia who had troops on the ground.
Russia started this war, nobody else. Russia can end this war at any moment by simply leaving Ukraine. If you believe anything else you have been fooled. Any Russian soldier who fires a gun in Ukraine deserves to die. Russia as a nation falling apart is just a bonus but it's beautiful to watch them destroy their own country and economy.
Your last paragraph will clear up sooner(end of war) than all the scheme of West to destroy Russia and feast on the riches. Is childish now to talk geopolitics, after all the attempts every century to destroy Russia, learn something, Russia is in the blood veins of this earth, it affects us all, we can't stab our own body, it's a sin, a mistake, only paranoids and sick greedy entities do this, don't be a part at least.
