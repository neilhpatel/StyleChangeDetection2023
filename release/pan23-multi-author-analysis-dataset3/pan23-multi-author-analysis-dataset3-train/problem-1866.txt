$191 million in stock buybacks since 2011. 30% reduction in workforce. 75% cut to safety inspection times. Yup.
That is true. Such as when a bank or investment company makes $Billions$ via illegal activities (money laundering or insider trading for example), get caught & convicted, then pay millions...well that's simply the cost of doing business. Someone has to got to jail and the fines have to be more than amount illegally earned.
President Harry S. Truman frequently used the phrase "the buck stops here." That is the whole point of this proposal, to stop buck passing, which would go through some fine tuning of course. It is a very simple fact that somebody MUST directly accept responsibility for actions and consequences. If you do not agree, quit; these are highly educated, professional corporate executives involved. OH, and I do believe in strong unions, but there are no one-size-fits-all answers to complicated problems.
Instead, the way better solution: free your unions. Truly free unions are to left wing parties, what capitalists are to right wing parties. They are also a counterbalance to capitalist in the government and the economy.
LoL, Americans are so obsessed with finding the culprits and with punishments. This idea would never work. As the rich and powerful are extremely capable in "keeping their hands clean". All this bill would do is create new jobs: professional scapegoats.
One of the few countries where it actually works: Iceland! And that's because of their super high unionization rate, 91%.
We've already got tons of laws against crimes by the super rich and their corporations.... but it never really works: you're asking corporate pawns to write and enforce laws against their masters...
Without them, there's nobody left to force the government into enforcing the laws also against the rich and powerful...
