Any new variants will need to have one of those two or some combination of them, otherwise it would simply fail to outcompete existing variants.
So titles like "most transmissible yet" are a bit inaccurate, because it implies that the new variant is more transmissible than the previous, while in reality a large part of the competitive edge is due to evading preexisting immunity. If all the "most transmissible yet" claims were due to each variant actually being more transmissible, then the current version would be the most contagious virus we've ever known by some margin. And while covid-19 is very contagious, it's not that.
There's also a pretty nasty non-COVID virus going around that has this as its main symptom. (I caught it too! Couldn't swallow my own spit.) If you're COVID-negative it's reasonable to guess that that's what you caught.
Yeah I did the same, and oddly enough I just tested positive for Covid yesterday. I have no doubt that my symptoms would be much worse had I not gotten the vax and boosters, but I’m still kind of surprised it’s been as bad as it has.
Not sure if it was the vaccine/booster from over a year ago or the strain but this bout wasn't too bad.
