IIRC Stalin was fixated on the UK as a threat. He saw Hitler as an enemy of his enemy, and was not the kind of person to easily accept that he was in error.
Well Stalin did try to buddy up with Hitler until Hitler attack him and he ran to the allies for help... so Stalin was always kind of part Hitler and Putin is too.
Why any sane Russian wants to venerate Stalin is like asking any of the Jewish faith to venerate Hitler.
Stalin was such a loser it's funny they are so desperate they still worship him. In all reality he just made a bunch of idiotic choices and ran the country into the ground... like most of their leaders.
Yeah, but those deaths are mostly because they didn't prepare and sent people in without gear to die by the masses... because they thought Nazi Germany was their friend and they would split up some of the eastern European land. USSR and Germany were more like allies when the war started. Russia helped Germany develop some of it's initial weapons and copied some of their advances in the process. It was only later when Germany turned on Russia that Russia joined the allies .. for their own self preservation and that's about all.
At the end of the day... Russia is under immense strain due to the war and the world's reaction to it. Putin is trying to evoke strong nationalism to convince people the sacrifices are worth it and to stave off social strife.
For those who are curious about why this is and if Putin is trying to bring back Stalinism across the board, the answer is a bit complicated.
Except that in real life Stalin tried to make a deal with Hitler for parts of eastern Europe. Hitler instead turned on Russia and Russia ran to the allies and US Lend Lease. Russia was ready to give Hitler a free pass as long as they got some land out of the deal.
