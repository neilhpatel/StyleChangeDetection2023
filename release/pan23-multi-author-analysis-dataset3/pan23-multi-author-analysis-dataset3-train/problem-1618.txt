The UN and “international law” is rigged, has been since it was created. It exists solely to preserve the countries that sit on the permanent security council.
Russia is bad for invading Ukraine, and they are getting their well deserved outing as a puppet military force that is hardly the threat they were imagined to be, or maybe once were.
I sympathize with Ukraine for being invaded by a shitty dictator & getting bombarded with weapons from our shitty dictatorship. By the same token, when a shitty dictator invaded us and the world armed him… I don’t think many people would have agreed those arms factories should be liquidated.
From my perspective, unless attacks are done covertly - bombing these sites is likely going to undermine our goal of having human rights in Iran. And probably pull a few other countries in the region into direct conflict with the blowback.
The only thing stopping them is they don't want a domino effect leading us into a world war, as countries pile on joining one side or thebother for their own gain.
Yeah the difference is the consequences. The US could turn Iran's military infrastructure to glass over this, with little criticism and probably no direct military consequences. If Russia tried that with a NATO country it wouldn't go the same.
I don’t think Russia could afford to strike NATO because of the fallout, but ofc they could and we would get closer to WW3. Maybe they would try to intercept shipments or damage transportation infrastructure for NATO supply lines like rail etc.
