If you do pursue it in small claims court, make sure you bring as much information as you can, including a very thorough estimate. The estimate often changes and the price goes up once the shop takes the car apart, exposing further damages. Ideally, you would have the vehicle repaired on your own so you can ask for the full amount. At the very least ask for a partial tear down to check for additional damages. If your sue for your first estimate of $2500 and win, you will be awarded $2500. You can’t then come back and ask for more if the repairs end up costing $3500.
Attorneys don’t want your claim because they typically take a percentage. Auto damage only is often small, and if they take a third you couldn’t get your car fixed.
The driver damaged your car, and it is the driver that would owe you the money for that damage if you win. His insurance company will cover HIM for the amount of that damage, per the policy.
If you have full coverage insurance, then you can also file a claim with your insurance and just sue for your deductible.
The insurance doesn't owe you any money- they didn't cause you any damage, and you don't have any contract or agreement with them.
But that's between him and his insurance company. He owes you, they may or may not be responsible to pay that based on his agreement with them.
