When someone cosigns a loan, they are on the hook for the debt, regardless of what happens between the cosigners. That's why the lender agreed to the loan even though they wouldn't approve it on your credit history alone.
If a cosigner could successfully sue to be removed from the debt obligation, having a cosigner wouldn't mean anything and wouldn't affect loan decisions.
In general, a loan guarantor / "co-signer" cannot simply unilaterally decide they want to be relieved of their contract obligations to the lender just because of their antipathy or disagreement with the other borrower. Your intimate personal relationship is not a factor or element in the auto loan unless it's an asset being divided in a divorce.
Was the car marital property that was the subject of a division of assets order from a divorce/family court ?
What is the amount of money still owed on the auto loan ? How many months was the loan, and how many remain ?
Did you make a promise, verbal or written, to refinance the auto loan to relieve them of their obligation ?
