Honestly, I haven't seen that movie in a long time, so I can't comment on that. It's widely appreciated as being truer to the history here in Scotland, but whether that translates to actually being accurate is another matter.
In the end they simply built the Hadrian Wall to prevent raids. An attempt was made with the Antonine Wall to push further north, but it failed.
I'm steadily trying to amass a fantasy fiction story based on Mesoamerican cultures. I'm aiming to read as much as I can, particularly from native and contemporary sources, in order to do it as much justice as I can. What I've read so far has been fascinating.
Glad it was interesting! I can add a selection on the Aztecs/Nahua of central Mexico for colonial times, focus of my research.

- The Native Conquistador by Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, edited by Amber Brian et al. Translated very recently with comprehensive introduction. It's an action packed account of the siege of Tenochtitlan focusing less on Cortés and mostly on one of his main Acolhua allies called Ixtlilxochitl. Written by one of his descendants who is one of our main sources on the Acolhua (part of the Triple Alliance), so he strongly takes their side. Students usually enjoyed reading this when I brought it to class; the whole book "Historia chichimeca" was translated recently.
