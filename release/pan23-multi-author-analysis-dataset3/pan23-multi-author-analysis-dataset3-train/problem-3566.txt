Iâ€™m an armchair general like most of us, but that is a pretty bold commitment to a very specific and expensive type of ground warfare doctrine.
What I mean though, is if Russia mostly just has janky tanks (and arguably tons less after this Ukraine adventure).
A stronger tankforce in poland could also worry russia, getting them to keep more tanks in reserve, which helps Ukraine by taking off some pressure.
As a fellow armchair general, I have a feeling modem NATO tanks would handle that better then the old Soviet tanks in Ukraine are. Probably better then the modern Russian tanks as well.
Enough janky tanks can still overwhelm. You need solid numbers to counter, even if your tanks are much better, they aren't indestructible.
If Russia is attacking Poland, then they'll be going all out. In their attack on Ukraine Russia still feels that they still need to keep up defences against NATO, and even china, And so isn't sending most of their tanks.
Some are canceling the order, but for those that didn't, Russia isn't delivering because they are diverting these export weapons to the front in Ukraine.
