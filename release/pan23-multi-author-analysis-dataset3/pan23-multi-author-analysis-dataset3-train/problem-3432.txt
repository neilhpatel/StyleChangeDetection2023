Biggest surprise, to me, was that Biggs voted for this. Edit: biggest aside from about half of the Rs voting for it. I didn't expect that to happen.
The Senate has already passed this, and it is waiting to be signed by President Biden (edit: or, it's going to committee between the House and Senate.).
Well. Article one section nine of the us constitution band ex post facto laws. That means Congress canâ€™t pass laws about what has already happened, only laws going forward.
My understanding of that clause is Congress can't pass a law that punishes someone for breaking that law before it was passed, e.g. if they pass a law making a thing illegal, that can't law can't punish anyone for doing that thing prior to its enactment.
>The Constitution of the United States forbids Congress and the states to pass any ex post facto law. In 1798 it was determined that this prohibition applies only to criminal laws and is not a general restriction on retroactive legislation.
They stay in jail. They broke the law. They go to jail. That is the end of it even if it becomes legal to do what they did tomorrow.
You are talking about the ex post facto restriction in the constitution. That only applies to criminal law (and not even always then). This is civil law which is not bound by that.
