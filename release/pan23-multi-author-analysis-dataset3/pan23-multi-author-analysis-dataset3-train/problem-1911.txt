And to be fair, everything is up to date on my car, I just havenâ€™t received the sticker from renewing my registration yet, I was told it was towed solely based off the sticker.
And to /u/cheddarwalrus's follow up-comment, it doesn't matter if the car registration is up-to-date either, it matters whether the current sticker is on the car. /u/throw040913 makes a good point, but I suspect the effort would be high and the chances of success will be low -- this is simply the way HOAs are, and it's exactly why so many of us drive an extra 10 minutes or pay an extra $50k to stay out of them.
The towing company is doing exactly what your HOA contracted with them to do. They roam tow -- 45 seconds, 45 minutes, 45 hours, it doesn't matter. The HOA is of course not going to claim responsibility, but they are the ones that have the contract with the tow company -- if you were on fully private property (i.e., no HOA) then that tow company couldn't yoink your car. It is because the HOA has the power and asked the tow company to roam tow that the tow company is able to do this.
Lots of HOAs (and apartment complexes, for that matter) have rules like this and a roam towing contract in place to enforce those rules. From the tow company's perspective, you see a car with an expired tag (or has a flat tire, or a busted out window, or, or, or...), you tow it. Neither the tow company nor the HOA are looking at calendars and clocks while twirling moustaches -- the tow company is simply towing cars it has the legal right to tow. There's no "grace period" ("ah shucks Bawhby, this here tag's only been expired since yester-night, we'ze gunna have to give them til' overmorrow so's they's have a chance to get er dun").
