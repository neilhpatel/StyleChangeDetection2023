Follow-up question: I thought the Seminoles were partly formed from runaway slaves and thus would be a bit averse to owning slaves. Quick Wikipedia search showed that they did but had a lot more freedom relative to those owned by white people. How did slaves owned by the Seminoles act around free blacks who were part of the tribe, if documented? If they met slaves owned by white people, how did they act around them?
You note that the Five Civilized Tribes adopted "American style slavery". Was the concept of slavery completely alien to them precontact or had it already existed in some fashion?
Did Native Americans have ( any form of ) slavery before the Europeans arrived - or was it a concept they learned of from Europeans ? Was there any difficulty in getting Native American tribes to free their slaves when slavery was abolished in America ?
Is there a correlation between which Native societies made better refuges for slaves and how those societies were already organized? At least many people in those "Five Civilized Tribes" would have been descended from the pre-Columbian Mississippian civilizations (e.g. Cahokia), so they might have taken social hierarchy and maybe enslavement for granted. Could less stratified Native societies have responded differently to African-American slaves than those of Mississippian heritage?
