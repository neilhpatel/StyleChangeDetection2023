I would contact the judge that signed the eviction order. He may order a contempt charge or another eviction.
File a motion in the eviction case to have the eviction order properly served. And make sure her property is out of your house, on the sidewalk if necessary, when she is served with the eviction order.
If the sheriff evicted her originally, they should have put her property ( whatever she did not take with her) on the street. Sounds like law enforcement has messed up a lot.
Get the police to remove her since they screwed this up. Keep going up the chain of command as high as you can. You may need to physically go to the police department. Contact your city administrator and/or city council representative to also file a complaint since the police officer screwed this up.
File a complaint against the police officer to start with, they were there to ensure both parties behaved themselves and failed in that duty. You may be able to sue them in small claims for the damages you've suffered as a result.
