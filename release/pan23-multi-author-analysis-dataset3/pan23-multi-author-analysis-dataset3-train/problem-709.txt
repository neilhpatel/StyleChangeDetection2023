- This idea of a "Long Middle Ages" presumes that...there was something before the Middle Ages. Presumably in Antiquity. My question would be why is this being treated as something qualitatively different. That is - Roman society in, say AD 100 was also extremely agrarian, so why would that be something "different", but ordinary life for a European peasant from 500 to 1700 or so is the "same". This also is where specifically calling it the "Long Middle Ages" seems to have some sort of pejorative intent, identifying the Medieval period with unchanging stagnation (which it most certainly was not).
When the long Middle Ages periodisation hasn’t gained so much traction - I’ve never seen it used in a history book for the general public - I believe it is linked to two points.
All that is to say, we won't be seeing people suddenly start describing the Middle Ages as 476-1789, but that doesn't mean that historians who look at certain things across traditional period boundaries are wrong either. Indeed, they provide an incredibly important corrective, reminding us of the continuity between time periods that we slice up for our own convenience. If we didn't have people doing that work, our lines in the temporal sand would hide more than they revealed.
So I wrote about this many months ago (u/stormtemplar to keep automod off my back), and while nothing I said in it is wrong per se, I do want to add some additional material that comes from more than a year and a half of professional development.
