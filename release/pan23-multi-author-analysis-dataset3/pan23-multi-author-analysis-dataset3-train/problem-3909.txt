So consider what is going to happen with her kids, although it sounds like you will have them while she does her jail time.
Should the courts/government pursue the case, it would almost certainly end up with her in jail, which also very likely means she would lose custody of the kids. Depending on wider circumstances, this could result in the father getting them or them getting put in foster care. As a grandparent, if they are put into foster care, you could petition the court to put them under your care.
I will say that it is extremely odd that they would let\ her move out of state while on bond - bond only occurs until the main trial. Are you sure she isn't on parole or probation instead? Not that it changes a whole lot in the grand scheme of things.
\ "Let" here means not count it as bail jumping, issuing an arrest warrant and starting extradition process.
Does she have a probation officer? If so, they would be the best person to contact. Otherwise, you could try the police non-emergency line or calling the court directly.
