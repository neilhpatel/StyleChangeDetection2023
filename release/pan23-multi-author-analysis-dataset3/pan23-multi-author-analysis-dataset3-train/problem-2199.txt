Biden has gotten so much done and lots more bi-partisan legislation than anyone on the right or left expected.
What fight? Republicans again, would have jumped at the chance to send America into a depression with this shutdown to destroy Biden. You and I both know it and you must admit that. Biden left them with a deal they agreed they'd hammer out from then on. They then failed to close on it towards the end of the deadline. Biden avoided doing damage to all of America by avoiding a strike. Sometimes doing the least harm is the only choice you have as a leader.
He gets this done despite being flamed by nearly all the right. Democrat moderates who think he goes too far and progressives who don't think he goes far enough.
More over left voters always tend to undersell achievements. Everything is never a win, it's just not close enough. This is a failure strategy as it doesnt motivate people or cultivate more votes.
Until that happens everything you're going on about is pure fantasy likely so you can support fascists.
