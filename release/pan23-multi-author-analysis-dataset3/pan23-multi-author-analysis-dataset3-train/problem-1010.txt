Your manager's boss notwithstanding, you were actually fired. He broke the owner's rules to do so, but you had no reason to know that, and it doesn't change anything for you. The owner is apparently offering you your job back, and you can take it if you like, but you don't have to.
Why do you think your unemployment won't be approved? Being fired for being stoned on the job is a good reason to be denied unemployment in most places, but has your unemployment decision actually come back?
But, you can't sue just because someone fired you for a reason that isn't accurate, or because someone fired you when he wasn't supposed to.
You don't have a case for wrongful termination because the manager went over his authority when he fired you. If this boss person wants to rehire you, she can do that.
If you were stoned at work and your employer can prove it you will likely be disqualified even if that wasn't the reason given at the time. But if that didn't happen you should absolutely be adamant you were not on drugs at work. Either way, always appeal.
