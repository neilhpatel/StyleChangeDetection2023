Some of the conservative justices may of been wavering on their support. It could of been a calculated leak by another justice to stop them from changing their position. If they were to change their position after the leak it would look like they were caving into the pressure from progressives, which would be a very bad look for them considering they were put on the court for the sole purpose of championing conservative causes.
4 is the only possibility I can possibly believe, but as I said before, justices do _not_ want to have the appearance that public outrage / pressure can change their legal opinions. If the supreme court changed their ruling after the leak due to public pressure, then it would open the floodgates because they'd be proving that they will bow to public pressure. The only sensible move (and the move they took) was to stick by the draft ruling.
Someone in favour of abortion rights has _no_ interest in leaking the opinion, I guarantee to you that the leak is on the anti-abortion side.
In other words, they donâ€™t actually give a shit about abortion, and are using it to advance their own self interests while hurting the average voter.
