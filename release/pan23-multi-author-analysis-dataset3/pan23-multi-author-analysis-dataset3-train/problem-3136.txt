The US is the world's first and only hyperpower. Not even the Roman Empire or British Empire at their heights had military bases all over the world, military alliances in every region of the world, and enough technological and economic dominance to tilt the table heavily against every single adversary they might be faced with even without either of those significant advantages.
China is a superpower. The British Empire or the USSR at their heights were superpowers. The US, for whatever reason, has invested so much of its almost-endless resources into military supremacy that it's turned into something else.
It doesn't mean we're omnipotent, because that doesn't exist in military reality. But, it's not fair to criticize China or the EU because they can "only" operate as a superpower in the present day geopolitics.
I would also call the EU a superpower, although you can debate whether or not to consider the EU its own entity.
China is either on the verge or actually is a superpower now. Similar economy size as the US and lots of influence in almost every country from purchasing infrastructure/companies. They can practically bring the world to it's knees by stopping exports(as covid showed), although it would be economic MAD. They have also heavily colonized Africa, and or working on expanding their military and cultural influence there.
