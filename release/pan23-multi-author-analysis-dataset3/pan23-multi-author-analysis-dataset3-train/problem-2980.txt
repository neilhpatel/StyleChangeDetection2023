This. There are states that have required breaks after working x amount of hours in a row and not clocking out for those breaks can lead to termination.
In many states, the labor dept requires a lunch break for every employee after they work a set number of hours. (Example, in Georgia, if you work 6 hours, you are required to take a lunch break, but it does not have to be a full hour. Less than 6 hours you can work without a lunch break.) Your employer has to be able to prove in their records that they made sure you got your required breaks. There have been numerous class action suits because employers required employees to work through lunch. Deducting an hour is them covering their legal ass. You could be putting them at legal risk by working straight through. Your best bet clock in and out for 15 or 30 min Lunch. Most employers will be cool with that if the state is cool with it. Your HR could tell you what your hours required to take a lunch.
I would talk to HR/Supervisor about your schedule. If you're hired to work 6 hours a day and have been clocked in for that amount of time and actually working without a break - and they are ok with you working say 8-2 without a break - it could be an honest mistake in the programming off the new time system.
It's not uncommon for there to be issues in a new system as it rolls out. They may not even realize that you've been shorted hours worked.
If they want you to take a break going forward, ask for a 30 minute lunch break and adjust your hours to 8-2:30.
Also, what they are doing for lunch breaks is not allowed. If they know you are working for lunch they cannot do this. But they also are not required to let you skip lunch, which exposes them to liability, “because it is an easier schedule for” you.
