Could be very low level, like he's in charge of 5 guys and a machine gun. Doesn't specify if it's the rank commander or just meant in the sense of leader. He could be commander of the squad that digs toilet holes.
Well from the standard of living it is, but you're not free. Though you get to leave the prison in the day if you're a low level criminal and behave like a good boy. We have that here too. And it works great because if you don't show up then you're in deep shit and loose all your benefits and get the sentence extended so less than 0.1% even try and absolutely all of them are caught within a day or maybe three at most. Of course he probably wouldn't qualify for leave.
Ah right sorry, I just skimmed it. So pretty low level but not the lowest. Might have some interesting intel. Probably nothing earth shattering. But maybe he's got the orders. If those specify war crimes then that's worth snagging up this guy.
Umm he has evidence of war crimes and is clearly willing to testify. That’s very useful information .
Then fled to Norway to request asylum as his country was committing mass war crimes and is willing to produce evidence.
Russian is known to assassinate guys like him in foreign countries. Being the first guy to produce evidence of war crimes is a brave thing to do seeing as no one else is doing it.
He’s not brave- he’s a war criminal. He’s not admirable, he’s a worm preserving his meaningless existence. Once he’s provided all the evidence he has, he should do the only decent thing.
