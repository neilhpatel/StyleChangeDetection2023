As a Canadian who is ABC, and will never own a gun, even I agree that the hare-brained gun control bill the Liberals trot out like clockwork every election cycle or so, is a complete waste of time. They make something that seems good to undecided voters in urban centres (whose votes they need), that doesn't actually do much in favor of gun control, and yet massively inconveniences tons of law-abiding rural Canadians (whose votes they would never be able to get).
guns are a fickle thing when it comes to government utilization, and I don't want to get into the native canadian population's relationship with their government.
With 22% of Canadian households storing registered firearms I have to feel that the issue of further restricting firearms ownership to be unreasonably divisive. Apparently our firearms owners have gotten pretty good at not losing or murdering other Canadians with their firearms and we are failing to recognize their good behaviour.
If people respected what guns can do, if they revered 2A as much as 2B, then every gun purchase would matter and people buying frivolously would set off social alarms. People wouldn't bandy guns about to look cool or see them as ersatz dicks. (Well, okay, that last one might not be exactly true, but it would be significantly less.).
