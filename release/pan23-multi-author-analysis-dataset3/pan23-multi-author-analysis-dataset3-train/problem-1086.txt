Edit: as someone who doesn’t know much I think China could become pretty powerful. They almost have the same GDP as the US. If they invested the same portion of GDP into the military as the US does I’m guessing could rival the US. You also need to consider that Chinese cost of living is much lower so every billion that goes into their military I’m guessing goes a good bit farther.
But I think China mostly wants to increase the quality of life build and guide/control their society. Most of their imperialistic interest have seemed to come in the form of belt and road and gaining more control over territories that are half in half out of China.
Yeah Pakistan is another million troops and I’m sure China would supply them. Just looking at the militaries and there is zero shot india wins that war without being hard carried by the west. And China has a lot of power over the west.
That’s been one of the opportunities China can gain from this conflict. If Russia loses, it becomes a Chinese vassal and its sphere of influence it has over Central Asia wanes. Central Asia will inevitably fall to the Chinese economic magnet and interests. If Russia somehow pulls this off, the war could divide China’s European adversaries over energy and other issues.
Lol China, the country that's been propping up Russias dying industry and economy since the west cut Russia off. At this rate Russia will just be a vassal state to China, and/or its lapdog if it gets any more dependant on China.
If Russia does manage to continue or increase its trade with China, you can bet it won't be Russia calling the shots.
