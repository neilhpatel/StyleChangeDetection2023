Firing him for this would be illegal, yes, but employers always skirt around this when they fire you by giving another reason, theyâ€™ll never outright say it was because they were discussing their wage.
Also, I would really caution you against mentioning to them that it's illegal to fire you for discussing wages before they make a final decision. For one thing, they may calm the hell down on their own. Being retained because they decide they don't want to lose you is a lot better than being retained because they're worried about a lawsuit. If they're keeping you due to a threat, they may back down temporarily and then fire you later after building documentation against you. Much harder case if they fire you in 6 months after a terrible performance review. For another, they're sure not going to produce anything in writing mentioning the wage discussion if you tell them.
EDIT: regarding documentation, do your printing/screenshotting of things at home if you can. Most people have some kind of email access at home these days thanks to covid. You don't really want to get caught preparing for litigation, especially when they may decide to keep you. Also, grab a copy of the employee handbook if you have one readily available, if there's a "policy" about not discussing wages in there that would be good evidence.
2. The firing document will, oddly enough, not mention you are being fired for discussing wages. It may list no reason, it may list something like "insubordination," "poor performance," or "attendance issues.".
if they could fire you they would have. document any disciplinary action they take against you in future, including termination, even if they say it's for a different reason. make sure all your documentation is backed up off site and that you can access it at a moments notice. it's illegal to retaliate against you for this under the national labor relations act but they do it all the time.
