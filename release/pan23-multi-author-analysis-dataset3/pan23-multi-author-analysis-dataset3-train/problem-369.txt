The transcript opens with Carroll's testimony. Trump's testimony starts on page 15 of 48 (numbered page 125). A few examples:
Trump: Now, like everyone else, she gets paid by a radical, left-leaning publisher to say bad and untrue things.".
This is who he is. He's irreversibly broken, and deeply pathologically disturbed. It is horrifying that he ever got within a million miles of any elected office, never mind the fact he served in that office for a four agonizing years.
If you want clear, obviously, and absolutely gut-busting hillarious proof of the fact that Donald Trump cannot stop lying even when its catastrophic for him to do so, my favorite example.
That's the thing that blows my mind about Donald Trump - much of his behavior is, LITERALLY, indefensible. He does and says so much for which there are no good explanations, only less-bad ones.
It doesn't excuse the lies, and it's not a good thing, but having a decent theory about when he'll lie and when he'll tell the truth is still useful.
