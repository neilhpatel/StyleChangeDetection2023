Well that’s why. You didn’t guarantee the lease with business assets, you guaranteed it with personal assets. Your partner is only taking over your business assets, not your personal assets, so this doesn’t give him any increased ability to guarantee the loan on his own from the landlord’s perspective.
Your best bet is to condition the sale of your business assets on your partner agreeing to terminate the lease. He may need to find another location to do business from if the landlord won’t let him start a second lease on his own.
It is a tricky spot to be in to give up control of the business but still be a guarantor of a lease for the business. May want to reevaluate the decision to give up control or speak to a lawyer about other options to protect yourself.
Offer to pay a large security deposit. The norm is typically equal to one months rent. If you can offer to give a security deposit of 4-12 months.
Offer to set up a letter of credit (LOC) with your bank. If you don't pay rent then the landlord can take rent payments from there.
