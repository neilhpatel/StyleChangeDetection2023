Imagine a drunk driver whose drunken swerves cause an accident that kills another driver. That driver can be charged with manslaughter— he never wanted, or intended, anyone’s death. So he had no guilty mind in that sense. But he still voluntarily drank intoxicating liquors and then drove. That recklessness is the “guilty mind,” that’s necessary.
When someone commits a criminal act, they usually have to also have a “guilty mind.” But the guilty mind doesn’t necessarily mean an intent to inflict the harm that results.
Here, we have something similar. Delusions about pursuit by phantasmal kidnappers that justify breaking windshields to draw attention are simply unreasonable . . . and if the delusion arises from voluntary intoxication, that’s no defense.
Secondly, you might have two separate defenses based on the state of mind, specifically insanity and intoxication. Since he was taken to a mental hospital after his arrest this could help in a defense of insanity, arguing that your BF was acting unreasonably due to a mental illness. Voluntary intoxication is usually only considered a valid defense in specific intent crimes. Specific intent crimes are those that require the accused to have had specific intent to commit a crime and break the law, like burglary, forgery, and robbery. Vandalism is not a specific intent crime.
