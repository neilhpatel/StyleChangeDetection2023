Not only can attorneys fees likely not be awarded here, but it doesnâ€™t sound like this is a valid cause of action.
Your effort to sue for this is likely frivolous and if there's a provision enabling it you're likely to pay their attorney for the work of dismissing your frivolous suit.
Title: [US-MD] Reclaiming lawyer's fees if the civil suit arose because of a previous frivolous legal action?
If the previous suit was litigated and the defendant lost because they didn't defend it, it wasn't a frivolous suit. When you don't put up a defense, everything the plaintiff alleges is deemed to be true.
How would my suit be considered frivolous if the evidence could not have been produced until after the fact? If the then plaintiff/now defendant is diagnosed with a mental illness after the fact with instances of that mental illness playing itself out well before the suit it changes the context of the previous case in the first place. It's not as if I did not suffer injuries both related and unrelated to the case and would not be able to prove them so long as the official diagnosis is obtained. Am I being unclear or is there something I'm not understanding?
