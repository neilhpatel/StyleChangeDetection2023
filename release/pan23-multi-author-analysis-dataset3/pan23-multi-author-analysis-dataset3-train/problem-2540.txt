Banned if you know the location of every safety zone and where hunting is banned and don't shoot there is a huge difference from actually banned, with official PA game commission signage prohibiting it. If a hunter thinks they have a right to fire while they are within an unposted safety zone, as this guy did, they will. And if they will, then it should be made known that it is not legal, period. Knowing where all of the unposted safety zones are shouldn't be left up to the due diligence of a hunter who is already half a foot of water away from being on private property, in an area where there is a new safety zone every couple hundred yards, because they will hear 'there's a 50 foot patch where it's not a safety zone' and go for it. And while my neighbors can permit it, it's on the hunter to know if it is permitted or not by asking permission to hunt and I don't see any hunters knocking on the doors of the 20 or so houses in this township alone where the creek flows through their safety zone.
Your neighbors are allowed to permit hunting in their safety zone, but only where it doesn’t infringe on your safety zone.
If the river is in a safety zone, then it’s already effectively banned. It’s just a matter of patrolling and enforcement. Post signage and call the wardens when a hunter is on the river.
