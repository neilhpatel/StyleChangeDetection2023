Maybe all these missile strikes have never been intented to be against civilians but are aimed at places NATO is going to be at and Russia is simply getting a head start in the fighting!
In a war with the US and NATO on one side and Russia on the other, the only thing Russia could do to avoid one-sided annihilation is shoot nuclear missiles. That of course won't prevent Russia's annihilation, it will just make sure it isn't only Russia.
Seems to me that most of the Russian populace buy anything Putin offers for purchase. But the presence of even one NATO troop would be all Russia would be talking and shouting about.
I think NATO should address this government statement very simply, “Is Russia saying they are at war with NATO?” Loud, public… Don’t let them get away with this basic disinformation. Call up the Russian Ambassador to the UN and make him say wether or not Russia is at war with NATO.
Somebody from the Russian foreign office is gonna have to distance themselves from that statement, lest it be taken as a declaration of war and NATO does commit forces.
By which I mean Patrushev will likely end up committing 'suicide' via Russian bullet to the back of the skull soon.
