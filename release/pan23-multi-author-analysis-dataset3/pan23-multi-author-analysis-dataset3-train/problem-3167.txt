What have Republicans actually won in California? No statewide elections since 2006. Only a handful of Congressional/state legislature seats in already conservative areas like the Central Valley and Orange County/San Diego suburbs.
The flipside: Corporations no longer wanting their HQ in California like and , for lower-tax states like Texas.
What do you say to people who say "red states like Texas and Florida had minimal COVID restrictions and turned out fine while states like California had all this learning loss from closing the schools"?

This one's easy. I'd say, "The dead aren't able to complain are they?". California had 245 deaths per 100k. Florida had 387. As bad as the pandemic was, it was 60% worse in Florida. That's about 31,000 people who didn't have to die. This is using Florida's self-reported statistics, which were shown to be low balling things. Texas was in the middle with 316.
