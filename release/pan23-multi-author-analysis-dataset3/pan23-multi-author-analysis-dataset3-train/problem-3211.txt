For me, it's conservatives ruining Congress for everyone else. The only reason they're holding on to their razor margin is because non-conservatives didn't show up as often as they do (which is every election, every time).
Non-conservatives don't show up to vote because they don't have non-conservative options to vote for. The two most common reasons given for why people don't vote is that "No matter who wins, nothing will change for people like me" and "I didn't like any of the candidates". As long as our only choices are the conservative side of liberalism or the progressive side of liberalism, anyone that doesn't adhere to liberalism as a political ideology will be alienated.
Um, can you give an example of a policy that is neither conservative, nor conservative side of liberalism, nor progressive side of liberalism? I'm not sure I understand where you think the gap actually is.
Maybe like .2 years or so, when they had a supermajority (barely) and were busy getting the ACA passed?
And that's assuming 100% of them and the independents that aligned with them would have supported it -- if only 1 dissented, then it doesn't matter that the other 59 did support it. So not really fair to say the parties are the same when the vast majority of Democrats generally support the good thing, and the majority of Republicans support the bad thing. It's just hard to pass stuff because of the filibuster. All Republicans need to do is block stuff.
