Incidentally, I visited Paris in May 2022 and seeing all the Ukrainian flags everywhere made me emotional. Slava Ukrani, Glorie Ã  l'Ukraine, et la Russie peut manger de la merde.
It would be a shame if all the athletes from Russia and Belarus we're denied visas upon trying to enter France.
Just blanket ban Russian/Belarussian tourists from entering your country so none of their athletes can attend.
One could argue that an outright ban is the best way to hold Russia accountable while also keep athletes and their families safe from Russian threats to the athletes' families.
Russian athletes are regularly used as propaganda tools for Putin's regime, so it makes sense to ban them. Also, you keep pasting the word "sanctimonious" around as some kind of one-size-fits-all universal incantation of moral affront, whereas your statement is actually the only accurate example of sanctimony here. Which is hilarious.
Sorry but your rethoric is beyond the level of nonsense I care to spend any more time discussing. Cheers.
