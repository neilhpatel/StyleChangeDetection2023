To put it simply, the reason Portugal did not invoke Article 5 of the NATO Treaty (the article about collective defense) is because it could not, :
Therefore, the NATO alliance could not be invoked by Portugal, because Goa is outside of the scope of the NATO treaty.
However, all of that is in the future from the point of view of 1961. It is anachronistic to suggest that NATO should have been concerned about a USSR-India alliance in 1961 when that was a decade in the future.
Yes, India purchased arms from USSR, and sought ties to counter US-Pakistan ties in the 1950s. Yes, Nehru instituted socialist domestic economic policies. However, India was also a founding member of the Non Aligned Movement and publicly espoused friendly neutrality towards US, USSR and China (until late 1950s).
The fact is, India had loudly proclaimed it's foreign policy as one of non-alignment in the great power competition between the US and USSR throughout the 1950s.
By 1961, the US and India had fairly strong relations, and US and USSR were competing with each other to provide developmental aid to India.
So, in 1961, India had consistently followed a policy of non-alignment and the United States was aware of this. The United States and NATO powers generally did not consider India to be anti-Western or pro Soviet in 1961.
And I must disagree with your statement that "India was always _perceived_ to be aligned with the Soviet Union.".
