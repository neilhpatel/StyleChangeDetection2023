DOJ would have needed to have some hard proof that Trump continues to hold onto more documents. Which, if they did, you’d think they would go and get a warrant rather than pursue contempt. Either they don’t have sufficient evidence (perhaps they know there are documents, but not where, for example), or they do hold cards and this hearing was a gambit to get Trump’s team on the record saying otherwise before law enforcement goes and gets them.
2. They’d still need to have an idea where it is. They didn’t even get a blanket search of MAL with an informant and possibly video.
So you want a DOJ lawyer to walk into court and basically say that some classified records that left during Trump’s presidency were never returned. They can’t say for certain whether Trump himself or someone else in the administration (let’s say for sake of argument Mike Pence) has possession of them, much less where specifically they might be found if searched. But nonetheless, since Trump kept other classified documents illegally at Mar-a-Lago, they’d like a warrant to toss every inch of his 6 residences and any owned or rented facilities - some of which may be owned by other people or entities - just in case.
If there’s potentially classified documents out there, and they’ve lied about that multiple times, now none of his lawyers want to go on record saying there’s no more documents, how is that not probable cause for a warrant for all of his properties?
People are missing out that those files are Top Secret Documents that no one, not even attorneys are allowed to even see and he just orders another commercial firm to find these documents? This alone is WTF! He is basically spreading the documents willingly, that alone is a crime. Never attribute to incompetence when it was deliberate malice. Trump is a traitor and a Russian asset. Point. He should be charged with espionage and for selling state secrets.
