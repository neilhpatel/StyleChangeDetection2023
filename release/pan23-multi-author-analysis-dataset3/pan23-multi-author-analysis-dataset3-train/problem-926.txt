Realistically, a direct artillery hit or an anti tank mine. Lots of M1s that were in Iraqi use were destroyed by ISIS, so the tank isn't completely indestructible. However, it's leaps and bounds better than anything the Russians field. Ukrainian tankers are also very competent, so they'll put them to good use.
If the Russians aim to take over every town in Ukraine the way they did with Soledar, that's great news for Ukranians.
Honestly I’ve never really heard anyone try and make out that Ukraine is dominating. Yea we hear more of Ukrainian victories than we do if Russian ones, but this is Russia’s first real win since summer at the latest. Ukraine had victory after victory throughout most of autumn. But we know Ukraine is struggling, hence the reason why so many people have been pushing for tanks for Ukraine so much harder for the last few weeks.
No, from what I’ve heard soledar was quite important as it made defending bahkmut easier (by keeping a strategic offensive position from Russia).
Bahkmut is a strategically important town since it can be used as a transportation hub for the Russian army, making supplying offensives deeper into Ukraine easier for Russia. Russia can’t move deeper into Ukraine in that general region without those two towns.
It seems the Vatniks were very salty that the Ukrainians for almost one year couldn't be evicted from a small town and a small city in Soledar and Bakhmut.
