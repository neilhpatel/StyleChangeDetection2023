Influenza has the ability to share gene segments between different strains. This is called Antigenic Shift. The danger here is that the more this H5N1 strain spreads, the greater the chance it goes through an antigenic shift that drastically alters it, potentially for the worst. All it could take is for the wrong bird to infect the wrong pig, where one of the pigs cells already infected with a different strain of influenza and is also simultaneously infected with the avian H5N1 strain. What could emerge from that cell could be a virus that makes COVID-19 feel like a mild case of allergies. The good news is that we've seen outbreaks of H5N1 in the wild before without it mutating into the strain we all fear. Chances are this outbreak will be no different, but give the virus enough opportunities to spread and it can eventually turn into the nightmare pandemic we fear.
Supply issues and rising prices are just everyday things now, people probably just assumed it was something related to that and not a massive bird flu pandemic.
As you've said, Covid was a surprise, but Influenza is what we've prepared for and it has high potential to cause massive deaths. The scale and severity of the bird epidemic illustrates that.
I agree. This is missing from the article - why are we culling the birds? To prevent spread - not just among bird but importantly to humans.
There's also a wild pheasant who hangs out, and my folks are wondering if they should keep the chickens penned up for their own safety.
