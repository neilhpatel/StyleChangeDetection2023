Once the transfere is done, and the russian cargo is now mixed with the original cargo of the mother ship, the owners of the cargo can request the chamber of commerce (a relevant CoC authority, it cannot be a CoC from the UK when the ship is sitting in the territorial water of let's say Spain, it has to be a Spanish CoC). The CoC the issues a certificate of origin as Spanish origin...
Vitol, BP, Glencore, Trafigura, Shell all the majors are buying up russian oil and oil products like nothing ever happened, with a discount of about 30 bucks a ton on ULSD.
As someone who had been in the oil industry for over a decade, I can tell you it's the most corrupt industry, only second to the vessel owners.
Its the biggest source of corruption and nepotism in the region (see Petrobras, Pemex, Ecopetrol,etc...).
The difference is nationalizing it leads to corruption of nations and bad nation states. The government isn't holding oil accountable if the government owns oil...this is real life where there's actual bad people.
