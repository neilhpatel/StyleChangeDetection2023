This is the problem Democrats have on their hands. We practically know that what Biden did doesn't rise to criminal, but he quite possibly did something firable (assuming it was him directly and not an aide), just like Comey felt like Hillary Clinton did. It then becomes all too tempting for the Democrats to hide behind "nothing illegal" and turn that into "nothingburger". However, independents will see a fireable offense as a problem that needs acknowledgement, fixing, and maybe even a punishment such as stepping down. If that is not done, then the Democrats run the risk of voters doing the punishing for Biden by not voting for him when they would have before this.
Now if they catch Biden on tape, badgering, extorting, and begging for 11,800 fake votes in a blatant attack on democracy. . . . . .
Hell yes. He absolutely fucking should. His fuckup with retaining classified materials is wots gonna let Trump skate. He absolutely should not run for re-election — I’m not voting for his ass. I voted for him cos it was a vote against Trump.
I can and will still vote for the Democratic candidates down ballot. I just won’t tick the Presidential one.
