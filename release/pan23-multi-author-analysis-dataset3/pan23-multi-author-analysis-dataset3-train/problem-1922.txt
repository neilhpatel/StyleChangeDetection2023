Dump is preparing to set up a new party if he doesn't get the GQP nomination. He should probably name it something other than the nazi party, even though it will probably have the same platform.
The subject is Nick Fuentes, a Nazi Sympathizer. It shouldn’t shift to a comment that indicates Trump has treated Israel favorably. There’s no way the two should be in the same conversation, unless you’re insinuating that Israel are the new Nazis.
You can do whatever you want, and you won’t go to jail for antisemitism. But if a Jew tells you your comment was insensitive and mildly antisemitic, just take their word for it.
In order for it to be antisemitism I have to accuse a group of Jewish people of doing something negative. They didn’t proclaim Jerusalem the capital of Israel, Trump did. An act which if I was an Israeli I would applaud. So is making the observation that Israelis (of all ethnicities) applaud Trump for HIS action antisemitism? Is so, is Trumps action of proclaiming Jerusalem the capital of Israel sympathetic to Nazis? Lastly, who cares about any of this gossip?
