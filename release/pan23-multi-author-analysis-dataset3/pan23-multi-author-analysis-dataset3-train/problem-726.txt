I'm a PA. I've done several Locum positions. I've never backed out of a contract that I signed. But, I think it would also depend on why you're backing out? What is because there was some catastrophic problem? (God forbid) Like your health?
Your immediate family's health? Etc. I'm not saying that would do it, but some people are more understanding and considerate when things like that happen. And some aren't, when it comes to the almighty dollar. But don't lie just to get out of the contract. Still recommend getting a contract lawyer.
With the amount of money on the line, I would recommend a consult with an attorney versed in contract law.
Personally, I would highlight "This penalty will be deducted from the employees next scheduled compensation payment." and tell them to take the fee out of your next scheduled paycheck.
The agency pays the temp their pay check. The temp is an employee of the staffing agency, not the company.
Staffing agency bills the client the bill rate ( pay rate + mark up) according to the hours on the time sheet the temp fills out and submits to the agency.
Not a lawyer but a recruiter. I don’t think it’s enforceable. Curious where your contract is located (state)? Most employment legal issues side with the employee as long as you’re not terminated for cause.
At face value, it seems like the recruiter doesn’t want to miss out on her commission and trying to twist your arm with scare tactics. I know there is a big mark up with nurses right now.
