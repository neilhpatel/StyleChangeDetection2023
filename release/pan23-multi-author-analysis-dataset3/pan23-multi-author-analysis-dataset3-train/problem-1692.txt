People like Erdogan/Orb치n still has to make it look like the elections are legit. They are, but they are absolutly unfair. These regimes do cheat but in more insidious ways, mostly by trying to brainwash most of their population with rampant propaganda, fearmongering and by cutting them off from proper education, especially language knowledge so they would be only able to consume the news that their regime feeding to them.
Same thing happened in Hungary last April. One of Orb치n lies was, if the opposition wins, they immidietly send our men to fight in Ukraine and according to polls, even 1/3 of the opposition voters belived that lie. Other lie was, the opposition will force children in kindergardens to change sex... and 3 million people voted for Orb치n, 2 million stayed at home, so de facto they are fine with the regime and that happened just after Orb치n let Covid kill 0,5% of the total population in less then 15 months and letting Hungary become the 3rd highest death rate country in the world per capita.
That way, with time, you simple reach a point when you don't need to blatantly cheat on elections, you will have a lot of people who will only believe you, no matter how crazy you are.
The system makes it difficult to cheat, yes, but it certainly does not prevent it from happening - and evidence of fake ballots and dumped ballots appeared in the last election.
While I agree in that large scale voting fraud is difficult, it is still possible to cheat large enough to manupilate the results. In the last election I was in Sincan/Ankara as an objective observer with an NGO and there were several things that stood out:
Especially the first point seemed significant during the vote tally, as out of the 200 something votes cast in that room more than 20 had been cast for AKP and then ripped to pieces by whoever cast the vote. That's 10%.
