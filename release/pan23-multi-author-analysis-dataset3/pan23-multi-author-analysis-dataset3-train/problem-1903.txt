Yes, this was a well known phenomenon and was correctly understood as caused by the spherical shape of the earth, and the seasonal variation as caused by the angle between the earth's equator and the plane of the ecliptic. The most to-the-point discussion in ancient sources is in Cleomedes' On the heavens, ch. 1.4: he was writing later than Caesar, but his work is based on material going back to long before Caesar's time.
Anyway, the earth's shape was a perfectly well known interpretation of variable daylight hours at different latitudes. It can be clearly seen in, for example, Pliny the Elder's account of latitude measurements for various cities. The earth's shape was well known enough that it gets referred to in poetry, like in the opening paragraph of Ovid's epic poem the Metamorphoses.
That was the rather chaotic picture of things before Oenopides came along and whoever else was involved in the discovery of the earth's shape. After 400 BCE it's relatively rare to find evidence of flat-earthers in the Mediterranean world. The Epicureans did cling on to a cosmos arranged in layers, which implies a flat earth. Some Christian biblical literalists in Syria in the 4th-5th centuries CE insisted on a flat earth. But other than that, it's round-earthers all the way to the horizon.
Out of curiosity, why would the ship over the horizon effect not be part of the discovery of a round earth?
