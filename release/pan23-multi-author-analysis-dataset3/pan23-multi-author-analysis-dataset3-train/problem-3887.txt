Obviously COVID's death count is much higher than H5N1's count so far, but H5N1 doesn't seem to be able to transmit from human to human yet. Pretty much everyone that's gotten it either works closely with birds or ate an infected one. The numbers will go through the roof if it mutates to transmit between humans, and that's the nightmare scenario people are worried about.
This thing is insanely bad news if it's ever able to transmit between humans, and it'll be bad enough with people thinking it'll be like COVID. The last thing we need is people spreading the idea that it'll be less severe, or worse, comparing it to swine flu, which is even less deadly than the seasonal flu.
We saw literally all of these things in the recent pandemic in what i'll call mild doses. Imagine what we might be in for next...
Breaking it down to a simplistic percentage (which i know doesn't account for a lot of factors), h1n1 seems to have been something between 1-4% previously, whereas covid was roughly 5%.
Maybe H5N1 isn't as severe as 50% fatality rate, but even at 10% fatality rate, it will still be an order of magnitude more severe than COVID.
It's impossible to know, I think - there have been less than 1K human cases of any strain of H5N1 in the past 25 years, and less than 10 cases of the new strain since 2020. Many of these cases were in less-developed countries which have less access to and/or lower quality of healthcare, and potentially poor nutrition or other diseases or situations that contribute to mortality. Further, we have no way to know how any mutations that might arise as part of a hypothetical jump for human to human transmission might change things.
