I have heard personal anecdotes from relatives who lived in Italy at the time. My uncles had to flee to the mountains and hide to prevent being conscripted as the war against the Allies was very unpopular in the Southern farming areas.
Japan is still to this day something like 98% homogenous and they were united in their deification of an emperor for a thousand years.
I definitely think Italy’s cultural independence up to that point also played a role in its lack of enthusiasm for Mussolini’s war.
Secondly, Italy itself was absolutely not enthusiastic to start a war in the 1940s in the first place, with the perception being that Italy was instead dragged into the war by Germany's hubris. One eloquent example: Mussolini and his government even directly warned Hitler, on the days immediately after the signing of the Pact of Steel in 1939, that in the event of a conflict Italy wouldn't have been fighting-ready until 2 or 3 years, hoping that peace would have been mantained until then.
Another two factors that come to my mind are that Italy, unlike Germany and Japan, worked during its wartime period to rid or distance themselves of Fascism, or at least of its topmost leaders, something which cannot be said to have been widely attempted in the other two countries aside from small cadres or private failed coups. This too, in collective consciousness, helped toward an "atonement" of guilt for Fascism.
