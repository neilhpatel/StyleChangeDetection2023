Thanks for that, I’ve done that before where I paid less than half and they deleted the debt. Unfortunately with my background I’m pretty well versed with collections and such. Don’t do drugs kids. But you do have a point there I’ll try and call them to settle if I can’t find free representation.
Well it’s a 90% cash business that only I know the amounts of so while I understand what your saying, there’s no way that I can see that they can prove any specific dollar amount other than what I tell them.
I believe it was a process server and it’s a court document not just a letter threatening to sue. I have 21 days from the day I got the letter to file my response with the specific court, I believe it’s a civil court.
Is it an actual petition, filed with the court, and instructing you to file your response with a specific court? Or is it a letter they sent you, saying they are suing? We’re you served by a Sherrice or process server?
So type up a response - make it look like theirs does, except yours is a Response instead of petition.
Say you have no record of such a debt ( if that is true - do you have paperwork for it.). Say this is the first contact from them about such a debt. Say you request verification that the debt is your, and that it has not already been paid. Say you need more time to research their claims.
