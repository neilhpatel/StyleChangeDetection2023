i live in a complex. he and his wife live across town. i’m fairly certain he’s just using my restroom, because i haven’t noticed anything missing as far as food… etc. i think i’m going to get a motion camera that will send me notifications.
Ring camera is easy to install and it will notify you of motion and sound outside your door. If the door is opened, the chime will go off and you'll know someone is inside. There are many cordless indoor cameras that are also inexpensive and can be easily installed and I would place one in your living room, bathroom, bedroom. You want to see where he's going, what he's doing, what he's using. You can skip installing the ring doorbell if you want to catch him inside and have proof. Once he sees the ring doorbell he will either leave or will make believe he's there for maintenance. Check your lease, it should say they have to give you 24 hour notice unless it's an emergency. Video cameras are a must and will make you feel safer. Also, Ring had a home security system that is super easy to install and you can arm it when you are inside, when you go to sleep or when you're leaving your house. Do not give them your code. They can call you and you can arm and disarm from your phone before they enter your apartment.
I'm not endorsing ring in any way just ideas as to what you can do. We have a security system, cameras and video doorbell.
TL;DR - use video surveillance to see what is happening in your apartment while you are gone before deciding what to do.
If he is there preforming maintenance then that is a different story and just borderline unacceptable that he is using your restroom.
If he is coming in and cranking down your a/c and hanging out in there watching tv, using your internet, using your toilet paper, your water, or eating your food and it could have a real cost for you.
