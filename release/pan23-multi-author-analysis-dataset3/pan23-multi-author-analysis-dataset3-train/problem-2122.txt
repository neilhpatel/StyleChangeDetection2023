Funny. In Idaho right now its freezing and has snowed about 4 ft in the last month. Most snow Ive ever seen here and seems like its been abnormally cold all winter long. It seems like there is a jet stream thats moving the cold arctic air more south. Im sure it will revert back to normal over the next couple of years and the ice will build back up. Also, the more ice that melts from glaciers and ice caps in Antartica, the colder it makes arctic ocean waters thus creating more sea ice during winter months.
I would re read that physics books again - a melting floating ice you and the article referring to does NOT increase the average sea level.
Even more, you see lot of people worrying about the sea ice itself melting raising the ocean levels - which is tarded because sea ice is already in the ocean and so it won't raise the ocean levels. The further details being investigated for years to come are about it possibly maybe affecting the land ice.
Probably not. This place is full of doom but if you click into articles or read the scientific papers and watch interviews with the scientists themselves and not the media's BS clickbait interpretation of what they or their papers have said, none of them are presenting doomed planet malarkey because it's not the case.
E.g. This article is full of maybes, likelies, possiblies, and also notes it will be several years yet before it's understood if what's happening is really going to have any effect on anything down the line.
