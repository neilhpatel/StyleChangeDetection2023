You need to retain the services of your own attorney if you have questions that need to be answered as they arise.
If the trustee knows that the death has occurred and has begun to manage the trust affairs, the trustee should be contacting you within a few weeks or months to send you a copy of the trust and to let you know you are a beneficiary.
For example, a trust created at death is usually found in a revocable trust or last will, where the testator states that he/she at his/her death, he/she wants a trust fund created out of the estate assets. He/she could say that the trust should be created/funded first, and then the rest of the assets to the beneficiaries. And, creditors would have to be paid off first before the estate assets are given out.
If her Last Will is lost or missing and her attorney does not have it, the laws in the State that she died will determine who gets her estate assets.
If it is never found, you'll have to let it go. You could contact her attorney about it but it will be hard to enforce a Trust where you cannot find the trust documents.
If you think something shady is happening, you can certainly hire your own estate attorney to check up on things and get control of the estate.
