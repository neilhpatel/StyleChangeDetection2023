Can you believe this level of self denial or worse deceit. The ideology is so deep that even with clear evidence of climate change he has to call his concern "environmental stewardship" and dance a complicated dance to avoid admitting its worse. This is because it is starting to impact him, but he can't admit being wrong. Imagine it took republicans 40 years to accept environmental conservation and only because it is impacts them directly.
"Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, says he does not think a lot about climate change. He cares about environmental stewardship, he explains, in the way hunters and farmers do. He has noticed, too, that Georgia’s coastal roads are flooding more these days.
“Look, I think man causes all kinds of problems every single day, whether it’s violent criminals — I’m sure there’s effects on the environment from people that do things the right way and people that don’t.”.
That "i am not a scientist" thing is a canard. It allows them to play "just some plain ol' country guy" and "I can't understand this new fangled scientificy stuff" denial. He isn't dumb. He is University of Georgia grad and a businessman. He total understands all of this stuff. He is making a veiled excuse for not understanding so he can continue to BS everyone.
But when it comes to assessing whether human-caused carbon emissions are warming the planet, Kemp disclaims any expertise. He reminds me that he is not a scientist, retreating to generalities.".
Oh well would you look at that. A change. Of the climate. (Snarkiness aside there is another huge contributing factor to the flooding which is the sheer amount of paving that makes the inhabited areas in Georgia less permeable to rain water.).
For most of Georgia it's probably the fact that very dry earth doesn't absorb water well, so a heavy rain is more likely to cause flooding if it happens during a drought.
