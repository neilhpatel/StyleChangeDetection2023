The smarter play is her flipping Republican and getting Mitch to promise no primary in 2024. Warnock getting the 51st screwed that plan.
Manchin hasn't decided yet what he is doing in 2024. He could easily go Republican, but I don't think he trusts McConnell not to fuck him in the 2024 election (and Manchin would lose a Republican Primary) - that is why he publicly stated he wouldn't go Republican with McConnell as the senate republican leader.
She know she can't win a Democrat primary, Democrats are winning state wide elections (albeit very very close). The better bet is going Republican, getting that backing of the party and the kudos of delivering the Senate, and get the voters who walked away from the crazy.
Well, she did say she would not caucus with the Republicans, so it seems unlikely she wouldn’t with the Dems because then she would lose her committee seats and power. Even without her, because King and Sanders both caucus with the Dems, it would still be 50-49.
Dems already have 2 independents that caucus with them for the purpose of committees, etc - Bernie Sanders and Angus King. As long as she doesn’t caucus with the Republicans, Dems still get majorities on committees. It was actually 50 R - 48 D last session.
