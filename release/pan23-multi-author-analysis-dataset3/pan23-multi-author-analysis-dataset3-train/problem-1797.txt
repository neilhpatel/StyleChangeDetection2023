Being from IL, I remember Joe Walsh and his election to Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010. Prior to that he was a radio host in the Chicago area. An absolutely disgusting human being. Don’t let his anti-Trump rhetoric fool you, this guy is pure scum and has terrible right wing positions on nearly every issue.
It's funny, because most want to distance themselves, if only to remove serial election loser trump from the party, but they can't say anything because his hog supporters will rip them limb from limb.
The only way a Republican US House or Senate member could truly stand up to the extreme right is by refusing to caucus with them and form some sort of coalition government with the Democrats. Basically say it is me or MTG.
There is a much larger percentage of the GOP than they are willing to admit who don’t have a problem with Trump have dinner with Fuentes because they simply do not have a problem with Fuentes beyond him saying the quiet part loud (and plenty who do not have a problem with that).
