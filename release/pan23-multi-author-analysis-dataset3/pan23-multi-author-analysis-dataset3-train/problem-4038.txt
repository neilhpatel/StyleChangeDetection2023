Also the insurance policy follows the car in VA, per 38.2-2204, as long as the person driving had expressed or implied consent to use it.
So the girlfriend claimed to the insurance that he took it without consent and she never allowed him to drive it which is why they denied the claim.
The claim is against the driver with the argument insurance is obligated to cover under Virginia law. Their defense that she didn't give permission is a question of fact for the court. This insurance denial could easily be entirely based on girlfriend's kneejerk or coerced lie to try and shield driver, which could be picked apart with something as easy as text messages exchanged on the day of the accident produced in discovery or by subpoena to the cell carrier.
Folks, when Liberty Mutual ads tell you to "only pay for the insurance you need," they are trying to trick you into this situation so they can make bank off of your life altering car accident. A minimum policy is 80% the cost of a million dollar policy but does basically nothing when it needs to except make money for insurance companies.
