They don't have to do anything destructive but you should make sure that Susan clearly understands that she is not welcome on the property.
Once you've told her that she is not welcome there and needs to be removed, you can call the police and remove her.
However, wouldn't it be a better idea to, today, call up the aunt in question and tell them that if they're bringing Susan, that none of them are welcome?
Send out a group text to all of your invited guests (at least family members) about the time that you will be expecting them and that Susan is not welcomed to attend. Explain that you are looking forward to sharing the holiday together, but if they bring Susan they wonâ€™t be welcomed in either.
I have made it very clear to "Susan" that she isn't welcome at my household. She doesn't even know where I live now but that's another reason why I'm worried. I guarantee that once she finds out where I live, I'll get harassed with uninvited visits if I don't interact with her. I already have her blocked on all social media platforms, and even her phone number is blocked. I don't want any contact with her at all.
Yes, I have called my aunt about this and she's made no comment. That's why I made this post, everyone's been silent.
