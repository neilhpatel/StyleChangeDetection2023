I do not regret my history major. Most importantly, because an awareness and understanding of history is critical, but also because it taught valuable studying, researching, project preparation, and communication skills that have bearing on the rest of one’s life. With that said, I haven’t used it for anything since getting my Bachelor’s, and as much as I want a higher degree, I realistically would only do so if my passion for history had me wanting to teach it somewhere.
Yeah, I can’t imagine majoring in something you’re not passionate about. College/university already isn’t a cake walk, but having to learn subjects that don’t animate your mind has to be absolute drudgery.
I think if you aren't set on a specific career that requires specific coursework as an undergrad, you should study something that interests you.
I majored in history as it was always my favorite subject. I thought about attending law school, but ultimately ended up going in a different direction.
I find my degree helps with critical reading and thinking as well as research. I know where to find the answer to pretty much anything. I also learned how to learn, if that makes any sense, and don't have trouble picking up material for my current career that has nothing whatsoever to do with history.
