Whilst UB is more a "detached angelic overview" than a "contemporary human source", it has no barrow to push on this point and, to my mind, has persuasive authority. Here is the quote-.

136:2.8.(Jesus was almost thirty-one and one-half years old when he was baptized. While Luke says that Jesus was baptized in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, which would be A.D. 29 since Augustus died in A.D. 14, it should be recalled that Tiberius was coemperor with Augustus for two and one-half years before the death of Augustus, having had coins struck in his honor in October, A.D. 11. The fifteenth year of his actual rule was, therefore, this very year of A.D. 26, that of Jesus' baptism. And this was also the year that Pontius Pilate began his rule as governor of Judea.).
A. A. Mosshammer's The Easter computus and the origins of the Christian era (Oxford, 2008) covers what early Christians (up to the 4th century or so) knew of the relevant period, and how they constructed its chronology (though when it comes to the information they based their chronologies on, Mosshammer's coverage is bitsy).
