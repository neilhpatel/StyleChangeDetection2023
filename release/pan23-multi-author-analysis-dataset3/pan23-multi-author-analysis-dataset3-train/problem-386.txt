Then you've pretty much done all you can and that $125k is likely lost. You can still try to follow up on your report to the FBI and you can file police reports. Other than that, there's likely nothing else (legally) you can do.
You can file a pro se lawsuit... but it is HIGHLY inadvisable to approach most legal matters (civil or criminal) without a lawyer. A lawyer will have the basic knowledge and a lot of experience that most people (and pro se litigants) lack.
Plus, if you are going to attempt a john doe lawsuit and subpoena a large corporation, a webhost, or an ISP (all of whom have legal teams of their own), you'll need to do it with a lawyer.
Besides asking the police to help you can file a lawsuit then get a john doe subpoena for the domain registrar and the webhost and ad service to identify the other party. These third parties may not have the actual contact or payment info, they could have been paid with stolen accounts. Or they could live somewhere with no effective legal recourse. It is hard to say if it would be worth paying a lawyer to pursue this. Get a consult with a personal injury lawyer about what options you have.
