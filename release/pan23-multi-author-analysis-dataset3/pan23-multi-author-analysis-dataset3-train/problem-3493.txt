There are ways the House subpoena process can be changed, weaponized, if you will, so that it will be much harder to avoid complying. In 1973 or 1974, Alexander Butterfield was walking down 16th Street in DC (I think), and he looked in the window of a TV store. He saw the Watergate hearings broadcast live. He and a small crowd watched as someone mentioned that there were tapes Nixon had made of his conversations, and that Alexander Butterfield knew all about the taping system. The Committee immediately issued a subpoena for Butterfield, and he only had a couple of minutes to wonder what he should do before the Senate Sargent of Arms walked up to him and said, "Come with me." Pretty obviously the Committee had known in advance what to expect, and had sent out the Sargent of Arms ahead of the live testimony. He had asked at the White House where Butterfield ate lunch, and knew where to look for him.
I could be wrong, but I thought I was describing Butterfield's own description of what happened. I thought he said the above in an interview, maybe on 60 Minutes.
I believe the subpoena powers of the Committee were such that they could have the Senate or House Sargents or Arms take some Capitol Police, and have him arrested and cuffed if he had not complied.
So why would anyone comply with a subpoena issued by Jim Jordan, a traitor who continually defied subpoenas issued to him by the 1/6 Committee for his role in an attempted coup?
Like if they really pushed them, would a judge use their past actions as precedent to say "Well Congressional subpoenas actually have no teeth so gg"?
This is the most hypocritical part of it all their talking about issuing the same subpoenas that they themselves deemed were useless and invalid when they didn't believe they should've been issued. Now they believe they should be honored and legit because they are issuing them...
