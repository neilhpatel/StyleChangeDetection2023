It won't, unfortunately the country has been nosediving into corruption since the 70s, and no sign of improvements. Everything reeks of corruption. The most human thing to do is let it rot, otherwise the parasite politicians will keep sucking every fund that gets into the country's hand. I say this as a lebanese.
What a shit show Lebanon is. They managed to take a beautiful country and turn it into such a shit hole that they can't even produce more than 4 hours of electricity for the entire country.
The only solution is an external intervention and the removal of the entire status quo of politicians and the complete renewal of the contract between the government and its citizens.
Lebanon's politicians should be put on trial in the Hague for crimes against humanity and corruption and allowing Lebanon to become a breeding ground and training ground for terrorism.
They put the investigation into the Port explosion in a drawer and are trying to forget it ever happened because prominent politicians from Hezbollah and the right wing axis of Iran and Syria are involved in the smuggling, negligence and inevitable cover up.
