Letting the landlord know, filing a noise complaint with the relevant city department (often the police), and getting earplugs. It takes a lot for a landlord to evict someone due to noise, and the degree to which they're obligated to do so is pretty limited. Often, it's easiest to leave at the end of the lease if the landlord isn't handling it: this is a bad business choice, more than anything else.
It doesn't appear that your reasons would support the proposition that the landlord breached the lease or that walking away was a suitable remedy for that breach. You may be liable to the landlord for breaching the lease. While you still have the same rights you would regarding your deposit, they can put the deposit towards the damages caused by your breach.
Also I see damages up to 2x security deposit. Is it just that or do you have to prove hardship or similar to justify the 2x the amount withheld.
Definitely agree. It took me 3 weeks to fill my house that I own and rent out. That was with 4 applications submitted within 2 days of listing. However, she didn't list it at all as far as I can tell. I searched the website I initially found it on as well as many of the other websites.
I do stand to get the cleaning fee back. There was no justification for that. And per the article I read, a landlord is not entitled to keep any of the security deposit if not returned by 21 days so there is a small chance I get all of my security deposit back.
What I'm saying is that if you file suit because she didn't return the security deposit, you may well get a countersuit for more than the security deposit for the rent you were legally required to be paying.
Is it likely that I'd end out even more money if I take the landlord to small claims court other than the security deposit she has already retained plus the cost of small claims court? I'm not sure what level of burden of proof is required to show the landlord didn't list the house for rent.
