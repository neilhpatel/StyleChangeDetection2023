Donâ€™t live in gangland and none of this will affect you. I was raised and spent a good chunk of my life living in the US, never saw a gun or worried about it anymore than I did when in Canada.
I mean I immigrated to this country just 10 years back so still getting used to the whole "carry your gun to the grocery store" thing lol. But I have lived only in big coastal cities like San Diego, SF and Los Angeles- where I do not see civilians carrying weapons. I guess California Coastal Counties are just overall better with gun-regulation .
Thanks for that list, I didn't actually realise it was that bad . I will aways take my vacations in Europe lol . Its so cheap. But make money in California .
So, how much money do you need to make to live comfortably in California? According to GOBankingRates, the yearly income needed to be happy in California is $149,310.
They got a few claps when the Chinese flu caused us all to be locked up these people had to still go to work to puff cigarettes and stock a few cupboards and they got a head as big as Jimmy Neutron with melanoma mass.
