But it would certainly help with handling the costs. So not only would trans youths be prevented from accessing gender affirming care until they're 26, they won't even be able to utilize their parents' health insurance after they are legally of age, effectively adding yet another barrier, a financial barrier, to gender affirming care. This bill is a double FK you to the trans youth of Oklahoma.
Gender affirming care and transitioning can be extremely expensive, and could lasts years, if not decades. Insurance may not cover the cost, but its still a possible resource that could help, regardless of how little of the medical bill it covers. This bill is cruelty in legislative form, as it prevents trans youth from even trying to utilize the small, if any, medical coverage the parents' Insurance may provide for gender affirming care.
In the "90s I first read about the bizarre situation where intersex infants are forced a gender binary on them, more or less arbitrarily, which can have longlasting detrimental effects.
I literally had a coworker tell me about their child being born intersex and they had to “decide” on a gender for the infant, opting to have the child surgically made male because the dad wanted a boy anyways.
I don’t pretend to know the fine details of that person’s life, there’s so much that can be going on beyond gender identity problems, but it was eerie to see everything happen in such relatively quick succession, and I’ll admit I’ll always wonder if things could have been different.
I found it interesting how she avoided the term “intersex” through the entire conversation, but it was clear as day what she was talking about. He even needed to be on hormone replacement therapy to supplement the fact he produced no natural testosterone. As a trans person myself, it was surreal to see someone in such a similar situation, but yet so very different as the choice in my case was mine alone.
