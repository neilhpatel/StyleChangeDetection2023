This law firm website makes the following statement about the beneficiary's right to see the trust documents:
Note that the statement by the law firm states that you can request the TRUST DOCUMENTS (I read that as the entire Trust itself) and NOT JUST THE SECTION THAT REFERS TO THE BENEFICIARY MAKE THE REQUEST FOR COPIES.
You need to retain the services of your own trust attorney to ask the attorney to make a WRITTEN request to the trustee so that the trustee can send the trust document and a copy of an accounting report for each year the trust has existed. The information would be sent to the attorney so that the attorney can send it to the beneficiary. If the request to the trustee came from the beneficiary only, some trustees are more likely to ignore that request.
The correct term for a person who manages a trust is the "trustee". An executor is only responsible for the will.
The attorney represents the trustee and may not respond to the OP. Does not hurt to make the request, but she should be prepared for a rejection or failure to respond.
Trust documents are NOT filed with the court unless there is a dispute. But in every state that I am aware of, a beneficiary is entitled to that part of the trust document that affects his interest. The probate court can enforce that requirement.
