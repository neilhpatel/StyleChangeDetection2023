Biden's bills are laying the groundwork for more progressive agendas. Some progressives expect someone to come in and magically enact sweeping progressive reforms.
Those sweeping reforms like new deal happened because democrats had supermajority in both house and senate. We don't have that. So, it's not gonna happen short of getting rid of filibuster. Which is not a good idea w conservative supreme court and how flippy congress is.
But, these impatient uninformed voters just criticize him for his age and for "not doing enough". They should wake the fuck up and face reality. Cuz you will end up with trump or DeSantis otherwise and I don't think democracy will survive that.
People don't turn out to vote Democrat because the party is full of can't-win-won't-try defeatists. Realistically, only the Republican party runs on a platform promising any form of change to a system that is clearly not working for most Americans. Then, bizarrely, Democrats complain that the poors and the minorities keep "voting against their own interests".
I guess voters are more likely to turn up and support politicians who actually work in their interests? Weird.
