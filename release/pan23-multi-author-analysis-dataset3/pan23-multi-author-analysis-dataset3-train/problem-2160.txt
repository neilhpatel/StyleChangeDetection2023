My guess is the lawyer copied it from another contract. Very little reason for a small daycare to have a JAMS arbitration provision. JAMS is very expensive and the business hast to pay almost all of the expense. The primary benefit for businesses is to discourage claims in the first place because potential claimants can’t figure out how to file in arbitration, and it allows the business to contract it’s a way around potential class action liability.
Generally for a small business like this the benefit is not in the cost, arbitration is much more expensive than small claims for a business especially in California which has laws requiring cost structures that benefit the consumer.
I don't know if negligence and abuse reports to California's regulatory body for daycares are public or if only claims that have been substantiated are public information. Either way, even if the claims are public you would personally be incapable of disclosing the ongoing dispute or after the dispute is concluded in arbitration without breaking the terms of the settlement or arbiter judgement.
It doesn't mean this is a bad daycare. But it isn't the sort of thing that fills one with confidence that any of their major screwups that would have generated a lawsuit has been smothered with an arbitration agreement.
I am not in any possible position to even begin to evaluate the advice a day care received by an attorney.
Thus, any would be lawsuits of say negligence, accidental injury that failed to be settled will be kept out of the public eye.
