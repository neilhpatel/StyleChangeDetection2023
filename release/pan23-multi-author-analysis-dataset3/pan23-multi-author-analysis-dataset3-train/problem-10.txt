Im also well aware of the numerous atrocities committed in the West. That article specifically uses a quote made about corruption - contracts for flour to natives where none was recieved and contracts for beef where 400lb bulls were sold as if they weighed 800, and thats why he threatened withholding funding. Sure he was no champion of Native Rights but using that quote to show how he was "happy" to see the extinction of Native tribes is literally the definition of taking something out of context, and to say it's a disservice to anyone to keep people honest is something we will have to disagree on, my friend.
Correct. The question was about the source of the quotes, not the quotes themselves or his policy. I provided a larger context for one as an example. Other instances, such as the implication he called their words unpronouncable, are also in the article (he said they were "beyond my vocabulary" to pronounce, which is a little more nuanced).
He said all those things, but that only tells one angle of the story (isn't that an ironic comment for me to make!).
