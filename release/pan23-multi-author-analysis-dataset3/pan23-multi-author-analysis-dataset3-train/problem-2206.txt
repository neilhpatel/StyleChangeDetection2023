All accidents so far have been counted and its still one of the safest, maybe not the safest, so I doubt this release will seriously impact those figures. Fission is dangerous when mishandled and anyone who's studied nuclear physics, like I have, knows that, acknowledges that and understands that treating nuclear power with respect and transparency makes it a safe resource to use.
I dont believe nuclear power is anywhere near safe enough yet, and I believe nuke power advocates are way too eager to risk the ruination of entire continents in the name of conserving them...
The effects of this release, and whatever they are they aren't zero, conveniently won't get reflected in the statistics this group shares when they say Fission is the safest, purest, most wholesome power source god has given man.
The Chernobyl area will see an uptick in cancer etc in the near future due to the shelling and trench digging in the area re-exposing radioactive dirt. Will it be tied to the Chernobyl disaster? Unlikely, and this is an obvious in your face consequence.
