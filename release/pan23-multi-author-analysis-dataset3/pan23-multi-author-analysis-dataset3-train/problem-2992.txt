It sounds good but how are you going to fund it? Thereâ€™s an aging demographic so less people paying into the pension but longer life expectancy so more people withdrawing from the pension.
I'm not advocating for anyone else paying for my retirement, I'm advocating for ensuring the pension that I'm currently paying for others to have is still available when I retire in 30 years.
I'd rather have lower median incomes and be able to retire at 62 and have better unemployment protections than earn a bit more money but work till 67 and get fucked if I lose my job.
the problem is not working more, the real problem is seeing the added value of our work going into ceo bonuses and seeing the value of our pension going down even if we work more.
2 - Giving bonuses instead of raising salary: Since companies don't need to pay the gouvernement when giving bonuses, it's their go-to solution when they want to reward an employee. If salary were raised instead, contributions to the retirement funds would raise as well.
