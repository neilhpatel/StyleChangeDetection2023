There are 7 European countries whose captains planned to wear these armbands. Those 7 countries should now threaten to withdraw from the World Cup. What would FIFA do? If 7 countries dropped out right now, before any of them have played a single game, the WC would be completely ruined.
I wasn't trying to make excuses, which you would realize if you'd read the rest of my comment where I suggested that the 8 countries who had planned to have players wear this armband should now threaten to withdraw from the WC.
Secondly I know the teams would never withdraw like I said they should, they're in the business of playing soccer/football and there would be all sorts of negative lasting repercussions for the national teams and the individuals involved, and probably a tiny minority of players would even want to consider boycotting...I just don't see any other truly meaningful way for FIFA to be held responsible for their ethical corruption.
Will football fans make a stand against FIFA and teams who willingly participate in this shit, or are they going to choose the path of selective hearing and ignore the monstrosities that are being played out right in front of us?
I think the salient question here is, "Will FIFA deliberately not play in/withdraw from a country or community that does not respect basic human rights?".
True. But they decided to compete to host an international sporting event. It's not like hordes of exposed-shoulder, rainbow flag waving fans randomly showed up at the airport one day.
