Both McCarthy and McConnell said it was a good thing for Pelosi to go. Sure they had reasons why they didn't like it to their expectations, but both agreed that is was something Pelosi should have done.
That was the complaint about Pelosi going over there, which I agreed with, and I agree McCarthy going there is wrong as well.
You realize, don't you, that it's the official position of China, Taiwan, and the US that there is only one China, and Taiwan and what we call China are all the same nation, right?
Countering China is pretty much the one thing that the right and the left can agree on in Washinon right now, I fully believe that the United States would step in to defend Taiwan. The entire national security community is in lockstep on this.
Those are honestly small exceptions to the rule. A few examples of GOP officals being pro-china isnt good. But it doesn't match the overwhelming amount of momentum in Washinon to counter china either.
I don't like McCarthy but I support his, or any member of the US Government's right to visit Taiwan.
You’re assuming that McCarthy wouldn’t be on China’s side. Republicans go to the highest bidder. McCarthy just proved that by selling his ass to right-wing extremists.
