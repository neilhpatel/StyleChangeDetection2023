Just another good reason for the West to continue to cut China out of trade, high tech production, and eventually everything else. The next decade is going to be a harsh lesson for Winnie The Poo.
TSMC has a massive interest in remaining essential to the US and the West in general, it's part of Taiwan's national security strategy ffs.
And Turkey knew for years that a big earthquake was due. The fact that the time scales involve lead people to engage in all sorts of cognitive distortions to justify inaction doesn't mean that the wall won't hit them sooner or later. People have been saying for decades that Japan is facing a demographic crisis and... now they are.
Europe has paid a MUCH higher price than we would have by cutting Russia off as much as we can all at once, than if we had listened to concerns over the last decade and done it more gradually. Besides, China isn't the source of cheap labor it once was, unsurprisingly Chinese people expect economic progress, and slaving away on an assembly line isn't their idea of success. There is also the demographic realities of an aging population on top of inverted pyramid of too few young people.
Also, the 'more children' approach is a capitalist fallacy - the solution for falling birth rates and an ageing population is automation, NOT more children. You can bet your ass China knows this, and history has already shown countless times that China can change (for better or worse) quicker in a few years than most countries can change in a decade.
