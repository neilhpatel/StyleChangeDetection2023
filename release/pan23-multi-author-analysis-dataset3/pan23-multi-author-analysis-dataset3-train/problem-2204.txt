It is heated up and flows through miles of pipes, distillation columns and reactors. These separate and change the crude oil into its refined constituents.
Refineries may take crude oil from all over the world, by the time it reaches its final product; that gallon of E85 may have come from 80 different tankers all originating from various countries.
The easiest solution, would be for the UK and NATO to just say “we won’t buy from any refinery that buys Russian oil”, but I don’t think there’s the political will for that level of sanctions yet.
Not to mention that the US (and EU) will soon allow imports of Russian oil again as long as the oil is bought below a certain price cap, a decision made by the G7 recently.
As for these sanctions, they're literally just buying a small amount of oil from European countries, who happened to have bought it from Russia previously.
yea but they bought the russian oil from germany, the sanctions are for buying oil from russia, rather than buying russian oil.
