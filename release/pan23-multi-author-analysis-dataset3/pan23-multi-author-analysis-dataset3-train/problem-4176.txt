People try to normalize Liz Cheney for doing her job regarding the January 6th committee while ignoring that her politics outside of that are dogshit.
If Republicans control the House then this is a long shot, but the alternative is the House spending all its time investigating Hillary and Hunter and impeaching Joe Biden three or more times. Nobody in their right mind could want that.
I don't understand why you'd rather have the Republicans get a speaker who would empower MTG and make sure nothing happens other than impeaching Biden at least three times, rather than the possibility of taking advantage of the razor-thin margin (with the help of a few of the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump) to put a moderate speaker in there so that maybe a few good things get done in spite of Republicans having the majority there. Can you explain?
It only makes sense in the case where Republicans control the House (they only have to win one of the six races that haven't been called yet), but if that's how it turns out, what's wrong with the idea?
If Republicans win the House by 2-3 seats, what are the chances Dems could convince some of the moderates to actually vote for bills instead of killing every bill that is introduced for the next two years?
It's not likely Dems will have the majority when all the votes are counted, but the GOP majority is likely to be so small that no one in their caucus will be able to get 218 to be elected speaker. In that case, Dems would be lucky to be able to get a compromise speaker in a coalition with several Republicans.
If it is a 218 or 219 vote majority, we really may need a compromise speaker in order to have stability in the chamber. You have no idea how much chaos could be created if the House majority swung on every vacancy that occurs in the session. Because those vacancies are frequent. Also consider the games that governors would play to delay special elections in order to extend their party's control of the chamber.
