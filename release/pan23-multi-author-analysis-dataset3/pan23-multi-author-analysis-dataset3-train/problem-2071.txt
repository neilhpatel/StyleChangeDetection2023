Yes. It also helps children be able to eat daily, and that helps their education levels. Other countries feed their kids freely (and much more nutritionally), and their higher education scores are reflected in that. Republicans most certainly seem to always clamor for better test scores, and yet they don't care about doing anything to help kids improve in school. They actually delight in seeing kids do worse, in reality.
Sorry. I understand your hunger, though. I'd actually eat lunch if it looked like lunch in South Korea or Japan. I actually skipped lunch in school, because the food was so awful. I'd just go into the computer lab and hang out, and I'd refuse to go to the cafeteria to eat, because school lunch made me vomit. I think that's why I can only eat two times per day.
The Republicans want to literally starve their own people and make them more susceptible to illness?
Next in the IA GOP plan… extermination chambers for those yucky Americans who are a drag on IA society. You may think that’s hyperbolic… but if you look at the republicans antivax message and boarder policies, which created near concentration camp like facilities, we should acknowledge… it’s happening here already and stuff like this is a step towards concentration camps.
