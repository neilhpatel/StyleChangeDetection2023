I can actually respect this stance. He also said and I'm paraphrasing "It's not Kalle or Nils getting shot and killed (common Swedish names), it's Mohamed and Ali (foreigners)... In other words, gang members.
Everywhere has gangs. Because everywhere has criminals and eventually one group of criminals starts competing with a second with each banding together and that's how you get gangs.
I would wager a lot of the crime in Sweden isn't much worse than America only far far less widespread.
Sweden’s homicide rate is still only , the same as the U.K., and lower than many other safe countries like Finland, Belgium and France - for comparison, the US is about 6x higher.

Note though that our total homicide rate is lower than that of Finland, the same as Denmark, and about the same as the UK, so it's not like we have a lot of homicides in total, it's just that a large amount of them is done with a firearm.
