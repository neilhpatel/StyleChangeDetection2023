The only way to tell whether something is a condo or not, is to read the legal description. It may be outlined in the preliminary title policy as well. Condos are not a physical description, you can have detached single family homes that are condos. You will likely see something like an undivided interest or a horizontal property regime (depending on how TN state laws require this wording).
I'd escalate with the lender. They're supposed to be intelligent enough to figure out what is what. If the appraiser was not correct then the lender will inform them to make the correction, as the appraiser works for the lender.
ETA: if your lender says this cannot be changed then the appraiser is likely correct. You're going to need to find a different lender, if yours won't make a condo loan. What another lender might have done, is immaterial - if that lender erred they may be required to buy back the loan or find a different investor to sell it to. That loan might have closed, but you have no way of knowing if that lender acted appropriately or made a mistake that wasn't caught until it was too late.
Thank you We are currently talking to their preferred lender who is being very helpful He is the one who closed the VA loan on the same home 3 weeks ago. Do you know who would need to start the approval process with the VA to get it approved as a condo? Is it our realtor or lender?
Ask the lender then ask your realtor to ask the builder. It's just a certificate that gets issued alongside new construction and while the certificate won't mention property description there is usually an inspection card filled out alongside it that will state how the property will be deeded with the county.
