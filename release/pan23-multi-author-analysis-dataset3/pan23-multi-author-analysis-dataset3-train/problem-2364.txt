It'd be like if a "potentially allied" nation said you could join the club only if you changed your laws to be convenient to specifically them and only then will you get their necessary vote. Your nations democracy is being violated and extorted, "the people will" overturned in their own country by a foreign government.
That sets a dangerous precedent for its peoples right to self govern and also a very dangerous precedent going forward for NATO itself and any nations seeking to join.
I want my country and Finland to join NATO, but I don't want this to happen by sacrificing our democracy and disrespecting human rights.
I want more of Scandinavia in NATO, but I don't want it badly enough to go along with sending 130 political prisoners to their deaths at the hands of sultan-wannabe Erdogan.
Also American and I really don't think NATO membership is necessary enough for Finland and Sweden to bend over for Erdogan. Every other NATO country can sign mutual defense agreements with them anyway. They are up to speed and well informed to work with NATO. Joint exercises have been held and coordination escalated since the russian invasion of Ukraine.
