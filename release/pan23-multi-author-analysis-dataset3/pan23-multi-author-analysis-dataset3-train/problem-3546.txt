Have they agreed to pay their half? The landlord is only going to be concerned with with getting the full amount, they don’t care who it comes from. If the roommate refuses to pay the half, that’s an issue between the two of you.
What's immature is bringing the landlord into the issues that are only between you and your roommate. IMO, you should have just said something like 'Our circumstances have changed and we're no longer able to fulfill the lease' and then pay what's outlined in the lease.
Based on the terms of the lease, it says that if I want to break it, I have to pay a re-rent levi of 1.5 months rent, plus any rent due. The rent is regularly $2500, but it will be $1700 for August. So I would owe $1875 (2500/2 1.5) if the landlord decides to base it on the $2500, or $1275 if he goes with the $1700. Nothing else is due because the first months rent has been paid. My part of the security deposit was $1250. And since there can't be any damage or repairs needed since I never occupied the property, I should get all of that back. Am I correct in thinking that I can tell him he can keep the deposit and I'll pay the difference needed ($25 or $625) to break the lease? The early move out clause in the lease doesn't say that he gets to keep the deposit, or anything at all regarding the security deposit.
