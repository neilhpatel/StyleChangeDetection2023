Yeah I was somewhere where this "Shaolin Monk" would come and try to give you some beaded bracelet. I don't remember how the scam works, but I kept having to tell the guy I wasn't interested... but "no no, it's free!"... yeah, that makes me even more suspicious.
I guess then they start some guilt trip on you. I think at that point you just toss it on the ground and tell them no, or maybe go over the top "Oh THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS GIFT I will treasure it always Give you a tip? No, that would ruin the spirit of friendship in which it was given Thanks so much, you are so kind, thanks for this free gift You are too generous!".
That’s been a thing for a while. One of them assaulted my mom in the early 2000s because they didn’t feel she gave them enough money. The Italian police were very nice though.
It's not just Italy. Plenty of times I've gone to see bands in clubs that are in shittier parts of cities in the US and the "parking jockeys" are there with the "I'll watch your car for you" shtick too.
I've apparently developed such an effective "fuck off" face that when I was in Rome a few years back even the roma beggars averted my gaze & left me alone.
