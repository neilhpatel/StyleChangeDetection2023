It COULD end tomorrow, but that would require Putin to grow a sense of empathy, which he refuses to have, so presumably, Putin will insist that Ukrainian-controlled areas are Russian.
Ukraine can decide how and when this war ends, but other countries have more power with regards to Russia's future. What Russia's future looks like needs to be discussed now, but this isn't the time for absolutes. This may not be realistic at all, but there's at least a tiny chance Russians could overthrow Putin and try to look towards the West. How this war ultimately ends is still unknown.
The reality is that for people who suffer from either, it can look very much the same. There are no moral equivalencies, but the dead will remain dead no matter how or why it happened.
Everything you say about Russia rebuilding the military is completely valid. It also asumes nobody will help Russia substantially after this war, which is very unrealistic. I'm not concerned with what happens in the next 5 years in Russia. My concerns are what happens within a longer time frame where Russia can realistically rebuild the military, and more importantly rebuild and influence alliances. Try to imagine the world 20 years from now.
Do you know where the term banana republic comes from, and the history of these places? This is not the time of place for this discussion, but the reality is every government is responsible for some evil. Some like Russia is very much intentional evil. The evil of other governments may come in the form of unintended consequences most of the time.
