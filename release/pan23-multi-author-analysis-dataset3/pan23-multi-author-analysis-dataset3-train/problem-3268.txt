This is wrong, it is working, it is preventing hospitalization and death, which is the purpose of the vaccine, not preventing all cases of mild illness. Second, the vaccine isn't just to protect you; it's to protect those around you and to prevent further variants from developing.
A religious belief must be a sincerely held religious belief, not a belief that suddenly arose because of this vaccine. You should be able to produce some evidence of this belief and why it precludes you from being vaccinated, such as a letter from a member of the clergy of the church, temple, mosque, or ashram that you attend on a regular basis as a devout member of this religion.
Further, . It is from 1973 and could have either been the result of an abortion or a miscarriage. Either way, I don't think your claim to deciding doctrine is superior to the Pope's, and the vaccine itself contains no fetal cells of any kind.
Then I suggest you take a look at what the Pope has said about receiving the vaccine (Hint: It's a moral obligation). It's a lame attempt because what you are asserting is at odds with the current teachings of the religion you are hiding behind.
Frankly, your lame attempt at the religious assertion may not pass muster, either. But again, you're welcome to try.
