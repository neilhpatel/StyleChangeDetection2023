Have you considered the possibility that your family is making part (or all) of this story up? It's awfully dramatic and far-fetched. Have you with your own eyes seen insurance paperwork for this payout? Did you with your own eyes see the $25,000 in cash?
Did she prove to the police she had the $25k in cash? they might be more helpful if she proved she just withdrew $25k in cash from the bank/actually cashed a check for that amount. If you are the victim of a crime with unusual circumstances, you may have to offer proof of some of the less common details to be taken seriously by police.
Theoretically you could get into a great deal of trouble, another word for fake cash is counterfeit. Even movie studios have to jump through a bunch of hoops use fake money for filming. If this was a dark comedy someone could steal your fake money, get caught spending it and then confess to stealing it and you would get into more trouble.
As mentioned even if you went through with the plot of setting up fake cash and a nanny cam, if the worker took it that would not prove he took the prior cash unless he admitted to it. If the cops are refusing to investigate, keep pushing them because there's not much you can realistically do.
