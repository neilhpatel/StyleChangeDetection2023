That’s honestly starting to be my comfort thought. With all the political disasters surfacing recently, it’s almost nice to think that civil war and rising temperatures might end me sooner rather than later.
That’s some hard fact right there. And unless shit turns around real soon there’s no way I’m having kids.
Yet I've got a daughter, and she's got a 3 year old son. By the time she's my age, coastal cities will be facing serious flooding, food insecurity will be a huge problem worldwide, there will (if we keep up the current pace) a lot of species driven to extinction, and politically I wouldn't be surprised if the US is extinct as well...broken up into regions run by different factions or perhaps the whole thing rebuilding after a civil war. My grandson? He'll probably wonder how "The Road Warrior" got everything so right...
If we go by the longest lived male relative of mine - my uncle - I'd be lucky if I get another 30 years. If it's the average? I'm looking at another 10. Oh well.
Well said. It's amazing how destructive the GOP is. It boggles my mind how predictably cruel they all are. If it could possibly be considered common sense legislation, that's a "no" from the GOP. If it can put even a single red cent into the pockets of the 1%, that's a "yes.".
Yep. At least during the Obama years, you could rest easy knowing the Republicans care more about money than anything else, and a default would hurt their wealthy sponsors. You knew they were bluffing. With the crazies in charge now, who knows what will happen.
