Russia hasn’t fought many wars in the past 100 years. Also that time frame excludes the Russo-Japanese War, WWI, and the Polish-Soviet War, which were all pretty embarrassing losses.
The Winter War was technically a win, but the USSR was badly mauled in that conflict. WWII was a team effort, and although the USSR came out as one of two superpowers, its losses were horrific.
Ukraine is basically WW2 Russia - WW2 Russia got flattened by itself, but turned things around because the West was just dumping equipment on them. That's closer to what's happening with Ukraine now.
Yep, I just mean that, if we're scoring militaries from 1-100, and the U.S. is 100, it's perfectly possible for Russia to be the second best military in the world, but still only score like 21, while everyone else is 20 and below.
I'm not saying Russia IS the second most powerful army, but just that Russia struggling in Ukraine doesn't prove that they aren't - as we have no evidence that anyone other than the U.S. could successfully invade a country the size of Ukraine either.
That’s also ironically why US/NATO forces (who been training the Ukrainians since 2014) are so much better quality-wise, is they were tasked to fight the Soviet Union/Warsaw Pact while being outnumbered. So they made up for it with quality weapons, lots of training, etc..
