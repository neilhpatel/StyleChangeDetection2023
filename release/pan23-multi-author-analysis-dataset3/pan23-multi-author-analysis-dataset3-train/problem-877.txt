That’s very obviously false, as that title unquestionably belongs to the former guy, but notice how Fox skirts liability by inserting a quote from a mouthpiece into the title to guide readers to their desired position. “No no, we’re not falsely claiming that Biden is the biggest serial liar elected, we’re just reporting on someone else who did. \ wink wink ”.
The headline implies that Biden is the "Biggest serial liar elected," which is patently false. President Biden would have to be lying at a rate of twenty-one lies per day to top . Fox knows this, which is why they had to quote someone else falsely calling Biden the "Biggest serial liar elected" instead of saying it themselves.
I think the biggest serial liar elected definitely goes to Trump, but it does appear that Biden made this story up. Both his father and his uncle died before he was elected Vice President in 2008.
The Problem: The President's father and the uncle he referred to both died several years before Biden took the office of Vice President.
Biden could have also been talking about when he got elected to the Senate, and mistakenly said VP. He didn't specify the year. Still a gaffe, but this could be a very minor instance of misspeaking.
Not comprehensive is putting it lightly. You have to actively register recipients for them to appear on that list. It's not pulled from government records or anything. My grandfather, who has now passed and whose purple heart we have in my house, doesn't appear on the list either... because why would we register him on some stupid internet database?
