Not a lawyer, but a long time school teacher coach, behavioral specialist, and adminstrator. Regarding the advice to "skip the prayer session," that is horrible advice. Might be the worst thing you can do. Either fight the whole fight and raise holy hell (start with the ACLU before proceeding and then follow their advice regarding formal complaints, etc), or unfortunately feign participation. I explained why in my comment to the person who advised "just skipping:".
Well you skip the convocation. Since that isn't part of the "training" (OP did say the actual training takes place after the church service at a different location), I can't see how OP can be made to attend the convocation, and as long as the actual training is non religious, the fact it is in a church is acceptable.
Is it? The opening prayer and church service is being held before the official training at a different church. What religious purpose or training is occuring at the part OP has to attend? Maybe there's some comments I'm missing. Normally convocations are not requirements for anyone to attend.
Because churches have large common areas that can be rented to the public. It's common for companies to rent external locations for training and team building to make the event more memorable and provide "fresh surroundings" for those attending.
Again, you go to the first day but skip the convocation. OP did not say the convocation is part of the training, they did explicitly say the training is after the convocation at a different location. I've never seen a convocation as a requirement to attend, especially an overtly religious one.
