This is an incredibly stupid take. Ukraine leaving landmines lying around to kill their own civilians is no different than Russia doing it. It takes a real piece of shit to openly defend war crimes just because they're committed by the "right side.".
Yes, they are. One side murdering civilians does not justify the other side doing it. If Ukraine responds to war crimes by committing war crimes also against their own people, why should I continue to care if they win or not?
But yes lets focus human rights violation on the landmines and not the rape and murder of innocent Ukrainian civilians.
However, if Ukraine was smart they would keep using mines but stop any and all POW atrocities. Landmines everyone understands. Atrocities against Russian POWs is going to cost them international support and play into Russian propaganda.
For what it's worth, the article does acknowledge the atrocities the Russians have committed. The problem is mines tend to inflict more civilian casualties than military.
Landmines always kill more civilians than military targets. Ukraine knows this. What they're doing here is no different than dropping a bomb on an occupied apartment building, except that the deaths will occur over an extended period of time. There is absolutely no justification for this.
