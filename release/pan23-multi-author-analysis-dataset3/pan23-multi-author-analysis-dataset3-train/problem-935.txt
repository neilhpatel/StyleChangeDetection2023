I ask about the modern military because it seems like we, as modern people, often take the idea of a military motivated to "protect our freedom" or other such nationalistic narrative totally for granted. It assumes that the people who volunteer to serve do so out of a motivation to serve their country, to help make the world a safer place, or to continue a family tradition. Some of that remains true. found that the desire for professionalism, the desire to join a brotherhood of soldiers, family tradition, and other such intangibles were highly rated by young enlisted men and women as reasons they joined. There are, of course, tangible benefits as well, as in pay and citizenship, money for college and the like. Most of those reasons rank high in even the most chest-thumping breakdowns of why people would join the army.
Strikingly, though, despite some popular notions that the current army's ranks are filled with people of lower income brackets, actually suggest that the poor are underrepresented in the army, while people from middle-class backgrounds make up the bulk of new recruits.
Does that study take into account that, once people join the armed forces, they receive a wage plus various benefits, elevating them from the lowest-income brackets into the middle class? I do not know the wage scale of US soldiers, from private all the way up to the officers.
