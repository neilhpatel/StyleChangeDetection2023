I don’t get this take. Yes republicans break shit then leave office. But you were then elected to fix that shit they broke. Doesn’t matter that it wasn’t your mess you still have to clean it up. Saying it’s Trump’s fault doesn’t fix the problem.
The DANGER of blaming Trump is that If we want to fix the problem, we can’t just assume that not electing Trump again is sufficient. Any GOP president would have done the same. We need strong regulatory frameworks that better balance public risk against business interests.
Hazardous yes but not hazardous enough to apply the brake rule. The whole system is broken is my point. You can’t blame Trump because he’s just one part of the whole regulatory clusterbacle.
You certainly can blame any and all parts of the "regulatory clusterbacle", especially polticians like him. Yeah he isn't solely to blame, obviously, but as a prominent mouthpiece for the ideology that is responsible I'd say it's fair to cast such aspersions.
Rather than blindly assigning blame or upvoting comments that align with our biases, we should approach complex issues with an open mind and a willingness to listen to all perspectives. Only by working together and engaging in productive dialogue can we hope to solve the pressing issues facing our society and our planet.
The safety rollbacks cited by the White House in response to the East Palestine spill are certainly cause for concern. It is important for government officials to prioritize the safety of their constituents, and taking steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future should be a top priority. Hopefully, the situation can be addressed in a bipartisan manner to ensure that the necessary safety measures are put in place to protect the public and prevent further environmental damage.
