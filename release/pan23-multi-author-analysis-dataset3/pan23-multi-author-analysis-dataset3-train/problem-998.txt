The judge should have explained his order denying your motion to you. Your lawyer should also have explained why the child was not ordered returned.
I'm just guessing here because I'm bored. Call your lawyer and ask your lawyer to explain why, or ask your lawyer to request an explanation from the judge.
2. You and your attorney might be misinterpreting IC 31-17-2.2-1 and 31-17-2.2-3. Those statues are intended for situations where legal and physical custody has already been established through the court, that is to say where a cause number already exists and jurisdiction has been established. The way you explained it is unclear as to the order of events.
1. The judge felt that it's not in the child's best interest to be returned to you. If this is the case, and the divorce is still pending, then your attorney needs to file for a hearing on a provisional order laying out visitation during the pendency of the divorce.
You should ask your attorney these questions, but in general the law you cited applies to situations in which a court has already awarded custody to one parent. Was this the case with you?
