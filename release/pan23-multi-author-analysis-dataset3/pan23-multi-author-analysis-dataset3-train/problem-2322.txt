However, either of you can give notice as late as 15 days before the end of the lease that your tenancy is ending. That would include giving you the alternative of either renewing or leaving.
Your lease will become month-to-month by default if nothing happens to modify that and if the lease itself doesn't address the issue.
If you want month-to-month and that isn't stipulated by your current agreement, I'd email your landlord asap to see if they will permit that.
Generally once a lease term expires it converts to month to month unless a new contract is signed. HOWEVER, neither party is legally required to transition to that month to month contract. As the leasee you generally inform the LL 30 days before that you will be vacating at end of lease date. For the landlord he has already told you there is NO intent to convert to month to month, you cannot force him to. You can also chose to not move out, in this case you will most likely be evicted and that will make renting in the future extremely limiting.
