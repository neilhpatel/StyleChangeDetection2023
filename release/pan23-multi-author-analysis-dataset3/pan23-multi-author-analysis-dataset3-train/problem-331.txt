Republicans are slimey and will try to pass some variation of a law that doesn't explicitly say "you must be 21 to vote", but will try to put in some kind of rule or something that seriously restricts anyone under 21 from voting.
It’s amazing the efforts these pieces of crap will go through to restrict people from voting instead of creating any legislation that would make people want to vote for them.
There would be no way to write a law that would be able to frustrate voting because someone is 18. It would either be overly broad, or vague, both of which fail. While I am a newly minted lawyer, I assure you it is impossible to skirt around this particular amendment. It would be the same as trying to get around the amendment that allows for a direct vote of senators. How would you even do that?
I know the current make up of the court makes it hard to visualize them not going with the most esoteric explanation to allow it, but there is zero room to move around. It is the equivalent of saying “without oxygen a human cannot survive for 24 hours in a conscious alert state. ” There’s no interpreting around that.
There’s nothing to interpret. The amendment was ratified in 1971 and that’s the complete text. There’s no room for interpretation. It says don’t do this.
Don't be stupid. That's not how this one goes. This is not Roe v Wade, or even the Voting Rights Act, where the SC claimed to have some leeway.
