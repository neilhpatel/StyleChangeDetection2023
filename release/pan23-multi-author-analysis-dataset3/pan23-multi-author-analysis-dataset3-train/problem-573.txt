Even if it's significantly cheaper than Airbus or Boeing, there is more to gained by cancelling the orders.
The development time doesn't tell you much, tbh. I think the key thing is that it's made in Russia and buying them means you probably won't be able to fly it into the West and it would be seen as helping Russia. Politically it's a bad idea for almost all customers, except those inside Russia who want to avoid being defenestrated by Putin for not being patriotic enough.
But they are extorting Russia to lower the price (though not by 50%, more like 15-30%) since Russia doesn't have many other potential buyers.
Only thing we should do is look for ways to make more money from these Russian tourists, drain every last penny from the Russian economy.
Giving every Russian the chance to leave destroys national unity. It’s easier for putin to spout ‘evil west’ and ‘freedom’ when the west is directly targeting Russian civilians.
Well, Russia has a lot of recent history sending assassins to brazenly murder people in other countries. Some of them were on tourist visas. Lots of spies too.
London, New York, Florida, and other places are crawling with Russians. Saw lots of Russians in Norway this year too. Tourist visas are often valid for years and allow long term visits. Some overstay their visas entirely.
