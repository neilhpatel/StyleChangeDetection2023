We have to somehow convince the French to go back to nukes. But they’re French, almost like cats, so we don’t know what’s going to happen. But they’re still leading the way with their fleet they currently have. And shame on you Germans, turning away from nukes….
But don’t forget about us and how our slow government with employees stealing shit, and how we really are the first there, party hardy, then we fuck care and go back to being the middle class of the world.
Haha, didn’t know that about the Italians. Surprising since they’re the core of nuclear science as a field.
Yup, it's mostly the west is still against nuclear, which is so fucking strange. We should be heavily invested in it but coal and gas is still king for some reason.
The earthquake wasn't the problem, it was the Tsunami that came after. That was also a problem because the backup generators weren't on top of the roof like they were supposed to be, they were underground so they got flooded, without those backup generators, they didn't have enough power to go into emergency shut down.
