Taiwan doesn't want to invest in their military. Their hope is they strenhen alliances and 'entrap' their allies to defending them if China invades. You can see how Taiwan's % gpd spent on their military. For a country that is regularly being talked about being bombed and conquered by their enormously large neighbor, they don't particularly have a militarized society or seem to be interested in actually defending themselves. This could be changing given how Washinon has invested in making Taiwan more militarized.
How do you see the evidence of the war in Ukraine and decide technology usurps manpower? Russia is having massive recruitment issues even when conscription is partially used.
Ultimately if the calculus is to let Taiwan fall without direct allied involvement, it will be very fast and swift conclusion. It would not be a rather protracted war like Ukraine. Either China blunders and pulls back or Taiwan immediately collapses. It'll be decided in single invasion week.
The point is to deter or prevent that from happening. Which is what we ultimately want. No war to happen at all because the risks are too great for China.
A “good relationship” with China is bowing down and doing what it asks you lest you incur its wrath and tantrum.
Maybe China can fuck off and leave us alone, then we can talk diplomacy. Yeah, let's go and have some diplomacy when facists have a gun to our heads. Great idea.
