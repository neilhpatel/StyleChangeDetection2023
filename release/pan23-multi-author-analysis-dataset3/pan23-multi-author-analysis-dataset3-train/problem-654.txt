He receives payments for being deaf. I'm not quite sure how his checks work as my grandmother was his legal guardian before she signed him off to his now guardians. But I'll look into for sure.
But I believe I’m correct. A 2-minute westlaw search leads me to In re Bailey, 2006 WL 1174224 at 4. “Margie was never appointed administrator of Bryan’s estate, and even lost her authority as his next friend upon his turning eighteen.” So I think I’m on the right track there—not sure what the procedure is called to terminate the next friendship but a lawyer more familiar with state court can likely find out.
This is all provided that (a) he is not disabled other than the aforementioned deafness (which is insufficient to destroy his legal rights of course) and (b) he doesn’t want to sell, because given the facts here, it’s likely the type of arrangement where any owner can force the sale of the property and take their half.
If he is the joint owner of the property, he can apply for a partition sale in order to claim his half of the money if you refuse to buy him out or sell the property; which is presumably what his guardians are doing. Because he is still a minor, any proceeds from the sale will be placed in a UTMA trustee account. It's not as if his guardians will get all of the money and be able to spend it on themselves and leave your brother on the street. They can use the account on things that benefit your brother as well as them, but there will need to be an accounting of the funds and they can be held liable for misuse. Omce he reaches the age of majority (not always 18 for UTMA accounts), he will have sole control over it, not his guardians.
