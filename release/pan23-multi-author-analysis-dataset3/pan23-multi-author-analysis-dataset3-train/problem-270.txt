The Allies spent a fair amount of time considering how to deal with the Axis leadership, including Hitler, throughout much of the war, as detailed , and in the end, despite voices to the contrary, the result was a commitment to legal proceedings.
What would that mean in practical terms? In the end we can only really speculate because the Germans didn't put in the effort to document just what they would do and prepare for trials after the war like the Allies and so on, which is what allows us to be more grounded in our assumptions about the reverse scenario for Hitler. But certainly it is clear enough that Hitler believed the Soviet Union was held together in no small part by the will of Stalin - at points in the Table Talk and elsewhere he even is oddly praiseful in ways - and that cutting off the head was the most assured way for the body to collapse.
That would seem to suggest assassination as a war-winner, especially after the retreat from Moscow in 1941 made actually capturing Stalin a more distant prospect. Do you know if the Germans attempted that? If not, why not?
