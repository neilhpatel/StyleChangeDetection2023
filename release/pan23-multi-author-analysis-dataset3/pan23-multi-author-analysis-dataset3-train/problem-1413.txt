1. Ignore them. Unless they sue, where ignoring could mean they win by default judgment, do not acknowledge them in any way.
If you decide to do 3, challenge it by paper. Some online reporting tools say that if it isn’t removed on your first try you cannot challenge it again through that reporting agency. In addition to it being removed because they can’t prove one of the above pieces, it can also be removed if they do not respond properly within 30 days. You can repeatedly challenge it on the hope that they will not respond in time, though this just prevents it from affecting your credit score and not your obligation to pay.
2. Talk to a lawyer. Let them request everything, or at least advise you on how to do so without giving them anything they can use against you.
NAL, but I would not even acknowledge that is an old debt. Don’t give them anything that they can use to argue that the debt is valid. “This is an old debt” is still acknowledging that it is, or was, a valid debt.
Anyway, what I would instead do is ask for proof of debt. It could be they don't have complete records and things never get off the ground in terms of suing you. And even if they do, the complete lack of contact with you for numerous years could still convince a court to strike down at least a large chunk of those fees. Especially since they weren't withdrawing fees during that time. Do not agree to negotiate, at least not without a lawyer consult. Even partial payment may constitute recognizing the debt and have you on the hook for more than you originally thought.
If I said "I may just take the deal" would that count as recognizing the debt? I had called them and don't remember specifics but I may have acknowledged it I think?
