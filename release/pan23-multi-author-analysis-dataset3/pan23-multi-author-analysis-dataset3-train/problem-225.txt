They realize that the mega donors for the DNC and RNC won’t let those things happen, even if they ask for them.
This is just a safe comment from a few to make them look good, it’s just rich people virtue signaling.
Nothing is quite as cringy as a billionaire virtue signaling. The entire corporate apparatus that created their amassed fortunes relied specifically on lobbying both sides of the legislature to perpetuate the tax loopholes that sustained their wealth in the first place. How stupid do they think people are?
Uh-huh, I can see it now, hundreds of Billionaire protesters chanting in the streets “Tax us now, Tax us now!”.
They've said the same thing for at least a decade now, yet they do EVERYTHING in their power to fight any increase in taxation.
Exactly. Yet for some reason there's a bunch of temporarily embarrassed billionaires here sticking up for them like we should be grateful they said words.
So these good billionaires are making policies that cause people to have to shit in sandwich bags because if they don’t there will only be the evil billionaires left, got it. There is no service in the world that an individual can provide that warrants them making billions of dollars.
You seem to be missing the point, nothing is stopping the ‘tax us now’ group from donating as large as a portion of their wealth to social causes as they wish. The fact they don’t shows they do not want to, but that bit of lip service will trick naive people into believing they are good people.
