If you are uninsured, you could sue the driver of the other vehicle for the cost of your damaged belongings. You would need to file in the state the accident took place in. Your losses probably far exceed the small claims court limit in most states and you’re going to be physically located in another state, so I would consider hiring a lawyer for this. You will not get back the full value of your property because of legal fees and it will be a slow process. Litigation lawyers are the correct type of lawyers for this; most personal injury specialists would be well practiced at getting settlements from insurers.
Did you have a renter or homeowner insurance policy active at the time of the accident? If so, call your insurer to see if you have any coverage for moving losses.
The driver’s insurance (adverse in the parlance) are going to first prorate between you and the movers damage, and then prorate your property value. Your moving company took manifests when they loaded your stuff and they will have provided you copies when they loaded your stuff. Adverse is definitely going to want to see those.
Adverse is also going to send you a release with the check. The release will stipulate that you won’t go after the at-fault driver for any more damages.
This means the Driver could've avoided the circumstances the led to the accident even though it wasn't his fault.
