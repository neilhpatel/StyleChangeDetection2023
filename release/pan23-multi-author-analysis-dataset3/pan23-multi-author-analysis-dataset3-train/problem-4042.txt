She's pushing the Republican narrative. Republicans need people like her to undermine the electorate's trust in elections if they plan to push for an autocrat before they become completely irrelevant.
The funny thing about this is that these ridiculous election deniers which are overwhelmingly Republican are probably going to have the opposite effect of what Kari Lake and other election deniers suggest: “restoring trust in our election process”. It’s actually probably dissuading already skeptical republicans from voting at all. I mean, what rational person would go vote for an election that they are convinced is rigged against their candidate?
And the average voter who wasn't paying attention will just remember that, yes, there were lots of people shouting about fraud. There were lawsuits popping up everywhere. There were tons of news stories about very smart people all over the country claiming fraud. It won't matter that none of it was true. if you shout it loudly enough, people will forget that you were dead wrong. It just becomes "a wash", so to speak.
"Look, I'm not saying for sure that 2022 was stolen, but when we look back, we all remember what a mess it was. It seemed like every day there was a new problem popping up, another news story discovering issues with the election, another lawsuit being filed somewhere. I'm just saying we shouldn't be afraid to ask these questions and look into things, especially something as murky and clear as we all remember that election was.".
She's sowing seeds of doubt. It's pretty clear how this tactic works. Then, in a year or two, she can say.
