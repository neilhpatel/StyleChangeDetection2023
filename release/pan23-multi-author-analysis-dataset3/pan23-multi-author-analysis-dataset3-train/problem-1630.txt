A lot of former swing states are now solid red (Ohio, Florida) or solid blue (Colorado, New Mexico). But there are also a lot of new swing states that used to be solid red or blue, like Georgia and Pennsylvania.
I'm in a blue island in a state that has pretty much solidified red this season. Despite being AFAB and a religious minority, I'm staying to fight. I drive people to the polls during early voting and have signed up to be a poll worker next election. And I do want to remind everyone that Ohio's district maps were rejected by the court multiple times and they still didn't fix them so the fact that it was as close as it was for Ryan gives me hope that if we can actually push through legal election maps there is a chance to bring it back. But it's going to be a long, tough road.
Absolutely agree on all of your points, but it may be for the best if they don't figure it out. The best I've been hoping for is that they realize that open fascism isn't a great selling point but then again I've never voted for one of them in my life and have no plans to start.
Other plus side on the Ohio side if DeWine keeps botching up so bad with his hardline anti-abortion stance, the presidential years are going to be a heavy turnout.
What's sad is that if voter turnout was better, this could have probably been a bloodbath for Republicans. My state, WV, is likely going to break its previous record for worst voter turnout with only 18-22% of eligible people voting.
