NAL. Answering your question...Maybe? It is possible to have a loan be in one person's name, but all the property owners have to sign allowing it---not all owners have to be on the loan necessarily.
Why are you on the deed (i am assuming that is what you mean by "on the house")? Is there a mortgage currently & are you on that? Did you help buy this house? These questions are largely irrelevant to the bigger question, though. I mean, even if the loan is only in your parents name, if they default (or they pass away before the loan is paid), there will be a lien on property that you own (fully or partially depending on how it is recorded) & would need to be paid even if it isn't in your name. If this isn't paid off, the property could go into foreclosure. If the house goes to auction & doesn't get enough to pay off the loan(s), then you would be responsible for the difference, plus a foreclosure on your credit.
Signing onto the mortgage would mean that you agreed to your property being put up as collateral, but if you donâ€™t sign the note than your not going to be personally liable for the loan outside of the property and mortgage.
I wouldn't advise that you be on a mortgage or home equity loan with your parents because it would wreck your debt to income ratios for any loans you wanted for yourself. But there is no reason not to believe that they are doing exactly what they say and taking the loan in their names only.
It should be very obvious at the closing if you're on the loan or not. When I would close loans with a third party I would literally separate things into three piles " these are the documents for the loan that parents need to sign" "this document says that as a co owner you authorize your parents to take a loan using the house as collateral" and "these are the documents you all need to sign so we can record the loan with the county".
