I get tired of saying this, but we need to get away from fossil fuels. I know we produce a lot, but we need to get away from it and tell Saudi to go fuck themselves.
If people are curious why we still deal with Saudi Arabia even after all the shit they do...it is for this reason.
Saudi Arabia is an important regional actor and a leader within the . Therefore China needs to be a good friend with SA to have a good relationship with OIC.
China has friendly relationship with Saudi Arabia (and Iran) for many decades now. And given the current geopolitical conditions: Russian-Ukraine war, Sanctions/Price-Cap on Russian oil , therefore China needs a more stable/back-up energy source. SA almost always a top 1 or 2 energy source for China, therefore China needs to maintain a good relationship with SA.
SA invests way more in Europe and USA than in China and now with USA/Europe is pulling investments from China, so Xi wants/needs SA to divert some of their investments toward his country.
In the past many decades, operating under its Mutual Non-Interference policy, China have not threatened SA or interfered in SA's internal affair.
