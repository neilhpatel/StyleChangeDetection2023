He's doing this because as a free Swede, it's his right free speech, including burning the Koran. He's trying to agitate and prove that Islam and it's intolerant followers have no place in modern Sweden/Western Europe. Unfortunately, the violent backlash from the Swedish Muslim community is proving him right.
There is however a limit to how much contempt you can express against swedes, muslims and turks before it's considering inciting hatred against that group.
The distinction is drawn between the population group and the entity which is associated with them. For example, it's legal to say whatever you want about Sweden and Turkey and to burn their respective flags. Likewise, it's legal to insult any religion and burn their symbols.
If they want to burn our flag or a bible go ahead, at most youl get some angry tweets. Think there are few religions in the modern world that is as hateful and zealous as Islam and their nations.
Okay, hereâ€™s an example of the kind of shit hundreds of Muslims will do to you if you criticise or insult their religion in some way.
People have been sentencted many times for inciting hatred against muslims. There is no double standard.
