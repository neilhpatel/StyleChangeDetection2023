I legitimately love Wisconsin should be fairly obvious by my user name. I am seriously looking at jobs both on the coasts and in the twin cities because if we actually elect Michels and/or give the Republicans a super majority we are fucked. I've come to terms that RJ is likely going to get re-elected unfortunately but if either of the other two happen Wisconsin is done as a state.
A paid federal holiday would not hurt people. I personally did early voting because I think there is going to be intimidation at the polls and I just didn't want to deal with it.
Fingers are crossed, but honestly the early vote total aren't enough to make up for what people are seeing with the current in person exit poll results.
To be fair, if they have never voted before the polling doesn't know they exist. Also, if Republicans died of covid in greater numbers because they believed disinformation, the polling models can't account for missing demographics that the now obsolete census data tells them still exists.
The fact that Republican biased polling firms are deliberately releasing a bunch of polls that are extremely skewed isn't helping things either, especially given the propensity of Republicans now to reject election results that don't favor them.
