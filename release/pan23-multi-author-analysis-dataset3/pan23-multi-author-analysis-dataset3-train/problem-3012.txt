Since the series starts >a few days before Wild Bill Hickock died< That puts the start of the show in 1876, after the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869.
Deadwood was established in the 1870s after the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869. One would take rail service to Omaha and then a shortline north. In the early days, it would then be necessary to take a stagecoach to reach Deadwood, but the trip would be relatively short.
As u/itsallfolklore says, it'd be a quick ride from the local rail station to Deadwood. If you would like an idea of what a long stagecoach journey was like, one account that's classic- and easy to find- is Mark Twain's of his 1861 with his brother from St Joseph, MO to Carson City, NV in Roughing It. It was cramped , dusty, and the swaying motion would make people seasick. The food at the stops- what there was- was awful, and there would be places - like where there was deep mud or sand- where the passengers had to get out and walk to lighten the load. Twain and his brother were armed ( with a useless "pepperbox" revolver) , in case of attempted robbery, but there was none. Even Twain's writing can't disguise the fact that it was, really, just a very long, tedious trip.
a pepperbox likely very similar to the one Twain brought along. As the trigger is pulled, the hammer is lifted and the barrel turned, and when one comes to the top, the hammer drops and that barrel is fired.
