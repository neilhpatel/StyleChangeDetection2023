I basically told the court I need the funds in the estate to pay for the fees but can’t get the life insurance until I’m named head of the estate. It’s all so frustrating and not easy for people who are grieving.
They were the beneficiaries on each other’s life insurance...not thinking they would die at the same time. The only way to receive those funds are to become the head of the estate.
In that case just find a lawyer that will file the paperwork for a fee paid from the estate. Just get one that charges a flat fee or hourly fee and not one that wants a percentage of the estate. With life insurance money there is a pretty much guaranteed payout so you shouldn't have a problem finding a lawyer that will take payment once life insurance pays out instead of up front payment.
If someone else is the beneficiary on the life insurance policy, they're the one entitled to the money & you becoming the executor won't change that.
If you are the named beneficiary on the life insurance, you should get that regardless of anything else.
Are you the named beneficiary on the life insurance policies? If so becoming head of the estate has nothing to do with that. Life insurance is handled outside of the estate. Just contact the life insurance company and provide them with the appropriate documentation (death certificate etc).
