3,232 It's thought that Ernest Hemingway killed himself because nobody believed him that he was under consant FBI surveillance. This surveillance later turned out to be true. Just how many people was the FBI surveilling during the red scare years?
2,863 In Peanuts, an unseen adult character is shown to GREATLY overreact to the institution of zip codes. Was this reflective of a real thought process that people had at the time or just something that Charles Schulz thought was funny?
2,174 It Wasn't About Slavery: Exposing the Great Lie of the Civil War by Sam W. Mitchum Jr, historians thoughts?
Please let me know if you have suggestions to make this roundup better for /r/askhistorians or if there are other subreddits that you think I should post in. I can search for posts based off keywords in the title, URL and flair. And I can also find the top comments overall or in specific threads.
I occasionally see posts in this sub and I wish I could read other non-expertsâ€™ thoughts about the topic.
Am I the only one who would love to have a little space carved out in each thread for non-expert discussion?
Just my two cents: aren't threads like this the place for chit chat? I don't think every question needs this. Not sure any question would really benefit from it.
