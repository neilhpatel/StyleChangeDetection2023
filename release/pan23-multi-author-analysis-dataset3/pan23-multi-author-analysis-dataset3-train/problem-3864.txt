I would absolutely agree - that being said, the later oral traditions, particularly Eiriks saga rau√∞a, does provide the actual source for this association, if we do a LOT of interpolations.
Sciapods are one of the Plinean races, i.e. the monstrous peoples who Pliny the Elder describe as living on the margins of the world, particularly in Africa. On Sciapods, he says.
This is wrong - what's most likely going on is that the author of Eiriks saga is deliberately introducing beings from a learned Classical tradition to Vinland so that Greenland, by comparison, appears far more integrated into the Christian cultural space. But that is almost certainly where the article gets the idea from.
The logic goes - if Sciapods are from Ethiopia, and the Icelandic oral tradition places on in Vinland, then therefore they must have thought that Vinland was connected to Ethiopia!
"South from Greenland, there is Helluland (Rocky Land), then there is Markland (Forest Land), where there is not a long way to Vinland the good, which some men reckon is connected to Africa.".
(Added. I remember that I also wrote the similar thing, though with source citations, before in this subreddit:
