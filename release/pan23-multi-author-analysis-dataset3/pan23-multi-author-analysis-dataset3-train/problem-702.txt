I’d also recommend The Second Nuclear Age, which talks a lot about how orthodox nuclear doctrine emerged, and the dangers of not revisiting these questions more now that nuclear weapons have proliferated to many smaller countries.
If you're looking for a comprehensive approach to how nuclear strategy and warfighting thinking evolved, the answer is, Lawrence Freedman, _The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy_. It charts how official doctrines went from "the bomb is just another weapon to destroy cities" through many different phases (including but not limited to Mutual Assured Destruction, which was, surprisingly to most people, just a blip in the 1960s). Along with it I would recommend Nina Tannenwald's _The Nuclear Taboo_, which is about why American presidents in particular _rejected_ nuclear weapons use after World War II — even though many of their doctrines were in favor of using them, and there were situations in which they could be used against non-nuclear powers without imagining similar reprisals (the Korean War, the Vietnam War, etc.).
