The reality is Sweden and Finland already have security assurances from the US and other NATO countries, so in more ways than not they're already in NATO. The US and the rest of NATO have all the time in the world to pressure Turkey to give its vote, there's no real urgency to do it fast.
Edit: Yes, I get it, Ukraine had security assurances too, Trump didn't uphold previous agreements, blah blah. They're in the European Union which has its own mutual defense agreement and even though it's not in the EU, Norway would absolutely not tolerate Russia invading Sweden or Finland.
If just Finland entered NATO, I as a Swede would feel pretty protected seeing the issues Russia have projecting power with a land border and an allied country as a neighbour.
If I remember correctly Finland and Sweden already signed separate defense pacts with at least the UK and possibly others before they submitted their bids to join NATO, for this exact reason. Aside from that, except for the holdouts, all other NATO nations (including the three independently nuclear-armed ones) have said, formally, "yes we want to enter a mutual defense treaty with Finland and Sweden.
But if Sweden and Finland are not formally in NATO, then NATO members have no actual obligation to them should anything happen. The only way to get around Turkey (or Hungary, which can also block membership still) would be for each other individual NATO member to sign treaties with Sweden and Finland to consider them as de facto members.
I really, really don't see those countries that have approved membership just going "oh shit you're not officially in NATO yet so good luck" if Russia were to launch an opportunistic attack on Finland. Article 5 requires mutual defense of full NATO members, but equally nothing in the treaty prevents its members from unilaterally defending anyone else if they so choose.
