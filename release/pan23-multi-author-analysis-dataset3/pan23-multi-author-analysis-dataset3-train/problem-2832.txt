Not as long as he stay hidden like the coward he is. Come to think of it, we all know what happened to another megalomaniac dictator with a mustache in WW II Berlin.
Any gains that was reached after the demise of Soviet Union days are wiped out and when the war end I suspect there will be further breakup in Russia itself before the dust settle.
I believe Ukraine is smart enough to understand that as soon as they give up territory and settle down from the war, Putin is just going to invade again, only this time with a strategic advantage and time to re-arm and train more soldiers.
I expect they're going to try for the same play they had with Crimea; consolidate, wait for the support and attention span of the world to wane as it tends to, and all the while lay the groundwork for starting the whole process over again, death by a thousand cuts.
I really think that is the angle which Putin is playing; depend on the people of the world to fail Ukraine, while holding the suffering of the the Ukrainian people hostage to compel the government to capitulate.
Russia can't win a war of attrition here, they planned for a quick campaign where most of Ukraine capitulated, they signed a quick treaty where they annexed a chunk of Eastern Ukraine to maintain clear access to Crimea and installed their own pro-Russian government in what remains of Ukraine.
Russia might have more people but it is also less stable, the more people are as much a liability as they are an asset, those people need to be heavily policed, the massive land border also needs to be defended so they can't bring all their forces to Ukraine.
