The company alone can make you be vaccinated. There's a question about if OSHA has the authority to mandate it, but that doesn't change the company can decide you need to be vaccinated.
The court cases regarding the mandates affect your employer, in that they may not want to have a vaccination policy and if the mandates are ultimately invalidated in court, they may not have to. However, your employer is always free to have more restrictive rules than the minimum required by laws and regulations.
So basically, your employer's policy is entirely legal and if you are terminated over it you are very short on options. Even if you asked for an exemption and were denied, if they had a defensible policy on granting or denying those exemptions, they would have a strong argument against any discrimination claims you might make.
If you asked for a religious or medical exemption and wrongfully were denied one this might implicate federal employment non-discrimination law. If you just don't wanna get the shot, you would not have a viable claim.
There are some limits on what they can impose on employees (mostly related to non-discrimination), and states sometimes further regulate that sort of thing, but none of those limits are relevant here.
The CMS IFR applies to healthcare workers specifically, rather than the OSHA rule that applies to any employer with more than a certain number of employees. The CMS rule is related to CMS's role in regulating providers that accept Medicare and Medicaid, and so the legal issues with the OSHA rule don't necessarily apply to the CMS rule, since it's based on a different delegation of authority.
