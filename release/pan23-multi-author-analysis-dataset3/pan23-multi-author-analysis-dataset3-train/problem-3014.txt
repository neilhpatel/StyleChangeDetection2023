She cannot force you to pay, make you pay, for anything at all. You are 17. She can take the money you earn, she can take all of it, but she can't force you to work one job, let alone a second job. Are you still in school, how many hours a week are you working?
Yes, I'm still in school, and it's 30 hours at the first job and roughly 20 at my second. The second is a weekend job, and the first is my weekly job. I go to school Mon-Fri.
I'm not sure that this is a legal issue, but just an unfair situation that she can't escape from. She'll end up working herself to death at this rate, but she's also deeply attached to her siblings and will continue doing what her mom asks just so she can be a part of their lives.
This is her boyfriend replying(she wanted me to make that clear lol) I said this to the other person in the comments, but she'll keep her away from her siblings. My girlfriend lives with her grandparents in the same town as the first job, whereas her family all live in the town with the second job. I'm not so sure that this is a legal issue, so much as it's an unwinnable situation for her. I'm just looking for help where I can get it.
Thanks, i'm just looking for a way to help her and didn't really know where to look. I wasn't sure if this could potentially be a legal issue, but I appreciate the help regardless.
