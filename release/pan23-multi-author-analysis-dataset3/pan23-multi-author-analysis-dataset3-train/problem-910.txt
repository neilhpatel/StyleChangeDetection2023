As did I, got out in time to retain EU rights in Denmark. Brexit was such an engineered, self-inflicted catastrophe it destroyed whatever hope I had left of the UK recovering to its former glory, where it had some semblance of caring for it's people.
What I find bizarre is that the Conservatives are still in power after driving the UK economy into recession, pro-Brexit for 20 years, electing leaders that were an embarrassment.
An analysis by Bloomberg Economics three years after Britain left the European Union paints a bleak picture of the damage done by the way the split has been implemented by the Conservative government.
Brexit is costing the UK economy Â£100 billion a year ($124 billion), with the effects spanning everything from business investment to the ability of companies to hire workers.
Interestingly, the blackhole in the finances discussed last year was around the same as the estimated losses to the wider economy through Brexit.
Brexit had already cost the country more inside 3 years of the vote, than the entirety of our payments into the EU over our 45 year membership.
