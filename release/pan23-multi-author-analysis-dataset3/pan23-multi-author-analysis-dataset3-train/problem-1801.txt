So first thing's first, it is entirely possible that some ancient humans made it to Antarctica (or the landmass that would become Antarctica) but any evidence that proves their existence is undiscovered as of right now. We know that once upon a time \260 million years ago there was a forest on Antarctica so there was almost certainly more diverse life there than what is seen now. However, much like the forest that was once there, any human or early human life that did exist on the continent either died off or moved elsewhere; perhaps the indigenous people of the pacific islands could even be descendants of Antarctic humans.
While Antarctica probably could have supported a native population, it just didn’t; it’s a bit of moot point to ask why when there are examples of perfectly habitable islands that were never permanently inhabited prior to European exploration (e.g. Azores, São Tomé).
Antarctica is more often analyzed from an economic and geopolitical point of view. However, we can take a historical perspective. Antarctica was explored primarily for economic purposes; people did want to make money and settle there. Yet economic activity on that continent today is very limited, mostly fishing and tourism. There is a lack of resources that any nation has found worthy of exploitation and transport off of the continent. (“With no native population, Antarctica is far from labor markets and from the markets to which any minerals would need to be transported for final consumption.”) The climate and hostile geography is a huge impediment; there are extreme katabbatic winds that blow throughout the continent and 98% of its surface is covered by ice. As the planet warms, things may change, of course...
An aspect of Antarctica’s history that you should consider is the extensive overfishing of its waters. Governments eventually stepped and enforced curbs on Antarctic fishing, diminishing economic activity in the area.
