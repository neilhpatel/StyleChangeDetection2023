For the most part, the goal of battle in general to intimidate the enemy into running away or surrendering. Europe was in no way the exception. As /u/Iphikrates outlines and , the way the famous Spartans took great steps into intimidating their enemies, including through propaganda and dress, to make their enemies run away or even not fight at all. Against enemies who don't get intimidated, the Spartans don't actually have any exceptional track records.
Besides the answers already here, I also want to point out that European warfare was as much about intimidation as everyone else.
Finally, I need to mention that while the conquistadors punched above their numerical weight during the conquest of what is now Latin America, it was the native polities themselves who did the heavy lifting in that conquest, not the conquistadors.
I would say that the Spanish reputation for "taking no prisoners" probably comes from their war against the Tlaxcalans, the battle of Otumba and the Siege of Tenochtichlan.
In the battle of Otumba, the Spanish were in an even worse situation, if you can believe. They were a beaten force, cut off from supplies and reinforcements, desperately trying to break out of encirclement. Again, not an ideal situation to take prisoners.
