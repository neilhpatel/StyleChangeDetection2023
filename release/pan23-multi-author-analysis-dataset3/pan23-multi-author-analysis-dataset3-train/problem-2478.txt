My wife works for an insurance company owned by Nippon Life. The exec team and half the senior management are all Japanese and come down for 2 years at a time. As she's also senior management she works with them and she tells me that she can tell the Japanese managers feel conflicted because they know the work-life balance is better here in Australia but they don't want to be seen as doing anything different than they would back in Japan because they will pay for it when their term here ends.
From what little I know about this in Japan, women that get married/pregnant are often quasi-forced out of the workforce because the expectation is that they will retire to become stay-at-home-moms, or just not hired to begin with to avoid paying a worker that "will leave anyways". This apparently happens to professional women, even.
Therefore, one of the reason Japanese women aren't getting married/having kids is that they don't want to lose the careers that they worked hard for.
Indeed, women in Japan have to make the choice about a career or having kids. Having both is hard as child care is tricky and companies do not support work life balance. The pandemic has helped force the work culture to start changing away from the drinking parties after work but still ways to go.
Work culture in general is meh but there are major societal changes in the works. COVID basically murdered the drinking culture part and doesn't look to be recovering. Can go on for a real long time on everything Japan does right. Overall I had a pretty decent life there and I'm glad my kids got to be born there.
Also general observations. The cost of living in Tokyo and Osaka is cheap in comparison with comparable US or European cities. This is a myth that perpetuates from the bubble times and never got updated with the last 25 years of development.
