6,228 I'm currently studying the "rise" of the Third Reich, and I cannot for the life of me understand the why's and how's of Adolf Hitler's supposed "charisma." Can somebody give me some insight?
Thank you for your insight. What you said it's true and I agree with it. Depiction in games can be very damaging by reinforcing false conceptions of history. As someone who primarily studies Islamic and Ottoman history, I feel that though the main point of contention being mostly media such as movies and books rather than games per se.
Anyway, one time he was approached by a lecturer and asked "So why did you enter History?" He answered, "I'm interested in military history." The lecturer then proceeded to laugh him off, followed by the entire class laughing, and then said "You played too many games. You entered the wrong major.".
This is very true and an interesting point to make in this context. However, it does need to point out that the representations in games can be very wrong and that while it is all well and interesting to be awakened to the joys of history through video games, the discourse surrounding the representation of history in said games can reinforce incorrect (and in some cases damaging) understandings of history. Not everyone who is interested in history becomes a history undergrad, after all. It's a subject that is dear to my heart as I am currently writing a book on it (Kempshall is my editor!).
