Some coffee of course was available, since it could fetch a grand prize for a blockade runner able to get through, although in turn it meant that the real stuff was generally out of the hands of the typical boy in butternut. At least a few unscrupulous businessmen in the North were party to this, since they knew they could get a much better price from the Confederates. Charles Lynch of the 18th Connecticut recalled coming upon a Confederate wagon train, and its contents being distributed:
Lynch and his comrades might have been being unfair, as the Confederates also got their hands on Northern stores in the same way the 18th had gotten the Southern ones, but even with that assistance though, coffee remained the greatest of luxuries. Blockade runners could only bring in a trickle, and production as a whole in the war period was dropping, which only hurt the consumer more. Supposedly, small breast pins in the war years would be set with a coffee bean instead of a diamond by Southern jewelers, the wearer showing off they could get a hold of the product, which was quickly becoming worth a small fortune. Relative to their pre-war price in 1860, in a city like Richmond or Charleston, the amount of coffee that $1.30 would have purchased in April, 1861, would have cost $4.5 a year later as the blockade became more effective, and $142 after two more years of conflict, and likely considerably pricier still once one went to more rural parts of the South. Although the Confederate Army had tried to include it in the rations at first, the scarcity and ever rising price meant that it was dropped by 1862, and a year later, in the Army it was ordered only to be provided "as a stimulant for medicinal purposes".
Now, in the pre-war regular army, each soldier was issued a coffee and sugar ration, ever since Andrew Jackson ordered that these replace the whiskey ration in 1832. When war broke out and the ports were effectively shut down the Confederate army could not find enough coffee, and units began looking for alternatives to coffee.
