I know he definitely doesn't have the $6k, but I wasn't sure if they could give him a timeframe to pay it back. Would he really get away with it with no consequences at all?
Also, I don't live there, but I haven't told the landlord yet as the 2 people who aren't allowed to be there are still there. After everything that happened with all 3 of them, I don't really care what happens on their end (eviction, etc), but I don't want to get in trouble for them being there, so I haven't said anything yet to the property management company.
2- Not yet. The lease isn't up until April, but I will obviously not be signing if they choose to renew.
Just get ready to let your landlord know that you have 0 intentions to renewing the lease come april, you will have to let them know atleast 30 days in advance that you wont renew. You can find template letters on what to say in regards to not renewing lease, make sure to send by certified mail and any other forms of communication you see fit. But certified mail must be done to cover yourself legally.
2- were you legally removed from the lease of the unit? as in, the roommate signed a new lease without your name on it.
1- you can take him to small claims, and if you win a judgment will be placed against him to repay you; whether or not he has the funds to pay is the question if its worth it to proceed with it all. If its worth it to you simply based off principle then file away.
1. probably not if he couldnt pay his share while living there, doubt he has the $6k to make you whole.
2- just remember you're not off the lease until the roommate signs a new lease without your name on it, even if it doesnt get renewed, the lease will convert to a month-to-month lease with you still tied to the unit.
