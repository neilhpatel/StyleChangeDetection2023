Bananas are an excellent example of why genetic monoculture farming is problematic over the long term. First the gros michel banana dominated, but a blight hit it and wiped out the world's gros michels. Then the cavendish banana took its place, but a blight hit it and wiped out the Old World's cavendish bananas, and now that blight has crossed the Atlantic.
Commercial banana plants are propagated asexually. Which makes their successive collapses a good illustration of genetic monoculture weakness.
I'm not ideologically opposed to genetic splicing. Yet with the current implementation and legal framework, patentable GMOs are basically setting up major staple crops for a similar collapse.
Whether the patents are BS or not, the law is the law, and knowingly & massively violating seed restrictions over tens or hundreds of thousands of hectacres of farmland is going to get you in trouble. Just like if a company reproduces a patented drug, they're going to be sued.
Exactly... and the idea that it is harmful to the environment is also not founded in any science. Farmers are incentivized to keep their farmland and the environment healthy for centuries and beyond. There's somehow this deep conspiracy that big ag would damage the environment for short-term profits, but the reality is that farmers incentives are aligned with the very environmentalists that vilify them. Farmers need their land in the long-term, so they will do whatever they can to keep it sustainable.
It's true that 'small farmers' (less than 100,000 acres) may not plan in 50 year horizons. Multinational corporations that have been around for centuries definitely do... part of the reason why it makes sense for farmland to be aggregated to fewer decision makers.
