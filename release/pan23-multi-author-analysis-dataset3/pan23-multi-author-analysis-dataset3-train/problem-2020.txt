What is the legislative minority supposed to do? This isn’t happening in states where Democrats have authority to prevent it. In these red states, Democrats can make floor speeches or hostilely question the supporting witnesses, but they can’t stop a hearing from happening or a bill from passing.
Wait, are you saying that Democrats are wrong for being mad at conservatives for passing bigoted legislation that doesn't affect most voters and for fighting nonsense faux outrage bait culture wars?
Conservatives outlaw lifesaving trans medical interventions, democrats get reasonably upset because people are being stripped of their rights, and you're saying democrats are the bad ones here for pointing it out?
Republican legislators are NOT going to read a Washinon Post article pointing out their hypocrisy, and suddenly wake up and say "Wait - the voters don't like this We're actually...wrong. We need to shape up".
We need to wake up. Democrats in power aren't doing anything because they are friends with GOP criminals and they do not want to help us. They had the Presidency and both Houses of Congress for years and didn't even legalize weed or protect Roe v Wade.
