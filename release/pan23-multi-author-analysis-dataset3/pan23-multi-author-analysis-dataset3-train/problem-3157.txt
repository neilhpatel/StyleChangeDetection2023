I mean, it's not my fault your friend caused damage to another's property and you're weirdly invested in him not having to pay.
Your friend isn't going to get out of this without having to either pay out of pocket, or by making a claim through his insurance.
The insurance isn't for the other guy, your friend insures themselves. I would file a claim but it's up to your friend.
He doesn't have to do anything except let his insurance handle it for him. A police report is often not necessary for undisputed things so that has nothing to do with anything.
And if the guy wants more money than he's prepared to pay, well, this is why you carry liability insurance. Let his insurance deal with it.
If your friend pays the guy directly IMO it would be wise to write up a little agreement that states this is payment in full for damages to the car, etc. Ideally I'd get an attorney to write it up but that will add to the costs, so, at least get SOMETHING. Details about what happened, a copy of the estimate.
