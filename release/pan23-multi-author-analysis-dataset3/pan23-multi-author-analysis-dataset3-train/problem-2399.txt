Putin might actually be the richest man in the world so he can easily afford that. If he wasn't he would also probably just murder the doctor's family and worse until the treatment was "free".
Treating a mass murderer is one thing, but what about a doctor who refuses to perform an abortion even when a patients life is at risk? What about a doctor who deliberately kills those accused of heinous crimes?
I wouldn't question a Doctor following his Hippocratic Oath. We ask soldiers to kill, we shouldn't demand it from healthcare professionals. Do you want justice? speak with the courts.
That wasn't really the point I was making. I'm not saying he should be made healthy to face trial. In a civil society we place certain responsibilities on different roles. We expect a doctor to remain neutral and put their beliefs to one side and treat anyone who needs medical care.
With that said, I don't think doctors should refuse treatment to people because they don't agree with he/she has done. That's not the doctor's job, and it's also a slippery path. Heroism and righteousness to one side is genocide and war crime to the opposite side - I'm sure a lot of muslims view the west the same way as ukrainians view Russia.
I doubt Putin will do anything even if a doctor refuses. What putin needs is a doctor that he can trust, if he kills whatever doctor that refuses to treat him, there is a much higher chance he will end up a doctor who doesn't want to be there and do a shit job treating him, because no one will say no.
But yes, every doctor should still treat him, otherwise you're creating an idiotic precedent where a doctor can refuse to treat someone due to personal beliefs/morals.
