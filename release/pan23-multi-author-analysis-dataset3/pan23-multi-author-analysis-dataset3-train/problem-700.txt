A lot of times they can file a motion to move the case from small claims court to circuit court so that they can defend you in the matter.

IAL, seen some wild complaints that dont fly and people freaking out about being sued and paying easy $$$$ to lawyers.
As another contributor wisely noted, NY as well as many other states DO allow attorneys to represent you in small claims courts. But yes I’d be curious to see what this guy’s legal basis for damage is (and if he is represented by counsel) since based on your facts he was clearly trespassing on your private property conspicuously marked as private by the way of locked gates. Consulting an attorney beforehand would be wise but if this guys just pulling shit out of his ass (anyone can sue for anything) you might not even need to “retain” an attorney—just consult and do some research.
On second thought, def talk to a lawyer about this idiot trying to capitalize on this idiotic incident he is responsible for while trying to what i can only imagine as stealing shit. Insurance fraud, TRO, nuisance etc may be on the table as well depending on the specific facts.
