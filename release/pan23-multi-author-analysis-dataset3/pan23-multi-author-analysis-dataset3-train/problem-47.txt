Remember that Simpsons episode where Lisa found out that the entire backstory of the town founder was a fraud, and instead of telling everyone the truth, she was convinced to let them keep their delusions because those delusions made them feel good? That episode really did reflect the way a lot of people feel about the truth. They just don't think it's that important.
And now we're seeing the exact same mentality play out on a huge scale with the Republican war on "critical race theory", which is literally just telling the truth about how racist America's history is. I don't even know how the idea of systemic American historical racism could be controversial, with slavery and Jim Crow and redlining and sundown towns and the Tuskeegee experiments and all the rest of it.
A lot of people actually think it's better to make people feel good about themselves than to tell the truth.
It's actually even crazier than that- teaching the truth is just teaching the truth. "Critical Race Theory" is actually some PhD level philosophical discussion of the role of race in teaching history. Like it's further away from elementary schools than most Republican congressmen are required to be. (Cheap joke, I know.).
It's funny how little the truth actually matters. Like I lived my life thinking I was subject to the truth but all this time I could have just been like "nuh uh".
