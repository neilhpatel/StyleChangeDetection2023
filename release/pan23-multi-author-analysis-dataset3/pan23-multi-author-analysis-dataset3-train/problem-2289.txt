The thing is, they've all been real. This is how real science actually works: incremental progress, one step at a time, and it almost seems like nothing is changing until you look back on the last 20 years.
Still to go: exceeding the total energy used by the lasers, including waste heat and secondary elements like cooling systems.
Previously, the energy output was greater than the energy absorbed from the lasers, by the hydrogen capsule.
>And although the experiment got more energy out than the laser put in, this did not include the energy needed to make the lasers work - which was far greater that the amount of energy the hydrogen produced.
"And although the experiment got more energy out than the laser put in, this did not include the energy needed to make the lasers work - which was far greater that the amount of energy the hydrogen produced".
Laser energy consumption is greater than the energy of the emitted beam and the energy gained as the result of fusion is greater than the energy absorbed from the beam.
This time, energy output was greater than the total amount of energy input by the lasers, including waste input that didn't get directly absorbed.
> A lot of energy is lost when the laser light is converted into X-rays inside the hohlraum; a large proportion of the laser light instead goes into heating the hohlraum walls.
