I’d much rather my tax money go toward helping people (and by extension, our country) than going into an already-bloated military budget or used to offset the loss of tax revenue from keeping billionaires rich. Too many people don’t realize that raising the floor on the standard of living in this country makes life better for everyone - even if one specific policy doesn’t affect them directly. Economics trickle up, not down.
My school loans are paid off but I’m all about student loan forgiveness. It’s not right to send young people into adulthood in crippling debt simply for getting educated.
Forgiveness isn’t even the right word it’s passing the buck onto responsible Americans who choose to not go to college or paid their debt.
If so, you should understand why someone who has already paid off their loans would like to be included in this forgiveness (issued a tax credit at least).
Yes, it would be better for the 1% to pay their fair share, but it's not necessary for student loan forgiveness to pay dividends in the economy.
You know the two programs are pretty close on price, granted the edge going to student loan forgiveness over a ten year span. Though farm subsidies doubled under Trump after his stupid trade war.
