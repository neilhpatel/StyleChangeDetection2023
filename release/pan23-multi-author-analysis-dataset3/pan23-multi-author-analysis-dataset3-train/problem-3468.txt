This is not legal in the vast majority of locations (including all of the USA), but the what to do is very location dependent. In general the answer is file a wage claim.
What your employer is doing is wage theft, and you can regarding your unpaid wages. If you haven't been already, start keeping careful track of all your clock-in and clock-out times yourself; having a precise record will make it easier to recover the full amount of wages you are owed.
That is definitely a violation of the FLSA (which does allow rounding to the nearest quarter hour, but only if it isn't always done in the employer's favor and doesn't result in employees not being paid for all hours worked over the long term). It is also a violation of Michigan state law; Administrative Rule R408.702(e) requires working time to be "computed to the nearest tenth of an hour, or other finer measure", so even rounding to the nearest quarter hour wouldn't be permitted in your state (and simply hacking off a full 15 minutes whenever the employer felt like it certainly wouldn't be allowed).
