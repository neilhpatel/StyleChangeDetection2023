Anyone who thinks oil and gas companies will voluntarily do anything beyond lip service for preventing climate change is an idiot.
Anyone who thinks oil and gas companies the ruling class will voluntarily do anything beyond lip service for preventing climate change maximizing profit is an idiot.
And no group of politicians in DC will ever get a large enough backing on any bills or laws that will force Oil Corporations to operate accordingly to climate crisis and prevent any further ecological damages….
These corporations are just too large of entities who have thousands of lobbyists and political think-tanks (in DC) working for them to ensure that no one is or ever will be able to stop their continued growth year after year. Sure you’ll get a few times where a company representative or a politician (just to gain public support) say they will ensure that oil corporations will work appropriately and not cause environmental damages, but they all end up ignoring the issues and continuing working all while lying to the voters.
