The only way forward for the GOP is through Donald Trump, which is quite the predicament. On one hand, there's no way they can win with him as their candidate in 2024, but they also have no chance unless he "OKs" a different candidate. If they continue attacking him, he will never support their candidate and if he's not running independently, he will be off to the side trashing whoever the GOP is running and will have an audience. The media will eat that shit up too. Very bad for the GOP.
Outside of his legal woes, he's in a great and powerful position politically, with the GOP as his plaything. If he's not their 2024 nominee either by not running (whether by his choosing or not) or somehow loses in the primaries to someone like DeSantis, they will be begging him to endorse him or at the very least keep his mouth shut. Otherwise you're going to have 20-30% write in ballots for Trump, or his most loyal supporters just won't vote.
And having said that… I think Trump is bad enough that he has actually turned off some GOP voters enough that they won’t vote for him.
I remember thinking trump was going to be the downfall of the republicans back in 2016 during his campaign. He destroyed their establishment… but it mutated into something worse… hopefully it’s finally time for it to self-cannabilize itself.
