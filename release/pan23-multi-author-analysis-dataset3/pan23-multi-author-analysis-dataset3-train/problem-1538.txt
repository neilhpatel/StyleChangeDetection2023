The obvious answer is that they made it easy to swallow and bulletproof. We're not trying to end homophobia with this law, we're trying to protect LGBT and interracial marriages today so that the Supreme Court can't take the right away as they have signalled they will.
This protects every existing gay and interracial marriage in the US as well as protects every gay and interracial marriage in the future. Yes, there is still work to be done to get those other states to allow gay and interracial marriages, but that will either require a social change to vote in better politicians, or a constitutional change to eliminate any gray area with the first amendment.
You misunderstand the law then. States can only ban issuing new marriage licenses. They cannot dissolve existing marriages and they must recognize legal gay and interracial marriages at the state level from other US states, and those recognized federally. This means that states that ban gay marriage still have to fulfill all spousal rights of gay marriages.
And this doesn't even cement marriage equality in every state. If Obergefell is overturned then all it does is force discriminating states to recognize marriages from other states. So queer folk in those states would still be unable to get married without traveling somewhere else.
