No it isn't. There are no official meanings for any of the colors in the US flag. Traditionally (and not until years after the flag was established) there are suggestions that red is for "hardiness and valor.".
I'm just saying. I'm pretty sure the LAPD isn't a governing body and can fuck off. Dumb twats. Why are cops such peices of shit? Like do you just have an asshole gene when you sign up and grows with more pensionable time? Orrrr???
See that’s the thing. They’re liberals too to the core Republican base. It’s the reason trump was so successful. Republicans have been primed to hate the leadership of their party since the southern switch, and the acceptance of the new deal.
It’s even worse. They’re downplaying how conspiratorial it was. The implication was that the gosh damned liberals were lying about POWs and MIA Americans missing in Viet Nam and refusing to bring them home. It’s 80s qanon. And it’s so mainstream your highschool probably flew that flag and they made a goddamn Rambo movie about it.
I’m more invested in the disgusting absurdity of the Rambo sequels because the first one is such a amazing artistic thriller action movie about the lingering affects of the Viet Nam war, the way society treats veterans horribly when they have mental health issues despite idolizing them, and of course police abuse of the homeless.
