Nope. Dude was a guest. Got in as main candidate after actual party leader could not run for bribery charges.
2 was for that plus corruption since several people were obviously taking bribes/throwing civil covid parties.
Kinda, with an extra layer of incompetence at the top. He and his cabinet knew from the get-go that congress was hostile to them yet they couldn't even go 2 months without a major controversy.
He got elected but congress was still controlled by Fujimori (the daughter), he then appointed friends and party members (notably not the ones the party wanted) to his cabinet and there was definitely corruption. They got nothing done so he appointed 3 more cabinets, all same result. Sanctions on Russia pretty much killed the perivian economy so the unions turned on Castillo. Fujimori was going for round 3 on impeachment, so Castillo "dissolved congress" (made illegal last year) and now you're caught up.
Still, that seems like a VERY mild thing to impeach someone three times over, at least compared to shit that other politicians and heads of state do without every getting impeached once.
So, basically, he got impeached for nepotism/cronyism and not getting anything done? Am I reading that correctly?
