This -- If for no other reason, OP should consider that this could really end up costing a lot of money in treatment, if it hasn't already. If a malpractice attorney thinks they could help, it would certainly be beneficial to have at least some of those costs come out of the previous doctor's malpractice insurance rather than OP's pockets.
I'd seriously recommend consulting with a medical malpractice attorney, and if they say they'll take your case (generally they only get paid if you win, and generally they won't take your case if they don't think they'll win more than their services cost, but obviously discuss this) you should go for it.
I have some experience in Med Mal (not giving legal advice, not licensed in your state) and I would recommend a consult with a local Med Mal attorney to discuss the matter further. Please note that malpractice cases are incredibly expensive to litigate. I frequently turn down cases where I believe there has been malpractice, but the damages are simply not high enough to warrant the litigation costs and extensive attorney time required to litigate these cases. If you are going to recover fully, which would of course the be the best outcome for your health, unfortunately your damages may not be high enough to warrant litigation of the matter. But again, you should discuss this with a Utah licensed attorney who practices Med Mal litigation.
As you will undoubtedly hear here, you need to talk to a med Mal attorney in your area. It is a very fact and location specific area of law and youâ€™ll need someone familiar. Document as much as you can and bring to the attorney - screenshot convos, save voice mail, text, email, bills, etc.
