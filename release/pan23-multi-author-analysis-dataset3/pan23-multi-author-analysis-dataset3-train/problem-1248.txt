I have read that by the end of 1941, Britain had sent 466 tanks to the USSR, through the artic convoys, and that the USSR had around 670 tanks for the defence of Moscow (I presume this includes the British tanks used). I was hoping to find out how many of the tanks used were British and what proportion of the USSR tank forces they made up in the defence of Moscow. I have read around 30-40% of the tanks used were British, but I believe this came from an article written by Alexander Hill and I have seen the reliability of the sources he used questioned. Also, of the tanks sent by Britian, were these tanks manufactured in Britain, or did Britain send any American tanks (through lend-lease) to the USSR, as American did not directly lend-lease the USSR until a little later.
Thank you for that response, I heard that Alexander Hill was using unreliable sources when he made some of these articles, is that true or has he corrected this in his revisited article. Many thanks.
