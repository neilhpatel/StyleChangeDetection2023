My instructor reported a UFO and filed paper work and he later found out that the UFO were a bunch of balloons that had little baggies of human ashes in them. I guess some farmer died and they spread half of his ashes in his field and attached some to balloons and let them go.
I took an aviation class in High School and what people dont know is basically a UFO in the aviation world is when a pilot sees something in the sky and cant accurately ID.
Oh yeah UFO’s and UAP’s are extremely common, they’re reported by pilots more often than news articles can even write about. People are simply more interested now due to the Chinese spy balloon incident.
my guess is that many countries are going to see all of this stuff and just start sending spy balloons over people they dont like and then try to blame in on the Chinese or on "hysteria".
You don’t think the military and governments of countries can tell a difference between mylar balloons and craft from different countries? They have some of the highest end air surveillance tools and radar that exist.
