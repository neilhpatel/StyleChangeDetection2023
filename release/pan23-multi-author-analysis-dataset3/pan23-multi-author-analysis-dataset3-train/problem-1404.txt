That kind of assumes the owner had a legitimate reason to place the stand on your property. Trepassing + poaching doesn't cut it. Being that 1.) it was placed illegally, 2.) it was most likely placed for an illegal purpose, 3.) you have no way of identifying the owner to give them notice to remove their property, I'd say you are in the clear. But if you want to be super duper in the clear, post a signed and dated notice on the stand that you will have the unauthorized structured removed in x days. At least 5 days, no more than 30. Take a picture of the notice on the stand for your records. Give a copy of the notice to whoever in city hall handles similar notices for evictions for their records. This fulfills what any obligation "of what a reasonable person would do." After that, do what you want.
P.S. You can get a decent trail camera at walmart for $50. Then you could see who is trespassing and probably get a picture of their license plate if you situate it properly.
In it's place I would leave a note that they were trespassing and to contact DNR to retrieve their stand.
