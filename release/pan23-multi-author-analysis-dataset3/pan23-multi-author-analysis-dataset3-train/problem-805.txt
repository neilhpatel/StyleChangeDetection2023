All of which is to say, I would probably be asking a local lawyer if this surgeon can come after you for the money if they don't get it from your insurance.
Despite this the doctor is the one who wants to be paid so he is offering to arrange for the lawyer to secure payment from the insurer.
I suspect they want to file papers on the op's behalf sueing the insurance company to pay for the bill.
In a lawsuit between a collection's lawyer and your insurance, you seem to be an outside third party to this. Insurance won't pay them, they want insurance to pay. Granted, your coverage has some determining information but why do they need POA over you to get this?
Why do they need POA from you in order to sue your insurance company? This sounds really wonky to me. If they need info from you for the case, they could ask you to give it. IANAL, but I would really hesitate to do this.
I mean, I agree, I feel really hesitant about this for the same reasons. My husband seems to think that this is probably standard practice ("Who has $40k sitting around? They know you don't. They'd rather try and get it from the insurance company.").
They want me to appear at their business and sign in front of a notary. The benefit (from my admittedly layperson's view) seems to be that by granting them the authority to sue my insurance provider, they'll get their money from them. As opposed to making me pay it directly. Obviously, I don't want to be stuck with this enormous bill which will absolutely go to collections--I don't even have 36k in my total savings.
