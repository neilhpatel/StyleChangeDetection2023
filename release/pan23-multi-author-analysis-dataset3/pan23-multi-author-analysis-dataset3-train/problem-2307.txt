There are a number of programs being staged up at the state and federal level to support childcare. The biggest problem we’re having is finding trained and certified workers, so we’re also funding workforce training. Unfortunately, until we can get childcare workers back in the game, costs will likely stay high.
Depends on your local options like Relief Nurseries, childcare co-ops, and STEM Hubs. But for sure, we need more affordable options, especially for middle income families. Just know that there are people organizing and working to make that a reality.
Those who CAN work usually want to work. The issue I see in the USA is there are SO many people who cannot work or can only work in a limited capacity, that we fall back to the “one size does not fit all”.
Right now we are looking at a snapshot where there is a ton of backlog, and most people are back to work. It doesn’t matter the industry you are right, the economy should be on fire. The stock market is looking good, but everything takes gas to make. And now Ukraine.
