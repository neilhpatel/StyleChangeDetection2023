It sounds like there was no will. I just went through this process myself. You need to hire a probate attorney ASAP who will establish an executor of the estate, which is typically the next of kin. Unfortunately the probate process can take months to file the paperwork through the courts, and for them to recognize a personal representative. They should be able to advise you on how to proceed with the landlord.
It sounds like nobody has been appointed executor yet, so at least some of the landlord's choices are defensible. The ultimatum to get his property out by next week is inappropriate, however.
Whoever is appointed executor will likely need to notify the landlord in writing of their intention to enter, and will need to act quickly - in many states, the death of a tenant ends the lease, and the estate's right to recover the deceased's property is similar to the tenant's own right to recover property abandoned at the end of the tenancy.
The landlord should allow the executor of the estate access to the decedent's unit to inventory it and empty it out, but should not be allowing the family of the deceased in without the executor's explicit instruction.
If the landlord inappropriately disposes of the deceased's property, denies the estate access, or otherwise acts to take possession of or to dispose of their things, the estate can sue the landlord, exactly as the tenant could have in life if their landlord kept their things after they moved out. Only the executor of the estate has the capacity to begin legal action on behalf of the estate.
We do not have an executor of the estate. This is the first time we’ve ever experienced something like this, so we didn’t know we needed one. Everything is in his child’s name, and I’m her mother / legal guardian. Can I be the executor?
