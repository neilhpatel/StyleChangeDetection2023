Not to mention the issue of Ukrainian civilians, including numerous children, kidnapped to Russia and scattered. Getting the land back won’t bring them back, and I don’t think Ukraine is going to tolerate throwing them under the bus for Crimea.
Or maybe the vast majority of Ukraine citizens don’t want to negotiate and want to take back their land and get security guarantees from Europe and the US so they don’t need to do this again in 5-10 years.
I could see one depending on what Ukraine would accept, as I don’t think the rest of the world (especially Europe) wants this to continue and potentially turn nuclear.
Ukraine is offered NATO membership and given enough toys and permanent allied support to make any round two a suicide mission on Russia’s part.
Russia would have to keep Crimea. I don’t see Putin surviving if Russia has to give this up, and putting a man with thousands of nukes in a nothing to lose situation would be risky.
Because Putin isn't the only powerful psychopathic wannabe dictator in Russia, he's just the one that made it to the top at that point. Its a precarious position and there is no retirement from his job. He has built his entire presidency on an image of unwavering strenh and brutality, and made his aims to recover the soviet Union territories very public and part of his legacy. Theres no way to back down from that without entirely undermining his entire position.
