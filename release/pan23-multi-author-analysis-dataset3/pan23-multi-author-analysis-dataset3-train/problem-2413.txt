All a commission is, is a statement from the commissioning authority that they are appointed to a position. In the military, this is one of three officer tracks. In civil service, this covers judges, US Marshalls, and other positions.
More importantly to the question, the USPHSCC is a uniformed service due to it being created initially to oversee hospitals for merchant marines, the Coast Guard, and other naval concerns in the US.
The Surgeon General of the US is the head of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps which, like NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, is a Uniformed Service but NOT a military service. Both use the same ranks as the US Navy but are composed of only commissioned officers and are noncombatants. Neither fall under the Department of Defense but rather the Department of Health and Human Services in the case of the Public Health Service and the Department of Commerce in the case of NOAA. Uniforms and ranks alone do not make one a member of the military.
How can you be a commissioned officer but not in the military? Can a civilian be commissioned just to serve as Surgeon General and then go back to private practice?
The first Surgeon General, however, was a surgeon. Woodworth was a military field surgeon and Medical Director in the Union Army.
He specializes in internal medicine, focused on vaccine research and nonprofit management during his prior career.
Even in its early days, however, the position was managerial in nature, involved very little surgery, and Woodworth's early achievements focused on preventing the spread of infectious diseases (yellow fever, cholera, etc.).
This doesn't answer your question, but I think it's important because you asked "why this person is a surgeon" instead of why "surgeon" is in the name of the position.
