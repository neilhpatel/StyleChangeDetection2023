Very soon they will be able to. The West just wants to be certain its weapons aren't the ones that do it for fear of backlash. But I've been working with Ukranians for over 15 years and it's just a matter of time before they can hit the Kremlin/Moscow/St. Petersburg. And honestly, I wouldn't blame them for targeting political and military targets there.
I wouldn’t be surprised if they “bomb” areas of political significance to try an justify further escalation.
100% most likely Russia has a psychological problem that they are trying to fix, and they will pull all the stop to do so.
Putin is in the middle of nowhere with everything he can physically need, so his discomfort will take longer to reflect reality.
Problem for now though is that Putin is actually in a very upscale and isolated bunker, opposed to Hitler's damp and cramped concrete bunker in the middle of Berlin.
Yes, good point. I also wonder if since Putin can stay protected for longer, that a physical illness or assassination attempt could end him too.
Mental breakdown on Putin's part is probably what will happen unlike Hitler who put bullet in his temple.
Granted what Putin is experiencing is very different than what Hitler experienced. Still, just like Hitler, Putin is pretty much on his own alone and most likely trust no one for their "failure" to do what he told them.
