Is it true that the US is generally viewed as neglectful by South Americans rather than antagonistic? Given the many instances of US interference to manipulate Latin American politics in its favor, I'm skeptical of that claim.
Also, the United States rarely takes a firm stance in Latin American issues and is generally viewed as neglectful by many Latin American countries. As detailed by Jeane Kirkpatrick, the United States UN Ambassador at the time:
The perception is that US really does not get that involved as long as it has compliant governments in place. So, spreading democracy or combating human rights isn't something that the US has any consistency in supporting. Those items are only brought up against governments that are generally hostile to US interests.
President Reagan did try to discourage the invasion, but it was unsuccessful. He did make it clear that the US would likely side with the UK in the conflict, but that was taken as a diplomatic, not substantial position of concrete military support by the Argentinian Government.
The treaty certainly did encourage Argentina in that they expected the US to not upset its whole South American strategy to back the UK.
