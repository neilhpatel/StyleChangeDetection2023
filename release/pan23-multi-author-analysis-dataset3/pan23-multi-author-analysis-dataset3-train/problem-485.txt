I remember reading someone say "the biggest mistake we made during the pandemic was telling people the masks were not to protect ourselves, but to protect others".
I wish I could believe you were right, but people really couldn't be bothered to do the minimum (vaccines, masks and distancing) to literally save lives. There might be a few who would go "Oh, I'll change my stance for a child", but I fear the vast majority will just be the same "If it doesn't affect me, I'm not going to alter my behaviors to save other peoples lives.".
I get what you are saying. Iâ€™m in Canada and things seem pretty okay, despite the very vocal minority of anti-measures people. But the fact that COVID-19 became politicized, and not just a health matter, is problematic and worrying for future pandemics.
Also, the biggest issue with COVID initially were the reports coming out of China - they were VERY inconsistent. Some Chinese officials were saying, "Hey, take this seriously", and others were saying, "It's not a big deal". The ones saying it's no big deal were too worried about being alarmist and going to prison for delivering bad news. Some of the ones who were saying it's a big deal were told to STFU or else.
I think there's a paradox with COVID: It wasn't dangerous/deadly enough for people to take it seriously. Yeah, we saw old, sick people die in the thousands, but young people mostly suffered a scratch.
Whereas something like Ebola that REALLY fucks people up and is gruesome AF to deal with, would make people want to take it serious. Late-stage Ebola is fucked, and the most humane solution is a gas chamber.
A pandemic like Ebola would make A LOT of politicians say, "fuck it. We don't care about feelings. We aren't going out like that".
