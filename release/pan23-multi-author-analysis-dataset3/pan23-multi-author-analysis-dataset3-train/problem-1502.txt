OP, I am very sorry, but I need to lock your post now because you are starting to get some iffy advice and off-topic comments, and there is very little that people here are going to be able to tell you.
I am incredibly sorry for your loss, and wish you the best. Do not be shy to come back and ask us for more help if anything else arises that you are confused about. Take care.
Remember to take care of yourself as well. This is a very overwhelming time, and you shouldn't feel ashamed if you think you need to look into counseling to work through it. There are many free clinics out there that provide counseling services. You may be able to get more information when talking to the Hospital Social Worker.
As others have said, speaking with a social worker is the best option to get info needed for your state.
Anything you sign, or in regards to her estate make sure you get a copy as well and keep it organized, sadly the process can drag on.
You are not responsible for any of your mothers debt or bills, companies and collections may try to get you to pay as " next of kin" and will start tying fast, any payment would come from her estate. So if she owes $500 to visa, but her cash funds are $5 they don't get paid. Never sign anything in regards to her Owings.
Do NOT sign anything over saying you will take care for your mother’s debts. Her estate is what handles everything. Do NOT do it.
I’m sorry to hear that OP. I went through the same thing recently but I had people and siblings who were all able to take care of it. I don’t have much advice but I want you to know that you should really listen to a lot of these comments, they are extremely correct, especially the one about debts.
