Seems like a reasonable compromise to me. Demilitarization of Crimea prevents Russia from staging another invasion from there and Ukraine keeps its eastern land, but I would expect Ukraine would need more security assurances from the West and Russia.
Giving up Crimea is a non starter; regardless of what most of you here want to believe, plus there are still issues with the Crimean water supply, and would Putin give up his land bridge to Crimea which depends on holding parts of south eastern Ukraine?
The alternative for Russia is endless further bloodshed (which they don't care too much about), losing the rest of the fighting capability of the military (which they might care about a bit), and ultimately likely losing Crimea if Western support continues.
Their headline is that Putin has been offered terms for surrender by "The West" because the Russian narrative shifts daily between them battling Nazis, NATO, Jews, and homosexuals, but the first bullet-point in the article says:
Considering I just read that the UN is looking at how to work out reparations and russia is losing on the battlefield the only real negotiation would be the turn over of war criminals.
