As someone who also represents clients with mental health issues in and out of court routinely in personal injury and criminal law, I can assure you that nothing trump has said deserves institutionalisation.
As someone who litigates competency cases, if one of my clients said what Trump did in a hearing they’d be getting institutionalized. Not an ounce of doubt about it.
This is why it is absolutely crucial that Trump be prosecuted for his crimes and punished harshly. If there are no consequences for insurrection, then there is nothing to dissuade the delusional, fascist idiots in the GOP from continuing their heinous attacks on America.
Truer words have never been spoken. All the more so because poor folks often can’t afford, or don’t have access to, alternative treatment that a judge would consider in lieu of a state facility. This whole thing hits home; recently had a client committed for insisting- on the record and against counsel obviously- that she was the president.
Though most of us, fortunately, can recognize Trump’s screeching as absolute nonsense, the reality is that it has serious and insidious implications. Make no doubt, Trump- and the GOP that continues to support and host him- are actively undermining democracy and the rule of law by continuing to confuse and chip away at the their constituents’ faith and understanding of the law and electoral system. There are many idiot rube conservatives who hear this and believe that, since Trump said it, it must be true.
But regarding Trump, hyperbole becomes a sober statement of fact. The world will be a vastly better place once this fucking cockroach is dead.
