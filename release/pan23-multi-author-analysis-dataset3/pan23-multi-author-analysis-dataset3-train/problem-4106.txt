It's possible, but unlikely. Just this Kim tested a strategic, nuclear-capable ICBM that can hit targets in mainland USA. The current fear is that NK is already working on miniaturized warheads for tactical nukes to be placed on short-range missiles.
To my knowledge they have nukes, but not nukes small enough to fit on a warhead (no means of delivery). Being able to manufacture warheads is what would make them a nuclear weapon state, but I could be wrong.
USA is already against more countries getting nuclear weapons. They won’t add to the pile by asking more allies to get nuclear. That would also lead to other countries trying to get themselves nuclear weapons.
This isn’t about denying that NK has nuclear weapons. It’s about whether NK should benefit from the rights enjoyed by other accepted nuclear weapons states. For example, accepted nuclear weapons states (NWS) don’t have to worry about international sanctions being applied against them just because they have nukes. NWS in theory can join groups like the Nuclear Suppliers Group, participate in international organizations as a NWS and debate nuclear issues there, and otherwise fear no opprobrium from other countries just because they have nuclear weapons. The G-7 is saying they won’t accept NK as a normal NWS.
