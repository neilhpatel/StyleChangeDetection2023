I imagine the Iraq Iran war, and the invasion of Kuwait, would have turned out much differently if Iraq had become a nuclear power.
It is funny how most of the world was pro-Iraq (including both the US and the USSR) in this war, with Israel being among the few who did something beneficial to Iran instead.
Not only this, but Iran also shared with Israel its intelligence (gathered when Iran did a partially successful airstrike on the same reactor a year ago), according to at least one source. Israel used this information to complete the job, coming from the unexpected western direction, as most of Iraq military was facing the East - Iran.
'What will Russia do" - well, for starters it seems to be giving Iran Su-35 jets, something of a deficit. Another thing it could give is S-400. Third, well.. you know. If Iran keeps graciously supplying them with drones, and decides to throw in some ballistic missiles, like Russians would want, who's to prevent Russia from simply giving them some nuclear weapons, instead of going the long way to develop their own? Good relations with the West? I guess only inconvenience of the risk that the West will transfer Ukraine a nuclear weapon then.
And having more nukes in the world somehow therefore makes the risk of incident... less?? And that's before considering Iran's support for Hamas and such.
It is even more absurd for the pro Palestine people here to not support that. Wtf do you thing is going to happen to their precious land after a nuke?
The government is full of fanatics who torture their own people and is on the verge of collapse anyway, make it obviously very unpredictable and dangerous. Those people will have nothing to lose anymore.
