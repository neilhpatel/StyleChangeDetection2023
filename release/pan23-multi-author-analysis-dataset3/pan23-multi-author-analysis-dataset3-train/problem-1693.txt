He was jailed because he's name keep it popping up on plea bargains, of top executives of constructions company involved in "petrolao scandal" , so was understand that he knew about bribery,kickback from government contractor and did nothing.
Thing is people seem to think he got out of jail because the judge was biased, reality he was out a jail for a good year before the news broke of the "biased judge" , and he was out because the Supreme Court made a never before seem interpretation of the law so Lula could be freed.
Yet Lula still has 6 charges of corruption pending, which are paused until 2026 cause he got elected president.
He off course appeal that conviction 3 times(that I remember) , each time his guilty verdict was upheld.
Then it went to the appeal court, WHICH UPHELD THE VERDICT. Then the Supreme Court said the original court had no jurisdiction over the matter, which annulled the whole process.
My man, the cases werenâ€™t thrown out, they were annulled by the Supreme Court on the basis of jurisdiction. Meaning, none of the evidence was ever denied.
