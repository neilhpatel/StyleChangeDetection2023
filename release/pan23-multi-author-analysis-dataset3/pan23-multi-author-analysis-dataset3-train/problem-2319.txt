But has anyone tried shooting at the hurricanes or maybe dropping a nukular bomb on them? That could work, I don't know. But many people are saying it.
This is very true. But, it makes the point even more real. The MAGA’s denial and misinformation campaign is deadly. Just like their denial of global warming, which to me is worse than Covid, because there is no vaccine or anywhere to hide.
“But when I type in “Covid vaccine causes death” Google brings up tons of information about how the Covid vaccine causes death and NOTHING ELSE!”.
“Except that there’s tons of misinformation online and just look at where all of these results are coming from…essentialoilswillsaveusall dot com, oragnicfoodistheonlyfood dot com, vaccineskillbabies dot com, etc. You don’t see that?”.
“No. That’s not how it works. If it wasn’t true, then nothing would come up when I searched for it.”.
I never even thought about that but it’s so TRUE. Most people no matter how screwed have SOME loved ones. Give the choice to choose between them or party affiliation it’s not that difficult to imagine this playing a part in the last two elections.
