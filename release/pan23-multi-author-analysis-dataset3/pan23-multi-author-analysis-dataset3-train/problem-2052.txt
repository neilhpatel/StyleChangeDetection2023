Understood. Last question: they don't have my SSN/EIN and they live in a different state than me -- do either of those points affect their ability or likelihood of filing a collection or pursuing litigation (small claims court)?
Is there a reason they may be withholding their alleged evidence? And would it be ill-advised to assume that since they lost the credit card dispute, their said "evidence" wouldn't be sufficient enough for pursuit of me through other means (such as collections or litigation)?
It would be extremely ill-advised to assume that since they lost the credit card dispute, they wouldn't be able to pursue collections or litigation.
The credit card companies dispute practices are generally biased towards the consumer and further you dont know what if any evidence the vendor actually has. The vendor might not have even responded to the credit card company resulting in your win in the dispute.
The fact that you won the dispute has no bearing on the validity of the debt, nor does it impact the vendor's (or their debt collector) ability to pursue the debt.
