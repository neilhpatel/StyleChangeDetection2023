This bill is absolutely your responsibility - you likely signed paperwork acknowledging that you are responsible for what insurance doesnâ€™t pay.
HMO plans assign you to a dental office. They are also the worst type of plan you can deal with. Calling the dentist and not knowing your specific plan details was the first mistake made here of many. The office is under no obligation to discount the work or work out a payment plan but it sounds like they have offered some discount.
None of the details matter - it is your responsibility to verify that your plan covers things. After all, insurance is a contract between you and your insurance company.
I understand what your saying about the insurance side of it. HOWEVER, I would like to point out HMO is NOT my choice. It is the only thing I can get through my work.
So, the insurance told me I could look for another dentist that accepts HMO. I just had to check that they do.
Furthermore, I ALWAYS have the choice. If this dentist doesn't give the choice, I can go elsewhere. I can choose to see a dentist who does silver or a dentist who does porcelain. But they should be communicating your choices to you. Everyone seems to agree on that. I should have even signed a paper agreeing to the treatment and the cost of insurance didn't help. This dentist took my choice away by not communicating and I was too naive to protect myself.
