"Total war is a type of warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs.".
This is not the point you were making above. The point you were making is that it wasn't called a "war", but it fact it was called as such in the US from day one whereas in Russia this is a "Special military operation".
The Sarcasm doesn't work here, because you are drawing parallels to the wrong thing . Putin is drawing parallels to regime change in Iraq, to prove hypocrisy of the US and it's supporters for only being offended when the Russia ignores sovereignty.
But we call those wars in the US. We've called them wars since day 1. The War in Iraq the War in Afghanistan. They just aren't wars from a legal perspective for a number of reasons.
Wether they're wars legally is actually a fraught topic. The constitution says that Congress declares war but it never actually specifies what the procedure is. It's come up a few times, IIRC, and courts have ruled multiple ways on whether the AUMFs constitute a declaration of war.
There's this whole Indian nationalist narrative that they're allied to Russia but they're not. The whole thing is just part of the nationalist anti-Western salad.
I think itâ€™s more that India has incompetent diplomacy and kinda always has. Like, it spent the entire Cold War cultivating total irrelevance and alienating literally everyone.
