I think OP mentions that he's getting a school credit for this? I'd like to know what school it is and I hope OP can report this employer to the school and get them banned. Mixed EE/UI, because maybe it's tied to academic credit, but probably fraudulently so.
I have no evidence that there is any educational benefit to this work like what there would be at an academic institution. There is no class on genre identification. No test will ever have you listen to 500 songs and score you on the ability to identify the style. Hard employee (EE).
That's 4.5 points EE and 2 points IU. And if you really try to weigh them, I think the contextual importance of 2, 5, and 6 would make them count double for me. It's clearly an employee position with abuse of the unpaid intern standard and this guy needs to make a wage claim.
Interns are by definitely time sucking and worthless, but unpaid IT interns are not the norm. On the offhand chance that an intern actually produces usable work for your company, then it is ethical to pay them for their time.
Not sure what professional services mean, but I work in IT and interns are always paid in that industry.
Know it's different in UK but I did a 3 month unpaid internship with a recruitment company. 6 months after leaving I realised how illegal that was, contacted HMRC and within a few months they did a full investigation and made them pay me minimum wage for every hour I was there.
