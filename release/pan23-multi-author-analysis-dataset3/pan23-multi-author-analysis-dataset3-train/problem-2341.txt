By filing a police report, you aren't escalating anything, just reporting that an incident took place; it's just CYA documentation. It's only required if damage is over a certain amount (varies), or if someone is seriously hurt.
Sometimes, whoever gets there first, wins. It might be a good idea to go ahead and file a police report, as a protective measure.
Getting a police report to record your side of the story is a good idea. It's also a good idea to write down exactly what you remember right now, and sign and date it. It can be very, very hard to remember details months later, especially of a traumatic event. I know my notes helped my lawyer, and they're more valuable the sooner they are written after the event.
Edit: Also, I'll echo the advice to go get your injuries checked out. I knew right away I was injured, but didn't find out fully how bad until I got an MRI a few weeks after the accident. Turns out that some broken bones can feel a lot like heavy bruising and sprained joints in the right circumstances.
Second, I am sure that you must be feeling the injuries from the impact. Make sure you tell the police that you got banged up and where your soft tissue injuries occurred. Also, go to your campus infirmary and tell them that you got hit by a car and that you are feeling sore from it.
First, file a police report. It is not too late to file one. Give them a clear description of the events as you perceive them. Do not go into great detail with them about what the driver claims. You must be clear with them that he hit you. There may also be video at or near an intersection or one of the stores that you were near.
