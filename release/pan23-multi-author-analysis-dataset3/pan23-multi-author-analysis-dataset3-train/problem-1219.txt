And in the Swiss Alps there's been 20.2Â°C, 16 degrees above the average temperature of the last 30 years. Belgium and Latvia have also been breaking extreme temperature records for the time of the year.
As I said in another comment, I remember that very nicely made documentary about a scientist that has "crazy ideas" and no one believed him, until the very next day the thing he was predicting happened exactly as he predicted it. BUT that was about the Gulfstream, an ocean current, while the current weather phenomenon is caused by the jet stream around the polar vortex, a WIND current.
As the wobbling of the jet stream gets worse (caused by faster warming along the poles), these kind of effects will happen more and more.
DAT was actually about the Gulfstream, and other ocean based WATER currents collapsing. So same.... but DIFFERENT. The Gulfstream is why Europe has a way more temperate climate, compared to other countries that are at the same latitude.
The Gulfstream is only partially responsible for warming up the western side of Europe, a lot of it is also due to how winds move on a spinning Earth, every continent's is warmer on its west coast than the eastern one.
