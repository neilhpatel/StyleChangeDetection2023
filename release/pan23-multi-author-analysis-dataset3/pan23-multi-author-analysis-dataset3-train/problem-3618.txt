Design patents cover specific details of a product's visual appearance. They don't cover broad concepts like "a widget shaped like any kind of animal", or even "a widget shaped like any kind of dog" -- a design patent would only protect the _specific_ dog shape used for the widget that appeared in your patent. A competitor could still make dog-shaped widgets, so long as theirs looked different from yours in some significant way.
Correct. The important part of a design patent is the diagrams, not the text of the patent. (This is the exact opposite of a utility patent.) The claims of the '486 patent encompass the entirety of the design -- the shape of the seat, the little freckles on the nose, the shape of the legs and the little painted toenails on the feet -- not just the fact that it resembles a hippopotamus. A competitor could create a non-infringing product which also resembled a hippopotamus, so long as consumers would not be likely to confuse their product with the one in the patent.
However are you saying that a competitor could replicate the hippo potty chair design with slightly different features (ears, teeth, etc) and it would not violate this? Or if another potty chair that resembled a hippo was created it could be considered infringing?
Here they took what is mostly a non-animal shape (potty training chair) and added a head to look like a hippo.
A comparable example of a granted design patent: Potty-chair having a likeness of an animal caricature.
Apologies, my design doesn't 100% look like an animal but instead gives an animal-likeness to an otherwise standard shape.
Based on your comment it sounds like a patent that covered the hippo-shaped toilet seat would not cover a bear-shaped seat, even though the language does not have anything more specific than "having a likeness of an animal caricature". Is that fair to say?
