It's not so much accessing the dark web that would be illegal (because it's not, nor is using TOR, or whatever), but your specific actions and content you consume/produce on the dark web.
The dark web is perceived to be a place of horror and extreme illegal content which yes it does offer some of that however that is not the case. For example people living in countries where they are not able to express their views and opinions due to oppression will browse content that wouldn’t be able to be viewed on the surface web because the country opposes that political view.
It can depend on your country’s specific regulations regarding the topic but not even browsing on the dark web will not get you into any issues.
Just a side question - can the government see what you search and the sites you visit - or even sub websites, as in categories within a site (No I'm not doing dodgy illegal stuff).
I'm probably on some lists, just because there are legal concepts I'm interested in and don't bother to search using incognito mode or whatever. I should probably lose more sleep over it than I do.
