They already went there. A few years back I read a article trying to promote a "Small scale nuclear war between India and Pakistan". It claimed that they don't have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world and no one would interfere between them.
Which this wouldn't be unless they used a nuclear device for dispersal. The technical term for this is albedo cooling, nuclear winter is a specific type of albedo cooling.
The time to cut our emissions and decide to avert disruptive climate change was 20-30 years ago, and we collectively decided to enjoy the short term benefits of ignoring the problem. Now that we have decided to deal with the problem when it is already a catastrophe, deciding to reduce emissions is choosing to confront a catastrophe by doing the things that would have avoided it. It is too little, too late. I do think that we need to seriously consider options like this Baja idiot is proposing. I just think that the idea has not been examined throughly enough before we start experimenting on our only patient.
