It often can feel like kind of gross hairsplitting when you point and say "thats genocide, that's genocide, that is only a massacre, that is a pogrom but not genocide..." but viewed separate from the latter stages, the 1913-1914 period feels more in line with, to use the most apt comparison available to me, generally gets termed the Hamidian Massacres of the Armenians in the 1890s. I think it is particularly good as a comparison because those alone resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, but nevertheless generally aren't considered genocide, so illustrate how genocide isn't simply a matter of volume, but also needs to take into account motivations and intended end goals, among other factors. I know some scholars, principally Benny Morris, do make the argument that it was, seeing the totality of Ottoman/Turkish directed killings from the 1890s through the 1920s as part of one, single, broad genocide that went on for thirty years (literally the title of his book), but I also have some serious issues with Morris as a scholar, so... take that for what you will.
A historiographical question for you - you cite Erickson's work, which of course makes sense, and in this answer and elsewhere in the thread you discuss the Armenian Genocide (again, as you should).
I am confused how the motives and end goals of tehcir and expulsion of balkan turks are different enough to consider the armenian issue a genocide and the other not. However I understand you said this is not your interest.
