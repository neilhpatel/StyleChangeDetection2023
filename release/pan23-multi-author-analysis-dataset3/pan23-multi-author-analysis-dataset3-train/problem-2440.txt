There are 3 calendars used by different christian churches. Technically in the year 2800, if we as humanity survive and if any of these religions survive (hope not on the second part), there will be 3 christmasses.
-Revised Julian: created by a serbian scientist as a gift to the serbian church but they never adopted it. It is more accurate than the gregorian calendar and is aligned with it up until the year 2800 than it will get disaligned by 1 day, not sure after how long it will become 2 days. It has been adopted by smaller orthodox christian churches, for example the american orthodox church uses it.
Some orthodox churches accepted that NEW calendar for certain church holidays, like Greek, Romanian and recently Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
(The Ukrainian Orthodox Church gives congregations a choice to celebrate on the 25th to align with other Christian groups or the 9th to align with Russian Orthodox. Both are national holidays.).
It’s more than that. It’s a Fuck you to Ukraine as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church just moved their Christmas to Dec 25th this year to separate further from Russian Orthodox Church which celebrates on Jan 7th.
It's also an opportunity to say Ukraine is suppressing their Russian Orthodox Christians - since Ukraine Orthodox celebrate Christmas on the 25th now.
If Ukraine reciprocates (they won't) Putin can say they're observing Russian Orthodox Christmas and therefore are part of Russia.
