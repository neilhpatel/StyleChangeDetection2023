That's the kind of community we're after here. honestly, it's not the kind of community that appeals to everyone. And you know what, that's fine Different spokes for different folks and all that You might appreciate other history subs like r/history or r/askhistory.
Of course, if you're still upset over our level of moderation, there is always r/history and r/askhistory - both fine subreddits with decent moderators who enforce their own rules in their own way. But this is AskHistorians, and the thing that differentiates us from those subs is being more stringent assessing and, if necessary, removing answers and comments that don't meet out standards. High standards are what AskHistorians is all about; without them, why have the sub at all?
In part, we feel that the success of this subreddit has been because of its active moderation policy and its knowledgable base of flaired users - all of whom are volunteers. We have attracted some notable experts to participate in AMAs, and work to extend the reach of great answers from this community through social networking (twitter, Facebook, etc.) and our Podcast series.
So while we feel your frustration, and welcome suggestions for how to improve our moderation policy, please try to understand why the subreddit is how it is.
The way to work with, instead of against, reddit's design would be to split the sub in two, one for questions, answers and discussions, and one for links to just quality answers and discussion on them. Think /r/bestof or /r/depthhub.
