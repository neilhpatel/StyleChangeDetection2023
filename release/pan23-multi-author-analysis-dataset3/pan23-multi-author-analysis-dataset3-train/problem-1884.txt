There’s a reason that even if McCarthy gives them everything and gets their vote he can’t win, because others may not be willing to destroy themselves so McCarthy can be speaker.
with concessions like these, even if McCarthy wins the speakership vote, he's going to be powerless lame duck beholden to the insurrection caucus from the first day.
Seems to me Democrats are missing a huge opportunity here…they could each take turns being nominated for speaker, and one-by-one each get more votes than McCarthy.
Enjoying mainstream Republicans who are grumbling that Democrats should ‘be the bigger person’ and vote for McCarthy.
Even if he’s Speaker for five minutes, he can keep calling himself that for the rest of his life and charge more for speeches.
If McCarthy is bowing to the demand to have JUST ONE Rep able to call a vote of no confidence any time they like, then it’s obvious he just wants the title.
If it was Pelosi up there with six failed votes and she needed a few Republicans to save her, how many do you think will selflessly step up?
