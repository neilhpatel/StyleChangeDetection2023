As far as whether the west knew I would guess not. It’s very hard to get even remotely accurate estimates of stockpiles for a hostile country and to be honest with corruption there’s a good chance even Putin didn’t know his true stockpiles.
I agree with that assessment. My guess is the Soviet Union had huge stockpiles but a lot of these were sold off (both officially and unofficially) in the 90s plus Russia has had a number of wars and conflicts since then so they’re stockpiles got used up and not replaced. Russia had plenty of shells for a short war but they tens of millions and they just don’t have them.
One of the reasons for announcements like this is to communicate to the Russians that Ukraine will have supplies of ammo/weapons for the long-haul.
Is it a NATO or specific spec round, for instance we are asking Ukraines eastern European friends to donate their stockpiles because its not NATO spec weapons.
Interesting that the aging global arsenals are being sent to Ukraine. Basically we are sending all our old weapons to them and now we make new ones. There has to be some significance here. Maybe someone more intelligent has some insight.
