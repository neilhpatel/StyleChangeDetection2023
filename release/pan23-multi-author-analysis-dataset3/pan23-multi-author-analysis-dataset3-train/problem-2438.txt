Yes. But if WE tell him he'll deny it and not do anything as we aren't his equal. It has to come from someone superior for him. Every time something like this has come up he says that's not true and nothing ever comes of it. And dlsince we can't prove it from hearsay.
The issue is proving it. She has a cell phone and we wanted to ask her to take a picture. But I know it's a touch and go subject.
The issue is asking her to take picture. I know it can be kind of iffy on that subject us asking her to. Putting her in the middle and all that.
Then don’t put her in the middle. My parents are divorced, and being put in the middle was a hell of a lot more disruptive to me than anything else I had to deal with. That included personally revealing infidelity, moving at least once a year due to instability, multiple instances of them reconciling/splitting up, and eventually pervasive alcoholism. So is putting your daughter in the middle, and the baggage that puts on her, worth avoiding having a conversation with him and if he doesn’t resolve involving a lawyer? She doesn’t need to be in the middle further than answering a question if it gets all the way to the court.
