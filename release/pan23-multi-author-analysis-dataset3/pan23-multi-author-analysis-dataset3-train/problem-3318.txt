In my engineering program there’s a growing concern that engineers are becoming glorified software users due to how much technology is used. But the answer my professors have come up with is just to provide examples of why it’s good to maintain your understanding of and ability to execute manual calculations at a basic level. If someone is a good student and engineer then they practice their manual calculations instead of skipping steps. The ones that aren’t very good engineers don’t tend to practice in my experience. And towards the end of my degree now I feel like I can see a difference between those that do and don’t keep their basic skills up.
(As a side note this is why I love estate sales and used book stores. I’ve found more interesting historical items or books through something catching my eye in those than any online store or web search. If I had the ability to access certain archives as an amateur I’d probably cry).
Sorry, I didn’t mean to frame it as a one size fits all solution. I just thought the problem presented sounded similar to one that I see in my program and so was offering a solution since OP didn’t provide one on their own and I was curious what they’d think. But it’s definitely anecdotal because there’s far to many variables at play and I’m only talking from my experiences, same way OP is. Although they obviously have more experience as I’m still a student and have far more to learn.
I've been a historian for a decade and a half, now, and I'm still learning so much new stuff, constantly, on every research project, no matter how minor.
Note: I am most definitely NOT a historian (my day job is a software developer / IT guy), just recently found this sub and I've been fascinated by the questions and depth of answers. It's quite refreshing.
That totally sounds exciting. There’s a yearly zine fest in my city and they’re an incredibly fascinating medium. I’d love to be able to digitally flip through historic fanzines.
