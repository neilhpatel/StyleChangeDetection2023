I'd go down to the post office and talk to them, they'll have the best advice at the office since they can easily discuss with other employees and their supervisor.
Also, still get the locking mailbox so when it sells, the buyers don't have to deal with creepy dude.
I believe there’s mailboxes where they’re locked and can be opened with a key. It’s like a little drop box for mailmen where they put it in the slot and nobody can open it but you.
It sounds like you have a free standing unlocked mailbox. Locking mailboxes are a thing. Just buy one and install it. The USPS has some guidelines on placement of mailbox you should check out (distance from road, height, etc). Or you can try to ask the current carrier if there is anything they want changed as long as you are replacing it. You’ll have the key and the mail carrier will slip the mail in a slot at the top.
I was a postal carrier for a bit, and it was not uncommon to see a mailbox, with only a slot for putting mail in, and then a locked door on the back end. I don't know the hard rules on it though.
If you go that route, make sure the slot is big enough to get your stuff in without it being crammed.
