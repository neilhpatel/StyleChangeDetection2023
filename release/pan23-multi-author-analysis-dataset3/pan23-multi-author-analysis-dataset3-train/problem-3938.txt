Not really. Using the dash in that title caused me misread it as the US warning Japan, but then I read it again (because US threatening Japan didn't make sense) and realised it meant US & Japan.
Why have news sites stop using the word "and" in titles? I've seen commas and dashes replace "and", do they not know the ampersand exists?
Hopefully you haven't seen a dash replace "and" outside of the context where a dash would be a normal thing to use.
But the supposed correct use of a dash—which would be an em dash not a hyphen—is like this, no space. Which drives me batty. I must prefer spaces — like this — even though it's technically against the style guides. Although it's perhaps a bit wide – which I like – but if it is felt to be too wide, en dashes as I used here would work for me. I'm fine with hyphens or dashes - like this - being used, but I think at least an en dash if not an em dash is better.
To me, though, I read U.S.-Japan as a combined entity, like you might talk about the Mexico-Guatemala border.
