I say this as someone who has tried being both vegan and vegetarian. I like meat. Meat is delicious. As is cheese. I'm sorry. I'm weak, and I'm sorry for that. I wish I weren't, but I'm not there yet.
Wild, isn't it? People are so defensive of their consumption that they'd rather ignore, or even defend, factory farm practices before they'd consider that their meat eating is problematic.
Yet you'll still have weird people defending it because they get so defensive about their meat eating habits.
Meat eaters are allowed to care about animal welfare - in fact they are the ones who we need to care the most since they consume it. Vegans don’t matter — they aren’t buying it anyways.
On a mass scale the vast majority of Americans don’t have access to locally sourced food. The only way to improve industrial farming is through regulation. Instead of demanding people boycott products, you should encourage them to support politicians and legislation that will hold these corporations accountable.
Corporate propaganda has shifted to encourage the “why aren’t you boycotting” narrative. It leaves them completely off the hook. It’s the perfect strategy.
