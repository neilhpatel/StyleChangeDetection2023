The main reason to carry it is for aesthetic purposes, which includes the appearance of it being an actual sword, but not for the purpose of tricking a person. Would that apply to pulling a gotcha? I would carry an actual sword but that feels like more trouble than it is worth.
A sword (and things that look a lot like swords) are going to attract attention, largely negative. The laws around carrying weapons cover imitation weapons, as a general rule, so you could as easily 'brandish' a foam rubber sword (misdemeanor, up to 30 days jail) as a real one.
There's no law against carrying a sword, but if you got into an argument and put your hand on the hilt, or did anything to confirm the at-a-glance suspicion that you're a nut with a sword about to 'demand satisfaction', presumptions would be against you. It could well be a legally-relevant aggravating factor if you did something else illegal while wearing it. Charges likely wouldn't hold up unless you did commit other crimes at the same time, but you'd face a lot of avoidable hassle for the sake of carrying a rubber stick that looks like a weapon.
Legally, you are within your rights to do this, but there are all sorts of complications that could arise that would make a legal situation worse for you. You'd also run a vastly increased risk of police interaction, because you are apparently carrying a sword and are dressed in a very unusual way. Socially, people might be a lot more on their guard around you and there is an increased risk that your behaviour will be misinterpreted as threatening.
You might also find yourself at increased risk of confrontation walking about dressed as Francis Drake. That is the kind of thing I'd be hoping to avoid if I was carrying a weapon, all the more an imitation weapon. Private businesses are likely to bar you from entry while carrying a sword or sword-like object.
