Turkey has and understandable reason to not want to join a military alliance with countries that support and protect people accused of terrorism against the Turkish state. It's not petty, even if you agree with Kurdish separatism you can understand why Turkey doesn't. They want NATO to be aligned with their nationalistic interests regarding Turkish sovereignty- not to support people who want to rip their country apart. People don't join military alliances to lose power and be broken apart.
However, no sane country would join a military pact they can't veto the other members of. It's a risk. Once Sweden and Finland are in (some day with any luck), they'll hopefully veto any potential fifth column country themselves if necessary. Such is the nature of joining the pact.
If Hungary or Turkey won't come to the defence of their allies then their attempt at playing both sides is no longer useful, yes. Not a fan of the bullshit from both. Turkey is trying to get Europe to help it persecute its ethnic minority, and Hungary is clearly playing both sides.
Turkey's dictatorship's cultural clash with the rest of the bloc makes things difficult, but is a good reminder to never allow Turkey into the EU, no matter how soft we get as the millennium goes on. The existence of Kurdish Muslims and Greek and Armenian Christians is clearly traumatizing to them.
