I would guess the knife is considered excessive force and not considered “proportional” to having fists punching you.
But, most likely the police policy is to arrest no matter what when someone stabs someone else. Arrest now, ask questions later.
I mean I don’t disagree with you. The thing is, that’s for the jury to decide realistically. The cops don’t get to make that determination. It sounds like a great theory for the defense to present that would likely make a jury acquit imv, and is great leverage for negotiating with the DA.
The police aren’t there to determine if the man’s act was in self-defense. They just enforce the law. Your friend stabbed people. The prosecutor’s office is charging him (sounds like he was arraigned?) Now he needs to get a lawyer and his theory of defense is self-defense.
Self defense is a defense. Just because there was an arrest, which was completely proper, it doesn't mean that the DA will automatically prosecute. If that happens, then he'll have the chance to prove self-defense at trial.
