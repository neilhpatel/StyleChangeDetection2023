I am not a Colorado or a Texas Attorney and I am not familiar with probate laws or cemetery laws In those States.
Did the cemetery people tell you then he signed an affidavit of some kind naming himself as your grandfathers heir?
Did the cemetery people acknowledge or admit to you that your Grandfather owned the plot before he died?
Do you believe your Grandfather and or your grandmother owned the cemetery plot before grandfather died?
It is possible that the cemetery people were not told the truth and did not know that your grandmother even existed or that your uncle had authority to sign for her on her own behalf.
Therefore, if your grandmother contacts the cemetery people, gives them evidence that she was married to your Grandfather, tells them that she never gave power or permission to the uncle to sign anything on her behalf.
If that is the case, then it doesn't matter what the uncle signed because your grandmother could be probably is the current legal owner.
Do you think believe that the uncle named himself as the owner of the plot as the relative of your Grandfather?
Also, what she failed to mention was that brother is also dead so his children are the ones who own it now and my uncle was dealing with the man's son.
