If you can get cooperation, have that person try to negotiate a payoff amount. Generally these places will work with you on the amount.
Unless you can get the former employee to cooperate, your only option is going to be to go to the auction and bid.
I see several other comments suggesting you bid and win the auction. If you don't win you could negotiate with whoever wins the auction to get your items. Possibly even talk to one of the bidders there before or during the auction and offer to combine money to increase their bid to a winning level if they'll give you your belongings. Perhaps allowing them to verify that all the items you're interested in are photos and memorabilia so they don't think you're trying to get a high marketable value item away from them.
IANAL, but have a couple suggestions for resolving this without a legal proceeding. Keep in mind that any legal proceeding involving a lawsuit might be too late to prevent the auction anyways, although it might be worth discussing that with a local lawyer.
But even then paying on the unit would only postpone the auction from happening but doesn’t do anything with regard to the employee who at this point seems to be unwilling to help out. So, yes it keeps OP’s wife’s things there but still no access to it.
