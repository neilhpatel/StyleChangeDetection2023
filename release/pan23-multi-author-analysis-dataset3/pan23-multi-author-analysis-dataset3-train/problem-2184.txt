How much damage can these munitions cause? I assume they could take out things like trucks, planes, artillery, etc. Can they destroy buildings? Armored vehicles?
At some point something needs to be done about all that Russian artillery. Like destroying hundreds more, not a couple here and there. Ukraine can keep forcing back the ammo dumps and lenhen the supply lines, but they already did that before and supplies are still making it to the front. Russian artillery can pound Ukrainian positions when the battlefield is fairly static, and hit Ukrainian troops/vehicles in pre-sighted areas during Ukrainian advances. Maybe these munitions will be capable of taking out artillery better?
They are called antiaircraft guns. Most of the design and engineering is actually focused on air defense. But there is no reason you cannot fire the machine gun level to the horizon.
The existence of AA gun vehicles fills in the niche so your proposed class dedicated to just infantry slaughter is not likely to happen.
Secondly, the infantry fighting vehicle like M2 or BMP often comes with a big fat machine gun or small cannon.
You could haul boxes of 25mm Bushmaster ammunition in M2 Bradleys instead of a squad of troops and it would do everything that you are describing.
