1) Sabbath is relative. To some Jews, it’s “you can’t play instruments, flip a switch, light a match, or even rip a piece of toilet paper” (no, seriously - some pre-rip paper on sabbath). To others it’s “don’t actually go to work or engage in chores - it’s a holy day for study, prayer, and loved ones.” And to still others it’s “go to synagogue for an hour and a half and then don’t check social media for a day.” Sounds like you got the fun ones who can’t even push a button.
I think - and many of the old guard members of the New Atheist movement have come around on this - that there is basically a God-shaped (or religion-shaped) hole in most human brains. And that if you don’t fill it with something tried and tested that fulfills that role, most people’s brains will find something else to take its place, and treat that like a religion.
Most of the rules of Judaism don’t come from God, but come from the Talmud, which is essentially argumentation and case law.
What you're referring to is more of a personal choice to focus on learning other things besides Jewish law. It's a perfectly valid choice and one I've made for myself as well. But the only barrier to learning this stuff is the opportunity cost of doing so, not any cabal of rabbis that's keeping the good stuff hidden.
So, saving a life is definitely one of the standard exceptions. But the question is always what does that mean exactly. If it was the case that there was zero chance of finding anyone alive and the only remaining work was clearing rubble and bodies, then they would be required to rest on Shabbat. (Probably a good idea to take a break from that kind of work for a day, anyway.) What this rabbi is saying is that even though the chance of finding survivors is low, it’s still enough to make an exception.
Without intending to give offense, I hope you’re open to expanding your mind here. Otherwise I’m wasting my breath.
