Chileans are honorable. They not only provide penguins with a sensitive ecological area to evolve in, but they also host some of the best optical telescopes on Earth in some of their most delicate ecological areas. Anyone from Chile want to comment?

Chilean here. While most people here would agree that environmental protection is important, sadly we are burdened with more inmediate and urgent problems, it's hard to think about the environment when you can barely make it to the end of the month, or fear beign mugged on your way to work.
It also helps that the media usually jumps instantly to report any news of environmental damage and it's effect on nearby communities, usually triggering an official response or investigation, because most of the time authorities won't move their asses unless someone lihs a fire under them and are shown as passive/incompetent on national tv.
