You can file a complaint with your Secretary of State or similar bureaucracy that licenses car dealerships and provide them with both CarFaxs demonstrating that the dealer reported the accident only after you bought the car. They will investigate and may contact you for more information.
Did you look at the CarFax and see who reported the accident and when it happened? Did you verify the vehicle information on the CarFax as being your vehicle?
It was reported before I purchased the vehicle. I asked to see the carfax when purchasing the vehicle and they told me it didn’t have one yet since it didn’t have anything to report from it. They said the carfax would start when it had its first certified service with them.
It’s a legal question because it is illegal to sell a vehicle new with undisclosed damages that are on the history report. So I asked what should I do? Just because it doesn’t have the lingo like an attorney wrote it doesn’t mean it’s not legal. If you can’t answer the question then move on. Thank you.
