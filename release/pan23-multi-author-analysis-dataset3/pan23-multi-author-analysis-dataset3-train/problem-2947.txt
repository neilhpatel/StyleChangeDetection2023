Thank you for your kind words! Can’t bring myself to be spiteful just yet. He did follow through and let me take more of my stuff out, and was very peaceful about it.
I was able to peacefully text with him about getting the rest of my belongings. I know that he lost the right of me being peaceful towards him but there’s something in me that can’t bring myself to be more stern and bring up involving the police just yet. I still have a lot of conflicted emotions, sorry .
I did feel unsafe the day he forced me out of the apartment, but he was being peaceful letting me get some more of my stuff when I went today. I’ll definitely get the cops involved if it comes to a point where I don’t feel safe on my own.
I would prefer to not involve the police just to try and keep things from exploding between the both of us. I will try and talk to my ex about removing me from the lease.
I would start looking for a way to remove your name from the bills and lease. Sadly you will need to speak with you ex to do this.
