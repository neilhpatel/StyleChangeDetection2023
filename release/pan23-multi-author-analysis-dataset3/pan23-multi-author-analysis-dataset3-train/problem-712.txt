As the gun ban applying to Congresspeople isn't a crime but a civil law, I doubt violating it counts as either though.
Congressional reps are allowed to carry weapons in the Capitol, they just aren’t allowed to carry on the House or Senate floor. The issue is that you’re also not allowed to arrest them when they’re doing their official duties (barring a handful of specific felonies) so there’s no real way to stop them.
There should probably be some limits, but as a general principle it's more beneficial than harmful to make it almost impossible to arrest a lawmaker while they're acting such. A pretty common tactic in repressive governments (and especially "illliberal democracies", which appears to be the path the US is on) is to make it impossible for the opposition to enter the legislature. It allows you to claim X group has representation and even power in your country, while denying its use.
I believe either MTG or LB made a big show of refusing to relinquish a gun shortly after Jan 6. Unless there's a carve out for it, they could be carrying a vial of anthrax and smoking black tar heroin off some foil as they strolled down the halls and security couldn't touch them so long as they were performing their duties as representatives.
