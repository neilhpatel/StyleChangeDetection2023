The main contaminants from a nuclear weapon and a nuclear reactor are the same things: fission products (the "halves" of heavy atoms that remain after you split them), and heavy actinides (un-fissioned uranium and/or plutonium). You can think of these as "residues" of the bomb or reactor. But there were significant differences in the two cases.
TLDR: The atomic bombs produced a relatively small number of contaminants, that were kept high in a cloud for long-enough for the worst to decay and dispersed over a relatively large area, diffusing the contamination; the Chernobyl accident released a relatively large number of contaminants, that were immediately contaminating downwind and near the site.
Some of the fallout from Chernobyl was of the sort that could be more easily distributed throughout the environment, which raised the immediate risk to other folks around the world but over time those radiosotopes were diluted and became "just" a slight increase in everyone's background radiation exposure on Earth (as did the Hiroshima and Nagasaki radioisotopes, and those from atmospheric nuclear testing). The real problem was that the ash and solid particles from the reactor in the nearby areas around Chernobyl simply settled to the ground and stuck there. They won't easily wash away or diffuse into the air, they're stuck there for geologic time scales.
Because the Chernobyl reactor had been operating for years the amount of fission products (radioactive fallout) that had built up in the reactor was much greater than was produced by the WWII-era nuclear bombs, by an enormous margin. And this was added to by the massive power excursion that caused the accident.
