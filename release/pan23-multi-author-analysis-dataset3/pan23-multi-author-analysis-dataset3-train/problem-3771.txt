Things were/are complicated by diffusion over space and time. As cultures change over time - conversion to Christianity or the effects of early industrialization - this caused a shift in the nature of oral tradition. The same thing happened when oral narratives diffused and were adopted by cultures that might not understand certain motifs. In both cases (time and space), some motifs were no longer appropriate and were trimmed away, but invariably, new ones were introduced. The effect of these changes was not to trim down oral narratives but rather to transform them. They did not become sparse because of the transition but they did change.
There is a duel process of deletion and augmentation that affects of living oral narrative. If a storyteller tells a story with a motif that simply does not work (because it conflicts with the local culture or it is simply bad storytelling) that motif will be dropped by the smoothing process of repetition. At the same time, storytellers would embellish, and some of these additions would survive the processes of repetition.
If i understood correctly, not much meaning should be attached to these stories/myths and they are more for entertainment, stories to pass the time around the fire perhaps?
The subject you raise is at the heart of classic studies of folklore, which considered how folk narratives diffused and changed over space and time. Volumes have been written on this, so I offer only a brief synthesis of what has been observed and discussed.
