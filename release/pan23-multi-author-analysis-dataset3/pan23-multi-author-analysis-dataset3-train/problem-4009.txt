No, not really. You’re 80 years old. Retire already. Stop putting a gun at my head and forcing me to vote for your antiquated boomer ass. Fucking retire already. I’m so sick of having a gun pointed at my head and being told to vote for Biden.
I'll vote for Biden's stupid ass if he ends up the nominee, but, no, I am not "with" him. Stop nominating dinosaurs! I am an old fucker, but political old fuckers are out of touch with working Americans. I cannot forgive Biden for his treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearing. Biden is a primary reason Thomas now sits on SCOTUS with his horrible wife who wants to overthrow a legitimate election whispering in his ear, or is she listening to her husband and then spreading his bullshit.
I am in my 70s and had to vote for the lesser of two evils all my life, EXCEPT when I voted for Jimmy Carter twice... "vote blue no matter who" is crap.
Bernie is the exception of an 80yo and the only 80yo I'd feel comfortable voting for. Joe can't remember shit and has said some pretty shitty stuff, telling stories that are clearly not factual. I'll vote for him if he's the nominee but it is voting for the lesser of two evils.
Sounds like you’ll be voting for him. If you don’t think the GOP will nominate a subhuman parasite, then I don’t know what to tell you. They were just as wrong about the proper way to run things in 2004 (and 2000, 60s thru the 90s, all of it) as they are now, but now it’s just way more in your face and obsessed with grievance politics. Say things go back to normal, which they won’t. Republicans will still be eons away from coming up with solutions that don’t exist solely to adhering to status quo.
