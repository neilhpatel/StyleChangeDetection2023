I understand everybody's worried, same for you as for me, but having served in the army, believe me if I say they're prepared, the limitation is politics, not militairy capability.
4. do you even follow the news? The russian's control shit, the only thing keeping them from being obliterated is the fact that NATO partners don't want Ukraine to operate behind russian lines.
3. Why would they not be modernized? F16's dominated everywhere the last 20 years before the f35 came in play. The dutch never lost one in combat, and the've been in combat a lot.
They're already ready. You underestimate the planning going into this. Same for the leopards. You'd be a shit general if you weren't already planning for the use of everything nato's got to offer. And to be clear, unlike the russians, our generals aren't shit.
2. How so not many left? Do you have the numbers? In my estimation the US started with the training of additional pilots a year ago, because, you know, forecasts.
The question is what happens between the start of training and when the pilots will be combat ready.
And who is going to do the maintenance needed to keep their planes combat capable - training those crews and the pilots means they wonâ€™t be available on the front lines now.
Ukraine already has an air force and pilots, they only need to be trained on new equipment, not sent through Basic. It's the same as IFVs and MBTs; Ukraine already has tankers.
