They obviously weren't trying to get people to vote for her, they wanted to make it look like there was no valid defense for any criticism against her, so her supporters would just screech sexism.
I for instance didn't vote for her because I'm convinced that if she had won she would have ruined the chances of multiple generations of actual qualified women to be president.
"More Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than any other losing presidential candidate in US history.
The Democrat outpaced President-elect Donald Trump by almost 2.9 million votes, with 65,844,954 (48.2%) to his 62,979,879 (46.1%), according to revised and certified final election results from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.".
Uh huh. The same polls indicated Hillary was going to beat Trump. Your statement is speculation at best, but more accurately a fantasy. Just because you think he would have won doesn’t mean he would have.
Usually media bias fact check is pretty accurate, but it fails to take into account Jacobin’s interpretation of the facts and the liberties it takes with the conclusions they draw.
You still have no hard evidence. You are working entirely on hypotheticals because you can’t stand that Bernie isn’t as good of a politician as you think he is.
