As for the vet bills, it's unlikely you'll be able to successfully serve and subpoena the defendant in civil court to recoup your loss, since they're out of state. A local judge won't sign off on an extradition request for such a small amount, and I've never seen one for a civil case.
It looks like you can report the dog as abandoned through the website, which will start the clock ticking for Animal Control statutes for prosecuting animal abandonment. When you make the report, the proper agency will contact you for further information, and at that time, you can give them the details on your "good faith" attempts to reunite the owner with their property. You can also let them know about your intentions to adopt the dog permanently, so that for the duration of the investigation, the dog can just stay in your care.
Tell the owner you can no longer take care of the dog and will be taking it to an animal shelter. Then take the dog to an animal shelter. Tell the shelter the owner abandoned the dog and that you want to adopt it. The shelter will hold the dog and may even contact the owner. If they don't claim the dog than the dog can be adopted. You then adopt the dog and it is now legally yours.
