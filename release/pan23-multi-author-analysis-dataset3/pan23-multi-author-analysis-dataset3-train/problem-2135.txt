How is that supposed to work? When they say they removed the warhead before launching the missile, and then they launch the missile without the warhead, shouldn't they still have a warhead at the facility?
I'm wondering if that's the plan, for a bunch of nukes with the warhead removed, then when you fire one for real you can claim it was an accident.
Or, more accurate question: how easy would it be for someone to smuggle a nuclear warhead into a foreign country and detonate it there? I mean, the missile is just a mean of delivery, you don’t actually need it for the damage, right?
Presumably they aren’t doing this with their ICBMs only short and medium range missiles. One of the other threads had ICBMs as 1500 out of 4000 nuclear weapons.
The big reason for the debacle with the tanks was lack of oversight. You can sell everything on the black market if no one is coming around looking, but nuclear weapons have international inspection teamsz.
Because what you are describing would be a gross violation of the treaties and involve a huge number of co-conspirators from multiple states and organizations.
