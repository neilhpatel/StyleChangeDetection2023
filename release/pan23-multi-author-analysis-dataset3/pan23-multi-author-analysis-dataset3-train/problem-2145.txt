The Cholas ruled over what is now South and South-East India. They were a supposedly ancient dynasty but there is little written evidence on the Cholas prior to the 7th century CE let alone their origins. However, we do have a number of sources on what is now called the "Medieval Cholas" or "Imperial Cholas". This began in c. 848 CE when Vijayalaya captured Thanjavur and later defeated the neighbouring Pandyas and Pallavas. The Cholas slowly grew their influence and power in the region but it was under Rajaraja I and his son Rajendra I that they became the dominant power in Southern India and projected their influence even across the Bay of Bengal.
I was hoping an expert on the subject would come in, but as none are forthcoming I would like to point out that this is actually a misconception, or more accurately, there is actually an exception to the unassuming historical maritime prowess of the kingdoms that used to exist in the Indian subcontinent. This exception is the naval invasions of South-East Asia by the Chola Empire.
Why was the Chola Empire an exception, why didn't any succeeding states also have a blue water navy, once the Chola proved it's power?
This answer by u/LXT13OJ illuminates some of the history of the South Indian Chola Empire, probably one of Indiaâ€™s most famous naval powers.
In lieu of a more direct answer, I will show you to some previous answers that address Indian states with powerful navies and or sea-faring traditions.
In addition to the naval conquests of the Cholas, are there not much more ancient accounts of Indian seafarers in southeast asia and the Persian Gulf? I'm thinking of the kingdom of Kalinga and it's relationship with the Javanese (?), or the Brahmi graffiti on that island off the coast of Yemen.
