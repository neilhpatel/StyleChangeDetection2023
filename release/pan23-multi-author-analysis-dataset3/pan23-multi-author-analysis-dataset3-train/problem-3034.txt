So since the good faith deposit would go towards our security deposit, are you saying that the only reason they should be allowed to keep the deposit is if we did damage to the apartment?
The terms were not provided until after the good faith deposit was put down. Otherwise, couldn’t a landlord ask for a good faith deposit and only then, after you have “promised,” have absurd stipulations in the lease? Shouldn’t the lease and all terms be transparent in a deal like this?
“You sent them money promising to rent under the terms provided and are now refusing to rent under those terms.”.
You sent them money promising to rent under the terms provided and are now refusing to rent under those terms. They potentially lost out on oportunities to secure a lease to someone willing to accept those terms operating under the assumption you would keep your end of the deal. The purpose of that deposit is to compensate the landlord for that potential lost revenue.
It is the landlord’s right to deduct any expenses (from the deposit) incurred from repairing damage to the property which occurred during the lease. The balance of the money must then be refunded to the tenant. The tenant has the right to see all repair receipts to confirm what was actually spent to the property, in order to repair the tenants damage. The landlord may not deduct costs for general maintenance and upkeep (wear and tear) of the property, from the tenant’s deposit.
