Okay, so the policy isnt directly shaming me for not getting the vaccine, but it will allow customers to shame me for not getting it. If I worked a wage job that meant my income couldnt be affected by this policy, then fine. I dont agree but I'd wear the mask. But truthfully, it absolutely can and likely will effect tip based income.
On day 1 of the policy one girl was asked why some staff were not wearing the mask, the waitress said "new policy, unvaccinated people dont have to wear them" no biggie, she said that's all the convo that came of it, meal proceeded as normal. After they left, she noticed on their check was written a little note 'get vaxxed, save a life". She was wearing mask. They deduced she was not vaccinated. Now, they left an average tip, so THESE people were fair and that's nice. Should I assume everyone else will be fair too though? I feel that's a valid concern.
Got it. It wasnt specifically written into discrimination law that vaccination status was protected. So it's still shady ðŸ¤£ thanks for validating my feeling on that.
Shady isn't a legal concept but there's nothing shady about it. Legally they could require everyone to wear masks. Which is basically what they are doing. They are also offering an exemption if you show them a card. You can be vaccinated and choose to not show your card. This is a blanket policy with an exception.
