Sounds ridiculous indeed, but it's quite a sophisticated method of creating cohesion among a group, through collective but private shame and guilt. Let's not pretend any of those Proud Boys actually stopped beating it. They just said they did because the others did, and the induced shame forces them to double down on the superiority rhetoric which is the foundation of their cohesion. They give themselves license to feel superior to non-members on the basis of a collective lie which they all participate in.
Literally yes, but there is a dehumanizing connotation, just like when racists describe male immigrants as 'males'. Slave traders talked about slaves in the same way. It's a deliberate tactic to make them sound like animals. Pretending not to recognize this connotation is also part of the dehumanizing tactic.
Connotation is how the word is seen in general use the more you think it is "dehumanizing" and make a point to not use it certain cases the more you solidify it as a "dehumanizing" word. I'm a more scientifically inclined individual and use female more because sometimes it is hard to tell how old someone is. Is saying, her or she, dehumanizing to females aswell?
Could you elaborate on why "female" being used as a noun is misogynistic? The only thing that comes to mind is the context of "female" being used for animals, so using it for people is then disrespectful.
Fair enough, I kind of just figured the OP was mimicking the language of the article("female education" =.
You can still use female as an adjective like in the article "female students". What was wrong was your use of "education of females" where it is a noun there and should have been "education of girls and women". But to make it ok the easier way is to keep it as an adjective AKA "female students".
