Electrician here. This man did not need to shut off the main, like you said. Qe dont shut of the main breaker, he shouldnt shut off the water main. HOWEVER, he should have used the shutoff valve at the vanity, as we Electricians use a single breaker.
So normally the water main is not shut off unless there is no isolation valve for the plumbing fixture being removed/modified. That is why there are isolation valves for individual plumbing fixtures - so if they malfunction or need to be replaced, one does not need to shut off the water to the whole house. Clarification:
What actually broke here? Did the under sink shut off valve break in the process of turning off the valve? Did a pipe break while the valve was being shut? Was the shut off valve to the sink actually shut, but later, in the process of doing the repair, he somehow broke pipe before it?
But nowhere does it say they didn't shut it off at the angle valve, nowhere do we even find out where it broke either before/after the valve. Actually the most common would be the valve breaking when trying to shut it off, would be the same as if you fried a panel flipping one breaker although I know that doesn't really happen for you guys unless something is really fucked.
If I go to turn your angle valve off, and due to you not maintaining it it breaks and floods how is that clearly my fault for using the valve as intended? It is absolutely not a normal thing to turn off the main when there are shut off valves at the vanity, and if the valve broke from attempts to operate it that absolutely does not automatically equal negligence.
It's absolutely possible they are at fault, but it is in no way an absolute based on what info we have, and anyone who would give an absolute answer like that is doing OP a huge disservice.
