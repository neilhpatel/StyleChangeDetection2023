There's no legal requirement that someone who is demanding a document from you be available to accept that document, period.
They do not specify (ever) how documentation should be submitted, only that it must be. I could argue that mail or personal drop-off is implied since they provide their address, but as you recall in my OP, 1st class mail and physical drop-off weren't proving good enough, which is why we moved to certified mail (with delivery confirmation).
We already made a "best-effort" by going in person and dropping a copy of the documents (a 2nd copy) into their mail slot. They have a notice on the door (we took a photo) claiming their office is closed until further notice because of COVID-19. In that envelop, we also included a copy of the USPS notice (printed out) stating there was already a 1st attempt made by USPS (along with the tracking). But technically, they could deny that ever happening, which is why we have been using certified mail. I suppose we can send an e-mail now, too (for a 3rd copy).
