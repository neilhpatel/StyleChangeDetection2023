Of course, these days it's a campaign of terror, because Russia has no chance at winning in any other scenario. The public is against them and they are outmatched militarily. For Russia to win, they must outlast Ukraine and Western military aid. For Russia to hold any ground in Ukraine, they must be so terrible to dissenters that the entire population is effectively silenced or utterly destroyed.
The initial plan failed horribly, so now Russia is "forced" to destroy that opportunity for Ukraine.
Yeah yeah, Russia is inept and corrupt, but Ukraine would have been a real goldmine for Russias economy, short and long term.
Why would Russia try and capture Ukraine as intact as possible if not to take its resources? Why would Russia, famously lacking in shipbuilding capacity, go to great lenhs to capture the home of shipbuilding in the USSR? Why would one of the first actions of 2022 be to secure water supply for Crimea.
Getting control of Crimea, and it's water supply was critical to continue using Crimea as a naval base. Getting a hold of its natural gas reserves and rare earth minerals would secure Russian income for decades yet. Taking the farmland would give Russia a real shot at dominating the food supply to large swathes of Africa and Europe, given that Russia and Ukraine is the breadbasket of Europe.
