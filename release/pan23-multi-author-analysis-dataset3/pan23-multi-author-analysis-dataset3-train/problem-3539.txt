Seeing all these Republican appointed judges try to block any liberal legislation makes me really happy that Democrats won the Senate last week. Much wonâ€™t get done with a crazy right wing House but at least Biden can keep getting through lots of judges.
Much won't get done with a zero seat controlled Senate. Even if we retain Warnock that's a one seat majority and Sinema and Manchin will still rule the Senate.
And second, a reminder that this cancelation of debt only helps about 1% of those with student debt.
Making the debt cancelled by bankruptcy would only mean that no one would loan a student money. That would make college only accessible for the wealthy.
It's colleges who are the ones screwing students by overcharging them for degrees that don't pay, not banks or the taxpayer. No one is forcing these students to go to college and willingly enter into bad debt.
Because no bank would loan students with no collateral the money without it. It'd be a no brainer to max out your loans, declare bankruptcy on graduation and just take the hit to your credit.
It simply means that student loans are not eligible for discharge via bankruptcy here. The lender can write them off as in default, but the borrower is stuck with the debt and has little to no recourse.
