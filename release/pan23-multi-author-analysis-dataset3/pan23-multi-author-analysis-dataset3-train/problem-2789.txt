The NYT that predicted Nevada staying Democrat in the senate is still predicting the House to move to a GOP majority. Their statistics have been fairly accurate so far. I don’t think there will be final counts in a lot of the pending races due to a lot of paper ballot counting.
Losing the speakership means losing the power of the purse. Biden has to pony up on negotiation. It’s illogical to think republicans should bow down to his will.
Granted losing the House will force Biden to really negotiate - the House controls appropriations. The filibuster plus Manchin/Silema still make the Senate a tightrope act.
If the senate becomes 51-49 which is slightly favored, It would change the dynamics. It would give room for democrats to vote against things not popular in their state.
Democrats (& those that caucus with them) now have 50/100 and likely 51/100 after the GA runoff. Any ties are broken by the VP which is a Democrat so they control the Senate based on majority.
Democrats will control the senate. If they win the Georgia runoff, they won’t be as reliant on WV Sen Munchin.
