It’s weird how concentrated efforts by all the worlds governments might actually affect the climate.
Of course we didn’t need to change as many things as we do with climate change, but it still proves that it can be done, and that climate nihilism is just as bad as climate denialism.
Yes you are absolutely right we are speeding up the process by .000001% a year that’s how they get away with blaming it all on us, and saying we are the cause of global warming.
Or, and I’m not saying this is the case just a possibility. They look at what’s happening to the ozone/ global climate naturally, and use that to form a narrative to control us. Back around the 70’s they were screaming about a coming ice age. Then global warming. Now just climate change.
This kinda proves that we have no effect on the climate. We haven’t changed shit, also China has actually been pumping out more co2 then ever, and now this ozone is healing. Also California where I live is seeing plenty of rain and is cold. You realize we are coming out of an ice age. Look at the history of out earth’s temperature like I have.
Yeaaaa... we are going into a HEAT age, once all the ice is gone there will be nothing to cool the planet.
We are coming out of an ice age. Look at a chart of all the earth’s past ice ages. It’s hard to find that for some reason, but if you do find one you’ll see we are coming out of an ice age, and it’s not the first time. The global temperature is going to rise a lot more according to the past estimated temperatures throughout earth’s history.
