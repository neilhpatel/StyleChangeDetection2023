You're obviously scandalized by this but you're the exception. I don't get scandalized when Chappelle makes his stereotypical jokes about my groups, but some do. You're conflating jokes with phobia or hate. That's more to do with you.
It's more that he thinks it's funny that people get stuck on a label and just stop thinking about anything else. He said he's team TERF then right away also said he doesn't believe the main premise...
Well, since I commented I see that he’s a self proclaimed TERF. So I’m not going to watch some bigot no matter how funny or insightful he is. That seems fair right?
I can only find news about what he said, but no quotes on what he did say. Can someone actually provide the actual things he said instead of the editorializing of said comments?
I mean, any quote at this point would suffice. I ain’t going to spend over an hour watching a peaked in his 20s now nearly 50 out of touch Chappell to see if I can find controversial quotes. It’s just weird I spent like a good amount of time googling it, but no actual quotes. It leads me to believe that maybe they weren’t that bad.
Kind of rude to think I hadn’t tried that. I’ve read several of these articles, but every one I’ve found only has reaction to or editorializing of the things said. Not a one actually had quotes. Not exactly sure why you wanted to be a fucking asshole about it and contribute absolutely dick all to the discourse. I guess that’s not for me to understand I suppose.
That sound about right. I've watched this special multiple times, the jokes he makes are no more off-color or hateful than the jokes he's made his whole career. Also for a special called "the closer" no one seems to have paid attention to what the closer was, or what that name meant in the context of that special and in fact, this controversy.
