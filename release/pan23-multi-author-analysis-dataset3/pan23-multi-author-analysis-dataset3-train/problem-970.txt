Michigan passed a ballot proposal in 2018 which established an independent commission to redraw our heavily gerymandered maps.
The groundwork for this was laid in 2018 when Michigan voters approved two proposals - Prop 2 created an independent redistricting commission to eliminate gerrymandering and Prop 3 approved same-day registration and no-reason absentee voting.
In Michigan we can create constitutional proposals through simple majority ballot proposals (its actually pretty hard to get the proposals on the ballots). From my understanding this isn't true in a lot of other states. But that is how we created an Independent Redistricting Commission, which in turn created the districts.
In Michigan (for the first time), both federal Congressional districts, and state house and senate districts were drawn by an independent voter commission that was mandated to make the districts competitive. It also helped that in 2018 not only did we pass the "Redistricting Proposal" but also a "Voter Rights Proposal" (we passed another voter rights proposal this election too).
4 years back we also passed a lot of voting measures like same day registration, automatic registration, expanded absentee voting, etc.
