Only read the headlines? Carter inherited a decade+ of monetizing the debt to pay for 'Nam from LBJ, Nixon and Ford. The Fed refused to continue this practice and when the US had to borrow to pay for the worthless war, it literally sucked up all the available cash, reducing the supply of money for other borrowers, who (like happens in times of serious shortage) drove the price of money (interest rates) thru the roof, and the price of everything else followed the money.
Ronny's suck the rich taxscam drove inflation and unemployment back to near record highs and more than TRIPLED the National Debt (+340%). Reagan's economic policy had four key pillars: reducing government spending, slashing taxes, reducing regulations, and tightening the monetary supply through higher interest rates, all of which shifted the burden of "fixing" the economy on to the backs of bottom 90%.
It's also worth noting that Reagan's tax cuts helped stimulate economic growth, created new job opportunities and allowed for more disposable income for consumers, all of which contributed to a more robust and healthy economy.
In short, while Reagan's policies may not have been perfect, it's not accurate to paint him as solely responsible for the state of the economy and ignore the broader context of his presidency.
In short, while Reagan's economic policies were certainly not without flaws, it's not accurate to simplify the complex economic realities of his presidency and lay all the blame at his feet.
Sure, his policies had some negative consequences, including an increase in the national debt, but it's not fair to lay all the blame at his feet. There were many macroeconomic and geopolitical factors at play during his presidency, and to simplify the complex economic realities of his time in office and place all the blame on him is not accurate.
