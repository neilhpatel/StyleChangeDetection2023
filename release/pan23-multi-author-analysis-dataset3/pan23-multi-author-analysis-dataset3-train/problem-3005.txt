I don't think you need an attorney at this point, but you are right, something very bad is happening and the local police are complicit.
I'd think the opposite is true. It is such a large and successful company that if they found one of their affiliates using their name on their signs were fencing stolen cars they'd take action.
The big difference here is that the company was on notice that the car was stolen. They're probably not covered by the pawn laws on stolen property, but it might apply.
Third, if the car is being held in California, have you talked to the police in that jurisdiction? At the very least the dealership is in possession of stolen property.
You follow up with your insurance company and say, "The car I reported stolen is still stolen. I want you to make me whole." It's their problem. Take the money and use it as a down payment for a new car.
I wonder if you can just have your car back without paying anything or getting another loan. $2500 is not enough for your troubles. Itâ€™s not your fault that they paid your loan. I would just send them a demand letter requesting the return of stolen property.
