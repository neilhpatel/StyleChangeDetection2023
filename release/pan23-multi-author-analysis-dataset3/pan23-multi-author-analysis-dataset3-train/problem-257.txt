It has been studied. Quite extensively actually. Take for example the "official table of drops" developed by the British but still used where hanging is a common execution. It outlines the correct lenh of rope to use in relation to a victims weight to ensure a broken neck, and far less painful death, than asphyxiation.
Allowing someone’s weight to drop and break their neck instantly is a lot less barbaric than lifting them up by the neck with a noose and allowing them to struggle in agony for the last minutes of their life.
I take it back. Let’s be lenient on the Iranian regime. They who are willing to murder protestors in cold blood, who consider women whores for not wearing a cloth on their head, who rape women who have been jailed for crimes against a god who doesn’t exist, who torture people with car batteries. These people should be forgiven.
To clarify, I think the people responsible for these atrocities should be subject to a fair trial for their crimes, but I would not be sad to see those found to be guilty of the most severe transgressions executed.
Right (and let me just clarify in my version of the law for the death penalty it would need to be damn near iron clad guilty, ie caught on camera, dna evidence and no doubt of guilt. ).
Child Rape, Child Murder, any non justifiable homicide (ie not manslaughter where its accidental or self defence), just straight up murder, rape….pretty much the worst crimes you can think of.
And its not a good argument you are as bad as a child rapist or murderer because you demand they pay the ultimate price for the worst crimes ever. I don’t believe that and never will.
