This is a really tricky subject that is heavily debated. There are some who argue that oral history can go back very far (much farther than written history) and there are those that argue that it only reflects a few decades.
I'm sure people could provide some more examples of detailed and specific oral history from more recent times, but since you asked about just how far back oral history knowledge can go, I hope this gives you an idea.
As a follow-up: I've heared (can't remeber where) that certain cultures (I think it was in Western Africa, but I'm not sure) that have a very precise and formalised form of oral history, with certain people in the culture/trible being selected to keep the history from generation to generation.
There is also an effect noticed in some African cultures that don't have our concept of history that use stories of the past to explain the present, those stories usually claim to be old and unchanged but can change dramatically within a few years as the circumstances change.
The Iliad and Odyssey show one problem many scholars attest oral history: it changes, things get swapped out because someone makes a mistake or because they aren't understood any longer in the current society.
