Yes as /u/C1awed said this is a custody issue. The mom needs to prove to the court the “fucked up” parts that means your friend shouldn’t have to see/talk to him.
What you’re describing is friend doesn’t want to have to have anything to do with her father. That’s not what emancipation is. That’s for minors living independent life to formalize that situation.
Emancipation is to allow minors who are already living independently to act as adults and protect their financial interests.
If there is no custody agreement, then L and her mother simply don't have to communicate with L's father.
If there is a custody agreement that requires L to spend a certain amount of time with her father, then L's mother needs to go back to court to revise it.
L's best and only real option is for mom to go back to court, preferably with a lawyer, and ask for the custody agreement to be amended in light of the abuse.
Partial emancipation from one parent but not the other isn't a thing. It's all or nothing. What sort of trouble has L been going through with her father? Is she financially independent?
