Except if NATO finds out they are trying to get nukes before they actually have them, they will have a hot war on their doorstep approximately instantly. They have got to either be really confident in their sneak skill or be kinda dumb.
If Iran wants a nuke they are going to have to get it so secretly that the West doesn't know until it's far too late, or else they will get schwacked hard.
Russia doesn't want a hot war with the West, they know the only chance they have is nukes and if they used that button the country would cease to exist unless they fired everything... Because using only one nuke would invoke the world's wrath.
And yes, nukes are the only reason that Russia is not flying a NATO flag right now.. Nuclear weapons are fantastic at making sure you never get invaded ever, even if your military is defunct.
So even in the off chance that Russia sold nukes or nuke tech to Iran, they wouldn't defend Iran from the consequences if the world found out...
No they are not or else they would have shut down Iran selling Russians missiles. To be honest they have done almost nothing lately. Their silence is deafening.
