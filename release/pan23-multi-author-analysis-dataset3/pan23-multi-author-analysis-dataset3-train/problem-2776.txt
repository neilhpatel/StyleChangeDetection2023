There is a right to be secure in one's body, health, person, and possessions... The last of which was violated by stealing the man's property, which secured his rights to the first 3.
I can (legally) act to stop someone from harming me (or an innocent other person, in most places in the USA). If the attacker is threatening my life, I can do anything (including using deadly force) to stop that attack. Once the threat to my life has stopped, I am no longer allowed to use deadly force.
This has nothing to do with "judge, jury, & executioner" (which implies a long period of deliberation) and everything to do with the actions of the person threatening my life. If the criminal did not attack, I would do nothing to him. If the criminal stopped attacking when he saw that I could protect myself, I would do nothing to him. The responsibility for him being injured or killed is entirely his. He chose to commit a violent crime, he accepted the potential consequences.
He committed a serious offense. He is facing a considerable prison sentence. This isn't the time for hand wringing about whether or not the law is "reasonable" in your opinion. It is still the law.
