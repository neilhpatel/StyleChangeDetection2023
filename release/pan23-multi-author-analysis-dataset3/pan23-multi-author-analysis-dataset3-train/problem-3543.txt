He should hire a criminal defense attorney immediately, and follow his attorney's advice. He should not discussing this with anyone except his attorney, including you. He should definitely not speak to the police at all without his attorney present.
He needs to not speak to the police, at all, and hire a criminal defense attorney. That he told you this (hard to believe) story is a bad sign, meaning, he's telling people things and confessing things that will be used against him in court. And this is an extremely serious criminal matter, he was not arrested for "innuendo.".
If he was arrested upon arrival there was no minor child. If he did want to have sex with minor child would he admit it to you though? And who accepts an invitation from a man pimping out his daughter, of whatever age? Legally speaking he needs to follow the instructions of his criminal defense attorney, that's how he has a shot of getting out of this.
His explanation story to you is not credible, but regardless, he shouldn't be telling you stories. You could conceivably be called to testify against him (or for him, and be cross-examined). He needs to only speak to his criminal defense attorney.
