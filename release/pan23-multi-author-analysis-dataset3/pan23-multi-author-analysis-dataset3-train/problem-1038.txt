A sizable minority (100,000) of Crimeans fled and were replaced by Russians. Other Crimeans live next door to the Russian military, and under their watch.
Which people of Crimea? The Crimean Tartars who were forcibly relocated from Crimea by the Soviet Union in the 50's? The Ukrainians displaced by Russia's 2014 invasion? Or the Ethnic Russian settlers who've moved there over the last decade?
You mean the Russian elite that moved into stolen houses? No one gives a shit. When you catch the cowardly thieves who stole your shit, you don't let them keep it because they really really like it. They should be shot.
Those aren't the people currently living there. The people who were not pro Russian were displaced and murdered. Obviously they didn't want to be Russian and wouldn't vote that way which is why they were replaced.
This was a war of conquest and you can't award a conquerer land when they lose or it turns that conquest into a victory. Putin won't get shit. Maybe he could have kept Crimea if he didn't push his luck and attempted to conquer all of Ukraine and threaten to do the same to everyone in Europe. It's too late for that now. They have to go.
