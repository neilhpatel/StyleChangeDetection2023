Thanks for the insight! They didn't give us a hard copy of the HOA rules and regulations (everything they have sent us has been in email - and I have no record of the R&Rs), but did mention in passing when we received the keys to the property, that they could be found on the HOA website. Would that be regarded as making us aware of them?
Also to note - the infraction we were fined for was very minor and easy to miss. If we were forwarded that initial warning letter in March we would have corrected the issue within that same day. So I'm wondering if we can bring that up in case we need to dispute it in court.
However the property management did not supply the letter that was sent in March so I can't say how long the grace period was - assuming it was up until the fine was issued in October. We did mention that in our email to prop mgmt today saying that we dispute the fine due to this reason.
Yes from a previous experience with the HOA, they do provide a grace period for infractions - from the context of the letter that was forwarded to us, it seems like the initial warning was in March as they refer to a previous hearing regarding the fine in the letter that we received.
For the infraction, did the original communication from the HOA include a grace period to rectify the situation? Not all HOAs give warnings, so that could be irrelevant. But if there was, then you'd definitely want to bring that up.
A court would probably find that telling you where to find the regulations is sufficient, but California has some unique laws on the books.
