Two leading problems with this identification is in the way the painting - if that myth is intended - turns its back on the story. In the Roman myth, Saturn (Cronus in the Greek myth) responds to a prophesy that says he will be overthrown, removed from power by one of his sons. He resolves, consequently, to swallow each of his children after immediately after birth - swallowed whole, so the infant survives to descend into the gut of Saturn. Rhea (Ops/Opis in Roman mythology), the wife of Saturn, decides to deceive her husband by presenting him with a stone in swaddling in place of her sixth child, Jupiter, whom she hides. Jupiter is then able to mature and force his father to disgorge Jupiter's five siblings. He then dethrones his father and takes his place as the head of a new order of gods.
by Goya (1746-1828) is a complex, problematic piece of art - problematic largely because of issues around its identification and interpretation. The short answer to your question is that no one can be sure if the myth about Saturn devouring his infant offspring actually inspired the painting.
You outline the reasons art historians have doubts about the scene depicted in the painting, but what was that led them to believe it was "Saturn Devouring His Son" in the first place? Did they just see a giant eating someone and decide "that's got to be a reference to Roman mythology"?
