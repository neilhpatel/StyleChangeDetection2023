Under Kentucky's Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Law, month-to-month leases must be terminated with a 30-day written notice of termination.
You are free to negotiate. They do not want to go thru the expensive (time and money) process of an actual eviction. So tell them that you need until XX Date and see where it goes.
It sounds like you may now be on a month-to-month tenancy. How much notice they need to give you depends on where you are located. Most states require advance notice of 30 days, a few 60 days, and I think there is one state with as little as 7 days.
So in Kentucky, 30 days is standard and legal (and required) to end a tenancy. One of the main points of a one-year lease is that your tenancy is guaranteed for that year as long as you pay rent and don't break any laws or violate the lease. Once a year-long (or similar) lease ends, most tenancies convert to "month to month" if you don't re-sign a year-long lease. So instead of a 12 month lease, you're now on a 1 month lease that renews each month... unless either you, or they, choose to end it. Which they've done. A few states have extra protections for "month to month" renters, but most don't, and Kentucky doesn't. However, just try to talk to management and try to negotiate for an additional month. It'll be up to them, but they might agree. What you do NOT want to do is to overstay, then you become a holdover tenant and can be taken to court, and it will wreck your credit and make it hard to rent again.
