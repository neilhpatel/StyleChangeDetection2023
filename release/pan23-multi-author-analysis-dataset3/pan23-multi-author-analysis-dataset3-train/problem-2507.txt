This is how Russia officially takes over Belarus without firing a shot. Sure Putin already controls Belarus for the most part but he will slowly build up forces there and annex it to Russia eventually for a publicity win.
And yet Belarus still isn’t a full party to the conflict, so after defeating the early attempt to take Kiev, Ukraine has been able to focus troops and resources on fighting the Russians in the east and northeast.
The fact that Ukraine hasn’t been regularly carrying out strikes on Belarus for the whole last year should be proof that Ukrainian command also thinks that passing up targeting Russian assets based in Belarus is worth avoiding pulling them fully into the invasion.
When they get used to bomb Ukraine and Ukraine retaliates by firing missiles at the airfields used to launch the attack, it draws Belarus into the war, opening another front in the North, something Ukraine does not need.
belarus hasnt gotten involved with their army yep, given that they need that to pacify their own country, sending it to ukraine would be bad for them. Ukraine attacking them now wouldnt make much sense as you said.
