Respectfully, you don't. Check out the amount of misinformation that's on r/history or check out some of the threads on r/badhistory about that.
1) By far, most of the posts you see that are removed in popular threads are people asking why all the comments are removed (or some version of "what happened here" or the ever-_hilarious_ [removed] as a comment). They aren't serious attempts at an answer that we're removing for being off base.
There's a difference between removed and deleted comments. Subreddit moderators can remove comments, which hides them from view. Deleted comments are deleted by the person who left them.
Most of what we remove is as said above off topic chatter about the number of comments that are removed.
Trust me, we would LOVE to have no posts which are a see of removed comments, but that is a problem rather than one specific to our subreddit.
A majority of the comments removed are things like links to wikipedia, telling the OP to google the answer themselves, or asking why all the comments are removed. Then you get the snarky comments, jokes, failures to read about how the RemindMeBot works, etc.
