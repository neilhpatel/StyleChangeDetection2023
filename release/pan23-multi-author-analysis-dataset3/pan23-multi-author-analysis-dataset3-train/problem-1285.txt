My personal bet is that there is enough kompromat on the "careers" and "firebrands" that disclosure of party Secrets would be mutually assured destruction at this point.
That said, for all of those sitting on a pink Cloud expecting the Republicans to tear each other apart, please recognize that a lot of their opinion programming is based off of controlling the narrative and using kayfabe to entertain their audience. This "brawl" is likely to last for a very short period but I don't expect it to be long before they get their act together and we are back to the traditional articles about Dems in disarray.
Trump is about to take a heel turn and DeSantis is going to be the face. The question is how hard the Republican Party turns on Trump and whether they will abandon him when it comes to criminal and civil issues.
And now that much of the establishment GOP is pissed off at Trump, who knows, they might just nudge things forward to push Trump into DOJâ€™s trap!
When they release the shit they have on Trump (much like they did with Cawthorn), to turn public opinion, I wonder if Trump fires back?
