Based on our current understanding of Israelite origins, the Israelites did not come to the southern Levant. Rather, they developed out of the native Canaanite population of the Levant.
When the Israelites came to the southern Levant in the 13th century BCE, they found an already thriving civilization there: Canaan. While the people of the region never formed an empire of their own, they did share a common culture and viewed each other as (at least culturally) related. Since they sat at the crossroads of many great empires, like Assyria, Egypt, the Hittites and Mittani, they were also frequently subjugated or at least tributaries to these foreign powers.
Thus "the land where milk and honey flows" became synonymous for the phoenician coast, which was somewhat safe from external influences, which is a feature of supreme importance for a people like the Israelites, who had their share of experiences with being enslaved and displaced. They weren't some extremely desirable luxury goods, but where used to describe a region which was wealthy and also comparatively safe for Israelites to be in. This got passed down to the Hebrews and later to Christians and Muslims, as a saying for a "promised land", divorced of its original meaning.
My main source for this is "Auf den Spuren versunkener Reiche" (original title: "Historia de la Humanidad").
