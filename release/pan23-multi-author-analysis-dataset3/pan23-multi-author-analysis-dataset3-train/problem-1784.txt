Excellent answer, than you. Would you mind going into more detail about why the Reagan administration wanted to repeal the Mental Health Systems Act? Was it typical anti-government Reaganomics, or did they have better reasons than "gubmint bad?".
. . . what I haven't seen is a time series with comparable methodology that gives me confidence to answer the question that I think you're asking (or that I ask) "if we still had State hospitals, how many of the people in prison would be in a mental institution instead?".
The hospitals were run by the States, not by the Federal government-- so Administration action couldn't really "empty" institutions they didn't control. What they could and did do was fail to provide funding needed to make deinstitutionalization work. And, critically, the States didn't have the policy capacity --nor the political inclination- to design a system of community mental health services.
Speaking as someone from NZ, a country much smaller than the USA, why would US states in the 1970s generally lack policy capacity or political inclination to design a system of community mental health services? Even the smallest states could presumably copy from the larger ones, it's not like there's a language barrier or the massive distances to cover like there are between Pacific Island countries.
