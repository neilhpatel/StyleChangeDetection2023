I'm always amazed and touched at the assistance being offered to Ukraine by countries that I would have assumed did not give a flying fuck about what is happening there.
I am an Aussie and 100% behind Ukraine but I also hope that Russian people don't suffer, but for me there is no middle ground at the moment.
If people want to prevent a third world war, helping Ukraine win this war is by far the best way to do that.
My point was that Ukraine is effectively at war with Russia and so is doing what other countries have done in times of war. I do understand the US not wanting Russia to think that the US was / is behind the assassination of Russia generals but I think that if it was Ukraine acting on Ukraine intelligence, then they didnâ€™t do anything wrong.
This might be an optimistic view for the Ukrainians, but equally, thinking they're setting up for an invasion from there would also be an optimistic view for the Russians.
Even though I view anything he says with a handful of salt, this logically seems about right if we consider how many mobilised in Ukraine we've been seeing reports of.
That makes some sense as an idea, but given Ukraine's consistency in being very careful with advances, even into abandoned areas, I don't think it'd be successful, and I doubt Russia would either. On top of that Ukraine has access to drones and western satellites that can scout ahead of them.
