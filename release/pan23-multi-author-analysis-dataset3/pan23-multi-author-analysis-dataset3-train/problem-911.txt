Credit isn't really a thing with copyright or trademark law. Either she has the right to sell the items or she does not. If she's reselling stuff she already bought that's fine. If she licensed the stuff she's fine. With 2,500,000 subscribers it's unlikely the brands don't know about her.
She also get's a very low amount of views for the amount of subscribers she has, and is not mainstream at all, so they most likely don't know of her. Plus, her audience is mostly children who wouldn't know to look and see if it's a different brand or anything.
Yeah I assume she doesn't have a contract with them, because she never says any other company names and she changes the names of the product. Like the company could call it a "intergalactic space invader" but she would sell it as "galaxy alien." She also covers up most of the companies logos on the tags with a sticker with her logo on it.
Thank you! The â€œSelection of designs by ---" thing is kinda tricky marketing I guess, because most of her audience is children who will only hear/understand "designs by ---." That banner has been there since I watched her as a kid, but back then, she was only selling merch that was her own designs like bracelets or shirts with her name on it, nothing from other companies.
