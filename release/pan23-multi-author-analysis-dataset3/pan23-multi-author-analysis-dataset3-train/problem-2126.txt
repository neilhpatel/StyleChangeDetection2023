He'll be in for quite the surprise when every western intelligence agency with a spy is standing at the back door waiving back at him, but... that's for another day.
I agree. I also agree it's the kind of spectacular non-nuclear move he might attempt right before trying to disappear from Russia, as the chaos of the Russo-Belarussian Civil War would make a lot of noise for him to try to slip under on his way out the back door.
And of course, Belarus will see this and try to fight back, and the whole thing will turn into a huge civil war.
If Russia did annex Belarus and tried to turn the Belarusian army on Ukraine, expect rebellion/civil war.
And just a note on relevance: Russia is invading ukraine and annexing territory. I’m not looking for examples like “China is investing in other countries as a means of soft power”.
The majority of gladiator fights that have ever occurred in history have been generally popular. But it’s pretty fair to say if they happened now, they wouldn’t be popular. The thing is, as they become less generally popular, they happen less. So the historical average of how popular they are isn’t relevant.
