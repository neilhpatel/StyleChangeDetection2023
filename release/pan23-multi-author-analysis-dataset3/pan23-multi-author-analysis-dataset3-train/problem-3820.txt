The mistake gardeners make growing onions is only planting sweet ("Vidalia") onion. Those are tasty but need to be used within a couple of months of harvest.
If you're growing for long term storage you need to be growing a storage onion, usually a yellow variety like Copra.
Onion is one of the things I never thought of growing in the garden because I could get them cheaply and in large quantities.
I can buy a kg of half rotten locally farm grown onions for $1.5 ... (even the ones that look ok, still smell rotten.. usually won't last more than 2-3 days).
I can buy a kg of standard sized supermarket onions from one of the two chains in my city for either $0.8 or $1.2 ...
Lately I've pretty much given up on using onions in cooking, I will mostly eat a small one raw with a little salt or sliced in a salad, and that's it. Given the current prices, it doesn't make much sense. Peppers and garlic saved the day for me, don't really miss onions.
Let them increase the price as much as they want, I'll just stop buying it. They can stick their onions somewhere.
So there are going to be shortages of onions and many other crops this year. And early indications are that 2023 will be another year of drought and extreme weather in most of the northern hemisphere food exporting countries, so food shortages are probably going to get worse this year.
