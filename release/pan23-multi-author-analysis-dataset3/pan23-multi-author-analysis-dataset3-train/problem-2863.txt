The general rule is that a pet owner is liable for harms caused by their pet -- unless there is clear evidence of provocation or mishandling of the animal. This would also be governed at least in part by your agreement with the kennel -- like whether or not the staff accepted responsibility for animals that would need to be muzzled, or something like that.
In the agreement that I signed with the kennel, they clearly state that if an animal is injured, the owner will be notified and the dog taken to a vet at the owner's expense. It also requires the owner (me) to acknowledge that "nicks, cuts, and scrapes are a normal part of dog boarding.".
I also am wondering, because I don't know anything about this, if strict liability applies when he had never bitten or shown vicious propensities before. As I live in NY state, I am aware there is a "one bite rule" for dogs, but I don't fully understand it.
OK apparently NY follows the "one bite rule" -- meaning that an owner isn't liable for injury if the dog has never bitten anyone before. I guess that works out to your benefit here. IDK if this incident will count as the "one bite" going forward, but I would imagine it does. It wouldn't be tied to there being a record of a prior attack -- it would be the owner being asked in court "has your dog ever bitten anyone in the past".
I didn't see anything about mandatory euthanasia, and given NY is a one-bite jurisdiction it seems unlikely that it would be mandatory for a dog that has not bitten anyone before.
