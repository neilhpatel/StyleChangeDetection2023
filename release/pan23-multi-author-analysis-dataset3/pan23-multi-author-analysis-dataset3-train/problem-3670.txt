You must follow CA handgun transfer laws through a licensed FFL and you must have a background check done and you must posses a CA firearms safety certificate card. You must not bring the 17 round magazines that come with it into california because that's a felony. Your friend has to follow her handgun transfer laws where ever she is located.
If this was a civilian pistol I would know how to transfer it as I've done it many times with family weapons using a FFL dealer. It sounds like this might not be possible for military weapons though given the responses in this thread.
To be honest, I really don't know how this works at all, which is why I'm reaching out. I don't want to do anything that breaks the law.
I'm not sure exactly how it works. She said she essentially has to buy it but she has no choice in the matter. She compared it to the saber she gets for the dress uniform but said that one is only rented. The pistol has to be actually owned.
Who is giving her the pistol? To my knowledge the military doesn't give out gifts, they may issue a firearm but it remains the property of the military, not the individual it was given to.
To be super clear, with very few exceptions, weapons fall into the controlled equipage classification of government property and aren't privately owned. There are serious reasons why you don't expect servicemembers to maintain or own their duty weapons that I won't get into now. When weapons are issued to servicemembers, they're checked back into an armory at the end of a watch or operation.
