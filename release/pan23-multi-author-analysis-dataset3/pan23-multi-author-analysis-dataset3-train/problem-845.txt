Something got lost in translation, because a standard template won't fit this nonstandard situation. The lease needs to explicitly define what the renters do not have access to, and what they do.
You can let the owner know you screwed up and that they can't stay there, or their friends. Or negotiate with the current tenants. For example, ask them if they'll sign a new lease with a 50% discount that does allow X number of days for the owner. Sounds like a long shot. Right now the owner is violating the lease and violating the tenants' rights.
Who wrote the initial lease? Whoever did that, presumably screwed up. And this is not an eviction, this is sort of the opposite. Your management company needs to speak to counsel. There are a number of legal principles being violated here, it would appear, from a violation of the lease to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, among other possibilities. Your counsel needs to review the lease.
The lease is our standard template and was reviewed and approved by our lawyer. Even though we may have screwed up the lease, is there anything we can do? We're considering adding a different address to the guest suite, like a "B" or something to the door, so that it would be 123 address B. We're worried about the repercussions from the owner.
