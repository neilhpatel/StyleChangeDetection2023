Russia will probably never let that happen. Sure they can get thrown out of Ukraine with enough Western help, but the ever-present threat of yet another invasion, and probably constant bombardments will rule out any large scale investment into the country. And nobody can physically touch Russia because they have nukes.
Unless Russia is willing to start a nuclear war over the issue they'll never pose a conventional military threat to Ukraine again. Or so long as NATO exists anyway.
Lots of good land there, and tens of millions of people are going be displaced by climate change in the coming years. They might not be ethnic Ukrainians, but Ukraine will likely see quite a population boom.
Niece In Dortmund Germany says her city has seen a big influx of Ukrainians in the last 2 weeks. There were some before this but now accelerating.
Many won’t return. Ukrainians never had free movement to live and work in Western European countries. Now they do without having to meet EU and Shengen block standards. There’s no way, even if and when the conflict ends that countries like Germany can force them out.
Germany officially has about a million Ukrainian refugees but that number could quadruple this winter if Putin keeps destroying infrastructure..
It wasn’t ‘free movement’. Ukrainians need apply for positions etc just like an American. It didn’t mean they could just decide to move to Berlin next week. Now they can.
