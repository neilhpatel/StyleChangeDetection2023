I know your answer is over 40 days old now, but I just wanted to ask out of curiosity: How did they keep people in line? Surely there must have been people who wanted to cheat the system or accrue extra privileges. How did they punish them? Was it public execution or some sort of exile?
Also, were women held to the same responsibilities as men? Or was each family unit expected to provide a certain amount of labour and it didnâ€™t matter who did the service?
However, it's also likely that different communities gave their labour at different times. So, for example, farmers would work for the Inca after the harvest was finished.
This work might have been to fabricate Vicunya garments for the Inca, it may have been for building roads or bridges, serving in the military, or making weapons. The tribute would be distributed to local warehouses, where it would then be distributed to where it needed to be. It might be that llama wool was woven into nets in one area, to be eventually moved across to a coastal city for use in fishing. The fabricator typically wouldn't leave their home further than the local warehouse to deposit these goods. (Unless they were called to serve somewhere specifically, like a construction project or military campaign.).
Sort of. I think most would prefer to term it the Inka political economy. The giving or expectation of repaying things was the point of entry into a larger redistributive system that was ultimately unequal, primarily benefiting the Inka elite and their associated descendant lineages (panaqas).
