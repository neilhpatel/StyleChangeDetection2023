Call your insurance and they should handle everything for you, that’s what you pay them for. I’ve always gone through my insurance with everhtbing and have never had to contact other peoples insurance and they’ve always made sure I’m taken care of correctly.
It does. Even if the other insurance doesn’t pay out your insurance should. Do you have insurance for uninsured motorists? Like I had an accident where my car was parked in a parking garage and caught fire because of another car. My insurance paid me out for my car and everything before even going after the responsible party’s insurance and then reimbursed me my deductible like 3 years after (when they got their money from the other persons insurance).
But regardless of the tire company, the other cars insurance should be paying for damages to you anyways since their car did hit your car and that persons insurance is supposed to figure out if they can get money from the tire company. You need to get the full information from your insurance about it because it sounds kind of weird to me.
What insurance coverages do you have? Do you have comp, collision, and liability? Or do you have just liability?
Since you said it was your insurance that is refusing to honor a claim... you can also file the claim through the at fault driver's insurance instead of your own.
Your own insurance is denying the claim based on it being the tire manufacturers fault? That doesn't sound right in any way shape or form. Knowing the state that this takes place in might make a difference, but your state should have some department or agency that handles complaints against insurance companies. If not you could try lodging a complaint with the Attorney's General Office.
Exactly. The tire not being covered is a problem for the other party's insurance. Which is who your insurance should be talking to. That is, unless the other party was uninsured obviously.
