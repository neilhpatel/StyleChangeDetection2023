It's not a salary, it's disability pension. Also retierment pension is not much higher. And many people here work unofficially for lower than minimal salaries. My mother works officially, on the government job, she receives 270$... or used to, before payments was cut during the war. Now it's only part of those money.
Since only woman are allowed to leave (with few exceptions that are mostly oligarchs and their friends) it's almost certain that many have left someone behind. And since the sums you can earn in developed countries in month can be enough to life for years in Ukraine (my month income here is 60$, it's barely survivable, but twice as much would be already nice), they are most likely sending something to help those who stayed.
Right now - of course not. But they were MUCH better before the revolution. And not only them, but total economic sutiation in country, that allowed to get at least something but food.
It won't improve, not with current regime. I live on disability pension, and it only became smaller with new government.
I am from the UK, believe me, disability benefits are cut to the bone with the present right wing government. You don't want to wish in a right wing pro russian party over the centralist one you have at the moment .
