If any of this is even a smidge bad for biden, it just means trumps was 100x worse. It’s weird but it’ll work on Republican voters to believe biden is wrong but trump is ok because facts honestly don’t matter anymore for them.
My conservative family members are already telling me how “Biden’s doc situation is way worse than Trump’s!” I think the false equivalency machine is working as intended so far on the right.
This feels disingenuous, CNN was saying trump stole nuclear secrets and committed treason, none of which were true, Republicans making fun of biden for doing the exact same thing seems pretty justified.
Actually since Trump has such a powerful mind he accidentally declassified the Biden documents when he was thinking about all the documents he needed to psychically declassify. . He had intended to only include the Mar-a-Lago documents but instead used the overly broad "all documents stored in unapproved locations tag".
Trump is the one who notified the press about the search of his Mar-a-Lago residence. If he hadn't gone public and cooperated (even at that point) the whole documents scandal might have gone unnoticed. There is a good chance that the Biden team did a pre-emptive sweep for any documents to head off GOP investigations. Unfortunately they did discover some classified documents. Assuming the possession was inadvertent, at a minimum it indicates better procedures need to be put in place for outgoing politicians and "their" property.
Trump "Truthed" asking when the FBI is going to raid the White House (along with other Biden residences). How stupid do you have to be to include the White House in a list of places you suspect of improperly housing classified documents?
