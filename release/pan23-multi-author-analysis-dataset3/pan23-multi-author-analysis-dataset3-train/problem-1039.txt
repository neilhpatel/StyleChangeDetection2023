You say you bought the house, but did you really? Is the deed in your name? Do you have a signed contract from either of them? Did you get title insurance? Did it close? If you can't say yes to all of these then you did not buy this house yet. There is a reason that you close at a title company or real estate attorney. You don't just give the owner money. I really hope you didn't just give the owner money. Get a real estate attorney, now.
But yeah you're going to need a lawyer who specializes in real estate and who is maybe reasonably well versed in local divorce law.
For instance if the husband was selling the house as the executor of the estate then the wife may not have any signing interest in the house that she needs to sign away.
If it's not a community property state and he's the soul inheritor then no one needs her signature and their dispute has nothing to do with you and your purchase of the house.
If it's a community property state and the title was transferred from a mother to the son that's your worst possible outcome for ending up with the property.
