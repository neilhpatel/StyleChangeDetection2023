Thats the thing i wish people would understand. If holding a liberal position gained him popularity thats exactly what he would do. Trump is too self-centred to actually give a shit about “the gays”, or any other social issue. He just says and does what gets his base riled up to keep himself relevant. He would run as a socialist Bernie type if he knew that would get him more votes.
Trump is rotten but Desantis is way worse. He actually believes the crap he spews and is far less concerned with perception. Thats dangerous as shit.
This should scare people. Trump was an absolute moron who had no idea how to enact his agenda. DeSantis is smart, cunning, and ruthless. If there’s ever a time to come out in droves and vote Democrat, it’ll be in next year’s election.
Look how well the Dems performed in the midterms. This is how off course the GOP is with their horseshit, the fact that the Dems barely lost the House with this economic situation is incredible.
If the Dems lose in 2024 it will be because the economy craters or something else catastrophic. DeSantis himself cannot beat Biden, he’ll need the help of some realllllly bad economic problems. Here’s hoping the country is doing better with inflation and whatnot by Election Day 2024.
He doesn’t have the charisma that Trump had in 2016. He’s actually boring af to listen to. He will not have the national rally populist appeal Trump had. The bar is just a lot lower at the state level. He grabs headlines with his anti-LGBT and anti-black history, book banning bullshit. There’s no way that shit will appeal at a national level enough to win an election.
