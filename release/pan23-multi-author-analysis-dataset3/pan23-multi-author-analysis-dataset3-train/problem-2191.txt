The is a good lead up to an answer, but what techniques were discovered during the industrial revolution that made salt production easy/cheap enough for it to become abundant?
Salt is actually extremely plentiful on Earth, it's just that you need (somewhat) modern technology and chemistry to unlock most of the deposits. That doesn't mean they are economically viable as production tends to be concentrated to wherever salt is the cheapest to produce. But if civilization collapses you probably don't need to worry about your next salt ration. Toilet paper on the other hand...
The salt swamps along the Bay of Bourgneuf on the Atlantic coast of France is the northern limit for solar evaporation as a viable means of producing salt. There have been attempts but they keep failing, e.g. the weather in Normandy turns out to be too rainy and so on.
Modern salt mining has more in common with fracking than traditional mining. You drill holes to a salt deposit that can be deep underground, pump down water to dissolve the salt and then pump up the resulting brine through another set of pipes. Much cheaper than constructing shafts and employing miners.
