It’s funny because if you call say bmw or Volkswagen or any modern vehicle a car than calling this piece of shit a car as well is like comparing wright brothers early machine to let’s say F16. It’s not even the same scale, like that moskvich dump will potentially have zero safety features, I would be surprised if seatbelts are present. In terms of traction control systems again zero, engine will probably be shared with some tractors they still produce, bodywork will start rusting on the production line… Russians have no access to western technology, whatever they can copy or steal they will use but it’s still going to be a total disaster. It’s still funny to watch because it’s amazing how fucked up putin regime is and Russians still don’t seem to protest. Like the standards of living over there are plummeting but they still have fun, I guess Russians are really different breed altogether.
Of course, if things deteriorate enough, Russian citizens have a history of being quite “energetic” in their demands for change.
Amongst the various interesting bits is that the pilot had previously complained that Adm. Spiridonov (and others) had been using the military transport to smuggle various goods back home. These included spare parts for the admirals Moskvich automobile.
All of it because the senior officers were part of a system that permitted/encouraged a profoundly mismanaged economic reality. Basic needs such as toilet paper, sausages, fruits and vegetables were not widely available. So trips to Moscow or Leningrad meant the opportunity - and obligation - to get needed goods.
