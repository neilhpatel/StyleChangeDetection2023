It means balancing the budget, not spending more then you earn, reducing debt, things like that. If “fiscally conservative” was a person, they’d be a person that saves their money until they have enough to pay cash for a car, rather than a person that takes out a loan to buy a car.
Basically, I was trying to convey that on fiscal or financial matters, I tend to favor more conservative policies. Conservatives are generally considered Republicans and liberals are generally considered Democrats. (Here in the US).
Yeah, another post mentioned the GOP as not being very fiscally responsible, and I'm inclined to agree. I was frustrated enough during one of the Republican primaries (I think it was 2008? Maybe 2012) where a question was asked about a plan that was 10 to 1 spending cuts for tax increases and would they vote for it. So, for every dollar of tax increase, $10 of spending cuts. Not a single candidate was in favor. I'm screaming in my head thinking "are you serious?? You wouldn't even entertain the idea??".
Here is the thing. From what I can tell we aren't giving these tribes enough money and resources to be sustainable. Poverty causes child abuse this I've seen time and again. That isn't excusing the behavior, but maybe if life wasn't so hard children wouldn't suffer as much. Perhaps the child could be brought to local authorities and evidence directly given, or perhaps they could call in tribal police in that instance and refuse to leave until they show up. Your right there are nightmare scenarios that none of us want to deal with, and being helpless in the face of that situation must be beyond difficult.
