But it was the school who requested the no trespass notice to be issued and now they are letting him on grounds with a felony case still open against him.
The notice hasn’t been recinded though. And if he was worried how the kid would get to school he shouldn’t have attcked.
The school didn't tell him he can't come near you nor is the school in charge of keeping him off the grounds. If you know he's coming to school, call the police and tell them that he's coming to do pick up / drop off despite the terms of the order.
You shouldn't have to live your life in fear because this man thinks he doesn't have to obey the law.
There is no balance of legitimate reason to violate a restraining order. Literally none. The school doesn't have the right to stop him from coming or to let him come on school grounds. The police do. Just because this man has a granddaughter that comes to the school doesn't mean he can repeated violate an order of protection just because it would be easier for him to not have someone else bring the kid to school. The easing of her anxiety and peace of mind is exactly what the restraining order is supposed to do. She didn't ask to be attacked. She's asking what she can do to ensure that the protections put in place are followed. You need to call the police and tell them he's consistently coming to violate the order at drop off and pick up time because they will eventually catch him of they check up on it a few times and he's coming around at the same time every day.
Also if it's revealed to the court that you knew he was coming within 500 ft of you numerous times and you didn't complain or say anything and you knew, he could argue that you don't need the protection anymore because he's been around you and you haven't had a problem with it.
