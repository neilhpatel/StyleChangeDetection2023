Early computers used a variety of devices and techniques for programming, input, and output, depending on what was available, affordable, and suited to the purpose of the computer. I'll confine myself here to digital computers of the post-war "blinky-lights" type (which, granted, is still pretty vague) because I think that's mainly what you're thinking of. Hopefully someone else will address analog devices and the theory of computing, or perhaps I'll come back later. That's a whole different issue.
The teleprinter (basically a remote controlled typewriter) predated the digital computer, and was also used to interface with early computers. In the earliest models, this would mostly be used for output, but could also be found as an input device where text was the data to be processed (such as in decryption). Eventually the teleprinter would become the main interface to computers, eventually becoming video terminals when those became available. This allowed interactive computing, familiar to us today.
Very early machines would be programmed literally by rewiring the computer, or by flipping a series of switches on and off. This was, of course, very cumbersome and better ways were soon found. Input from cards was quickly adapted for programming, though this required fancy features like stored memory!
Output devices could vary according to what the machine was designed to do; while punched cards were common, some had CRTs, panels of lights, or typed output.
At first these computers were programmed by switches and gave their answers using lights, but soon they figured out how to write longer programs on punch cards and connect the computer to a teletype machine for output.
