I think OP means that her boyfriend told her that he's infertile, but he was actually lying about that. The end of the second quoted sentence reads, "which I found out was a lie.".
No, it's not. That said, be careful in the wording of your Facebook post since you don't have direct evidence that he gave you the STD (since he never took a test confirming that he has it). Also, warn him that in Missouri, intentionally spreading HIV is a felony and intentionally spreading herpes, which cannot be cured at present, opens him up to civil liability. Other curable STDs may too.
I'm more interested in his denial/stupid of his STD. I feel like someone at the government level might care since they track that stuff. It might be worth contacting MO health department to ask about it.
Do you know the people he might be sleeping with or do you know anyone who knows them? Unless you know these people and you can contact them personally (which might be better), can't say Facebook will do much other than open you up to be sued without proof.
