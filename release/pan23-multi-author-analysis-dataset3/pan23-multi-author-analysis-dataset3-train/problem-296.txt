The pronouns here are a bit confusing. Did GF sign the front of roommate's check? Forging the signature?
An authorized signature is as valid as the accountholder's own signature. From the _Bills of Exchange Act_ - the federal law defining most of the properties of cheques and other negotiable instruments:
Until your girlfriend is served with actual notice of a lawsuit, identifying the venue and laying out the complaint, there's not much she can do preventatively. If her roommate is clear about what issue she would be suing over, she should try to resolve that issue, or if she believes the issue is resolved, she should be clear about why, but past that, the ball's in her roommate's court.
Criminal charges are much more serious than a lawsuit, and can lead to jail time and a permanent criminal record. Forgery and fraud are particularly serious, and can lead to over ten years' jail time in some cases. Maximum sentences are rare, but it's not something to play around with. Going forwards, your girlfriend should not sign her roommate's cheques, even with her roommate's permission - paying via interac or writing her own cheques would be preferable.
the roommate did not dispute those cheques, even though they must have been aware of such a substantial payment being made every month.
The worst-case outcome would be that she is ordered to pay whatever rent her roommate adequately proves was not paid. There is no possibility of jail time1 and the courts do not have the power to take her roommate's side to punish her for having had a fight. The province flatly does not care if they have a good relationship or whose fault the fight was.
