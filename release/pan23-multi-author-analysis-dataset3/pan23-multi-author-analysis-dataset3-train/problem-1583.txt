You're under no obligation to sign a new lease in the middle of your current lease, much less one that supersedes your old lease and raises your rent.
What might happen is that at the end of your current lease, your new landlords don't offer you the opportunity to keep living there, end your tenancy, and get new tenants willing to pay the increased rent.
If the new landlords try to end their tenancy prematurely or evict them without valid reason, OP can bring their lease to court with them and show the judge that they have a legal right to occupy the rental.
Â¿Can the new LLs give the 21 days eviction notice if tenants don't want to sign the new lease until their current lease essentially ends?
The legal advice that you can stay until the end of the lease and that you need not sign a new lease right now is good.
You can stay under your existing lease contract until it ends, provided you stick to the terms of the lease, also.
The lease can't supersede law, which requires new owners to honor the terms of existing leases. Contractual obligations, including leases, stay with the property.
