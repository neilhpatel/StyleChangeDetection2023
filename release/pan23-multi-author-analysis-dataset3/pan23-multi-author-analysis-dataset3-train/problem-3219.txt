But, as John Hyland has recently argued in his excellent book Persian Interventions (2018), Persian activity in the Mediterranean was not just defensive. On several occasions they clearly went much further than they needed to in their support of Greek states, showing that they would not restrict themselves to the bare minimum that was required to maintain the status quo. Persian support for Sparta in the Peloponnesian War and for Athens in the Corinthian War went much further than simply balancing foreign powers against each other to allow Persia to keep control of the Greeks of Asia Minor.
Question regarding the difficulty in judging Acaemenid foreign policy, why does it seem way more greek sources survived through the millenia than persian sources?
The traditional answer to this is, first, that Persia did not have the same tradition of history-writing as the Greeks. This tradition is a bit of lightning in a bottle, really, seeing as it emerged from an intermingling of the existing traditions of epic and natural philosophy (and more specifically a mix of ethnography, geography, genealogy and medical writing) within a very particular intellectual environment. Second, the Persians mostly ran their administration through letters between local courts and the royal court, and most of these letters were written on perishable materials like papyrus or leather. Consequently most of the evidence for the way the Persians ran their empire is lost.
I've alway's wondered, was something like Alexander inevitable, or was Persia just in a state of decline? Or was it just bad luck not keeping up with military technology of the time?
