The feudal system in England was much more centralized and gave Angevin kings more direct authority than their contemporary Capetians. This allowed England to raise large forces and undertake long campaigns despite its smaller population.
The Valois kings come to accrue more authority over the course of the Hundred Years War. The later Lancastrian phase of the war is really a French civil war between the Armagnacs and the Burgundians with the English backing the latter.
\-The fighting between England and France encompassed a number of smaller internal French conflicts which often took on the characteristic of proxy wars between England and France. A succession war in the Duchy of Brittany in the first stage of the war, the Argmagnac-Burgundian conflict in the latter stage of the Hundred years war.
At the time only Gascony was in English hands, but significant parts of French territory had been ruled by English Kings in the preceding years.
The English kings lost all real control over Normandy and Aquitaine more than 130 years before the Hundred Years War began. I've never seen it suggested that the inhabitants of those regions maintained any real sympathy for their former rulers. The aristocratic class had no reason to, being tied to the French and not the English kings, and the ordinary people probably did not care.
