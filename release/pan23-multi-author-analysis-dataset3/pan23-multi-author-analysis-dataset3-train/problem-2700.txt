In general, no. If you're doing something like using some of her assets for your own purposes things start to get sticky.
SSA's answer is true enough. They'll comply with a court order. But a court won't enter an order to attach SSI payments for a credit card or a mortgage.
The credit card companies are unlikely to get an order granting them a wage garnishment (a court order allowing them to take her SSI).
What was said above is pretty accurate. The credit card company isn’t likely to get an order to garnish (or take) her SSI. As for her mortgage, it is “secured” or guaranteed by the house/property.
The Mortgage is secured by the house so if they foreclose on the home, that’s likely the end of that.
The mortgage is secured by the house. So, if the mortgage goes unpaid, the mortgage holder will go to court and force a sale of the home to satisfy (or pay off) on mortgage. If the mortgage owed is less than the sale (ex: mortgaged owed is $100,000 and sale is $120,000, and after all costs are paid, there’s $5,000 left over, grandma gets $5,000. But if the sale price is $95,000 and then she would still owe the $5,000 but it would be very hard to collect that extra $5,000).
