I think that such a predictable move would have been predicted by your oppressor. Also, are you sure that a misfit that was fighting for the Russians would be welcome on the Ukrainian side? They would just use you as cannon fodder, just like the Russians.
Don't you think that every Ukrainian fighting for the Russians, addicted or not, will be treated like a traitor and a deserter if they go to the Ukrainian side?
Sure give the Ukrainian unfortunate ones a gun, and if I were them, I would get all my homeless, and druggy comrades, after we have been armed, to attack our home, but instead, attack our captors. just take as many russian soldiers out as possible.
All, in all I'm still left wondering why not more Russian conscripts just turn their guns against their officers?!
Sooo, you coerce some guy to fighting for your army, you hand them a crappy, rusty AK and some ammo and you tell them to charge a position they can't hope to take...
Damned if you do, damned if you don't, and your remaining lifespan is counted in minutes, hours and if you're lucky maybe a few days...
