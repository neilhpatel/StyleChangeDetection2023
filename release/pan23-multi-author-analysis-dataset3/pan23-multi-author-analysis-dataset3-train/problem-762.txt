But will "no you cannot get your car back, it was sent to Ukraine" actually work differently than whatever is currently done in Latvia to try and reclaim your car after it was confiscated? I mean, I wish people's cars were confiscated and not just their licenses suspended for drunk driving here because then people just drive with a suspended license until they are caught. So genuine question for the potential effectiveness when you know have drunk people loudly proclaiming "I don't have a car because my car fights the Russians"?
I am also from buttfuck US, and idk how old you are, but that's borderline moronic to think people would drive drunk more just to lose their car, being generous.
I honestly don't care either way, don't drink and drive, but I do hope there will be strict limit and proper legislation, so the police doesn't end up just taking cars from guys who had one glass of wine on their daughters birthday 3 hours ago. This is ofc a hyperbole, but I hope you know what I mean.
this needs to be done correctly and if its rushed through an opportunity it may cause problems in the lonerm.
I'm not from Latvia, but that was my first thought too. That it seems like an idea that just waited for a good opportunity to be pushed without backlash.
