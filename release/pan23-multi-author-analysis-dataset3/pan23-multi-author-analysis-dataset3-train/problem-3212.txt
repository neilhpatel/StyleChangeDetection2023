It is OK to hate a Jewish politician or government. But it's not OK to hate them just because they are Jewish. Only by their acts may they be judged.
The problem with the "Jewish lobby" is not that they exist or that they are strong. The problem is that while supporting some causes that advance the benefit of the Jewish people, they also support abusive and illegal practices by the Israeli government.
The problem arises when lobbyists use illegal methods or otherwise violate the law (and I am not saying the Jewish lobby has done so).
AIPAC is not "the jewish lobby", it's an Israeli lobby, "the jewish lobby" comments were just an extension of antisemitic conspiracies on how jews control the world.
Anyway is the term 'jewish lobby' anti semetic by itself or is it just the general context it usually gets used in?
Oh and is there even something that could legitimately be called a Jewish lobby? Or is that mostly conspiracy theory stuff?
Aye, wasn't there a guy on the investigation group regarding Israel Palestine that said something like that a while ago?
