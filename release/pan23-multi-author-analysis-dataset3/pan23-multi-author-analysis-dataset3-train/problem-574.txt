Putin could see that part of the reason Russia was doing so badly in Ukraine was because of the duplicated command structures and political infighting to secure favour.
This looks to me like the same Wagner vs Russian MoD rivalry we've seen the whole way through the war.
Starting to think the Wagner boss is becoming Putin's biggest threat now. If he does manage to claim several victories in Ukraine while Putin's army just keeps failing, he's going to start having a Lot of political leverage.
Putin has presumably only combined everything under one roof temporarily so that he can try to squeeze some more cohesion out of his military for the sake of a war that's gone badly BADLY wrong for him.
Seems like Putin is trying to solve multiple things at once: diminish Wagner by cutting off ammo and new prisoner recruits, while also using them to soak up Ukranian bullets.
It shows that Putin is busy to make Wagner responsible of the fiasco and to show that he is "the" master punishing who he wants to (as a warning to someones).
