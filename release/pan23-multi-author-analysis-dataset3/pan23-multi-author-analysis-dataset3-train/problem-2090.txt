You'll probably have to have her served (don't do it yourself), and she might offer to pay then. Don't dismiss the case until you have cash in hand. If you take a check, take it to her bank as soon as possible and get cash for it, because she's fairly likely to stop payment.
You already have a valid judgement, so you can ask the court for an order to garnish her bank account or wages, or put a lien on property she owns. If you want to do it without a lawyer, ask the Court Clerk what forms you need, and how much the filing fee is. Include the filing fee in the amount you're asking for, because the worst the judge can do is say no.
Try asking for whatever forms you need to file for a garnishment. Surely they'll be allowed to give you those.
(To be clear here, I'm not a lawyer, and I'm certainly not your lawyer. I just like reading about the law. Yes, that's kind of weird.).
IANAL. What you need to do is file for a . If the losing party has failed to pay, you file the paperwork with the court, the owing party has an opportunity to reply, but typically has to lay out all of their income, expenses, assets and liabilities. If they're a no show at court, you get the writ. You hand the writ to the sheriff/bailiff and they serve the writ and start taking stuff from the debtor's premises until they have enough stuff to sell to cover the debt.
