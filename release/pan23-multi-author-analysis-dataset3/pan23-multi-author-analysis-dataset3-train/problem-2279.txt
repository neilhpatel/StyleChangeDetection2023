I would disagree, there was no legitimate business need for schedulers to be looking that deeply into the patient’s medical records, violating the minimum necessary rule.
Both going deeper than required for the task at hand, talking among themselves about not only a patients private health information, but also doing so about information completely irrelevant to what any of them were doing should all qualify as violations.
It sounds like a possible HIPAA violation to me; it’s a violation of HIPAA for staff to see Protected Heath Information (PHI) without legitimate need, which your mental Heath treatment would be to staff that aren’t clinicians.
Even if it doesn't strictly violate HIPAA (which I'm not sure it doesn't), it almost certainly violates their corporate policy on PHI and if that happened within the system I work at, and was reported on by an upset patient, would almost absolutely result in dismissal for at the very least the person calling, if not the other staff who participated. I've seen people fired for much, much less.
There wasn't? I'm reading multiple people who have no need to access the patient's PHI being given info on PHI openly in an office setting with a clear disregard for their privacy. It's very clear that it meets the standard of health information being improperly disclosed to parties who have no need or use for it in the patient's course of treatment or billing, completely disregarding safeguards almost certainly put in place. Your medical chart is not fodder for office gossip, full stop.
