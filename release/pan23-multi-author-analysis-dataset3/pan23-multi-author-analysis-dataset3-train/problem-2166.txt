And remember, it's not 2005 any more. Banks are VERY good at assessing risk, and if they won't give him a mortgage (or a good mortgage) it's because they have no confidence in such a thing, based on the math. It's super risky and messy for you to get involved, and I've seen these things tear families apart, even when no one had any ill intention. You both need separate real estate attorneys at a minimum and he needs an estate planning attorney (well, everyone does).
If you're on the deed, then he can't sell it without you, but you also can't practically force a sale since he owns the land.
The only real way to do that is if you had your own money, and you loaned it to him. Then you'd basically be the bank, and if he didn't pay, you'd foreclose on him.
Don’t do it because you’ll be liable for the full sum of the loan. Don’t ever cosign a loan with someone unless you’re married and even then that’s questionable.
Another factor is the lenders won't want the loan "encumbered." So that limits you to what you and your brother can agree to. A lender would never approve a mortgage if you and your brother had a deal to swap ownership, it literally couldn't be changed without the lender's approval. And many loans have "due on sale" clauses meaning that if someone signed a quitclaim the entire loan would be due immediately. Anyway, good luck.
