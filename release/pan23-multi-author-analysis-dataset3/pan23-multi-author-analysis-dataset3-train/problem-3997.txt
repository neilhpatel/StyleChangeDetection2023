They don't have to report your debt to the credit unions to sue you. They can report it to encourage you to pay but they don't have to. Not being on your report doesn't make it go away.
1) File ansswer so you know you won't get a default and their law firm knows they cannot just get a default judgement.
2) Then if you want to settle and pay then contact lawyers and see what they will offer. Once they know you are going to fight they will be more willing to settle. Then you can decide to accept or go to court but if you owe the money finding a way to settle if best but file the answer first so they can't "run out the clock" and then file for default judgement.
If you have an official court summons show up otherwise you will get a default judgement (lose) and pay the debt, most likely court fees/attorney fees, etc.
If you haven't received a court summons call him up and ask to settle. Sometimes they will take even 50 percent less if your willing to pay in full. Otherwise setup a payment plan that works for you . Good luck.
