Soooo… according to the article, the Chinese army started scheduled training drills in the area this morning, and all of a sudden, fishermen saw a ufo?
The US just confirmed the others were balloons too. Schumer said it on an interview on ABC this morning. They haven’t blamed them on China though. Not officially. But he spun the announcements of the balloons into talking about China’s balloon spy program.
Of course they are forgetting that they already demanded their downed spy balloons returned to them, the other day.
Yeah they weren't the same as the PRC balloon, however they were still balloons. I don't see why the general would call them balloons if they weren't.
Already have read your article. It states these objects are not similar to the original PRC balloon, however they are still balloons according to Schumer and the Canadian General.
> These objects did not closely resemble and were much smaller than the PRC balloon and we will not definitively characterize them until we can recover the debris, which we are working on.
He said they were balloons and in my article they call him out on it. He doesn't know they're balloons. Nobody does.
