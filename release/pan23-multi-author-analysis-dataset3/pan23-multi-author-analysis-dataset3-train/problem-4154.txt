Title: Insurance took my furniture and put me up in a hotel. They now say I have until tomorrow to move back, but they still have my furniture and do not plan on scheduling it to be moved back.
It was insurance that scheduled the pack out, which is why it seems so wrong to me that I'm expected to coordinate for the furniture to be packed back.
Refusing to make the arrangements, but already scheduled for me to check out without providing me any information as to the contractor that did the pack out and has my things. After all week of silence they respond the night I'm supposed to move in with their info, leaving me without a bed or furniture.
They did not pay me to schedule the contractors so right now I'm just going to pay out of pocket which I've done for the plumbers I needed among other things.
That is shitty. And what about reimbursements? Is that something I just have to continue to press for? Is there any expectation that they might say "no" for things they previously approved, i.e. the car or the plumber or any other contractor?
