And that's why I'm done debating with most folks. It's not a debate when one side will say whatever is necessary to "win.".
I'm done arguing with them. Now, I'm organizing with others and putting in the work to crush the GOP electorally.
I don't give a shit about the GOP's talking points du jour, and I won't be wasting my time arguing within the narrow framework/narrative that conservatives already set for the public.
And I don't really care about precedent for the public, Fox News and right wing media are going to go with their narrative no matter what.
It may set precedent for the public but I don't think it would set any kind of legal precedent for the courts. In this case, I believe the Republican candidates would have to be the ones to sue since they would be the damaged parties. If they don't sue to get the election certified, nothing ever hit the courts to form precedent, and if they do sue then the vote will almost certainly be forced to be certified.
If they continue to refuse to certify the election in their county and a court doesn't step in and force it, then all the votes in that overwhelmingly republican county are not counted.
GOP officials refusing to certify elections in GOP controlled counties, elections that GOP won in, and if they refuse to certify by the proper date their votes will be thrown out of the statewide totals which, would actually flip two state seats from GOP to Democrat. You can't make this stuff up.
