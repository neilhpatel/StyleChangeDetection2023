I just wanted to go back to my original job duties where I was at a remote location and these sites. I would be fine one a week but they ignored it. By not just letting me “go back to work “ they increased the work load for another employee who handles the other remote site. So he was now encumbered with now double the work load so people’s issues were now not getting resolve the same day. Instead now he had to work around his existing duties and added more stress on him. Simply put I just wanted to go back to being part of the team but instead they babysat me.
At this point I was terrified of being around him because how he would manipulate people. And for someone like me with my mental health issues, it was literally crippling for me. It impacted my work and customer service to the point I would have panic attacks and nervous breakdowns.
I would go to work fine but then their behavior would trigger my mental health to the point it was crippling for me to do my job.
This employer went above and beyond for you during your mental health crisis, in several ways that you document. The only accommodation you seemed to ask for was to not be around your manager. For an employer to agree to an accommodation, under the ADA it has to be "reasonable." And not burdensome. (To be clear, did you ask to be transferred to different manager, what were you asking for specifically, for the manager to be fired?) It may not have been "reasonable" or otherwise possible to keep you separated from your manager, it is normal to be around the manager. If you believe your manager harassed you due to your disability, you can of course speak to an attorney.
