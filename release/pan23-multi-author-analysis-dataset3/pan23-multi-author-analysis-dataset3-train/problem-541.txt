If you read the statement he keeps coming back and saying that he is stating what Jean Carroll said on Anderson Cooper.
This is by no means siding with the creep, but out of curiosity I read the interview with Anderson Cooper. She isn't a hell of a lot better with words than Trump and suggested that some people like rape... it's sexy... By that she we alluding to role playing.
I watched the clip that someone posted above and her comments about some people thinking rape is sexy were cut off by the commercial break so she didn't get a chance to explain herself. I don't want to put words into her mouth, so hopefully clarifies at some point, but this is my take on what she was saying...
I think she was saying that Trump thought it was sexy. It seems like the kind of display of power that might turn him on. I can see her wanting to not associate with rape if she thinks that would be a sexy thought in Trumps mind.
Edit: Prior to this, it was believed that Donald John Trump raped women. I think his statement solidifies the fact that Donald John Trump is a rapist.
Absolutely - she's a bit off. While there are kinks and roleplaying out there (to each their own), I don't think for a moment that -most- people confuse rape with sexy. In my book, actual rape (i.e. forcible sexual domination of an unwilling partner) is the complete opposite of sexy. So she either misspoke, or she has pretty crazy views as well. But it was Trump who showed his true colors by outright denying it, then when he senses an out, "Well? I guess that's what took place." So I firmly believe that it was outright rape. Because if it wasn't, why deny it?
