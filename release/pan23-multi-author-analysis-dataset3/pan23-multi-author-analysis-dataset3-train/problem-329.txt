No, there’s a fundamental difference between a school offering a degree or certification that might not get you a job in the field versus the school outright lying and saying “99% of our past graduates have gotten jobs within one year of graduation, with a median salary of $150k dollars.”.
None of that has anything to do with whether the school’s specific course offerings provide adequate job training - it has to do with the schools explicitly lying to the students about rankings, job placement, etc.
Again, the schools got in trouble for explicitly lying to their students, not because of the degrees’ “value” or lack thereof.
Do you have any links to these “colleges”? I bet they were actually vo-tech schools, trade schools, or “technical institutes” who lied about their post-graduation job placement rates, which is fraud.
Those were valid degrees the fraud was in the claim that they could get jobs with them any college selling any degrees that have no job value can be put on that list.
I think you are confusing for profit schools that lied about their job placement, and bc they committed fraud, and were closed down, the students didn't have to pay back the loans. Like iit tech.
