they are already trying to kick us out early lmao i just want to go earlier than the other two people do, i guess it just doesnt make sense to me because i didnt sign on any agreement that has a valid end date.
We just figured out that we weren't going to have the option to resign, and I don't even know if the third girl is aware yet. I'm also not sure how long the family has been planning on moving into the place. Most simply, I really just want to find a way to be able to move out this month despite my roommates no being able to agree to that because of their situations, and I can't pay both rents ðŸ˜….
thank you for this i hope you dont mind the extra context and questions, but if you have any information i'd really appreciate it So, the landlord and the people who own the home aren't the same people. There's a family who owns it, my landlord, and then the leasing agency, does this change much? As far as I know, there's no other physical proof that the landlord and us agreed on the ten months, just the obvious typo that we all completely missed haha.
Outside of the written lease document, is there evidence that you agreed to a fixed term ten-month lease from 9/1/2020 to 6/30/2021 ?
If there were to be a lawsuit over a breach of the lease, the plaintiff would be the one who is required to provide some evidence of the intended end of lease date.
And since the landlord and multiple tenants apparently have not sought to correct the lease and neither party seems to have brought it up with the other, a court would likely conclude the intent was to end the lease on 6/30/2021.
