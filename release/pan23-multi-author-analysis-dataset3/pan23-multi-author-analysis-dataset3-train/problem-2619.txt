at least not for Taiwan island,there's no escape once it's encircled.do you know the Taiwan annual Chinese character is æ¶¨ or rising everything.looking grim in economic aspect.
Edit: they may be skirting outside Taiwanese territorial waters when approaching from the southwest.
Not just ADIZ intrusions. On the maps, it looks like Chinese jets crossed into went near what would be considered territorial waters if you recognize Taiwan as a country.
It would take a lot more than 3 ships and a couple dozen planes to invade Taiwan. If it ever happens, the world will be watching the build up for weeks.
The conflict I foresee would be China blockading Taiwan, forcing a Berlin airlift type operation for 23 million people, and forcing the US to have to be the aggressor in order to defend the island.
China's only effective way to counter would be to try and sink the US Navy, and to destroy the airfields in Japan they would make use of, which would just cause world war 3, so they dont get Taiwan in that scenario because we're all dead.
This is leaving out the US getting involved, which it probably will, making that bombing campaign insanely costly (not that it won't already be, China's airfields that they will be launching from are well within Taiwanese missile range as well, and any naval assets they deploy will be in range of the various hidden mountain launchers).
