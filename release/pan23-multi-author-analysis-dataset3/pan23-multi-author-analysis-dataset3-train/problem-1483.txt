If you are actually served with a lawsuit, which I think is unlikely, you need to contact a lawyer immediately.
If you are served actual legal action, you’ll need to respond. In that case, you’ll want to be able to submit copies of all emails/text messages/etc, as well as photos, any other documentation. If you are actually served, a consult with a local attorney might be worth your time to aid you in preparing your documentation For the court.
Did you tell the seller that the products were broken as soon as you received and opened them? How did the seller respond? Did you offer to return the products (I would have demanded a return shipping label)? Did you take photos of the broken products?
If this is a fairly small purchase, it will likely cost more than the purchase is worth for the seller to take legal action. Some states allow small claims court appearance via Zoom or telephone, and you can email in your proof of what communication you had and photos, which would show why you shouldn’t be required to pay for broken products.
If this is just a demand letter, which it sounds like, you can safely ignore it, or you can respond by saying you refuse to pay for broken products and previously tried to resolve this directly, and when they refused you did a charge-back and will not be paying for broken products.
