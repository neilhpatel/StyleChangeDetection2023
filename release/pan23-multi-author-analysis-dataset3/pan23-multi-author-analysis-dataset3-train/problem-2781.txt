Sorry for the confusion. My 14 month lease ends on 2/28/21. Last week I had told the landlord that we would be going month to month and she wanted me to sign some papers saying that’s what we’re doing. We then decided yesterday, the 23rd, that we would just be moving so we’re not even asking for an extension, just a notice of intent to move which is what is required per our lease agreement.
So - Does your lease END on 2/28/2021 and you were trying to sign a 30-day EXTENSION or do you have a month-to-month lease which requires you to give 30 days notice? If it's the second, there's no actual reason they can require to use their document. Just that it's in writing, so send it via email and also send it via certified or tracked mail.
Does your original lease go month-to-month after the first year (ending 2/28?) or does it say something like “lease does not auto-renew or extend”?
They aren't required to offer you an extension, so if your lease hard end-dates on 2/28 and you don't have anything on file, then and only then can they evict you if you are still there on 3/1. The courts are pretty slow-going, many are closed, due to the eviction moratorium. This seems like a baseless threat from someone who is either stupid or has anger management problems.
I don’t really understand any of the other stuff, but what is in the lease is most important b/c you may be in “holdover” (google it) and liable for fees etc.
