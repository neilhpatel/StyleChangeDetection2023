“protagonist. The same would be largely true for comic books, which were descendants of the Pulps...with one notable exception: the infamous comic book story "Judgment Day" (Weird Fantasy 18, April 1953) where the astronaut removes his helmet at the end to reveal himself as black was subject to censorship - which the publisher famously denied, printing the story as-is.”.
So, if you picked up an issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact, Galaxy Science Fiction, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, or even Weird Tales in 1953, you most likely wouldn't find a black protagonist. The same would be largely true for comic books, which were descendants of the Pulps...with one notable exception: the infamous comic book story (Weird Fantasy 18, April 1953) where the astronaut removes his helmet at the end to reveal himself as black was subject to censorship - which the publisher famously denied, printing the story as-is.
You recall correctly. I didn't say it was a great example of racial inclusivity in science fiction, but it was a commercially successful one and an influential one.
Mainstream science-fiction (in the US at least) was quite substantially latently white supremacist (at least as much as mainstream literary fiction, perhaps more) up until about the 1960s, black characters as anything other than villains or lower class workers were few and far between.
Black characters in early science fiction, fantasy, detective, weird, spicy, and romance fiction tend to be either supporting or antagonists, and many of the characterizations were outright racial stereotypes and baldly racist stock characters...although there are exceptions. Robert E. Howard, who created the character of Conan the Barbarian, also created the black boxer Ace Jessel in (Ghost Stories, Apr 1929).
