Yes, the fact that you're 3000 miles away will have bearing on their decision. Again, unless she is currently (which you say she is not) doing drugs or otherwise a threat to the baby's safety most courts will not remove an infant from their mother for other than short periods of visitation. So you'd be welcome to fly the 3000 miles to visit your baby, but unless the mother is currently unfit you're going to have a huge uphill battle with the idea that an infant should be shipped 3000 miles away. Shared physical custody would be more of a possibility after the child was a year old.
like i said, i have no issue letting this girl come see him, or even shared physical custody. i know for a fact that when he grows up he will like me more, anyways. if he’s even mine.
i doubt that she’s been talking to a lawyer, i think she just understands the bias that courts have against fathers. she was just under the assumption that i wouldn’t want anything to do with this kid for 18 years.
In terms of what your rights are now: you don't really have any until the kid is born. You aren't entitled to medical info, being at doctor visits, or being there when the kid is born. You also aren't entitled to name the kid. You might one day be able to go to court and get the baby's last name hyphenated (her last name + yours) unless she just gives it your last name, but first name will be her choice. Make sure to get a paternity test before you agree to anything because if you sign the birth certificate, it doesn't matter if a DNA test later says you aren't the dad, unless it's only been a few months in the eyes of the legal system you have accepted responsibility and will be on the hook until it's 18.
