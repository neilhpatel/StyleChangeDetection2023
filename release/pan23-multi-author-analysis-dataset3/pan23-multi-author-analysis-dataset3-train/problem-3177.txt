“Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.".

we can combat white nationalism and blame her voters. I am tired of just getting mad at elected politicians while giving their supporters a pass. Plus, I'm a white-passing former pastor that lived in Alabama for years; I know exactly how these people talk when they are in "safe company." They are not good or decent people.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
