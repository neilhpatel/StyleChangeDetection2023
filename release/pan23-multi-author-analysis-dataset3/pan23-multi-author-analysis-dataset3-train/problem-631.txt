All that bullshit about bussing migrants to other cities as a political stunt would've actually been a pretty genius way to push the issue of immigration to Democrats. I hated Trump's stupid fucking wall, but a national agreement for the more equitable relocation of migrants in exchange for DACA? Sounds like a great deal.
But Abbot didn't care about actually solving the problem. He just wanted a racist scapegoat boogyman. Fuck Greg Abbot.
There's a lot of reasons to tell Abbott to go fuck himself, but his stance on immigration tops the list.
Greg Abbott sees it and aims to get out in front of it ahead of Trump with his own, because this shitgoblin has 2024 aspirations too.
My guess is Abbott is getting out ahead of the major talking point/rage point for the GOP in 2023-2024: Replacement Theory.
Looks like Abbott wants a mini war with Mexico and is trying to use hysterics as his way of doing it. But this will only work with Texan conservatives and maybe Arizona. But yeah this is probably going to lead to an international incident.
