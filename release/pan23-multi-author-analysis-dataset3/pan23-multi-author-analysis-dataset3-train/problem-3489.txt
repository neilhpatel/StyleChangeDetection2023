Most disturbing is Clarence Thomas's role. I have no doubt that he not only discussed what actions his wife was taking with her,, but firmly endorsed them. Supreme Court Justices are meant to avoid even the appearance of impropriety not jump in with both feet.
I agree progress is being made, but until MTG is removed from Congress and charged with conspiracy, until Clarence Thomas is removed from the court, until Trump and all his co-conspirators are held accountable, I will reserve judgement. We do not exactly have a good history of holding politicians accountable for their crimes.
If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and violently tries to overthrow the will of the people like a duck...
If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and smashes in the windows of the capitol building while screaming “Hang Mike Pence” then yeah, you’re domestic terrorists.
"look like" as in "LOOK at that banner over the August 2022 CPAC conference that says 'We're all domestic terrorists' - do you LIKE it?".
Yup. They didn’t give a shit about any of the Capitol Police who got hurt or if any of their side (insurrections) got hurt. All these texts are about themselves and how they look and if they can find another job.
