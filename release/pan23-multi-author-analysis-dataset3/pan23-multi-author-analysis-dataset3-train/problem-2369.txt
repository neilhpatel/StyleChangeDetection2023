But all of that is what it is in his power to do. Legalization requires a law, which means his stance on it isn't strictly relevant. He isn't the one writing the laws.
A president, nor any other part of the executive branch DOES NOT make the laws. The enforce the laws. Where's the judicial branch interprates the laws.
So. No the DEA and Biden don't get to "just make it legal". BUT they can decided how to enforce and to what extremes.
The don't, and neither does the president, that is laws are written and voted on by congress, Biden would have ability to veto but that's not the point of this.
Any legislation done that way can either be blocked by state or gop stacked judicial system and give gop grounds do the same thing if they get control of the congress. Gop's definition of meaningful legislation should give you a pause before thinking of getting rid of filibuster. Imagine decades of social progress undone in a single term.
Cuz they won't get rid of filibuster? Gop nvr has, dem did it in 2013 to remove 60 vote needed for Supreme Court nominee to just 51 and look where it got us. Nvr go nuclear. Filibuster is good for both parties and should not be messed with in these flip floppy congress.
This is the only bill to get a full House vote recently. So it is relevant. Senate Dems sponsored and backed the mirroring bill in their respective body. But it needs a threshold of Republicans to pass. I said "near unanimous" and only two Dems against it is nearly that. Three Republicans in the House and zero in the Senate support legalization. So almost all the Democrats are for this. Almost all the Republicans are against this. How are you still not understanding this?
He's unhappy with the New York Times? Here's The Hill, a similarly respected news source, no paywall. Other than no supporting sources, do you have any backing for your claims here?
You think that means he's anti-legalization? Explain ... preferably with a reputable and recent source.
