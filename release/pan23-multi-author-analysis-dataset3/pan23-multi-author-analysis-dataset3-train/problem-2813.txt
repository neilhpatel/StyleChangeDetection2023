At two weeks remaining n the existing lease the landlord cannot give you a two weeks notice. California requires a minimum of 30 day notice to vacate for a year or less of tenancy total, 60 days for over a year. So they still have two weeks where they can give you a 30 day notice, and after that would have to be a 60 day notice.
The leasing office can decide not to offer a limited term lease and let you go to month-to-month. Of course, you can make attempts to negotiate.
Termination of the existing lease and automatic renewal as month-to-month with all the same existing clauses from your current lease that are applicable to a month-to-month leases remain is what occurs.
Most leases convert to month-to-month automatically unless either the tenant or landlord terminates 30-days prior. Typically 2 weeks would be too short a time to terminate a lease.
Many tenants (and landlords) like month-to-month leases as it provides flexibility. In most cases, landlords like paying tenants, so thereâ€™s no incentive to terminate a lease.
I know it's a long shot but do you think that they might just be trying to offer us a month to month lease if that's the case? Even then, I would think that they'd provide a notice much sooner.
