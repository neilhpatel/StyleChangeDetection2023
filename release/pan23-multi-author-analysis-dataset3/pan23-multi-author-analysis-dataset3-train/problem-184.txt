I mean won’t this block of elderly voters who are conservative die off? Unless there’s a rapid replacement of old conservative bigots, they’re moving closer to death each day. Dunno.
Is it just me or are all these old conservative voters gonna be dead in the next 20 years? I feel like they can’t be replaced fast enough to be equal to their hold now. And that’s a good thing if true.
True. But the democratic people aren’t the ones who moved lol. Trust me I’m with you when you say the democratic turnout wasn’t the best…but the last number shuffled around was about 300,000 new republicans signed up in the state…mixed in with good ol’ fashioned gerrymandering…it’s a lot less blue.
I'm hoping there is a voter backlash to all this, though it might take a few years to see it, with all the boomers moving in with their more conservative politics.
And as we all know, conservatives have their tongue so far up corporate ass they are going to back down...or they want and the corps will move to fund democrats and there will never be a Republicans elected again because no one will give them money.
He wants to teach children to think alright. Think the way the "state" wants them to think. Who the fuck does this little tiny employee think he is. I mean he is smart and all but nowhere near close to the people he is fighting who's job is literally to teach and think their entire lives.
This facist has got to be taught he is an employee of the people, and not a very important or bright one either. Far to much racism and white supremacy bullshit in his world view.
