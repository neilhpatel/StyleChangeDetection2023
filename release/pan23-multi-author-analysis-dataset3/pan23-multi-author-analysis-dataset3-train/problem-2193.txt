We are at an interesting point for the environmentalist movement. As the scientific predictions continue to look bleaker, our governments continue to offer almost meaningless solutions. This raises the temperature as activists are starting to feel like their actions aren’t having the desired effects and new strategies need to be considered.
Inconveniencing average people who very likely already know about climate change and have opinions on it just makes them pissed at your particular group.
So, whilst most of us are concerned about climate change, a lot of the societal-conversation is about how irritating ER are, rather than about the environment.
It's kind of hard to make people see the impact of climate change in such a manner, since most people apparently can't comprehend things not happening literally in front of their eyes. Sure lots of people claim they care, but as soon as they realize that'd require a change in their personal behaviour it's all "but private jets but companies but lab grown meat!".
This. Whenever anyone talks about Extinction Rebellion, it’s always to remark about “those assholes who threw shit at the famous paintings.” Nothing else. Hell, I bet most people don’t know a single other thing about them. These stunts are duds, and it’s weird people are still arguing that they aren’t.
