Some of these eras have given us named cooks. Others have given us documents which were clearly collated by cooks in elite houses, but whose names are not attached to surviving manuscripts. And some have given us other documentary evidence of people who were celebrated cooks, but of whose actual work we have no record. But there's no connection that can be drawn between the existence of these cooks and the downfall of the cultures in which they lived.
There is an argument out there that inequality (not a small signal) leads to the downfall of cultures and civilisations - but it's mostly an argument advanced by economists, and not historians. Historians mostly look to widely disparate causes for those failures - climate change, defeat by other groups, famine, disease, and so forth.
Couldn't some of these more wide disparate causes also be seen as being triggered by inequality? I've seen some arguments focussing on political and economic inequality as triggers for the Western Roman Empire's collapse.
