Just Never. The US is completely incapable of holding him accountable. Appoint whoever you want... find him guilty as hell. He will walk away and then brag about it.
If it goes literally any other way, I'll pay OP $100 USD. And if he/she doesn't want it, I'll donate it to my local children's hospital. Save this Comment. Trump will never do time... and it will only get worse from there.
THEN we get to all the shit he did as president. The oval office gave him a very powerful platform to do all the things he's always done, but now he gets to claim he's being persecuted by Democrats.
If you are younger than Trump then yes, he has been under some kind of investigation for most of your life. His investigations are now bigger and more newsworthy.
