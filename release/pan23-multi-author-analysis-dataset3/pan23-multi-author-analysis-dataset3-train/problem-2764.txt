It's not that hard to get a dealer's license in California. You can be a wholesaler or a retailer. If you are a wholesaler you need a location but no display area and are prohibited from selling to the public. That said, wholesalers and retailers sell to the public illegally all the time through Craigslist etc.
Go to www.dmv.ca.gov and search Notice Of Transfer And Release Of Liability FAQs. Also reference California Vehicle Code ยง5602. Those tickets are not your responsibility and the ticketing agencies know it IF YOU HAVE A COMPLETE RELEASE ON FILE PRIOR TO THE TICKET DATE. Bear in mind that they are legally required to notify you of the tickets as long as you are the registered owner of record even if there is/are proper releases on file. You're not responsible for tickets but until there's a new R/O you get notified.
On the tickets, it clearly says that if it's not paid for after a certain deadline, then the penalty will be doubled or so... So I imagine someone must pay for the tickets. But then who if it's not me?
The way I see it, this dealership appears to be a reputable one with 5-star ratings with a proper location, doing legal business and stuff; although it seems they are relatively new and still slowly building their reputation.
