You may be able to sue the thief. Holding the locksmith liable would depend on if the laws or regulations in your location require the locksmith to prove ownership before action is taken.
The locksmith is to inquire into the person's authority for entering the premises or vehicle and request appropriate evidence of that authority.
Locksmiths performing a gain entry service in the case of lockouts of premises or vehicle, must obtain positive identification of the person requesting entry and be certain of that person's authority to enter the premises. A photographic ID card such as a driver's licence is a satisfactory form of identification. Where this is not available, other forms of identification must be sought, and the locksmith must be satisfied with the identity of the person requesting entry, before opening the premises or vehicle.
In all cases where the locksmith is not satisfied with the identity or authority of the person requesting the service, the locksmith is to suggest that the local police be contacted for verification or attendance. If this suggestion is declined, the locksmith must not open the premises or vehicle.
