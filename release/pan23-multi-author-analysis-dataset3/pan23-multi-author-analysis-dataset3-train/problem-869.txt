Probate takes time. There is no reason to "stop the proceedings." The executor can choose an attorney to represent the estate, whomever she wants, but they need to be licensed in CA. She can also hire an independent CPA to do whatever they need to do. All the expenses associated with probate are paid for by the estate.
Why? Unless it's going to terrorists or an embargoed country, the government doesn't care. If the estate is large enough to be subject to the estate tax (and that's quite large, over $11 million) then the estate has to pay the taxes. Otherwise it's their money and they can send it where they want.
2) It should be fairly easy to ascertain what cash is on hand. Assuming it's sufficient, your sister can hire an attorney, a CPA, and anyone else she needs, on behalf of the estate.
Your sister is the only one involved here is because she is the legally designated executor. That is the reason.
Yeah I get that. We're a bunch dumb hicks that have nothing to do with all this. I am simply trying to get to the bottom of this to make sure everyone especially my sister is coming out of this in a way that's fair and above board.
