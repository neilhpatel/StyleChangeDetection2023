China can lie and gaslight all they want, given their reputation its pretty much all you can expect from them at this point.
As long as the war happens in Ukraine, oil and gas will be very cheap for China and some other countries - hence the fake neutrality and lip service about peace. They know quite well that Z wonâ€˜t surrender territory.
On top of that - China/CCP most likely hopes that countries supporting Ukraine will be too busy or stretched thin resource-wise to do something to help Taiwan.
- China will never help Ukraine. They won't even meet with Zelenski. This is in line with their 'limitless friendship' with Pootin.
Now they also provide lethal weapons to Russia and we, in the civilized democracies, must consider our next step. More powerful weapons for Ukraine is one option. Another is making our economies more independent from China. However, this will take years. In the mean time we must stand by Ukraine and prepare for escalations, if the russian people don't handle the problem in Kremlin themselves before it all gets out of control. Too many red lines have been crossed. However, there is no alternative to stand up against the pure evil the Russians are conducting in Ukraine.
Trying to plug a narrative the west is to blame for helping out Ukraine fighting of inhumanized invading Russian zombies.
