I wonder if I put too much presumed importance on the USN's feelings about moving ships between oceans? Or if, as you mentioned, the vast shipyard capabilities of the war made the Navy look towards maintaining two large fleets, rather than one large fleet that transferred ships as needed?
It was no longer really necessary to plan on transiting your fleets from one theatre to another - though after the decimation of the Pacific Fleet in 1942 at Pearl Harbour, large numbers of ships were sent through the canal to reinforce them.
To my knowledge, the first ships the US Navy ordered that wouldn't fit through the Panama Canal were the Montana-class battleships authorized by Congress with the 1940 Vinson-Walsh Act (often called the Two-Ocean Navy Act) which was the largest of the bills that expanded the size of the Navy before the war began. The Vinson-Walsh Act authorized the final two Iowa-class battleships that were never completed, Illinois and Kentucky, as well as five Montana-class battleships.
The shared some similarities to the Iowas, but they were intended to be even bigger, mount a fourth main turret, and carry heavier armor. They would have been slower than the Iowas, but with a top speed of 28 knots were still planned to be faster than what were considered "slow" battleships of the time. Construction actually began on some of the Montanas but was halted in late May 1942, as it became apparent that shipyard capacity was needed to build other ships. The Montanas were canceled in 1943 and were broken up without making it off the slipway.
