okay yeah, the way I've been doing it is providing that insurance when I go to doctors, and add my personal as a "backup". that makes sense now why they do that.
so the insurance is from the car which is on my parent's policy or something like that. that's the insurance I have been using cuz I was driving the car at the time of the accident.
Btw as a side question, do personal injury attorneys only really accept cases if they know they have a good chance of winning?
Personal injury attorneys typically accept cases on contingency, meaning they don't get paid unless there is a judgement or settlement in their client's favor. They have an incentive not to accept cases that don't appear to have a reasonable chance of generating a judgement or settlement that will justify the work involved.
It depends on the situation. If the defendant has insurance that covers whatever the situation is, the insurance company normally pays for defense counsel. If the defendant does not have insurance, the defendant would normally need to pay out-of-pocket for defense counsel, usually based on an hourly fee for work performed.
