Except not even the tools of mass murder available to the public today "consolidate power" against the "police, military and state.".
You've also undermined your own position by referencing tools that one could theoretically use to harm other people (crowbars, other handheld weapons) but in practicality, are far harder to commit mass murder with than guns, particularly guns that can be fired dozens of times per minute.
It's funny that you appear to recognize that there's no justification in an average person having access to C4, bazookas, etc, but somehow that doesn't apply to guns that allow someone to kill dozens of people in a short time.
Yeah, no. That "right" was for a well-regulated militia to bear arms, and the "arms" that existed when that was written allowed only a handful of bullets to be fired per minute, and only so many before the gun had to be cleaned.
With there being about half a dozen SCOTUS level rulings regarding guns and the 2a that do a very good job of protecting the 2a and the right to own modern firearms it's going to take amending the constitution for any serious gun control to withstand legal challenges.
(establishes that the 2a protects modern arms that did not exist at the time of the ratification of the 2a thereby protecting Ar15s and the like).
(the big one that specified the 2a as an individual right unconnected with service in a militia and that guns in common legal use are protected by the 2a. Also said that mandating guns be stored in a safe was unconstitutional).
But... but... we need guns because a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state. It says so right there Without the right to own all these weapons, all of our other rights could only be exactly the same as in all other democratic countries in the world. We can't have that.
