No, Maccabees is in Protestant bibles until it becomes a) too expensive to keep printing them because b) British hardline Protestants said they weren't canonical so why waste the money - that takes place around the 1820s onwards.
Each question here would require a post of their own . and unless Santa Claus is going to give me the gift of a free time, I won't be able to do much on this in the next few days. If you get no luck here, you could try /r/Academicbiblical although the quality may vary more so that here, but there are perhaps more specialists there than here.
There isn't really a 'bible' but there is a sort of canon, but the Jews really don't decide this until somewhere in the 1st century AD (and some debates going on until the 8th!). There are theories as to why Maccabees didn't make it into the canon but were of value (that's roughly how Protestants ended up thinking about them too), but there's no 'answer'.
If I'm so far understanding things correctly, the Books of Maccabees weren't included for any special reason when the Bible was first compiled, but because they were on what was essentially an already compiled list of books. The Christian Bible (pre-Protestantism, anyway) included 1 and 2 Maccabees because they were part of the Septuagint, which was made before Jesus, and the books of the Septuagint became the Catholic Old Testament (and then future Christian sects modified what they considered part of the Old Testament). And so there are probably some better and broader questions to ask here, such as:
This explains things a bit, though I'm still struggling to properly parse it - perhaps /u/Flubb can clarify things further (I might be falling out of your wheelhouse here though)?
