You need facts, not guesses to go forward with this. Did your contract stipulate 5% fees? Since transfers can prove when you didn't pay on-time, start there. Once you have sum of all potential late fees, you can demand the rest of the money through court.
Exactly If you want your deposit, you will have to take him to court. But If he can prove that your late fees exceed amount of deposit, judge might demand that you pay.
On his end, he would most likely have to get an attorney and take me to court to get me to pay the late fees? Also since he never asked for a late fee in the six years that I lived there isn’t it suspicious that now all of a sudden when I ask for my security security deposit back he would ask for all of those late fees at once?
I’m pretty sure I don’t even need to take him to court. He didn’t comply with law. In MD there’s just a form you complete and an investigator will determine if money is owed. If he fights that, it goes to court and he could be forced to pay up to 3 times the deposit.
