While this is technically illegal, it's too trivial and petty for any law enforcement agency to deal with. You will have to handle it on your own, either by having your mail delivered elsewhere (like a PO Box or mailbox shop) or moving out.
If you aren't ready to risk living on your own, get a PO box or have your mail held for pickup at the post office. Practical solutions trump legal solutions, as holding your mail or receiving it elsewhere will _fully_ prevent your parents from opening it, whereas legal solutions might not.
Any legal action you take is likely to involve moving out, whether you like it or not - if you don't leave, they might well decide to kick you out, and while you might be owed notice, it still gives them control over the timeline. If that's acceptable, then put that first and solve the problem that way.
For the sake of completeness, you can also report this to the post office, but be prepared for a "so what" reaction. It is technically against the law, but petty intra-familial disputes with no actual harm attached tend not to be a priority.
