There's been such a project going since the early 1980's. It has missed every deadline and blown through all minds of funding. It has kind of evolved into a construction cartel where lobbyists from different countries fight over the funding. The next milestone is, if things go perfectly, which has never happened, to have a small demo by 2050.
Hell, we've had commercial fission for nearly a century and there's been very little progress the last 60 years. At industry now exists mostly a corrupt construction cartel that can't be trusted to operate their plants safely or cleanly or affordably, or to keep any promise.
In other words, if the fission pumper industry can't even get their act together for the last 70 years, what makes you think theoretical fusion - which orders of magnitude more difficult - will be mastered so rapidly?
...in mordern nuclear weapons you use both fission and fusion in the same bomb like the hydrogen one - so my argument is simply that this future industry is dangerous as it should spread all over the world to make an inpact.
If you have fusion technology you only need to add a very small amount of fission reaction to detonate a hydrogen bomb.
A fusion bomb uses fission bomb to ignite the fusion material. You can’t have a fusion bomb without a fission bomb. A fusion power plant won’t use fission as its ignition source. It’s not dangerous and it “spreading” will just mean energy prices across the globe will plummet.
