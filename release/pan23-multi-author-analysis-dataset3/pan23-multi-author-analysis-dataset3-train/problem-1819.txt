IANAL. Life insurance pays out to the named beneficiary, period. If the named beneficiary had died before the insured life, proceeds would likely occur to the beneficiary’s estate not the insure’s estate. She has been more than well taken care of by inheriting your father’s house and chattels. The fact that your father made a will naming her as beneficiary, but did mot change the beneficiary on his life insurance is evidence that things are going the way he intended.
When my father died, he had several different life insurance policies on himself, with all but 2 listing me as the primary beneficiary. The other two had his mother as the primary. Problem was, she had been dead for more than 10 years at that point. On one of those two policies, I was listed as the secondary, so no problem there. The other one though, my aunt who had basically disappeared years ago was the secondary. I had to go through a whole process with a lawyer to to show that I had tried to locate her, couldn't, and it took months for the insurance company to pay it.
She would need to sue you and the life insurance company, and any halfway decent attorney is going to tell her that she has no chance of winning. If she successfully sued in such a situation her attorney would likely get one third of the award.
If she does sue you, while unlikely that any attorney will take the case, answer. Do not think, just because her chances are slim/non-existent to ignore responding.
You mentioned paperwork that has you listed dating at least before the relationship with her. Have copies / photos of that paperwork and in the meantime BLOCK HER!
