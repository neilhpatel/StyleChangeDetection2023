“We’re seeing rising antisemitism while Russia is going back to a new kind of Soviet Union, and step by step the iron curtain is coming down again. This is why I believe the best option for Russian Jews is to leave,” Pinchas Goldschmidt, former chief Rabbi of Moscow.
We always think that wars can never happen again, and yet, here we are, and more wars will happen - the issue with China and Taiwan is always simmering, NK is always acting up, Iran is a huge headache. Just because we have endured huge wars over the last 100 years or so is just an indication that the world is an unstable place. I blame individuals with huge egos, perhaps even mental illness is to blame. Antisemitism is just another example of delusional and maniacal hatred which we would hope had no place in the world, but sadly it still exists.
And, in any of these cases (30's to 40's Germany, modern USA and Russia), the backdrop of rising, virulent, and violent antisemitism is another common denominator.
Antisemitism had been steeping throughout Europe for centuries, not just in Germany and Russia, but every major power in the continent had their own history of state sanctioned or at least tolerated Antisemitism.
However, what Putin is doing, IMO, is more reminiscent of the last throws of Imperial Russia, than it is of Nazi Germany.
I never said I agree with the Russian definition, just that in every thread where it is obvious that Russians are being actual Nazis people think Putin cared about the Jews when he was trying to "Denazify Ukraine".
You're right in that it's not that way nationwide, but parts of this place are definitely trying to make the comparison to Nazi Germany and modern Russia more accurate. For fucks sake, dudes with guns show up to threaten and intimidate LBGTQ events here regularly.
