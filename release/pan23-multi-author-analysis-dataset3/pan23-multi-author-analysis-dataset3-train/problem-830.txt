They don’t research the claims with any bit of evidence. Forbes just goes with what the interviewee says and writes a puff piece that people literally take seriously.
Forbes isn’t a trusted source on anyone’s income any more. They never fact check anything. They claim Kylie Jenner was a billionaire but was way off that mark. The same happened with Trump.
Same with Trump. His properties may be worth billions. But if there are mortgages and other liens against those properties, then the value of those mortgages and liens must be subtracted from the value of the property. Odds are that l, when that is done, Trump has very little net worth from those properties.
Trump bankrupted a fucking casino. He somehow managed to fuck up an enterprise that where people just give you money and you are mathematically guaranteed to keep a portion of it.
If you own a $1 million dollar house, but owe $1 million (or more) on it, you are not a millionaire. Your $1 million in assets is wiped out by the $1+ million in liabilities you owe, effectively leaving you with a $0 (or less) net worth.
