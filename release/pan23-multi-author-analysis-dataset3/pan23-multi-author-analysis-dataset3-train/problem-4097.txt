So how do I prove that their negligent, I mean they’re already keeping too many pets when the max is only two. Maybe I can try and see if that’ll do anything, the fact that they’re hiding animals.
Those people live with one dog, five cats, in a tiny tiny old dirty townhome. You’re telling me they clean their house everyday of cat and dog shit because they HAVE to it they have that many animals. Also our townhomes ONLY allow two pets. (I have one cat only.).
I’m worried for the cats well being not just “oh is she being fed” I’m worried if she’s happy or not.
Sorry this happened to you, but like the previous comment said, it’s their cat since your mom gave it to them. You can’t report them to the police or sue them because they took the cat with your mom’s permission. And animal control won’t take the cat away from the new family just because you don’t approve of the way they live or interact with the cat. Unless you can show that they’re neglecting or abusing the cat (which you can’t), animal control won’t get involved.
I'm sorry animal welfare law doesn't force people to be good owners. Animal services are strained as is in eery location I know of trying just trying stop inhumane treatment.
