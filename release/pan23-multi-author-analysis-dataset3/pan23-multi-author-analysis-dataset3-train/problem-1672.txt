Is there any reason to believe the US would have intervened in any way had the nuclear strike on China actually occurred? With whom would they have sided has this been the case?
A last question maybe: I've always been puzzled by China's (sudden?) turn towards the US. Wasn't the Sino-Soviet split at least in part caused by the USSR's acceptance of "peaceful coexistence" being interpreted by China as cozying up to Western imperialism and renouncing world revolution in the first place? Didn't China sort of come full circle here, breaking up with the USSR because of its relationship with the US only to themselves end up developing a relationship with the US as a way to counteract the USSR's hegemony?
That is not to say intervention was not considered at all - America did more noticeably side with China in the 1970s and 1980s to balance out Soviet influence in the Far East in what IR theorists call "the strategic triangle." Limited military collaboration between China and the US did occur, and American listening posts were set up in Xinjiang to monitor Soviet nuclear activity. In the early 1960s, there was a case of almost-intervention, this time between the Soviet Union and the US. Kochavi's A Conflict Perpetuated: China Policy during the Kennedy Years shows that there was talk of a joint USSR-US strike against Chinese nuclear facilities during the time of the Kennedy Administration. However, this is more a case of superpower collusion to prevent nuclear proliferation, than a traditional intervention in terms of a bilateral military conflict.
