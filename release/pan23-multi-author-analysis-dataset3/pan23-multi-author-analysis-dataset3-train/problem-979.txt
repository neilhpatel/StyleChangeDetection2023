Obviously both things are food, I have made decent dishes with both millet and barley, just odd how much culture determines what's acceptable for people and what's not.
So strange that Romans ate grains we generally reserve for bird seed while their punishment was to eat a grain you can only get in beer or in the expensive aisle of a grocery store.
It was also used as food for slaves and gladiators - but for Roman citizens, the grain dole existed for a reason.
So for the people themselves, it was dehumanizing in more than one way - and it wasn't just the barley that was the reason. It was what the barley was (animal fodder). It was the other things that went with being forced to eat barley. And it was the judgement of all of their fellow soldiers. Camaraderie was essential in ancient armies as much as it was in modern ones, and the stain of being "otherized" in this manner wasn't something that would just go away or be forgotten: these guys would be dealing with the stigma for years afterwards. Sorry for the relatively short response, but let me know if there were any further questions!
It took a fair bit for an entire unit to be sentenced so: Polybius indicates that it was a punishment that accompanied decimation, and it was relatively rare. Here's the relevant quote:
Your quote here sounds like I had it exactly backward? erhaps they lived in a different century. Do you have any insights into this?
