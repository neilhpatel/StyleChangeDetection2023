According to the state’s landlord tenant act, your security deposit may only be deducted from for these reasons :
That doesn’t matter here, the law specifies that the deposit may only be deducted from for the given reasons. Additionally, I’m doubtful your lease can further restrict the conditions under which the deposit must be returned. Your deposit can be deducted from for damage to your unit or other facilities your landlord provides, or to cover unpaid rent/bills, or rent owed because you broke your lease. That’s it.
Let me backtrack a bit. The law itself doesn’t specify a form upon which notice must be provided. If your lease specifies that notice must be provided on a specific form, the LL might be within their rights to refuse a different form of notice. If you move out without providing acceptable notice, it will be like you never provided notice at all. And in that scenario your landlord could keep your deposit. The section of the lease that you provided pertained to deposits and surrendering the premises, is there any other section that pertains to notice?
condition hereof, the lease, at the option of Lessor, shall be given written notice of any default or.
I suppose it depends on how your lease was written, but it doesn’t seem like you should have owed the full month. If you’re interested in pursuing that discussion, it might be best to start a new post.
Your landlord owes you your deposit less an itemized list of deductions within 30 days of moving out. You must supply your landlord with a forwarding address. You must dispute deductions from your security deposit within 7 days or you lose the right to dispute them.
