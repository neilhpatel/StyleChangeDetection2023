Lol wishful thinking from big business who want the good ol' tax-cutting Republicans back without the crazy. It's not happening. The GOP has been on this path of crazy and hatred for decades. More moderate House Republicans are going to find themselves getting voted out by either a MAGA politician or a Democrat.
> It’s fair to say voters in these key states probably preferred Republican control of government, in no small part because more Republicans showed up to vote. They just didn’t find Republican candidates they wanted to support at the top of the ticket.
For some reason they just can't bring themselves to elect a moderate Republican Speaker, with the support of the Democrats. I just don't see why they can't be the swing vote for Speaker if they already see themselves as a swing vote in legislation. This is what sometimes happens in narrowly-divided state legislatures, when the extremists overplay their hand.
Well, sure, there's a group of reactionary firebrands who get a lot of attention as a perceived necessary component of an effective Republican majority, but like the article points out, there are enough moderate Republican House members to be a swing voting bloc.
