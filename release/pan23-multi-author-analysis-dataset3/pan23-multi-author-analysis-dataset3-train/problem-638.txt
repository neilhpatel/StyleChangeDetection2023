I think I’d need to hear a little more about this language evaluation. There are language evaluations that go up to the level of native fluency. If you took one of those, then yes this would appear to be illegal discrimination. If you just took a language evaluation that was merely with respect to being fluent enough for this job, then it’s not as clear cut. For instance, if you’d come in with the language evaluation of native fluency, maybe that you’d taken on your own accord and dime, would you be offered the native rates or the second language rates? I’m not sure it’s illegal discrimination for them to only offer tests that test up to a certain level of fluency, and then to only pay non-native speakers who have only demonstrated this certain level of fluency less than native speakers or those who have demonstrated a higher level of fluency.
You can pay people more based on the time they were hired, how well they negotiated, skill sets, the fact that they're related to you, but when you were treating a class of employees differently based on a racial or ethnic or national origin characteristic of which being the native speaker of one language or another is unquestionably an element of, that is unlawfully discriminatory.
Some may argue that "native-speaker" is not a protected class, but that is an absurd and racist argument that leads to de facto discrimination.
Some will say that the company is discriminating based off native language and not national origin, which is the protected class. But federal law has been applied to discrimination based off items that are closely aligned to a protected class, so it could still be prohibited. The classic example of this is when banks were forbidden to refuse to issue mortgages to blacks, they tried to refuse mortgages on houses in black neighborhoods, saying they weren’t discriminating against the person, but the place. It was called red lining. It was ruled to be illegal, too. It was deemed too closely aligned to race.
