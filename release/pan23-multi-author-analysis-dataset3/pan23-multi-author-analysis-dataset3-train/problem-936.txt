"The hospital underwent a major Israeli renovation in the 1980s as part of a showcase project to improve the living conditions of Gaza residents.[9]".
That being said the settlers there are 90% extremists and there's this odd situation where the IDF can't stand them but won't withdraw from the area because it has always had a Jewish presence and the Cave of the Patriarchs is located there.
I wonder if you actually believe any of that crap, after Israel’s neighbors have been actively trying to annihilate it for over 70 years, and the Palestinian refuse any recognition of Israel’s right to exist.
This sounds and reads like inflammatory bullshit to justify Israel going into Palestinian territory and killing Palestinians for fighting against tyrannical Israel.
I completely get the point of supporting a Palestinian state (i personally support one in the 1967 boarders) but this does mean we should ignore the fact the Palestinian are targeting civilians and do a lot of manipulations like firing rockets from schools and hospitals.
But yes, as long as is the official stance of the Palestinians and they continue, generation after generation to mind wash their kids through their formal and their , to murder Jews, the situation will continue.
Of course the more senseless violence the Palestinians show to Israelis, the more they radicalize Israeli citizens, empower settlers and eventually just make it harder for themselves.
Maybe the Palestinian can, for the first time in history, announce that Israel has a right to exist and they are letting go of the violence.
I promise you if that would be the case it will take a few short years before millions of Israelis are pushing hard for a Palestinian independent country.
I, and millions of other Israelis, welcome the idea of a Palestinian country. Settlers while many times shitty are a minority still and are only gaining more political power because of Palestinian extreme senseless and endless violence.
