NAL Itâ€™s unlikely that any legal recourse would happen because of this, including if they took a photo of your car in the red zone.
If the no-parking zone is legal for cars to drive on or through, then it's not like you drove onto the sidewalk. The fact that you parked in a no-parking zone and got out of your car is a separate issue, between you and the municipality.
A driver has to exercise a "reasonable standard of care", including keeping a lookout and operating their vehicle in order not to strike pedestrians or obstacles in the road that are reasonably able to be avoided. A mobile phone is arguably not reasonably able to be safely avoided when dropped into the roadway.
At best, it is an unfortunate accident that a pedestrian happened to drop their phone in the road in front of an oncoming vehicle.
I remember a few years ago that D.C. scrapped a special app and plan. In general, (and as far as I know everywhere in California) a patrol officer of some sort has to witness a parking infraction to be able to cite for it.
