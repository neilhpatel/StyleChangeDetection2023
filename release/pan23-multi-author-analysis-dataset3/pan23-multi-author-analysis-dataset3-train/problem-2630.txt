So, to be clear - this is not a person making NFTs out of images from your game, this is a person who drew art in the style of your game and is making NFTs of that art with the name of your game in the title?
You can't really copyright a style of art or a way of drawing characters. You can prevent someone from literally copying scenes from your game, but you can't "own" a style. So you can call your artsyle a "trademark" but it is not actually, legally, trademarked.
As said before, you can't trademark an artstyle and you most likely can't copyright an artstyle. There is only one extremely specific case that I know of involving the singer Tom Waits sueing and winning against commercials using voice imitators for his singing style but I am unsure if they sang his songs with an imitator or the exact shape of the lawsuit.
Sounds unenforceable unless they are copying a trademarked character exactly, like Mickey Mouse. However even Disney can't prosecute someone for selling art of a black humanoid mouse and they have spent billions protecting Mickey.
