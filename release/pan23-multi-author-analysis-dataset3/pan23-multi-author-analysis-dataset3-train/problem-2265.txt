Decay heat is something unique to nuclear, when you turn off a reactor you stop the chain reaction, but not the heat. The reason for this is pretty simple: some of the uranium from the fuel is now another unstable element, and when one of those atoms split into more stable elements (decay) they let off a little heat.
Thing is, there are a lot of decay product atoms kicking about in nuclear fuel. Enough, in fact, that those little bits of heat each decay is producing adds up to a significant amount of heat. There's no way to stop this heat from occurring, so instead we have to deal with it.
So yeah, it's less risky now that the plant's turned off, but there is still significant heat being made.
They probably mean the reactors are shut down, but there's still too much decay heat to call the plant safe.
It is my understanding the reactors have been in cold shut down (). As such it is not producing power. However the plant still requires power to operate systems, and even in cold shut down there is decay heat to deal with (risks are significantly reduced, and in the event of issues there will be more time to address them before they lead to an accident, but there is still some risk).
I heard somewhere they've slowly been running them down so as to eliminate the possibility of a meltdown/runaway reaction if the power is suddenly cut to them and they can't get backup generators running.
In cold shutdown the plant is in as safe a condition as possible were something to happen, and it would not be a severe accident with just loss of cooling (there may also be additional capabilities e.g. Post Fukushima the US added features like auxiliary generators, pumps, wiring to expedite restoring cooling & make up water). A complete loss of off-site power and emergency generators would be more like a three mile Island accident than Fukushima and no where near Chernobyl. Targeted attacks could result in worse outcomes of the intent were to do so.
