That said when looking at the whole picture, we can see how Tibet was very easily overlooked, both for Tibetan and Allied reasons.
That's all to say that beyond Chinese vs. Japanese, Reds vs. ahem Whites, Americans, even higher up officials like the President and Secretary of State weren't prepared to really think about the complexities of Asian geopolitics. I use the term Racism [1] not in a malicious way, but just as a reference to how at least the situation in Europe could be grasped even if to say the grievances of the Serbs against the Germans maybe wasn't "understood" in any deep sense of the term. Let's remember that a few decades earlier, the US annexed Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, and refused to extend full Statehood to any of these places, with the explanation being that the "alien races" that inhabited these zones could not understand "Anglo-Saxon Principles." I think it's safe to say that the United States saw Latinos, Pacific Islanders, and Asians as "lesser" and to varying degrees as "uncivilized.".
Ah, I see what you were saying. By protesting you meant boycotting. But I do not think they were boycotting the UNSCR 82 vote specifically. They were boycotting the SC in support of recognizing the PRC and turning the China SC seat over to them, no? If they wanted to protest the resolution vote, all they had to do was veto it. Either way, giving up their veto was a stupid move.
