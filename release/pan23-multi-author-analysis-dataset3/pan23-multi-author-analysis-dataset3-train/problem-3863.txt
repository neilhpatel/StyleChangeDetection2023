Reuters reporters visited the two college dormitories Russia's defence ministry said had been temporarily housing Ukrainian servicemen close to the front line of the war at the time of the overnight strike. Neither appeared to have been directly hit by missiles or seriously damaged. There were no obvious signs that soldiers had been living there and no sign of bodies or traces of blood.
Russia's defence ministry, in a statement, said the strike on the buildings in Kramatorsk was a revenge operation for a deadly Ukrainian attack last week on a Russian barracks in Makiivka, in part of the Donetsk region controlled by Moscow's forces, in which at least 89 servicemen were killed.
KRAMATORSK, Ukraine, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A Russian rocket strike on the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk caused damage but did not destroy buildings and there were no obvious signs of casualties, a Reuters witness said on Sunday, after Russia said the attack killed 600 Ukrainian soldiers.
"As a result of a massive missile strike on these temporary deployment points of Ukrainian army units, more than 600 Ukrainian servicemen were destroyed," the defence ministry said.
I remember months ago when Russian military and media people saying that they destroyed 10 times the number of HIMARS systems that Ukraine had in service.
While I still donâ€™t know what to make of the Ukraine claim that the attack on Russian ammo depots killed hundreds Russian soldiers, this one is a lot less believable.
If Russia says they killed 600 Ukrainian soldiers, then it must imply that Ukraine successfully killed 599 Russian conscripts. This is an absolute law in mathematics and logic.
