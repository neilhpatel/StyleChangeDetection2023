The GOP doesn't seem to get this. It doesn't matter what policy victories they win. We're going to keep holding our beliefs. And because corporate America likes retaining top employees and catering to the majority, they're going to hold to it too.
Highly shortsighted though. We've seen that Democrats can hold the Senate without these states, and competitive states have Democrat governors who are going to stay because voters don't want abortion banned.
Basically, Republicans cry “states rights!” When it’s anything they don’t like being regulated, but then run for the federal legislation for things they like.
Yeah I really would like to hear a Republican be asked sometime where they believe the line is on states rights. Because unless they're fine with states bringing back slavery and segregation, it has to be limited.
States rights are just slavery 2.0, it's quite literally the response southern politicians and land owners had to the emancipation of free'd black slaves, well those that wern't killed by white christans anyway.
