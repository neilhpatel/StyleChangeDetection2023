Look at the entire situation as a whole, all the pieces together: you want to force interaction with someone that doesn't want interaction with you, going so far as to go to their place of business and sit in a car in wait for them, with no other legitimate business at that place other than to wait for them, in order to again try and force an interaction that they don't want to have.
That's creepy, stalker behavior. Stop it and leave this person alone. If they ever want to have contact with you again, you can be sure they'll reach out to you \-- but the way in which you're reaching out to them isn't going to help anyone, and has a high likelihood of turning out badly -- for you.
You're answering posts addressing single points at a time as if "I didn't threaten her safety or life" and "I never left my car" and "My words were never unkind" and all these single, individual, dismissive things are going to collectively add up and amount to people going, "Oh, yes, you totally weren't doing anything creepy or threatening or stalker-ish at all, my mistake.".
Yes. If you act insane and threaten and harass people on their property they can trespass you from all their property so they don't have to deal with you acting crazy.
It is stalking. And anyone would feel that is a threat. You don't sit in front of people's work that don't want you there. That is insane and concerning. Any reasonable person would be scared.
