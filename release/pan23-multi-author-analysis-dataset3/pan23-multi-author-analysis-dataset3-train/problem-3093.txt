A deed is an official written document declaring a person's legal ownership of a property. So unless you want her to be co-owner of your home, do not accept her offer.
If her name is on the title, she is a co-owner of the house. I'd much rather pay PMI. She could use the title to get a loan, and then default on that loan leaving you holding the bag. She could sell her share to a third party without your knowledge or consent. She could file a court petition to force a partition sale or force you to buy her out.
Likely, a bank won't even loan you the purchase money if her name is on the title but not the mortgage.
Just remember this, if she is on the deed, you canâ€™t sell, lease or apply for mortgage without her say so.
Most (reputable) banks won't give a loan for a house if you're already borrowing money for the down payment. But do look for down payment assistance programs - I did one where I took a few Saturday courses on responsible home-ownership, then they matched a percentage of my down payment. Only had to pay it back (pro-rated) if I sold in less than 5 years.
Be careful about loans for down payments. Unless things have changed in the past ten-ish years. When I bought a house I used the FHA program and they had to know where ALL my down payment money came from, and any loans for down payment were a BIG no-no. Everything had to be proved - my grandmother gifted me money, and I had to supply not only a letter from her stating it was a gift, but also my mother's and my birth certificates proving she was my grandmother.
