Ask what resources they can recommend for domestic violence victims. But, do not tell them what you have done so far. Physically protecting yourself doesn't always line up with ideal legal procedures, especially in TX.
I also suggest getting a PO Box. Forward your mail there for USPS and use it for any shared accounts the moment before he knows what is happening. If you think it might have a password or possible access, change it too. Anything else should only go through your lawyer.
Then I would contact an attorney in TX. Based on his second marriage in a foreign country, there may be a way for your marriage to become annulled, since bigamy is very much frowned upon in this country.
But, depending on when the 2nd marriage happened, your marriage can be annulled. So, no divorce papers, no property to split, nothing. The marriage didn't exist, since he was already married.
we don't know she is the first marriage not the second. So far, it's ambiguous who the "mistress is." OP may have been a non consenting mistress. And abroad wife is the primary and sent him to the states to catfish someone for the money.
