The odd thing is I did make a report, and the record was removed from my fbi background yet still remains as a local nonextraditeable warrant.
The FBI may have removed this past incident from your NICS due to a lack of adjudication. Misdemeanor cannabis possession is generally not a disqualifying factor from future firearm ownership if you are choosing to define yourself as someone not consuming cannabis under penalty of perjury. Should you fill out a 4473 form denying your usage of illegal cannabis and then be charged with possession of cannabis, you would likely have a very different outcome.
Unsure of Texas' stance on the personal possession of hemp products which smell like marijuana because they are the same plant. In Florida, we require probable cause plus at this point. 20 vac sealed bails of green leafy stuff producing the smell of cannabis, no problem. But if you have glassy red eyes on top of that visual, you are no longer afforded protection.
He almost certainly did based upon the admissions you have stated here. Just the smell alone of cannabis is enough in many states to search a vehicle even though hemp is legal under federal law and in most states. Florida is I believe rare in establishing our probable cause plus policy which to my knowledge, is largely ignored by law enforcement due to a lack of knowledge on the part of defendants in possession of something. This policy likely even invalidates drug detection canines who have been trained in the detection of cannabis at any point, although there is no precedent to that as far as I am aware. A dog trained to detect cannabis can almost certainly not determine the difference between low-THC hemp and traditional marijuana.
