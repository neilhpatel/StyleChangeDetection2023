This is the toxic Salafi/Wahabbist interpretation of Islam being spread by the oil wealth, destroying Muslim communities and their image throughout the world. It's real sad.
Extremely sad to see. The Middle East has its own reasons for toxic extremist versions of Islam being so prevalent, but pushing its worst excesses onto unrelated distant countries without those geopolitical backgrounds is just tragic.
It isn't really Nazi stuff. Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim country, and while not as radical as many Muslim countries in the middle-east, is still staunchly conservative.
With Indonesia now moving further towards repression and conservatism, is there any majority muslim country left for liberal muslims to live in? Is the west now their only option?
Liberal Christians have multiple countries to choose (eg the Scandinavian nations). Liberal Buddhists and Chinese folk religion believers have Taiwan. Liberal Jews have large communities in the US and can live in liberal Israeli cities like Tel Aviv with relatively little influence of orthodox Jews in their daily life. Where would a liberal muslim go if he wants to live freely among fellow muslims?
And so dies the illusion of the "liberal" Muslim country. To be clear, this isn't about Islam, it's about failing to separate religion and the state. It's simply too tempting for governments to utilise religion to cement their power. All states should be secular to be accepted into the global community and global partnerships.
It's always easier to adapt existing laws that form new ones, unfortunately this adaptation is in the wrong direction. Keep in mind that Dutch law at that time was also heavily influenced by religion and since then Dutch law has taken a very different direction to Indonesian law.
