I don’t know which code section I violated, I got pulled over on Sunday and I am still waiting for my ticket in the mail. I also don’t really know what defense I have since I was speeding.
Yea that’s true, idk why he didn’t just give it to me right there I think it’s cus I wasn’t from that state. Also I don’t even think I would be able to show up for court either way since I leave for school on Monday, isn’t it possible though for me to not show up by either paying the ticket or hiring an attorney to represent me?
By “L” I mean just accept the ticket and pay it without going to court and trying to dispute it since you said the cop could bring up me going 17 over instead of 5 if I do take it to court.
The 17 over might be something the cop would bring up on the stand if disputed, but they made the decision to ticket you for the 5 mph. It is highly unlikely the prosecutor would change the initial charge. The judges role in the case is just to say yes or no. Hard to give an absolute perfect answer since laws and chaos, but you're probably fine. It's buisness as usual for everyone involved as new as this is to you.
