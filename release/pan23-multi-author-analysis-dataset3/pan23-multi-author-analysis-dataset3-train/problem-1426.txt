A more interesting question is: did pre-colonial laws in Africa similarly criminalise LGBTQ+ acts? I hope a more learned responder than I will jump in -- it has been very challenging trying to do research on pre-colonial laws, a lot of which is customary and by its nature undocumented.
I notice the current top comment focuses on African socio-cultural attitudes towards LGBTQ+, rather than laws per se, so I'll try and chip in with two legal case studies.
With that said, the study of sexuality in pre and post colonial Africa has been a very hot topic in both history and anthropology. Researchers have tried to prove or disprove existence of homosexuality in pre and post colonial Africa to connect it with the social situation of contemporary gays and lesbians on the continent. One of the most well known books on this is Heterosexual Africa?: The History of an Idea from the Age of Exploration to the Age of AIDS by Marc Epprecht where he examines same-sex practices in Southern Africa, and Hungochani: The History of a Dissident Sexuality in Southern Africa also by Marc Epprecht. Another well known book is Boy-Wives and Female Husbands: Studies in African Homosexualities by Stephen O. Murray, Will Roscoe, and Marc Epprecht.
