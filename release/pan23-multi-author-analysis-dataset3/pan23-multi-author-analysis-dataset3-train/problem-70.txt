Legally, marriage offers you protections and benefits you're simply not getting otherwise. That was demonstrated clearly in Obergefell.
Being offered joint healthcare insurance by employers, having an easier division of property (specifically a home) in a split, avoiding significant tax burden on an inheritance. Being able to make medical decisions for one another. A thousand and one other tiny things.
The government is involved because marriage affords you specific legal privileges you don't get otherwise.
Not really sure how to dispel some of your possibly incorrect beliefs about the legal commitments involved in marriage without more specifics.
What marital strain has been created by the legal commitments of marriage? Are you saying it affected their taxes? Because I honestly can’t think of any other legal commitments/requirements that accompany marriage that someone wouldn’t see as a benefit.
While unmarried couples may be able to replicate some of those things via various agreements and powers of attorney and what-not, marriage is generally a much smoother, cheaper, and easier path to realizing all those benefits at once.
Legally, there are a lot of laws that take marriages into account, and without the legal marriage you may not always be treated the same as other couples that are legally married. Overall there are too many examples to list.
