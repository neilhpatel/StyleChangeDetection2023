You are right and there lies my anxiety about this situation. It was great negligence on my part. I know it's a very broad question when the context of the document is missing. I guess what I wanted to know is, whatever the document is can I be held responsible for whatever is in it.
It really is shot in the dark. Just wanted to hear some opinions. But yes, not knowing what the actual document is makes it tough the feel it out. It did seem to me that he simply needed someone to witness he signed the section of the document.
If you don't know what the document said, you don't know if you affirmed that you witnessed an action, or just that you witnessed a signature.
I will take a stab - if you were signing as a witness there's a high chance (not 100% mind you) that he just needed someone to witness that he signed it. If that's what it was, then you probably have little connection to whatever was in the document.
Maybe? Probably? Any answer we give other than "maybe" is nothing but wild guessing, since nobody, including you, has any idea what the document is.
