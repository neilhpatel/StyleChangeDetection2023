Although he won't understand it, every 1 degree increase in GW causes 7% more moisture to be able to be held in the air. This increases both the amount of rain fall and snow fall, but because it also changes circulation patterns, it will often happen in unusual places.
Lake effect snow comes from colder air interacting with warmer lake water, thus creating frozen precipitation. Lake water is significantly warmer due to…global warming.
With the higher temperatures, though, the lakes don't freeze. This means more water evaporates and more lake effect snow falls.
Of course, the heaviest lake effect snows occur when the water is warmer. They’ve always occurred earlier in the season. I also realize there is a capacity for more moisture in warmer air. My original point was that the stable genius is implying climate change is not real because a cold air mass was associated with a major weather event. Like idiot Senator Inhofe with the snowball spectacle when there was a late season storm. Both he and trump are both arrogantly ignorant, though the former is more hypocritical and cynical in his denial.
Of course 3 of the previous 6 or 7 winters very cold weather blasted the east coast reminiscent of the 1980’s and the deniers cited the ‘fallacy’ of warming conveniently ignoring the fact that the rest of the country and most of the world we’re experiencing temperatures far above previous norms.
