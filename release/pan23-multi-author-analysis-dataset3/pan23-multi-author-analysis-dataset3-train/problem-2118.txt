Yea it's certainly not taking into account that teens are 3 times more likely to be involved in automobile accidents than young adults 20 and over on a national level:
And the reason many states have raised the age for teen drivers is because of statistics like this one:
Yeah and then the parents see the rate increase and decide it's better to lie about having a teen driver. Then little Timmy wrecks the car on the way to the coal mine and everyone else's rates go up to compensate. Saying car insurance companies want more 15 year olds driving is like saying life insurers want more smokers.
Honestly sounds like a way to make things more car dependant and promoting unhealthy lifestyles, by gaining habits young. Most corners have convience stores, or coffee shops now. If we just start having maybe a gym at every corner or healthy drink stands instead of drive thrus maybe we can promote healthier lifestyles, but this isn't realistic solution as other factors come to play, but a solution I would like to see.
I'm just saying in more suburban and populated areas, rural areas have more responsibilities of taking care of land and animals. That comes with excrise, and long walks.
