My neighbor was parked on the short side of the rectangle with no parking, blocking in the cars at that end. I was parked in a spot further down on a long side.
No, they always floor it because of where they park. They park on the side of the lot nearest their door, but there are no spots there. They floor it and back straight out across the entire lot, usually as fast as you would on the road. If you are parked far enough down the lot, you can't see them parked on that side. I was most of the way out of my spot, so they had to start moving after I did.
I have no idea what any of this is about. I'm happy to pay my deductible and move on, but I've been told I'm now responsible for their damages. I have no clue how any of this is possible.
Maybe. You already said you couldn’t see them as you backed out and they floored it. Maybe they were trying to avoid you as you came toward them? I don’t know, but you were backing and hit something you couldn’t see. You will share the blame at the very least. Them being parked illegally is totally irrelevant.
I felt the same way when something similar happened to me. Sucks, but that’s how it is. You can try fighting it but the insurance companies don’t care. Hope they don’t also raise your rates.
