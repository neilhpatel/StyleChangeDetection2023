Maybe. This will be a fact specific inquiry that will depend on where you are located, the precise terms of your engagement with lawyer, and the standard of practice for attorneys in your area. It’s also possible that this was some thing that you should have discovered in your own due diligence. In any event, you now have an obligation to mitigate your damages and that means getting the appropriate CO in place as expeditiously as possible. If you don’t do that you cannot simply sit around and wait for the business value to go down and then blame your lawyer.
This is why lawyers have engagement agreements (and why clients should always read them!). Perhaps the other lawyers agreed to include checking for this kind of thing in the scope of their engagement.
Thought it might say something like that. No, I don't think checking for an appropriate CO would be part of an ordinary real estate transaction unless that is specifically required by a lender or title insurance, or specifically requested by the buyer..
BUT - they are advising on the real estate transaction, and shouldn't any lawyer make sure there is a proper certificate of occupancy for a real estate transaction?
This makes no sense he was engaged to transition the business and the real estate that goes along with it - how can he advise on transitioning the business etc withotu making sure there is a certificate to occupy the space?
I hired him to handle the sale of the business and the accompanying real estate and the legal ability to operate the business one is acquiring?
