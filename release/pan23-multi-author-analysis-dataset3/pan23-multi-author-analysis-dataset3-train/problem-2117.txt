I mean it's sad when anyone dies unnecessarily but I feel like 20 million guns that can only be associated with 36 total deaths across 9 months is not that bad all things considered. Still.
The isolated event was the major one at Las Vegas not every mass shooting, the majority of which are not committed with AR15s or rifles at all.
"In half of the ten deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history, AR-15-style rifles were the primary weapon.".
It's not just one thing. There's a lot of bigger societal issues at play. Guns alone aren't to blame. I agree with you there.
As a firearm person I would agree with that. I have a hard time deciding where to draw the line and who decides it. Like I know friends that I know shouldn't have a firearm but that are respectable members of society and they haven't done anything for the law to stop them.
I think most people can agree some mentally ill, unstable, and violent/angry people shouldnâ€™t have easy access to weapons like this.
If you're unable to comprehend any other possibilities between "I am 100% ok with people being shot" and "Ban guns because they are bad" then you have no place in this discussion.
