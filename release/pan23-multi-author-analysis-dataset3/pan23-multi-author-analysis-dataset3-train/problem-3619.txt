I would also add The Journal of Slavic Military Studies (formerly The Journal of Soviet Military Studies) if one is specifically interested in Russian military history.
I'm interested in Russian history (especially Imperial Russia), History of Ideas, and leftist political thought.
How do I go about finding the "best" journals for articles? I'm planning on applying to graduate school and would like to read some journals to get a better idea of what's current in history.
I'm not a history student, but I plan on writing a paper for a course somewhat related to US history. The idea is to do something on the early days of the Republic. Haven't exactly narrowed it down yet, but I'm toying with the Constitutional Convention, the Constitution itself, or something about the Federalist Papers. Sorry if this is too broad, I have a lot of time on my hands, so the whole thing is in the early stages. Do you think the two books I mentioned above would be of use? Any other recommendations? Thanks in advance!
I'm not totally sure if this thread is right for book recommendations, so if my post breaks any rules, I wouldn't mind a redirection.
Anyway, can I get some opinions on the Oxford History of the United States? Particularly the first two volumes, The Glorious Cause and Empire of Liberty.
