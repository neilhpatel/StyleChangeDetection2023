I would disagree that this is a confined space. There is no chance of an atmospheric hazard, there are means of egress (windows) and unless there is live exposed electrical or protruding nails I don't see any hazards. I do agree that it is not designed for occupancy.
I agree with the possible fire code/ building code violation but disagree with this being an OSHA violation.
In the construction standard even things like crawl spaces, attics and basements can, but generally do not meet the criteria for confined space.
This is more of a really bad, cheap, and lazy design that quickly added framing to a room during a remodel. The area in-between the framing and the exterior wall was not intended to use, but I fail to see the danger.
The first safety solution should be elimination, remove the extra wall or rebuild it with one window to outside for instance. Build a mechanism to open both window from inside at same time. The very last thing they should be doing is sending you in there to open it.
Could also be a building code violation. Spaces like that can be a fire hazard and act like a chimney or tunnel defeating the fire strenh of original wall.
