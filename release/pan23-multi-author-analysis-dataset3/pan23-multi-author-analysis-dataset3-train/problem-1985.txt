We should hold a contest and equalize for GDP, income and cost and find out what country has the most corrupt politicians/people. I'm sure that we in Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria and our neighbors are fucked but you still have more income and people to steal from so we can't beat you.
Man, how are you so corrupt? I have seen corruption, things that would make you commit suicide, but your politicians still out-compete ours.
There's a joke about New York corruption and Chicago corruption. The difference being that with NY corruption, you eventually get what you (over)paid for whilst with Chicago corruption, you end up with nothing. The B-2, F-22, etc. are all super expensive but they are the best in the world. Russia? There's so much corruption that the tires burst when driven into war.
It's also not new corruption. Prior to the US revolution, the colony of Virginia was so bad for that, the other colonies refused to do business with it.
The sad-funny story that's unfolding is Louis Rossman(right to repair guy on Youtube) had legitimate grievances with the city of New York and how its run. So he moved himself and his business to Austin Texas, and is slowly realizing that the grass that he thought was green most assuredly isn't.
