Especially if these sketchy developers and constructions companies were big-time supporters of Erdogan and contributors to his political party. Isn't he considered to be pretty far right on the political spectrum? I know that he was pushing for Turkey to become more 'Islamic' and less secular. So could he be seen as a kind of Turkish 'Trump', 'Bolsonaro', or 'Orban'?
While most people think of the big earthquake danger zones in the US as all being in California, Oregon, Washinon state and Alaska, there's a lesser known area known as the New Madrid Seismic Zone which unleashed at least three massive quakes with an estimated Richter score of between 7.2 and 8.6 in the fall/winter of 1811/1812. The Mississippi River ran 'backwards' at one point, the shaking was felt all the way to the east coast and Reelfoot Lake was created in Tennessee. While the area was lightly populated at the time, today you have two large metro areas -- St. Louis and Memphis -- with sizable populations along with many bridges and pipelines crossing the Mississippi that could be severed. Also, until recently, a lot of our buildings in this region weren't built with earthquakes in mind.
You don't necessarily have to build earthquake proof buildings. Simple steel reinforced concrete would keep the building together and stop it from outright collapsing. It may still be fucked, but it can be fucked and still allow people to escape alive. What they have now is basically jenga towers where any disturbance to the bottom of the tower brings the whole thing down.
