Your discussion about alcohol is very interesting. How does it compare to other nations in particular Britain?
Your answer seems to imply Germans were driven to alcohol to a greater extent due to committing more significant atrocities, although you don't make the point explicitly, could you clear that up?
What was different about Nazi Germany that they didn't make the (logical or not) leap of "if alcoholism is bad and should be punished, drug addition in general is bad and should be punished" that occurred in the United States (and presumably elsewhere... though I suppose the US had alot to do with that)?
So, concerning Ohler: If there was an intoxicating substance that in the social history of the Third Reich played a role on a historically significant scale, it was alcohol and not other drugs. Portraying Hitler as a complete dope fiend and junky while certainly making a good pitch to sell a book is historically less significant in the overall history of the Thrid Reich than thousands of members of the Wehrmacht and the SS loading up on cheap schnapps.
