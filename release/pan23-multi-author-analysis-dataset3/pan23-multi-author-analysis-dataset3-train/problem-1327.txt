Thank you! I believe this is exactly what is happening. Only one of the tenants has viewed the rental contract, so we don’t even know what it states regarding sublets.
If the lease states this isn’t allowed then tenant 1 is in the wrong and is rightfully being evicted per the terms of the lease. Landlord is allowed to limit the number of tenants in a property or to require approval of subleases.
If I’m reading it right, your friend sublet a room from the original lease holder unknowing to the landlord. Landlord doesn’t allow this so when they found out they said ‘you’re out! ‘ to the additional tenants. They have a duty to protect their own property and having additional tenants goes against that.
The landlord has legal obligations to provide specific notice to the occupants. Landlords also cannot change locks, throw out possessions, cut utilities, among other things.
Ultimately your options are to move or be legally evicted which will affect your credit and ability to rent in the future.
Here's a link to a legal help page that can help outline what the eviction process in Michigan looks like. It's important to note that Michigan is not a self help state for eviction.
