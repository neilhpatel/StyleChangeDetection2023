The only group that has said it’s a weather balloon are the Chinese and they won’t exactly own up and say “yeah it’s a spy balloon.” Now I agree that they already have satellites for that kind of stuff, so I don’t know why they would go the balloon route, but until the thing is safely landed, disassembled and investigated.. Hope to the best, plan for the worst.
Just A civilian weather balloon that happened to get lost…which conveniently nobody reported as going missing in case it blew into another country’s airspace.
One thing I don't see mentioned is maybe they didn't blow it out the sky yet because they know something on the balloon is dangerous and they don't want it to be released over our atmosphere.
They didn't shoot it down immediately because it's a balloon. Why give China Intel on how our air defenses work, and how effective Norad is at picking things up?
But I really doubt they'd put something dangerous on there and risk starting WW3 over a weather/spy balloon of all things.
If there's anything on there that's sensitive we didn't detect, then we can wait around and see if China goes for it, or recover it ourselves.
