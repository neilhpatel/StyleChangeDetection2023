None of that matters one tiny bit. They need to grow up cause they’re paying child support very soon and for very long.
They’re crying over spilt milk and best make nice with the mother or run the risk of long term issues.
I’ve had many friends say “But I had an agreement with her to stay out of the kids life and never pay....” as the judge signs the child support order.
Stupid question, but if a parent signs their rights away for their child are they still legally obligated to provide for that child? Similar events are happening to me and I’m curious.
I guess it’s not that he doesn’t want kids it’s probably most likely he doesn’t want kids with HER. He took the proper precautions of using protection. From my understanding they only hooked up maybe 2 or 3 times I don’t think getting a vasectomy is necessary at such a young age (20).
It’s not the fact that my family member doesn’t want to pay, it’s the fact that the mother went against my family member and (I wouldn’t say tampered with the protection because I don’t know what happened) made sure she got pregnant. They don’t want to go into a financial depression due to a child that they did not want.
You can't sign away your responsibility to financially support your children in this manner. The contract is not going to be worth the paper it is written on.
