1. It doesn't cost anything to dispute the charge. They have nothing to lose, and everything to gain, by disputing it.
TL;DR Postpone as much as possible, hope the cop doesn't show up, and book your class 5 road test ASAP.
What you want to do is postpone the court date the maximum number of times possible. Since you have an N license, the points won't be applied until after the court hearing, and this gives you more time to get your full license, where the points will be less of a hit to your license.
Another benefit to postponing is it increases the chance the police officer not showing up (happens about 50% of the time here), which, in most cases, is an automatic win in your favour and the ticket gets thrown out. If he does show up, not much you can do honestly. Claim fault equipment or whatever, question the police officer on car model/location/speed, or if their Radar was calibrated. Pretty much anything that could be forgotten in the year (or more) until your court date. Of course, this depends on the quality of the officer's notes. You could also plead first time offense to try and get the judge to lower it to a moving violation, which is a no-point offense, though this may be unlikely since it is an excessive speeding case.
The judge may lower your ticket from excessive speeding, to speeding within a municipality, but I wouldnâ€™t count on it.
