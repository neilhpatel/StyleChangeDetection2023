Israel has always been able to strike deep in Iran. That they resorted to assassinations is just politics. And even an Israeli strike would still not trigger a war, Iran's state allies are mired in wars they cannot win (Russia and Syria). At most, Iran would employ the usual proxies to terrorize Israelis and Jews.
Israel could be retaliating for what's been going on or could have been acting on intelligence about Iranian nukes.
Could be a Ukrainian special forces operation to disrupt Iranian drone production. They've hit targets in Russia in similar fashion.
Could be Saudis finally getting their own revenge for the Abqaiqâ€“Khurais attack. Also don't forget they were pretty concerned back in November that Iran was going to attack them.
Considering everything happening in Iran right now? I would put Iranians themselves a lot higher. Specifically Iranians committing sabotage against the regime. Right behind an Israeli strike, IMO.
I bet it's the Israelis. Could be the US though. Possibly Saudi Arabia. Might be Azerbaijan. Could also be the Taliban. Maybe Kurdish separatists. Might also be Ukraine.
