Russia created conditions necessary for Ukraine to launch SAM counter measures which lead to the accident making them the responsible party.
You know we have laws like this in the US for example, if you are robbing a store and someone dies as a result, even if you do not kill them, even if they were killed on accident by the police in response to your crime, you will be charged with murder.
At the same time, to use another example from US law, if you are in a situation where you are forced to use a firearm to defend yourself, but miss and hit a bystander you will be held accountable. Though you'd likely be held less accountable than if there was no defensive situation.
Again, that's obviously much less responsibility than if you were just out there firing off a gun for fun, but you would still be held accountable again situation depending.
While this is likely what would happen in terms of criminal liability, you will almost certainly be sued and situation dependent face civil consequences.
