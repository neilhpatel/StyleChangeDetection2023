Skepticism is understandable. But Mueller ultimately reported to Trump and Senate Republicans ignored the evidence in covering for Trump during the impeachments. The fix was in for all of those previous attempts to hold him accountable.
The fix was in on all those previous attempts, but that wasn't 100% clear at the outset. In hindsight it was clear, but people legit believed Mueller was going to absolutely nail him to a wall. The fix could be in here also we just don't see it in the moment.
You put a period in Barr's quote that doesn't exist, missing important context: "the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense.".
. Trump was so horrified that info about it would get out that he bought out the hair plug company, closed them to the public, moved them to the apartment below his in his tower, and installed a secret staircase between his apartment and the clinic. It's a wild, unbelievably vain story.
