Living wages, affordable healthcare And mental health care, affordable housing and education, and jobs that treat people right.
Ok let’s do universal health care, increase living wages, invest in education, infrastructure, social programs.
Well there’s already so many guns out there- yes there are, let’s stop increasing that number and save some lives in the process. Are you really against these sensible measures which likely would not impact you or other responsible gun owners in any way?
Do you think you have a better chance taking on the most powerful military in the world with some pistols and rifles than you do with a pointed stick?
Would you prefer to protect yourself with any form of small arms or a sharp stick? An armed intruder breaks into your home are you better prepared with your own firearm or your cell phone calling 911 then waiting for armed help defenseless? I see it says your from New York how’s all that strong gun control working out for you guys? I just saw the other day there was a shooting in Times Square how could that happen in such a gun control bastion?
