Your landlord can't set arbitrary lease conditions after the lease has been signed, unless you agree to those conditions in writing. It's even more unlikely (and maybe illegal) to set arbitrary lease conditions on vaccination status after the lease has been signed or on future leases.
Do we really want to grant landlords the power to discriminate leases based on people's vaccination status or health?
The landlords don't want unhappy and disruptive tenants any more than you want to be living with this unvaccinated person.
Also you should stop discussing vaccinations with your roommate in any sense other than the necessity of moving out over the issue. There is no recitation of facts that are going to fix your roommate. And the total amount of resentment you can engender if you did have a way to force them or control them into getting vaccinated isn't worth the effort.
Cuz let's face it, deciding to remain at risk for a pandemic disease because you don't trust vaccinations, that's not just dumb it's rude.
You certainly can't break your least because you and your friends/coworkers have unreasonable understandings of the effect of being vaccinated and being exposed to those that aren't.
