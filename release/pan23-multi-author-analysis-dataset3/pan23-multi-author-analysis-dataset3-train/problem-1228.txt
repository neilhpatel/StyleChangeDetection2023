So it would probably depend on a person's level of education and their access/proximity to literate culture, ie nobility, monastic orders, the clergy, and so on, but we have a lot of gaps to fill in and in all likelihood its probably not as exciting as you think. It also might not quite be what you're expecting!
Literate people of the time period are the ones that are best represented in surviving texts, by simple virtue of the fact that they are the ones making the texts. We might occasionally get a glimpse into what "mythologies" the people might believe in, but they will only ever be glimpses. So if you're looking to find out what Wulfric the stable hand thought about elves or dragons and so on, you're kind of out of luck for this time frame, but that doesn't mean there was no room for what we might call the supernatural or superstitious among the learned classes of people, just that everything we know comes through highly filtered sources or is conjecture based on other belief systems or projecting beliefs backwards in history. As an aside, if you're curious particularly on folklore of later England, specifically Cornwall, /u/itsallfolklore is the go to!
Perhaps someone else in this thread will have more solid examples of cross-pollination of folklore between British kingdoms - hagiography and art are likely to be the places you'd find it. But I hope this helps clarify how difficult it is to answer your question.
