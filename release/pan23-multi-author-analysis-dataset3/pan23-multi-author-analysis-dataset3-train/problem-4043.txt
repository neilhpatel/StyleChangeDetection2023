Good, after the FIFA boss's insane rant that pissed off the left for trying to deflect from the horrible stuff Qatar does (seriously, slave labour) and the right by spreading hate speech and false statements about Europeans and their history in an horrible attempt of whataboutism, no one should watch this shit show or cover it in a neutral light.
FIFA executive: Qatar drove a dump truck of money to my front door to let them host, will I overlook the glaring slave labor to insure what little ethics we have in the world?

I mean. What the fucking fuck? It's supposed to be a news media. It's not supposed to be a troll media that dances for public appeasement.
I'm good with this questionable logic too if this is something universal. But given Japan still isn't allowed to have any army. There are things Germany isn't allowed to do. It feels like this guilt free future generations is not something everyone enjoys.
