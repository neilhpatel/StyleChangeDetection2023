You can contact the local health department and talk to them about unsanitary conditions. Especially since there are large amounts of waste in common areas where children play.
On a practical note, though, there may not be much you can force to get done except control where your dog walks to keep them out of it. If your dog is small enough to carry, carry them past these common areas until you get to safer ground. If it's a larger dog, keep them right at your side and maybe even focus on a treat until they walk past the problem area into safer ground.
A muzzle and booties on your dog until the yard is cleaned up will provide more for your dog's health in the meantime while you are trying to convince the property management company to "do something.".
Also. I’m aware they don’t have to do that. The person I was messaging asked me to state what I wanted them to do. I’m pissed that they won’t do the one thing that will end it. They don’t really have to test every pile of poo. Just a couple and ppl will get the idea. And the idea that they can’t afford the testing, you charge offenders. And if there are a bunch of bills piling up for dogs they can’t Id, make the offenders pay a piece of it. There are ways to make that work.
