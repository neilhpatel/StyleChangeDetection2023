I’ve never seen this usage before in my nearly 50 years. Personally it looks weird and I’m with your parent poster. Yes I can figure it out. That doesn’t make it “everyone knows”.
I haven’t seen a number from Ukraine. Do you have an official source of one? And we were talking about the count of Ukrainian casualties here, not Russian, so maybe you were mixed up with that?
Allegedly, both sides will use propaganda, we probably won't know true death counts for Ukraine and Russia until long after the war. Fair to say Russia ironically getting their shit pushed in though.
Russia's figures are off by a factor of ten from everyone else. Everyone else is Ukraine's numbers +/-10%.
That's not true. The various western defense intel agencies all have their own estimates, derived from their own sources. These are mostly in line with Ukrainian estimates, though Pentagon officials are on the record saying they think Ukraine overstates Russian losses a bit.
That all the estimats are clustered together is not an indication that everyone is cribbing Ukraine's notes. It's consensus. The Pentagon wouldn't be able to say "Ukraine's numbers are a little high" if they couldn't arrive at their own number independently.
