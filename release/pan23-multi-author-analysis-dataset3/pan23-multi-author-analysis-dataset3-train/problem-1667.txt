It's because a steam locomotive has two main parts: an external-combustion engine and a water tank. Earlier, static, steam trains often had an external water source - so the combination of engine and tank was a 'tank engine'.
A tank engine can still tow a water tender - this will sometimes show as 'T+T' on type notation (tank + tender.) But yes, typically they have smaller engines than a tender-only design.
There are some articulated South African tank-only locos that rival even big American tender locos. And they were also favoured on lines with turntables, as you can fit a TE on a turntable in one go - if you have a busy rail yard in a confined space it can be more economical to build water towers along the line than spend more time on the turntable (you see this a lot on the GWR line - turnaround time was at a premium in London so the line has more water towers than you'd expect for such a short line.).
Yes. That is entirely the point of supporting Ukraine. They are defending sovereignty, democracy and international law on our behalf. Anyway we can help, we should.
