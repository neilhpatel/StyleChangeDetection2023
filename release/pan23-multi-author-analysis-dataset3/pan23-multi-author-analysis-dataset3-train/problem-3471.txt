Yes, California (along with almost the entirety of the US) has at-will employment, meaning that you or your employer can both terminate your employment arrangement at any time, for any or no reason at all, with the exception of illegal discrimination or retaliation.
In California, without a contract or union, you are an at-will employee and can be terminated for any non-discriminatory reason.
With the exception of Montana in some situations, or if you have an employment contract or CBA, employees are at-will and can be fired for any non-illegal reason or no reason.
I have no idea. If you have limited work history of only this job then it's possible you are not eligible but you should still apply. it sounds like you did and don't have enough wages to qualify. Sometimes people just think they don't qualify without applying and would have been eligible which is very unfortunate.
Did you just believe you are not qualified for unemployment or did you actually apply and were found to be ineligible?
