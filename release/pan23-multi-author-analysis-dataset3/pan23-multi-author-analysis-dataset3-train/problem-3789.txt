I did not sign a new loan contract. The reason I thought the situation was fraudulent is because the dealership called to say the loan had been approved and I needed to sign a new contract, but failed to tell me that the loan did not get approved for the original amount (4.4%) and they tried to get me to sign a contract with 6.8% without disclosing it. I told them I was not signing a new contract and they lied and stated that they were able to secure the terms through a new provider but now the new provider has also cancelled the loan. I was told I was not able to back out of the contract because they had 30 days to perfect (30 days from 12/12/20). They still have not been able to secure the lien so I’m trying to figure out my options. I want to take the car back but the dealership is telling me that I can’t return it.
The reason I bring up the title is because I am a co-signer on my boyfriend’s vehicle which is already registered to my name.
I was contemplating calling the Arizona Dept of Finance and Insurance, the agency that oversees and regulates the dealership and speaking with them as well.
Finally, you can file a report with the , the regulatory agency responsible for auto dealership oversight.
The dealership appears to be way out of their legal requirements, but that might just be their standard operating procedure. It's not uncommon.
