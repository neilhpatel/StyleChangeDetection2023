One of the biggest wins in the debates for Pavel was Babis saying he would not support Czech military assistance to fellow NATO allies despite Article 5, instead opting to say he'd try dialogue and negotiations if an ally were to be invaded. Meanwhile Pavel is literally the former Chair of the NATO military committee, the most senior military position in NATO.
He was also the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee until 2018 when he instead went into politics. So him being Pro Nato also isn't exactly a surprise.
The fact that the president elect is pro-west, pro-EU, pro-NATO is notable and should not be taken for granted.
NATO has benefits for the traditional major Western powers, yes, but it also ensures that they are not allowed to slack on defending the democratic states of Central and Eastern Europe like in the past.
No. Babiš has framed Pavel as a warmonger (going so far as to send out fake texts from Pavel telling the recipient that they have been mobilized), but it’s all bluster.
The Czech presidency is largely ceremonial anyways, and it mainly helps represent the Czech Republic on the international stage. Pavel will probably be the first non-embarrassing president Czechs have had in 20 years.
