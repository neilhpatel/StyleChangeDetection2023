The second tradition sounds almost exactly like Fezziwig celebrates Christmas in A Christmas Carol by Dickens, and the first tradition what Scrooge envied his boarding school peers who returned home to their families for Christmas. The third unfortunately sounds like the more recent Santa-cons...
Since A Christmas Carol was written in the mid 1800s when Britain was also in the process of a transformation of Christmas traditions, would you happen to know if the similar dynamics were in play there, though perhaps with different groups observing the different traditions?
With the popularization of the Santa Claus myth in the aftermath of the publication of "Twas the Night Before Christmas" in 1823, an already-emerging gift-giving tradition was given a mascot. The emphasis on Christmas being a "childrens day" soon took hold.
A second tradition was to observe Christmas as a family holiday, just as we do today. This was particularly popular in New York and New Jersey among families who were either part of the Dutch Reformed Church, or who had some Dutch ancestry. Anglicans/Episcopalians and Presbyterians in the "Middle Colonies" and the South commonly celebrated in this way, too. Observers of this tradition would also often start the day off by going to church, while the rest of the day was spent much like Thanksgiving - a big feast with the extended family. If not playing host, then you might be the guest at the home of a close friend or relative who lived nearby. There was also modest gift-giving, especially to the children in the family, though this was more variable the further back you go. Dutch New Yorkers usually celebrated St. Nicholas Day earlier in December as the "children's day", and many others used New Year's as the gift-giving day. And, often, there was no gift-giving at all - it wasn't quite yet a tradition set in stone. The main way to celebrate was with food and drink and indoor fun and games.
