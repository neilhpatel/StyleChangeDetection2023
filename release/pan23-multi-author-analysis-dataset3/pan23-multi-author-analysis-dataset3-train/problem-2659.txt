I still think the number 1 way for Ukraine to get their country back soon is for something to change in the Russian govt.
It looks like Ukraine will win this war even though there are many nichtmares ahead. Russia has no meaningful allies, their economy is in a death spiral and their demographic problems only get worse by all the war dead. I am not sure what comes after though.
They stopped the early mechanized capital rush by Russia with a lightning fast mobilization and smart use of anti-tank weapons. They stopped the land grab in the South and East and stabilized those fronts after Russia's surprise momentum. They forced the invaders to retreat from Kyiv region. They liberated Kharkiv and captured tons and tons of Russian equipment. They liberated Kherson region by strategically cutting supply lines. Ukraine has been very smart in this war and I do think we can expect the liberation of the Melitopol area and a push towards Crimea soon.
Ukraine will fortify Bakhmut whilst Russia will fortify Melitopol -- each pushing soft targets on the front lines. The key difference is the proximity of those battles to supply lines. Ukraine has an advantage fighting in its own territory, shortening logistic routes and allowing for greater efficiency in the rotation of troops.
The continuous supply of western armaments will eventually overwhelm Russian supply lines and Ukraine will seize the opportunity to thrust forward to the coast.
