I am not a lawyer but am a civil engineer with experience in water distribution design. If the city is saying that its not possible, they are either not knowledgeable or just trying to get you off their back. Keep trying, or just go get a contractor and a right-of-way permit and get it done. There is almost certainly a closer water main that can be tapped to get water to your house, the City is probably just trying to avoid it becoming their problem. Is the water service line under their building or just running thru their parking lot or something?
Where is the meter for the water line? Often (not always) the city or water utility company is responsible for the line from the main to the meter, and the property owner is responsible for the meter to the home. So, if a new water tap needs to be made, which is quite possible, the city may be responsible for re-running part of the line.
Find a plumber or general contractor who does new construction in your area. They will know the right people to speak with, and will know the permitting process. Not all plumbers will know the process. If the easement is through the parking lot, the business and property owner next door are REQUIRED to allow access to the line with notice. You'll need to have your plumbing conractor look into that situation. Otherwise, it isn't that big a deal to move the water line to a new tap location that is more direct. A big rock CERTAINLY isn't a reason not to move it.
