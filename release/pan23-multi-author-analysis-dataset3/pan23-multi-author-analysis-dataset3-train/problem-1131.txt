I would get a consult with a real estate attorney before agreeing to anything. They will explain what rights, responsibilities, liabilities etc you would have from signing, what could happen if you refuse to sign anything.
You should talk to a local lawyer about this. Generally in TN the beneficiaries signature and a court order is needed to remove a home or other assets from the trust. Removing the home from the trust would affect medicare eligibility if that is expected in the next 5 years, so they probably don't want to do that anyways. And the trust could sell the home without removing it from the trust, but it isn't 100% clear the trust can purchase another home that would still be legally protected against claims by medicare in the next 5 years.
It sounds like the home is in Medicaid qualifying irrevocable trust and you are a beneficiary. Or you may be a part owner if the home was inherited. So you have some claim to the home. Specifically, if the home is in an irrevocable trust and your father is the grantor, they need the beneficiary's permission to remove the home from the trust. But you would need to review the deed, the document you are being asked to sign, and potentially the trust to be sure.
It is very reasonable to request a document to be reviewed by someone before signing it and this makes my fraud hairs stick up.
