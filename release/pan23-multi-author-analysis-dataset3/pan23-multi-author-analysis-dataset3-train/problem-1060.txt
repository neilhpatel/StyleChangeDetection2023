I wanted to emphasize this. A landlord that goes beyond the bare minimum legal requirements, and actually works at things like preventative maintenance is a treasure. Ours does inspections twice a year (more frequently if there's been something like a serious storm, or huge water leak, or something similar) and it's for things like:
And yes, they also look for things like code violations, lease violations, or other tenant-caused issues that could turn into bigger problems later. I got ordered to remove my plants from the edge of my balcony, which I was rather annoyed about... until I experienced my first windstorm in this unit which actually blew one of the heavy pots off a table that I had moved against the wall (where I mistakenly thought it was out of the wind). If it had blown off the wall I had it set on, it could have caused a lot of damage either to my downstairs neighbor's property, or to the building. (I have since put my plants back up on a properly supported shelving unit, which the landlord is A-OK with).
It's legal, and there are many legitimate reasons a landlord might need to enter leased premises. Unlikely that you will find a lease that doesn't contain some type of right for the landlord to enter.
Sure it is, it's their property. They may want to verify that their apartments are not being damaged, or verify whether there are any apparent maintenance needs.
Ask the landlord for a list of items they will look for during their inspection. If it's things like ensuring your underwear is all folded and organized by color in your drawers, then you know the person is a nut job and you should not move in. If they're inspecting for damages, maintenance, and repairs, they may actually be a good landlord!
