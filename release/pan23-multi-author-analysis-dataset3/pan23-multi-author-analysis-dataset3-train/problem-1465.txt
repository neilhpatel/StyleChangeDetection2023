Unfortunately, though, unless you can point to where they sold the space to you with a promise they will heat it to (whatever the contract says), it would be difficult as a matter of law to win a small claim against the venue for a refund because it was very cold.
It's a solarium, on a roof of what is presumably a very tall building. I truly don't know how you imagined they would heat it in the same way one might treat an actual indoor room. You and the wind being on opposite sides of glass does not necessary mean you are indoors.
Retractably glass enclosure would indicate that is is designed to protect against wind and rain. This is holey different from transforming it into an indoor space.
This wasn't a drywalled, enclosed room. It was a a glass room. In the cold. At height. How warm do you think they can make it in the first place, and without fogging up the glass? That room was never going to be more than about 20 over the outdoor temperature.
There was nothing in your contract about guaranteeing a certain temperature in the glass room. And when you had a problem, they went out of their way to accommodate you. They did not breach a contract or commit any tort here.
