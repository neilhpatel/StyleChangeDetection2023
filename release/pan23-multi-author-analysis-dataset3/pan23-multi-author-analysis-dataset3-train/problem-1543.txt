The most disturbing element of the recent political developments in Israel is the fact that a significant majority of their population voted for increasingly right-wing and divisive political forces.
First of all, your statement is wrong - “The fact that a significant majority of their population voted for increasingly right-wing and divisive political forces”.
That’s BS. If you compare the actual votes they’re almost even between left and right - out of this right votes - most of them were to “Ha’likud” which is a center - right party.
Second, the current political situation in Israel is a consequence of several factors that developed over the years, when the main reason is actually the center parties are just not willing to build a coalition with Netanyahu as an ethic principle.
Things are not perfect in Israel - that’s for sure - but there’s no need to paint such a dark picture when it’s not the case.
The truth is, Israelis are used to it too. But their society’s rhetoric is that if you don’t do eye for an eye (in practice much more than that) then you’ve lost.
This isn’t how scared people talk. This is how people talk who want to commit violence and want an excuse.
