Part of it's due to variation in pigmentation. It's difficult to get paints that really really stick to various materials without disintegrating when you're working with: 1) mostly natural (ie, plants, clays, animal parts, and ores); 2) non-standardized production conditions; 3) non-standardized application conditions and 4) utterly REDICULOUS amounts of environmental exposure on the finish.
Gotta chime in here - that rule (the rule of tincture) primarily applies to French heraldry, and you can find many counter-examples in Germanic and other-polity-heraldry (-ies?). Heraldry is fun!
A pleasure ! Heraldry is a fascinating subject, but, as it is quite tied to a certain vision of chivalry and nobility, most sources are in french, which can make it difficult to learn about it. I only brushed the subject too, but if you want to learn the basics of it, made by the Heraldry Society is pretty comprehensive and well-made.
If you're not familiar with the concept of "blasonner", which translates as "emblazon", it's the science of coat of arms and their description. It was historically exclusively done in french (nowadays, you can emblazon in any language, although many terms are directly imported from french) it was born in medieval Europe out of the need for identifying knights and nobles and, if done correctly, will always produce the same coat of arms you "described".
EDIT : thanks to a very good remark, I must edit this answer and apologize : I was under the false impression that french was the international language of medieval emblazonment, but it seems not to have been ; France was historically a land of chivalry in which heraldry was important, but I was wrong in saying it was exclusively said in french, as I was just able to find sources of late medieval german emblazonment.
