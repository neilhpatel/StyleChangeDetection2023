The whole thing was Russian disinformation and Rudy was involved in dealing with Russian intelligence inside Ukraine. This all culminates with Trumps phone call with Zelensky. All within the same time period. Which is why Trump tells Zelenskyy to get in contact with Rudy. The laptop was supposed to be evidence in this hatched scheme to link Hunter and by extension Joe Biden to fabricated financial crimes involving Ukraine .
CBSNews: Copy of what's believed to be Hunter Biden's laptop data turned over by repair shop to FBI showed no tampering, analysis says.
The same NYPost, that when pressed to provide sources for their Hunter Biden bullshit laptop claims, sourced another article from themselves as proof that "sources are saying..."?
The same NYPost that refused to attribute an author or editor to the "bombshell" laptop story, very potentially due to the grave legal risk one would face by having their name attached to such bullshit?
The same NYPost, that continues to falsely claim "The NY Times admitted the laptop is real", after the NY Times reported that certain emails on the laptop appeared to be legitimate, and not the laptop as a whole?
The lie was in claiming that, because the emails were genuine, that all of the contents on the laptop must also be genuine. Including the "salacious pictures package" that was added to the laptop remotely, while Rudy Giuliani possessed it.
The laptop was also accessed remotely, while in Rudy's possession, to add a "Salacious Pictures Package" folder with images.
It is also an incorrect assumption to assume all contents on the "hard drive" are genuine (as it has been confirmed that some files were added remotely, while the laptop was in Rudy's possession).
To be fair, “Computer Security Expert” Rudy probably calls USB thumb drives “hard drives” (Hey, you can’t bend them, they’re too hard!) so the terminology may be off….
