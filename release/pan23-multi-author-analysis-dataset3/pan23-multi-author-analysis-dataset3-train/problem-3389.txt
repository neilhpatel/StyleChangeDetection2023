You can either post the posted signs or send them a notice of trespass in writing. Either will constitute a notice of trespass.
I suspect that maybe a utility easement exist for sewage or other utility pipeline could exist. And this neighbor is mistaking this utility easement for a general purpose easement at their discretion. If that's the case the easement doesn't even apply to your neighbor. Only the utility company responsible for those utilities. In which case the neighbor can still be trespassed off that land.
If there is no recorded easement, then as far as your uncle is concerned, the neighbours have no right to enter the land and he can treat them as trespassers until they prove otherwise.
The size of an easement is a matter of negotiation and need, and there is no standard size. An easement for access is often as wide as the people involved believed was reasonable at the time.
Second, an easement does not grant universal access to something. Typically, they are crafted as small as is reasonable for the purposes. For example, if you share a common driveway, the easement would grant them access to regularly trespass over your land using the driveway. If you share a common utility hook up like a water main or sewage, it would grant them use and right to invade to repair it, but it wouldn't give them the right to regularly drive their car over the same property. So just because there is an easement, doesn't tell you what it gives them the right to do.
What are they claiming the easement is for? Even assuming there is an easement, it doesn't entitle them to possession of the land, just whatever activity was contemplated, usually access, underground utility passage, etc.
