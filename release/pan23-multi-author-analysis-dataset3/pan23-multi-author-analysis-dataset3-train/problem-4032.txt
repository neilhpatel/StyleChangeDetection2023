You mentioned Hillary Clinton and her emails. This isnt the first time she has had issues with classified documents, do you remember Sandy Berger? Who got caught stuffing classified documents down his pants on behalf of the Clintons? Remember that? No? Because the media buried it when it happened. Remember Vince Foster? When he "committed suicide", his office was immediately locked down, and before the FBI and Secret Service was on scene to process it, Hillary was allowed access and was seen removing classified documents. It was never questioned, and although being highly illegal as she was only the 1sr lady at the time, took classified documents.
Where did the story go? Why is.it that the only people who are holding on to this story are Twitter and reddit users? Because everyone else knows its nothing.
The reason is that the president can declassify documents at any time, and there is no formal process involved..
A lot of the argument in favor of Trump with this stuff is that the President can declassify stuff. But even ignoring how much of an oversimplification that is, these are not his and he does not own them. This stuff is just sitting around mixed into his crap and he doesn’t want to give any of it back. Even that basic fact is being ignored, it’s pathetic.
