Even if you have done all those things, still sometimes defendants lose. You should have proper insurance for your business.
Sure you could get sued, which is why you buy insurance. You need a contract/permission for where you want to put the vending machine of course and they will likely require you to have insurance anyway to protect them as well.
The particular insurance you need, and the maintenance and installation steps you need to take to make the machine safe and show due diligence are likely more industry specific than something a general legal advice subreddit can tell you.
Anyone can sue for almost anything, but if you follow industry standard practice in good faith, an accident becomes much less likely, a lawsuit is less likely to be successful and if damages happen they are more likely to be covered by insurance. Nothing eliminates risk totally when you have a business, but the right steps can reduce risk quite a lot.
I suggest talking with the suppliers for starters, looking up your local regulations and checking out forums where people discuss this business (It's been my experience there's a forum for everything).
