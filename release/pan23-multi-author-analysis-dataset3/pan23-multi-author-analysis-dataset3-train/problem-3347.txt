I don't think Musk was looking for more than to stir shit and do a rich guy flex when he first offered to buy Twitter. His big error was to make a court-enforceable formal offer, and when the Twitter Board accepted it (as they should have for the stockholders) he was stuck massively overpaying for the company.
It's not like he decided to buy twitter, he made a bid jokingly but the twitter board members are normal people with proper knowledge so they had to sue into forcing him to buy it.
He also had to get a saudi price to back him up, he had to leverage tesla stocks and twitter itself to get enough loans in order to buy it as a leverage buyout, so it's not like he had too much money.
I also like twitter and understood that it has massive value for people but it will be worth it if elon goes bankrupt.
The hilarity of all of this is that Twitter was haemorraghing money before Elon took it over, and they've now lost 50%+ of their advertising because he's an inept, right wing clod. He might as well have piled up $44billion and torched it for views; amusingly he would probably end up with more money if he did.
