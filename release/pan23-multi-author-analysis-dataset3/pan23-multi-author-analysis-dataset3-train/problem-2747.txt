Mortgage (doesn't) really matter, whose names are on the deed? Did your grandmother have a will, or not, and either way, who were her heirs, who has gone to court to start administering her estate, where is this located?
Then is what happens but they need to go to court to get the house and the mortgage name, that is, presuming that one of your parents is your grandmother's child and she didn't have any other children.
If my mother gets a lawyer, then attempts to sell the the estate (she owned a couple plots of land as well) then takes the money and pays off the mortgage is that legal?
If the house doesn’t have to be sold to pay debts, the representative can sell it and distribute the proceeds to her children who did not disclaim their inheritance. The heirs generally would all have to agree to this.
She cannot sell the house right now, because she doesn’t own it. It is the property of something called Estate of Grandma’s Name. Someone needs to be appointed by the local probate court to be in charge of the estate. That person would have the right to sell the house as the representative of the estate. If it has to be sold to pay debts, the representative can do that.
