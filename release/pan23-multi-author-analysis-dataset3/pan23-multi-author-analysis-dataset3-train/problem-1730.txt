The writing is on the wall that Manchin is going to leave the Democratic Party at any rate and run as a Republican in 2024. If the Democrats cave on this issue, it buys them nothing.
Democrats aren't caving on anything, this is their own plan. They're trying to reform the permitting process to make it easier to build new energy installations in the US, since the overwhelming majority of them are renewable.
You should be. If Republicans and Common Dreams are both against something you can bet it's actually good.
The amendment reforms the permitting process that is currently of green energy production in the US. It doesn't remove any environmental regulations, just requires the permitting process to be done within a reasonable time.
Common Dreams just conveniently failed to mention that it's mostly Republicans voting against this plan.
No one should be celebrating this, and the handful of Democrats who voted with Republicans should be rebuked.
And the vote previously failed 47-47 in the senate, with 7 Republicans, 38 democrats, and 2 independents voting "yes".
