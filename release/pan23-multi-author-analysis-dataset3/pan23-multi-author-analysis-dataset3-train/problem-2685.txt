I have always felt a sense of dread when considering trench warfare, but compared to an open plain it would indeed be a vast improvement!
First of all, I’m not one to think trenches were bad for the soldier (well they were bad, just the least worse option as you describe).
In other words, the generals knew that sending people with bayonet charges true no mans land and into trenches was a bad option, they just didn’t have the technology to effectuate any better offensive tactic?
If that’s indeed the case, shouldn’t the generals have seen that the costs of waging an offensive war wasn’t worth it, and have focussed solely on defending and killing as many troops as possible when the other party attacked as the more valuable strategy rather than going on the offensive themselves? Bringing it back to tactics not having adapted adequately to the reality, or is this a case where politics wouldn’t allow for only defensive manoeuvres without taking the imitative, until something like tanks were prototyped that could break the status quo of favouring defenders to a unbelievable degree?
Not to mention, by completely surrendering initiative to the enemy, they'd just invite the enemy to calmly and methodically invent the very methods of attack you mention, including better tactics, innovative weapons (be it tanks, underground mines, bombers, gas and effective methods of its delivery, bio warfare), or any number of other tricks both known by us or invented in the calm of the unheard-of stalemate.
So to sum up the developments from before the war, armies recognized the killing power of new weapons and responded in two ways: by emphasizing the importance of defensive entrenchments and by adopting offensive tactics designed to quickly destroy an enemy before he had the time to entrench himself and fortify his position. Armies did not go to war in 1914 clueless as to how destructive these new weapons would be (they were very much aware of this fact), and they did not go to war with Napoleonic tactics that did not take into consideration the power of modern armaments. Actually, quite the opposite is true.
