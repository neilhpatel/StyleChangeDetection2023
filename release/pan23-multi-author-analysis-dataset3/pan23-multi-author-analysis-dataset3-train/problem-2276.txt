P.S. I am from Turkey where I can openly declare my atheism and women can freely walk around without veils, where all legally recognized marriages are still only civil marriages, where it is still illegal for religion to be a basis for discrimination, where abortion is not illegal, where sharia has no effect at all, let alone over the civil code. Consider that Erdoğan had 20 YEARS to change this, but didn’t or couldn’t. Consider for a moment there is more to the story than what you’re privy to.
Ignoring for a moment this was purposefully done in front of the Turkish mission, probably not - but I'd personally argue ensuring religious freedom is a core obligation of any modern state, and permitting or acquiescing to a blatant attack against any religion in the public arena does not track with that. There are more nuanced and moderate ways to level criticism. Not to mention, Erdoğan's stance in this instance has nothing to do with Islam, so I'm unclear what you would be criticizing here by burning a Quran.
What people seem to don't understand is that crass and provocative actions such as burning a copy of Quran or hanging a doll of Erdogan allow Erdogan to unite his voter base in Turkey.
It is almost like not all Turks support Erdogan, but you get called names supported by bullshit arguments in every discussion about politics of turkey anyway.
But the fact is, it is even more idiotic to hold Turkish people accountable for a dictators populist actions to consolidate his voters.
I think it is important to make a distinction between the belief of the Turkish people and the aspirations and political schemes of a politician here. Erdogan != Turkey.
