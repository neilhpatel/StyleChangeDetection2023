I think "shamed" is a bit of a loaded term, and a bit unclear. If you're asking about the differing legacies of the two systems, then I can shed a little light.
1. If you're interested in a case study/microhistory of Brazilian slavery, I can't recommend "Dutra's World" by Zephyr Frank highly enough. It's an account of a Brazilian slave turned slave owner, and his complex place in Brazilian society in the first half of the 19th century.
I'll quote a couple of paragraphs from a paper I wrote in grad school, comparing and contrasting American and Brazilian slavery systems:
In a single word, the difference between the United States and Brazil (in terms of race and slavery) is fluidity.
First, while similar, the instutions of united states slavery and brazilian slavery have some very significant differences which will play a major part in OP's question:
Did you research the differences in the economic underpinnings of slavery in both countries? Iâ€™m interested in how the industrial revolution and the rapid growth of the textile industry in the UK affected American slavery. It would seem that close economic and trading ties between the US and the UK would alter the nature of slavery, particularly in the 19th century.
