There are no details, really. I was very surprised to see her fall for such an obvious and frankly clumsy scam like this. I always considered her to be smart.
Well, I think it happened slowly enough for me not to notice. She has always needed some help. Just not as much as today. I didn't see any decline in other areas (until this happened.) How would I communicate this to her doctor? If I just write to the doctor would she take action on my wife's behalf in regard to my concern?
There is no history of past mental issues. All I can point to is a little bit of mental decline. Her former career involved lots of work performed on computers. Today she is almost helpless on her computer - I need to provide help with almost everything, including keeping track of her passwords.
I have worked in resetting passwords for individuals who have forgotten their info. She should be able to still access her funds even though you've made the log on process inconvenient. I have also been a loan officer and am a financial advisor. It does not sound like your actions have sufficiently blocked her ability to harm you or herself.
