Over time, this sort of becomes reality for me. You know you are in deep when you are plotting in victims of rape, murder and mutilation into a spreadsheet, as it were your taxes.
Sometime, being deeply focused on historical events that are dark and involve a lot of dead and suffering, it can happen that I become 'immune' to it, as it just becomes figures and numbers.
As for how we deal with the horrors of yesterday, I find it helpful to always keep in mind that there is a bright spot for every tragedy and dark event which has occurred in the 20th century. As such, whenever I do my research and writing on AH, I always make it a goal to be as "neutral" as possible in my tone. u/OppositeRecording551 has already touched on this in their comment, but the general mantra of "connected, but not invested" in the past is a good thing to stand by. What I mean by this is that when you're viewing 'heavy' events, persons, and concepts; it's dangerous to get so emotionally attached (or detached, for that matter) that it blinds your own view of that historical topic.
Firstly, please do not feel like this is by any means the "wrong" attitude towards approaching the study of history. As I and countless other AH travelers and students of history can testify, that sense of hopelessness is almost always lurking in the corners of historical narratives.
Minor quibble, but it's not just European history, pretty much all of human history has some incredibly dark moments regardless of where in the world it is.
