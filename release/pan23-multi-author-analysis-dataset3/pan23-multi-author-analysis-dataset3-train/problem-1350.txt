TL;DR wrote a novel for this response but the gist of it is that it's unlikely the propellers were used for anything other than minor course corrections, and the solar panels were likely to be used exclusively for electronics and battery charging.
Sure, but it's doubtful that they had enough power to push a spherical object three bus sizes in size that's jam packed with sensors and other equipment.
The balloon had a gigantic payload, a large array of sensors and who knows what else. It loitered over sensitive areas, and then maneuvered and B-lined to other sensitive areas. It flew and loitered directly over the largest American ICBM base, after having flown by the US missile defense installations in Alaska, and then it went on to fly over other important military bases on the east coast before heading over water.
This was nothing short of one of the most aggressive, dangerous escalations of tensions between the US and China in the history of our relationship, and the damage done to national security might be incalculable.
This incident is undeniably the most aggressive and dangerous of tensions between the US and China, far more than their 2015 OPM hack and their 2022 rhetoric and subsequent military deployment up and around Taiwan.
I absolutely agree, this drifting, brightly painted balloon is the most aggressive and dangerous escalations of tensions between the US and China in the history of our relationship. None of China's satellite, drone, radio, automotive, telemetry, spyware, and HUMINT intelligence gathering capabilities even come close to their balloon intelligence capabilities.
