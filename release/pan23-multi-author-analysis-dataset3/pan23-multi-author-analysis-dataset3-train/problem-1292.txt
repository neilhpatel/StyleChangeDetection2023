Given the low nature of the craft and its reputation for salacious, lewd and at times subversive writings, the average play-write had to balance between writing about power and running the risk of upsetting those IN power, or avoiding writing about anyone with power at all. Censorship was very real and arrest for causing dissent was equally real.
Considering the way theatre was seen in the Elizabethan and Stuart era (to whit: very poorly; with the playhouses (especially after 1595) being located in the heart of the red light distract (in the case of The Rose, The Swan, and The Globe theatres) or in a part of London famed for being seen as run by criminals (Blackfriars- it gained its reputation after Henry VIII dissolved the Dominican friary who owned the region, selling the land to various landlords, but never updating the by-laws in the region; as such Blackfriars was under Church Law but with no church to enforce it; thus it became widely accepted that all warrants for any criminal could not be extended into Blackfriars; hence its reputation of criminality and its nickname to Londoners at the time, Alsace, after the contested region of France).
Shakespeare liked to avoid setting his plays in London, but rather placed them in foreign lands, allowing him to comment upon society from a safer position.
It doesn't seem to be a big stretch to say Shakespeare was thinking in Italian terms, even if he hadn't actually confused Vienna with Venice.
As with All's Well, Shakespeare is in general pretty faithful to the settings of his sources even when they are not Italy or England. (Hamlet perhaps being the most famous example.).
