Well on average its estimated modern Sicilians have only around 6% Arab-Berber admixture, so either most of the original Muslim colonists really did flee or there were just never a huge amount of them to begin with. Sicilians actually have a lot more Greek genetic influence at an estimated 37% admixture, but I'm not certain if the bulk of that came from the colonies of the Classical and Hellenistic periods, or from the Byzantines.
Being that modern sicilians have a high genetic influence of North African and Middle Eastern genetics - including yours truly - wouldn’t it be common sense to discern that our ancestors likely converted?
1. I’m reading John Julius Norwich’s history of the Kingdom of Sicily, which is utterly fantastic btw. He says that the island was predominantly Islamic during Norman rule, however only 60k people were deported to Lucera. I guess what I’m asking is are modern Sicilians the direct descendants of the Muslims of Sicily? I myself am part Sicilian and have a ton of West Asian and Middle Eastern ancestry, I was wondering if I have Arabic or Berber ancestry myself.
We have very, very few sources for the Islamic era of Sicily, and most of them are Christian or Jewish, and originate outside Sicily. That state has to do with the multiple cultural near-annihilations. Muslims nearly obliterate Byzantine culture, except for a few Greek communities in the northeast. Latin Christians allow Muslim communities to continue as Muslim for quite awhile, but eventually deport the entire Muslim population to mainland Italy. However, there are a few less direct elements--surviving Greek churches that were turned into mosques. And more impressively, Muslims turned Palermo from a middling city into one of the most important trade and cultural centers of the Mediterranean.
