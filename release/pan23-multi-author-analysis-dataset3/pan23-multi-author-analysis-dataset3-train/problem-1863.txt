In Scotland, grandparents can apply for a court order to force visitation if the parents have cut contact and the court deems a relationship with a grandparent to be in the childâ€™s best interest.
Courts don't generally like to overrule a decision of both parents, but in Scotland (and some US states), grandparents have the right to visit their grandchildren, so you can't cut her off completely. Since you're not doing that, she has very little chance of getting any more than you're already allowing.
No, she can't overrule your decision. A court could, but she'd have to file suit and ask the court for visitation rights.
Start keeping records of her visits. After she leaves, write down the date and time, what she did with the child, and things like that. Keep those records in case she claims you're not allowing her to visit. Pictures will also help. You can take pictures of her with the child and post them to Facebook or whatever, and that will help prove your case.
Make sure your house is always safe, somewhat clean, and you have good, nutritious food for the kids. That's what the authorities will look for if "somebody" makes a report, so you should be ready for them.
