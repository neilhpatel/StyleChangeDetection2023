Find out if the landlord had sewer backup insurance or anything else that applies to the clean-up.
My renters insurance covers up to 2500 for sewage backup. They don’t offer higher coverage (it’s happened before, so I’d up the coverage if I could). Not sure if they cover cleaning services, calling now to see.
Do you have any insight as to how insurance assessed used furniture etc? Lots of my things I’ve bought on Craigslist, etc — so no receipts and I’m not sure exactly what I paid.
That’s the simple version. I previously lived in one of the rooms, first as a sublessee, later taking the lease over. When I took the lease over, a couple was already living down there.
Yes, but what is the lease situation? Did you and your roommates sign a lease for the house + basement and you have illegally moved into the basement and your landlord is just letting it slide?
You took over the lease yet you chose to live in the basement yourself while letting others have the bedrooms? Still, sounds like you might be shit out of luck when it comes to your landlord having to make the basement livable since he's not renting the basement as a livable space, you're just choosing to live there.
