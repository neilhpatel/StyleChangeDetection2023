Is this a serious question? The war on fossil fuels has given us 70's style inflation. It began the first day of the Biden administration and his executive orders crushing American oil and gas production. Don't tell me it's Putin's fault.
Typical liberal answer. The stock market makes investment decisions based on government policies. All of Biden's policies are viewed as bad for the economy as opposed to their views on Trump's policies that boosted the markets worldwide. The Democrat agenda is a cancer that is destroying America. Your views reek of leftist dystopian theory.
We had energy independence then. The strategic reserves were full under Trump. Biden sold the reserves to artificially reduce the American price of gas at the pump.
Also your premise that Biden has somehow kneecapped American fossil fuels is proven false by the oil production numbers.
When demand for something exceeds the rate of production, it leads to higher prices. Putin attacking Ukraine didn't help, but prices would have gone up in any case.
Your basic understanding of economics is suspect. It is very possible for an economy to be booming while the stock market is tanking as the stock market is forward looking.
