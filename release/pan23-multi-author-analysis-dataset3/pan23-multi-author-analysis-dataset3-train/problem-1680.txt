The US already threw the first punch with the Korean War. They were also the first ones to bring nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula, and they have been openly calling for the destruction of North Korea for years while ignoring any attempt for peace.
Given that context I don't think it was that North Korea was trying to force anything on the south, but that they were trying to drive an occupying force out of their country, like they had done with the Japanese.
I'm not talking about living in North Korea today, I'm talking about the Korean War and the history of US aggression and the influences that has.
You said it yourself when you said China didn't let North Korea get conquered. The US wanted to conquer all of Korea, and the "first punch" was when the US arbitrarily divided the country, and conquered the south.
The North wanted to conquer all of South Korea, it invaded to do as much. The UN was defending a sovereign nation from being invaded. Go live in North Korea and see if you enjoy your time there, instead of South Korea, such a horrible fate that befell upon them by the big bad US. /s If you couldn’t tell. The line was also agreed upon by both the US and the USSR. Unless of course you’re implying the USSR had to bend to the will of the United States and accept such a divide. I’m sure based on what you’ve been saying that’s what you meant. The line was meant to be a temporary measure, but the Cold War prolonged that and know here we are 77 years later. After this response if you reply back with willfully incorrect history or outright lies I will ignore it.
