One interesting thing I heard someone say. If there was even a chance Trump was innocent, good lawyers would be climbing over each other to work with him and make a name for themselves.
It’s amazing the number of lawyers that are willing to work for Trump. They should know by now that as a lawyer working for Trump, you may be indicted. Michael Cohen is the most famous example. Rudy Giuliani was facing disbarment hearings and may also be indicted.
I mean, if I were a lawyer that is consider working for Trump, I would charge 1000x the going rate, and I would want the money up front in advance, given that Trump doesn’t pay afterwards. Because I know that if I work for Trump as a lawyer, he will ask me to commit crimes to cover up for him (or pin the blame on me and throw me under the bus), and that I may be indicted down the road. If indicted, I would lose my license and I could not practice law ever again, not to mention I would have a criminal record and I would have a hard time finding work after leaving jail.
Yet Trump finds so many lawyers to be his fall guy, even after he has left the presidency. It’s fucking amazing.
