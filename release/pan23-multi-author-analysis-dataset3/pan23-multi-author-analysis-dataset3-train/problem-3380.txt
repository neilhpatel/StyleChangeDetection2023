The Second Punic War is perhaps one of the single most dangerous wars the Roman Empire faced throughout its existence. They came incredibly close to losing as Hannibal and his army had decisive victories over large Roman forces and he came within marching distance of Rome itself. The ability of the Romans to field more and more soldiers to counter the terrible losses they had suffered was beyond what Hannibal expected and allowed them to eventually survive the war, along with a very un-Roman passive approach to fights in the later stages of the war. All in all however, their might, which had been uncontested in many ways until that point, was tested to the very limits and they came within inches of crumbling completely.
That being said, sure Carthage would have had some chance to survive under more direct Roman rule, but it's hard to say to what extent because there are so many factors involved. Instead of smoothing things over a direct installation of Roman power might have ignited tensions even faster. In the end however I don't think it would have mattered much. Carthage would always be seen as a dangerous threat to Roman dominance.
After the first Punic War, Rome already recognized Carthage as a major threat. Rome's normal policy was to deploy four legions at a given time, but in recognition of the severity of the threat, the Romans doubled this to eight at the start of the Second Punic War, and then deployed all eight legions plus allies to the battlefield at Cannae.
