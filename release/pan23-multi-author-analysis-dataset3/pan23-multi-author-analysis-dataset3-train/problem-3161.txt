Bolsonaro also mentioned reductions in deforestation rates and talked about combating illegal activities in conferences like these. It's easy to talk, we'll have to see the actual results.
Not really, the fact his attitude is no different than bolsonaro's is not bullshit. It just serves to show attitude is not enough. I didn't even say or imply that there's no evidence. But any minuscule thing that could be interpreted as not-pro leftist south american president is hated on reddit, it seems.
I just said reddit hates anything non-leftist, is that victimization now? lol. I don't even like bolsonaro. Reddit and its "if it's not X, it must be pro Y" mentality again...
But I'm talking about the future, not the past. It's so weird getting downvoted just for pointing out that a politician's words are not nearly as important as the future results lol. Besides, we were talking about attitude, I was showing how "attitude" is not enough because it's no different from bolsonaro's.
yes, some aspects of their attitude are very different. It's just that their words regarding deforestation (just their words) are not that different. So its the actions that make the difference.
Attitude is one thing, real deeds are another. During Lula's government Brazil deforested much more than during Bolsonaro's government.
Take your time to look into how deforestation was handled during Lula's time in presidency and compare it to Bolsonaro's. It is, indeed easy to talk, but their actions differed greatly.
