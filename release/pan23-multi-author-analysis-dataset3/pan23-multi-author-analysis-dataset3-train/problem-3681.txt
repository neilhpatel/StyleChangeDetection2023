On the plus side, when you parse through the election data. GA re-elected Brian Kemp as governor and a full slate of GOP statewide posts (AG, SOS, etc) by about 6-10 pts. It seems like many GOP voters abstained or voted for Warnock (200K difference between Kemp total votes and Walker total votes). My hope is that some GOP voters held their nose and voted for Walker but not enough to win and those same voters will not be motivated to vote in the run-off whereas Warnock supporters will be highly motivated.
A lot of people I know Voted for Kemp (cause this is still rural Georgia), but they didnâ€™t vote for Walker and voted for Warnock instead. Wether they turn out and vote at all remains to be seen. : /.
Yeah. Context is "the race is competitive, so if you field a good candidate and fund him/her, you should be able to win it.".
Good point. I would also emphasize that Democrat politicians need to keep voters motivated. I'd like to see some leadership by example. Brag about their own wins. As soon as any of their legislation bears fruit they need to bake some pies and fucking tell everyone about it nonstop.
Even if times are tough people need real world, tangible gains, and they need to know Democrats are the ones doing that. Republicans are the ones blocking it.
