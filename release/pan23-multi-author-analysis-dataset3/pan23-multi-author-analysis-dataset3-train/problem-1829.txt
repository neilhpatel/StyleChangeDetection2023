probably the influence in tagalog stems back to Aguinaldo's establishment of a central government, which is located in Cavite a Tagalog speaking province.
One possible period for contact between Tagalog and Tausug was in the era immediately before Spanish rule. There were contacts then between the Manila Bay area and Brunei and there were certainly Muslims among the Tagalogs including some chieftains.
Malay was certainly known in parts of the Philippines that participated in maritime trade, but it was never widely spoken natively. Different languages were dominant in various parts of the Philippines: Ilokano in northern Luzon, Tagalog in Maynila Bay, Cebuano/Binisaya in Central Philippines, Tausug in the Sultanate of Sulu. These languages have retained their prominence to this day, and are still used as local lingua francas, although the influence of Filipino has increased greatly over the years.
On the other hand, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian (PMP) was spoken by Austronesian peoples who migrated from Taiwan to Northern Luzon around 4000-4500 years ago. That stage is likely the lowest common ancestor of all Philippine languages: there have been attempts to put all Philippine languages in a subgroup, but they are very controversial and most definitely not the majority view. At around that time, PMP speakers invented the awesomeness that was the outrigger (essentially a log tied to a boat that keeps it from overturning at sea), and used their supreme naval skills to colonize most of insular SE Asia in short order.
I'll give you an answer from a historical linguistic perspective, which hopefully is okay, considering your question is about language.
