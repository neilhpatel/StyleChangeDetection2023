The list goes on and I could do this all day sadly. I can see things from their perspective but don’t know how to have a conversation with them because we live in two different realities and they can’t see things from mine.
I haven’t heard it described in the terms « Republican orthodoxy » before but I really like that term and I think it sums it up so well. Business suit, check. Lip service to Christian values, check. Regressive social and fiscal polices, check. Even a hat and slogan for the NASCAR type fans to wear around, check. No wonder it’s popular.
They think that socialist policies are what causes poverty, inflation, gas prices to sky rocket. After all Joe Biden is a socialist and look at the economy compared to under Trump! They vote Republican.
Because Republican voters have decided that they’re okay with extremism if it gets their party in power.
The only time the left gets elected is when even the right wing propaganda machines cannot whitewash the ugly reality.
The left doesn’t have a propaganda machine that can in any way compete with corporate right and far right propaganda platforms.
The ideology of the Right needs to be made fringe and that doesn't happen by insisting Trumpism is different from conservatism or that the chasm between conservatism and fascism is that wide, etc. The first thing you have to do is understand that in this pathetic and dangerous need for a cookie or a round of applause in "reaching across the aisle to get things done" with the Right, you have normalized and humanized an ideology that should be rigorously fought against in word and action.
