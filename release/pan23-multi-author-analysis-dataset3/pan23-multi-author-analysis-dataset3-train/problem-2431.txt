Without knowing exact proceedings that happened, we can't opine as to what records are public that you can access and be entitled to obtain a copy.
Without any information, such as where the case was filed, it's going to be very hard to find any information. Your full name would not have appeared in any records.
If you have a case number and the court, you can inquire. Depending on how long ago it was, they may not have any meaningful records.
Almost 20 years on, however, the case is long since final, and the kind of meaningful records that you're looking for, such as a trial transcript, may not exist, or may not be easy to access (it would cost money to retrieve them). Based on the city, you can figure out the county, go down to the courthouse with the defendant's name and the year, and see if they can find anything.
i have the name of the defendant and i know the city in which it was filed - i guess my question was just more if victims of crimes like these had any rights to court records like this.
