This is a critical part of your story. Make sure you have retain any information about calling for a cab as well as anything you might have got from what company she was a contractor/employee of.
As others have said, you are well into real lawyer zone now. If you are charged having a detailed record of what you know will help you. If it comes to it your lawyer might be able to prove that she wasn't out at a party and she was working the night you were with her.
Asking for a lawyer doesn't "make you look guilty" The police won't waste their time on you if they didn't think you were guilty. You won't ever talk your way out of an arrest. Either you give them something to help the case against you, or they assume you're lying, and will poke holes in your story. And they will speak to all your friends, family, and whomever, who can misconstrue, get it wrong, and who knows what else.
While it is fresh on your mind, make a very detailed mental note of what you've said so far, so you can discuss with your lawyer. If you receive a request to "talk" or "come down to the station" read 1 again.
Seriously. Your rights are not self enforcing. Police are never speaking with you in order to exclude you or rule you out. Their job is to make a case and fill any holes in the case. Period.
1. Shut up, say nothing, politely decline, and lawyer up. Don't say anything to anyone, anywhere, at any time unless your lawyer is there.
