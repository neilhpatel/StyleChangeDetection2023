I"m assuming he completely ghosted you as well? As in changed his phone number and email address? Do you know his Calif. address or the name of anyone he associated with where he's from?
Abandonment is a perfectly valid reason for divorce, both legally and morally. As someone else as mentioned, in your state he must have been gone for a year in order for it to be a basis for fault divorce in Texas.
TX allows for two kinds of divorce: fault and no-fault. For a fault divorce, you'd have to establish that your spouse engaged in some activity or pattern of behavior that gives you grounds to end the marriage (ie cruelty, abandonment, felony conviction). In the case of abandonment, you would have to wait until he's gone a year before filing.
The one hang up in your case is that you don't know where your husband is. Before you can obtain a divorce by default, you'll need to make a good faith effort to locate him. This may include contacting family members, checking prison records, reaching out through social media and hiring a PI.
For a no-fault divorce, you can simply cite "insupportability" (aka irreconciliable irreconcilable differences) and move on your merry way. Uncontested, no-fault divorces with no shared children or assets are relatively straightforward. Fault-divorces tend to be expensive, drawn out and contentious.
If he were to take loans or credit cards out while you're still technically married, it could complicate the divorce.
