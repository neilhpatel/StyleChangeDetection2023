P.S. You just answered your own question. It’s legal with 7 days notice, that’s the amount of warning you agreed to.
Don’t threaten anything. Negotiate a new contract or leave. One thing I would negotiate for is a longer notice period in the termination clause or a fixed term contract. Have an attorney review new contract so you understand it before signing. If this truly is higher pay than you can get elsewhere you may still come out ahead making some concessions.
Would you, when speaking to them, straight-up say: Hey, look, the salary is an incentive for me to stay? Or is threatening to leave always too aggressive and unwise?
Trust me...I'm trying! In interview stages right now (damn, do they like taking their time getting back to you).
Problem is $$$. I was earning damn good money with this company and chances are, a full-time role in my industry would pay way less elsewhere.
They acknowledge being in $$$ difficulty, but purely because they got screwed over in June. I have evidence of that. They aren't lying on that front.
