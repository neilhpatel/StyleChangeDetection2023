Almost all the laws are designed to protect workers from getting shorted from hours they did work. There probably wouldn't be much support for laws that prevent an employer from overpaying people.
If they weren't happy with it someone would have been fired by now. Don't disturb the ecosystem here. It works, everyone gets paid, and everyone at the top is happier not knowing. Everyone gets their piece.
You shouldn't say anything. Your ultimate boss [the owner(s)/shareholders] are either happy with what they're getting for the money they're paying for the work... or they're not.
Yeah, I think your manager is trying to do a good thing- I'll bet that you & your co workers do deserve that extra pay.
The only potential issue I see is that the boss is doing it "because they are “doing a good job”". That makes it seem like its intended as a bonus. Bonus pay is taxed differently, and usually at a higher rate. The Boss may be adding it in as hours worked instead of bonus pay to avoid paying the additional taxes.
