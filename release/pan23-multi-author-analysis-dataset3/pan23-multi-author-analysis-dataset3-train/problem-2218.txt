We used to be purple (went for Obama in 08 and 12) so it kinda made sense for getting a read on middle America, but after Trump we're solid red. Might as well be Alabama.
As someone who lives in Iowa, hates political junk calls/texts and thinks caucases are joke, I wouldn't say enjoyed is really the right word.
I really don’t get where people are coming from when they say that Iowa democrats are more conservative than ones in South Carolina, when in reality the opposite is true.
What's funny is Democrats actually gerrymandered the Iowa caucus so minorites and young people counted less. It's how Pete won but with fewer votes. They complain Iowa isn't diverse enough while actively surprising the voted of Midwest minorities.
As such, if the DNC had the chance to address the inequality of Iowa being a caucus of mainly White voters, why didn’t they choose a state which closely aligned with the demographics of the country?
Just in case they forgot, Hispanics make up 19% of the country. That is a large untapped population that is being ignored.
