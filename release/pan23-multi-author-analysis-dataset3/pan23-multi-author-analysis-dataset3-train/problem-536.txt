I was told that I would likely be getting an uncharacterized separation but have a copy of my DD 214 and it says other than honorable not uncharacterized.
Thank you for the in-depth response, if need be I will be open about what happened if asked. However I don’t feel that I should have to explain myself for a fraudulent enlistment that I did not commit, I understand that getting this corrected is a long and difficult process that may not even work out in my favor but I know that the information on my record is wrong and if there’s any chance I can get this information corrected I want to at least try.
But the thing is I’ve always wanted to pursue a career in law and politics and I feel like if this is discovered that it could significantly impact my chances and it’s for something I never even did.
Expunging something like this isn't necessarily an easy process, either - and I think embracing it in a career of law/politics may even be viewed more favorably by those you're hoping to get support from. Though, since this is the route you want to pursue, the best I can offer is that when I researched this it looked like something I'd have to escalate up to something like the 'Board for Correction of Naval Records' (BCNR). You could either find a Civilian lawyer who specializes in this sort of thing, or represent yourself.
You may want to have a civilian attorney with military law experience as you are separated. You will get an advocate, but that's like relying on a public defender.
