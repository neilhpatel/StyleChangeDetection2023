The first year the US and British planes used carburetors, and going into a dive to avoid being shot would cause the float valve to shit the bed.
I think a big part of Ukraines success is that their generals all believed Russia was going to attack someday, and they have been preparing for it.
The fact that Russia did not win this war months ago should give you some slight idea of the gulf between the USA and Russia militarily.
True and unfortunately the longer it goes on the more it favors Russia. Russia has a history of coming back from the brink. Right now they are comfortably raining hell on Ukraine and not really facing any threats themselves. They have the time and ability to regroup. In a war of attrition its unclear what the outcome will be. They will probably adapt and improve as time goes on. I dont think they give a damn how many bodies they feed to the grist mill unless they run out of bodies. They are far from it. This situation with Russia has really been an ongoing problem that has not been addressed. Ossentia, Crimea, Syria. They have shown an interest in conquest and I think ultimately they will push into Europe more if they can. If they are not stopped. The west is already committed so it time to really step it up. Or face a future of more of this. If they take Ukraine, its only a stepping stone.
Whereas Ukraine is getting more and more top notch stuff from the west. It's a tough battle but the odds of Russia just overrunning Ukraine seem pretty low at this point.
