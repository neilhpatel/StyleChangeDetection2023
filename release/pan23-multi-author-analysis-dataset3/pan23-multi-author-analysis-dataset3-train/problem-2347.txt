thats the weird part is how come its this hard to find a lawyer for basically a clean win (2 lawyers went thru all the evidence and they said its way more than enough) one insists on 10k downpayment (the shitty lawyer from one of my cases) and the other one went cold but he also mainly works with higher level cases.
As far as profits go, hes mentioned some months was as high as 90% net profits. He's been spending lavishly since he didn't pay out friend as well. He also bought a house, is getting remarried, and has been spending lavishly so on paper things look great for him.
He use to be paid monthly / when ever main guy got paid but then there were issues with him being able to collect money from clients (friend said clients said they never missed a payment).
How often was your friend paid (if he ever was paid)--has he ever received any payments from the man? How long did your friend work without being paid? Were actual paychecks issued where payroll tax deductions were taken out of his check or was he paid in cash only?
