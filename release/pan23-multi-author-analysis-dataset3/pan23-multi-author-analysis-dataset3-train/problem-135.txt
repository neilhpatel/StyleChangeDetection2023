I've always thought we should've continued developing the concept and used them to covertly support partizan forces around the world. A few crates of untraceable, 3D printed pistols into Russia, Belarus, Iran, etc.
Incidentally, there is a 3D printed gun also called Liberator. It's only good for one shot. But the idea is to shoot an invader and take their weapon.
yes, "some guy with a rifle" won't stop that. But many,in fact most protestors armed with rifles and pistols and shotguns, would give them a run for their money and make them think twice. It would reduce indiscriminate slaughter because they are no longer unarmed human masses, but an armed militia. Please, how do you think people will overturn this government without weapons?
where did you get your information? The US completely dismantled the Iraqi military. We had no goals of "controlling" or otherwise taking over Iraq. We just wanted their oil, We got their oil. This isn't even a Vietnam situation where we lost on our strategic goals but still came out with only 100k deaths while removing over 1 million enemy combatants, we went in, destroyed the army, secured the oil fields (destroyed if necessary) then left.
