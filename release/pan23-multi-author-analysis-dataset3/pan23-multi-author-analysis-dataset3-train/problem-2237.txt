Step 1 is interview a few personal injury attorneys. You can contact your state's BAR for references. There's plenty of personal injury attorneys. Step 2 is accept the services of one, ideally on contingency (they don't get paid unless the suit succeeds/settles). You didn't mention your state so I will just assume my own jurisdiction, where you would likely have a case (injuries resulting from non-contact/no-contact collisions).
Your partner had the right of way because the other vehicle was turning. This also means there was a collision resulting in damages and injuries. Whoever the police say is at fault is different than who insurances and courts say is at fault and where liability lies.
Even though there was no contact, many states and insurance policies that still allow suits and claims to proceed. The fact of the matter is your partner has substantial injuries and will need a legal expert to properly determine if you have a case, how strong it is, and to recover damages.
PIP insurance for motorcycles is rare, so you'll have to use health insurance to cover it. Collision would only cover the motorcycle damages.
Title: Partner in a motorcycle accident. Other person most likely at fault. Medical bills and totaled motorcycle will not be covered under insurance. Potentially lost the use of his hand permanently. Do we sue? How?
