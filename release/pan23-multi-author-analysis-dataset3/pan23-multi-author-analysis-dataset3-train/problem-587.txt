All you can do is file for custody. If the children are abused or at risk of abuse by the mother you should call CPS.
Legal aid said they could not or would not assist because there is no physical abuse even though the children are in danger. So I guess I have to get a private attorney.
Do you think they will speak with me if I am not the one seeking custody? I'm doing this for my father who has a super busy work schedule. He can attend any court hearings and stuff but . trying to handle the rest as best I can.
They are in my physical custody at the moment. I was told by adult protective services not to call CPS but if you think it's a good idea I'll do it. My father is also aware that the children are here and has given me express permission for them to be here. The issue is she's threatening to come take them and though I know I don't have to allow her into my home she is technically their mother and I know that she has ways that she could get them if she really wanted to. Only three of them are above the age of 12 and I am worried that she could force the 8-year-old to come home with her even though it is not in the children's best interest and not what they want. I don't know if it makes any difference but she does have a history of substance abuse as well as her mental health issues causing her to put the children in danger by way of setting things on fire acting erratically and not providing base care.
Would you recommend that I get a legal aid for this? The situation is a little bit tricky and I don't know if they would be more capable of explaining. Also would it help to get a restraining order for the parent they are with so the opposing could not come on his property.
