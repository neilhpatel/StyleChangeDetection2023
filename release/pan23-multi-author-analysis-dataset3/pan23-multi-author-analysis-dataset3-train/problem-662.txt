I agree drugs should be legalized, but we need to stop kidding ourselves with the "legalize it and tax it" idea.
Edit: Also no place in the entire world stopped the black market for cannabis by legalizing it. Black market weed just goes cheaper and is usually unclean cannabis grown for legal market.
If you just tax the shit out of legal drugs, you will still have a black market for drugs. This is exactly what we've seen in California and other states that have had legal cannabis for years now. We still have a huge black market for cannabis, bigger than the legal market. Because too much taxes and regulation.
It's about finding the right tax level. California has clearly not found the right tax level, especially not for the quality of the products or user experience in the shops.
I think California needs more regulations and quality control too. I just don't see it's testing quality being where it needs to be in CA. NV is smaller and has tourism to supplement a lot, but we only lost about $20 mil in tax revenue to the black market in 2020, I would need numbers for later. The amount of illegal grows has substantially shrunk year by year too.But we're small, CA is a whole different beast just being more populated than a lot of countries. I think it might be hard to completely eliminate the black market is CA without going hard on illegal grows and also cutting tax.
Tax is necessary for regulation and running regulatory programs. Coming from a highly regulated state I tend to agree it's necessary. I feel I benefit from this system too as I'm med and mainly pick out weed by terpenes, regulations have made it have some of the best testing compared to other legal states, and we're still not perfect and have had scandal lol. Some goes to the school district too which is great, I grew up here, our schools suck.
