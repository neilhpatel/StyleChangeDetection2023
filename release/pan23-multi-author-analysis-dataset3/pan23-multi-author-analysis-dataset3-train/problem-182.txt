Obviously there are more details than that. I'm saying that's the overarching reason. China has long proclaimed they will never interfere with another country's internal affairs. They're using Iran as the mouthpiece so they can say they aren't interfering, it's Iran, we just agree.
We're talking about the same Iran right? The same Iran that has no problem killing and torturing protesters and attempting to offer piecemeal offerings of freedom after allowing Basij to conduct wholesale slaughter and beat downs. Basically, there is no difference from Afghanistan at the moment.
Afghanistan is more likely to lisen to those countries so why should they not say something? Also you can’t really compare Iran’s hairscarves with what is happening with women in Afghanistan.
In most Arab countries women don't need to cover their hair by law as it happens in Iran. In most Arab countries don't have death penalty if you are LGBT as they have in Iran, and in couple of them there are not even laws against homosexuality. In most Arab countries drinking alcohol is allowed, but in Iran it is not.
