If this is a company car it's even better as he probably has a mandatory commitment to report ANY damages to the insurer.
If you don't have damage to your wheelbarrow, but you are insured, let your insurance know that there has been an accident where a driver hit your stationary wheelbarrow (make sure you mention it was stationary!) , sent them the screenshots of him admitting fault and tell them he is trying to seek damages and you need legal council. A letter from your insurance's laywer will shut him right up.
Keep those. Print them, take screenshots, save 'm on an internet drive (google drive of photo's is fine). Just don't lose them. Edit: some messaging apps have the option to delete the message even after it is send or read. That is why it is important to take printscreens and save those).
He pulled into a stationary object: he is most definitely at fault. That is also why he is trying to change his story, to put the blame with you. If you lie to insurance that you're at fault, result will be that the insurance will come after you for reimbursement of the damages they paid to him.
You're not responsible; this is all on him and you are absolutely in the right for not wanting to lie to his insurance company, particularly not any lie that would have you taking on liability.
