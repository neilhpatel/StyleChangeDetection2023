That means the debt is yours; your parents as co-signers were the security in the event you were unable to pay. Sounds like you were able to pay, thanks to the inheritance.
I don't see what your issue is. Were you planning on forcing your parents to pay your student loans?
More clarification is needed: Are these your loans in which your parents are co-signers? In this case, they are under no obligation to pay a cent of your loan. In fact, if you defaulted on the loan and they had to pay it to save their credit, they could sue you for the money they paid.
Then I'm not really following why you think they should pay it out of their inheritance. You are going to have serious issues claiming any damages here. You directly benefited 78K, unless you can claim you were on a path (like public service for 10 years) where your debt would not have needed to be paid. But even in that case, you'd need to back out the 10 years of interest.
However if this was a parents plus type loan, this is their loan to pay and they shouldn't have used your money to pay it.
One obvious sticking point: The 78K that was paid on your loan. How are you going to argue that this wasn't a 78K direct benefit? It is going to heavily depend on the wording of the trust, but you clearly benefited from the 78K and they did not.
