I think I understand Naguals now. I read that the Yahui lizard men were not an actual species but people who were turned into them.
The dichotomy confuses me, the men were dressed as a "Quetzal Owl" but Quetzals are far different from the Horned Owls we know today, and Quetzals don't even have any horns.
This is probably a strange question, but was there any connection between the Owl Men and Mictecacihuatl?
Moving forward, owl-men were thought to be , meaning (horned) owl-man, sorcerer, or a demon. In Nahua religion, Mictlantecuhtli, lord of Mictlan, is thought to be responsible for owls. Luchazas, or screeching owls, were more common with Mictlantecuhtli instead. However, animals such as owls were related to him, but another deity, Tezcatlipoca, who was attributed for practice of sorcery (especially at night). Tezcatlipoca is a deity that is known to have many aspects of their deities, such as Chalchiuhtecolotl, thought to mean "Precious (Horned) Owl", who is known for being active at night and associated with sorcery as well.
In more recent times, we have the Mexican saint, Santa Muerte, who is closely associated with owls and who some believe evolved from the worship of Mictecacihuatl, which made me wonder about the possible connection eith the Owl Men.
The owl men of Mesoamerica are definitely one of the more sinister types of traditions, particularly in central Mexico rather than the other inhabitants of the Yucatan. I will be dividing what sorcery and magic was known within the Aztec Triple Alliance territories and within the perimeters of the Mayans as well.
