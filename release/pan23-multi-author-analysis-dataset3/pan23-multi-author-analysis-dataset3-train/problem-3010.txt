If you don't do recreational drugs, check to see if there are any blood plasma donation centers in your area, like Biolife. Look on their websites for new donor bonus coupons. You can make several hundred dollars in a month for donating plasma twice a week. It's a lifesaver for me.
You can conceivably sue for damages; I don't know how much you've spent on plumbers at this point, or how much money you've lost in property damage because of the plumbing, but, unless it's several thousands of dollars or more, I think legal action in this scenario is not worth it. I recommend putting up with the bad plumbing, and putting all of your energy and resources into finding a new place as soon as you can.
Believe me, I do know. I was evicted in 2010. Luckily I had some friends who put me up. I was homeless in 2016 because there wasn't anyone to help me. Housing is something I've struggled with for much of my adult life.
It’s getting hard trying to find a place. I live in So cal. I’m starting to think my landlady is retaliating. Do you think I have an open a shut case?
