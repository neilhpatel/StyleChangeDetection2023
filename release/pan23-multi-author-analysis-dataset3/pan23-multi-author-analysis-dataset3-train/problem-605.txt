Thank you very much. I figured . The only reason I ask if there's any way around it is because a sibling of hers has repeatedly threatened her life; and unless there is a way to involve a third party or avoid being directly affiliated with it--I'm not sure she will.
I think the sibling is technically a fiduciary/trustee? The financial power of attorney. My understanding is that he (and one other sibling) were given access to accounts/checking in order to ensure the continued health of my grandpa and his assets (apartments). I apologize if this is not a suffice explanation. I've only been provided the document my mother was given as attorney in fact.
When you say your mother is appointed as "attorney in fact", what does that mean? That she is his financial power of attorney who was given a signed document by her father that allowed her to occupy that position? Or is it a medical power of attorney that authorizes her to make decisions about his care?
It's hard to know what you mean when you say that one of the siblings was given full access to his accounts: does that mean the sibling was added to the accounts as joint owner? If that is true then the accounts automatically belong to the sibling as soon as the death occurred.
