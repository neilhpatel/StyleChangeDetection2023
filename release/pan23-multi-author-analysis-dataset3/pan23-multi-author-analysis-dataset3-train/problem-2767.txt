Also, it would be a good idea to report this crooked realtor to the National Association of Realtors and any state/county regulatory department that may be applicable in your area.
You can and should report the realtor(s) representing both the landlords and buyers to your state licensing board and the association or realtors.
You should file separately about your landlord with whatever governing body handles landlord tenant issues. Name your landlord, and the new owners if you have that info.
The new owners are your landlord and are bound by the contract and the law. Entering the property without notice violates state law and moving in before the end of the lease is an illegal eviction.
Also pull out your lease agreement and look at what your landlord is legally required to do to terminate your lease and evict you. If he sold the property before doing that, congrats the new owners are not your landlords and they have to file according to your lease agreement. As a single mom and having stated you don't feel safe because of this already, I understand you may be hesitant to push back here. But they are bullying you and using your assumed ignorance against you. Don't let them. You have rights. And based on what you've said here you may have the start of your kids college tuition in lawsuit payouts.
