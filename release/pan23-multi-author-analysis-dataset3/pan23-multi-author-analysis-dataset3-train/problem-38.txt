The draftees usually won't go to these kinds of extremes if things are peaceful since their lives are not in any immediate danger anymore.
Not even unique to the military, people who choose to do a thing tend to do it better than those that don't.
Instead a lot of the kind of thing NCOs do in the West are done by junior officers. You can imagine the issues.
Imagine this. You don't want to have anything in common with military. To avoid being drafted you are going to university, where 1 hour every week there is a subject called "military". Basically theory of how the military works. You are not interested in military at all, but if you finish this course (usually spanning a few years) you will not get drafted. So you are going to this 1 hour subject, totally ignoring the content. It's easy to pass anyways. After 2 or 3 years you are going for 2 weeks field training. You are given an AK. You are going to the range 3 times during that camp. Shooting between 30 and 60 rounds in total. After about 10 days you have a briefing that your unit goes to field exercise with other units. The next day a truck comes for you and drives you to the exercise area. You are given 4 mags with 30 rounds of blanks each. You are running with your unit around listening to a guy that has so low respect of yourself that he doesn't even bother chewing you out. When the day ends a truck takes you back. After the course ends and you pass (it's impossible to not pass) there is a ceremony, where you are sworn in and you are getting your military id stating you are second lieutenant now, with specialization in i.e. rocket artillery, because on one of the tests you did good on that subject. Or no specialization at all. Time flies, you now have your own business, you forgot about university and the course. One day two sad guys come to your place telling you that In two days you will be commanding a platoon of motorized rifle infantry.
