The treatment of minorities in India is similar to the treatment of blacks in America. Statistically, black on white violence is far greater than white on black violence. Yet in the news, you only hear about it when a white man kills a black man. Same thing goes for Hindus and Muslims. Minorities in India also receive benefits such as affirmative action for college admissions, much like America.
I don’t blame you for thinking the way you do. Pretty much every post about India on Reddit is negative, so that is all you ever see. Bad stuff happens, but a vast majority of Indian people are peaceful and don’t care what religion you are.
Right but you implied that people can’t comment about another country unless they’ve actually been there, but you’re doing exactly that. Quality of life in India is pretty good so long as you don’t live in poverty.
Our poorest homeless have better lives than some of the richest people in certain parts of india. That is simply unacceptable for a nation that wishes to claim it is the peak of human rights and above being investigated. <3.
