I know about the Monsanto scheme where farmers were sued and bankrupted just bc one GM seed was found on their land. But you claim about mechanic pollination remains a bit vague.
Bayer / Monsanto is a criminal organisation. They all scientific research that proves the harmful effects of their activities and put wild claims on their propaganda websites. Personally I believe the impact of pesticides and herbicides on is much more worrying than direct human impact. > no pollinators no crops.
Herbicides and pesticides on farms spread in all sorts of ways (rain, groundwater etc.. and do not break down easily).
By continuing their push on questionable insecticides and similar chemicals, they gain by wiping out farms that are not in their own system.
What I was referring to was the export of pesticides that are banned for use in Europe, because they are harmful to humans and useful insects like bees.
I would understand the outcry if they were exporting those pesticides to their colonies... but they are independent countries. Why don't they just ban the importing of the harmful pesticides? I mean, if you are given freedom, you are also given responsibility, right?
