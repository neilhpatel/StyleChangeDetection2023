Crystal was told she could vote too, and then filled out a provisional ballot that wasn't actually counted.
What wohl is doing is election fraud, Republicans don't like talking about that because they know they commit it all the time.
Can anyone find me of a single example of Democrats trying to stop people from voting? Why is it that every voter suppression scheme is 100% Republicans?

Election fraud is rampant in the form of voter suppression, intimidation, and flat-out denial of voting rights. From Jim Crow to recent GQP attempts to hinder AA and poor people's rights to vote, it is just more common now than ever. Looking at you, Georgia and Brian Kemp. It is usually an organized attempt by political operators to deceive or hinder voting access through agency or bureaucratic operators. Again, looking at you, Georgia. Election fraud isnoften intended to suppress a minority or historically repressed group's access to suffrage.
