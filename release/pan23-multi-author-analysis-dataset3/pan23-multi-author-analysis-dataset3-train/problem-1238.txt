Does Dominos in the US have the same menu shithousery as the UK where working out how to actually get something the cheapest way is a nightmare?
Want a margherita pizza with one or two extra toppings? That'll cost extra. Do a custom pizza and you get 4 topping choices included... so you can do your additions for the price of the basic pizza.
This is why Pieology and other similar Chipotle-style pizza places are so so much better. All toppings are free at any quantity, are more varied, and of much higher quality than the shit at Domino's for the very decent price of $10 to get what's probably a medium at other places. It's typically enough to feed me twice. I hardly ever order at Domino's, Donatos, Pizza Hut, or any other legacy pizza chain anymore.
Only time I ever ordered Dominos was basically pre doordash and before most restaurants delivered because they were one of the few places we knew we could just order and have it show up.....haven't touched it in years now. No thanks Dominos I'll spend a few bucks more or the same price and order from a good local pizza spot.
Domino's is playing 8D chess while I'm just trying to buy a pizza. The last thing I want to do when I'm too stoned to drive somewhere is read all the fine print and comparison shop a business against itself.
When I was a cashier growing up, a WIC purchase meant I had to call a manager, close my line, and assist the customers in line to other lines while I waited for the manager.
If the average customer took about 2 minutes to get through my station, it took a WIC customer 15-20 minutes. Even with that policy, our store ended up eating money from accidentally allowing unapproved items.
