2/4 Kyrylivka is located approximately 14 kilometers southeast of Vuhledar. The central part of the town - educational and administrative buildings was turned into an assembly area where enemy forces gathered before dispatching to the frontline.
Before launching the Vuhledar offensive, occupational forces unconcernedly decided to set up an assembly area in the central part of Kyrylivka, not far from Vuhledar. Let's see how did that work out for them almost a week ago.
Girkin went on a sad rant again yesterday about the poor state of Russian communication, aviation, and supply. More so, believes that Russia is not ready for a major offensive, and if it's daft enough to try it, it can turn out worse than the Kyiv de-escalation.
Plus... Ukraine has no NATO coming to the rescue, if they let Russia get some land for free - how do they get it back?
For Ukraine to win, the West must be willing (because it has the ability) to provide aid until either Russia cannot match it, or until Putin croaks.
it's not about whether the West can help Ukraine win this war (it can absolutely), it's about whether the West is willing to do what it takes. aka send ATACMS and whatever else Ukraine is asking for.
