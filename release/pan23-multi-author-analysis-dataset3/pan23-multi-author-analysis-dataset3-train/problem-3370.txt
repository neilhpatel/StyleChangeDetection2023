She wasn’t the only one who claimed to be against this then backed down. Moderate GOP members are a complete lie at this point.
I dunno I’m 36 and I feel you could have argued northeastern republicans were, in my lifetime, somewhat moderate. They tended to not lean into the Christian conservative culture war crap and such, but that’s been a dying breed for awhile now and even the ones who claim to be that always fall in line with the far right when the votes come up (see Susan Collins).
Edit: I’m not sure why so many of you are a scornfully replying ‘there is no moderate GOP’, that’s literally the point of the comment. What exactly do you think the phrase ‘moderate GOP members are a complete lie’ is supposed to mean?
Stop telling my about the fictitious "reasonable Republicans", okay? Because this is just petty vindictiveness and has nothing to do with anything "reasonable". The GOP is just a party of internet trolls only interested in power and owning the libs. They are unworthy of the modifier "reasonable". All of them.
