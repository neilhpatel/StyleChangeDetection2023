yes but that's the narcissistic phase. They give you something of no value to them because what they want is seeing your reaction that approves of and validates them. Nevertheless, it comes spontaneously and your reaction should also be spontaneous and positive (if you are a loving parent). And psychoanalysts say that you better actually approve of them doing that unless you want to see them grow into actual immature narcissistic and sociopathic monsters like Trump. If you don't teach them that giving spontaneously is a good thing, they will learn that giving or keeping everything for oneself makes no difference whatsoever and they will never grow past this stage because at this age, it becomes hardwired in their brain for life, and that's the reason why narcissists and psychopaths are usually considered untreatable.
So no, that's not really a natural thing. It's something you learn in childhood and is part of growing up into a healthy adult. So in the end, that person who tells you that selfishness is natural is both right and totally wrong, and you may wonder if they aren't narcissistic, or just some idiot trying to justify wrong behaviour (most likely the latter).
They expect selfishness from everyone, so when they are selfish or see someone else being selfish, it’s brushed off as “natural.”.
Heard a hot take by a conservative family never member that “everyone is born selfish and we have to be taught to be generous and giving.” (Despite several social and scientific studies reporting the exact opposite.).
GROSS. I've smoked for a long time and NEVER smoke indoors. That shit is so nasty and there is no excuse to do it! Doesn't surprise me though with Republicans.
