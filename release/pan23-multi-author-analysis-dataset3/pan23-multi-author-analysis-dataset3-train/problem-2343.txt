No no. In southern speak that means “yes I did it. The sheriff knows. And he told me it was bad and not to do it again. So he let me go with a stern finger wagging “.
Actually they probably will be. 1) fbi and maga don’t get along. Trump called the fbi losers, and maga protested them. One guy even tried to shoot them up. 2) fbi don’t fuck around with blatant acts of stupidity when they’d rather up end democracy more quietly.
If you think the FBI is easily going to track down who did this you're going to be sorely disappointed. I'm sure Rainey was involved and knew who did it, but being able to pin it in on someone that is trained like she was is going to be difficult. Especially seeing as the Sheriff may have been involved. Hell, they couldn't even prosecute the Bundys in the ...and they were on camera committing these crimes!
Sun Tzu said "All warfare is based on deception. Hence when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make him believe we are far way; when far away, we must make him believe we are near".
I realize this might be a coping mechanism from some of you, to reduce fear or anxiety about the future. But it would be a GRAVE mistake to underestimate these people.
It's just what happens when you lack critical thinking. You end up with no framework to process the validity of knowledge beyond, "who's been nice to me or agrees with me".
