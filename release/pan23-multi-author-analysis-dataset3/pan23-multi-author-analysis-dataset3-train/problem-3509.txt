If she leaves a decent amount of personal stuff then she likely hasn't legally vacated. I wouldn't throw away her personal stuff. I would likely wait until the eviction is complete to change the locks. It is possible you may have store her property a little after the eviction.
If any of her things are still there, and the courts haven’t issued the formal eviction order, then she has not vacated.
Are you in any physical danger? If so is there a possibility of getting a temporary order of protection/restraining order for the time it will take to get the eviction done? Obviously you shouldn’t try this under false pretenses but if there’s a genuine threat that you can prove through text messages or whatever then it may be something to consider.
Have you tried cash for keys? Paying her to officially GTFO? Get her to sign a statement saying that she has 100% moved out and has taken all of her belongings (hell, get her on video reading her signed statement out loud if you can). Don’t give her the money until her stuff is out and you have the statement in hand.
“Cash for keys” is just the industry term for paying someone to voluntarily vacate in exchange for money...no actual keys needed, or cash for that matter, if there’s something else of relative value available.
