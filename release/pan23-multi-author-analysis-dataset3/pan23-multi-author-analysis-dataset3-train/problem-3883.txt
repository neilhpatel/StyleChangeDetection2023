It’s not so much a myth when Republicans gave the wealthy permanent tax cuts to the tune of $1.6T that wasn’t funded. To pay for those tax cuts, Republicans are eyeing Social programs that are funded by taxpayers; few are which wealthy.
The worst part is that those tax breaks for the rich are often supported by tax hikes to those same people who are defending them, but not qualified to benefit from them.
I owned a tax preparation CPA firm for over 10 years, and I'm constantly surprised at how people in the middle to upper-middle class will so vociferously support tax rules that will never benefit them.
I could go on and on about the many ways the superwealthy have hijacked our tax system and are using it to amass ridiculous sums of wealth for themselves. They've pushed the politicians they control to vote against every reasonable measure that would help the IRS collect tax revenue from them.
That’s what I think about when I think of Republican voters’ plan for becoming wealthy enough that the tax breaks they vote for will affect them.
