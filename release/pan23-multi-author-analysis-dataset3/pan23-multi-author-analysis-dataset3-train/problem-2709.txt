In light of your response to me elsewhere, you may not be able to take them down because she's got permission to put them up from the leaseholder or landlord.
If she's not an owner and doesn't live there, then talk to the owner of the home - presumably your mom - and find out if your sister has their permission to put the cameras up.
She doesn’t live here and nobody uses the common rooms, and again, if her plan went as expected, I wouldn’t know about the cameras in the rooms that nobody but me uses. (My bedridden mom is the only person living with me, and thus nobody else trafficks those rooms.).
I’d very much like for the former to occur. That being said, the question is (now at least, in my clearer, less emotional state of mind) primarily hypothetical as I’ll probably just end up removing the cameras myself regardless of the legality of that. Maybe I would’ve done what was implied in the post if it would’ve worked to get her in trouble; can’t honestly say cause my initial post was made right after I learned of this and I felt violated and angry. I kinda figured recording a minor nude in their home would be illegal across the board, especially if the installer of the cameras made no effort to inform the minor of he camera’s existence.
So she has the right to capture videos of me masturbating in the living room (my sister doesn’t live here, my mom doesn’t use the living room as she’s bedridden and cannot leave her bedroom) without my knowledge?
