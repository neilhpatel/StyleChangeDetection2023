That's really interesting. I always assumed Ancient Greeks just 'colonized empty spaces' but I always found it weird that there were not 'natives' in these prime pieces of real-estate/strategic locations.
As in the original epoch of Greek colonization, the motivations of Hellenistic city-foundation were mixed. Security was often the paramount consideration, since the kings saw cities filled with Greeks - often veterans of their armies - as guarantors of regional stability. Commercial advantage was another factor; Alexandria in Egypt was only the first of many Hellenistic cities placed at a strategic node in the local trade routes. It used to be claimed that Alexander and his successors also hoped to "Hellenize" their domains, but most modern scholars regard this as unlikely.
Picturesque? Yes. Apocryphal? Quite possibly. But Plutarch's account of the foundation of Alexandria - soon to become the greatest of all Hellenistic cities - is based in the actual processes of city-foundation.
For any of these settlements founded by Greek city states or Alexander himself, is there any evidence that a native settlement existed at the location? I imagine they would choose fairly isolated areas to found a new city, but I also imagine there were some incredibly strategic areas that were already settled by natives and so coveted by new colonists. Rome did this a lot, converting sites like Paris or Vienna, which had native settlements, into contemporary castra. I imagine the Greeks sometimes did the same?
How did the rest of Greece saw these settlers? Equal to them, or viewed them as backward, having embraced barbarian tradition?
