Make a police report, then report it to the school. If there was no investigation and this man wasn’t charged with for the crime, legally there is little you can do to have him removed from the school. His isn’t a sex offender until he’s charged for the crime and until that happens, it’s a he-said/she-said event that happened nearly ten years ago.
While I agree with you and the other respondent that the "he said - she said" caveat does not really apply here, I do not know where you are coming from with:
"He said-she said" is particularly inappropriate for this case since OP has mentioned that there are multiple third parties that can back up her claims. But even if there weren't, please don't be so quick to assume that testimony is the only evidence available. The majority of people who post here do not share every detail of a traumatic experience and may not even realize that certain facts may help corroborate their story.
Yeah, I could've explained that better. The assumption that I was referring to was that made by the person I responded to who said, definitively, that "it'll be your word against his". Their use of the "he said-she said" to describe a case that is anything but did not come across like a warning about the difficulty of prosecuting sexual assault. Nor did it indicate, as you just have, how competing testimonies are handled in court. Instead, it seemed to be a knee jerk response by someone who read the words "sexual assault" and stopped there.
