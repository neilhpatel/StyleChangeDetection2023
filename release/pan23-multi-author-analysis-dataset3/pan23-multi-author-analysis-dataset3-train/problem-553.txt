As far as stopping them from calling, in the US, right now the law specifies they cannot call "with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass", and intent is difficult to establish with a large corporation. You can request all communications be done in writing by mailing the collection firm, and they will have to stop calling, or send a cease and desist which would block the firm from contacting you at all with a few exceptions (including suing them for the debt).
They probably bought it from somewhere and are hoping to intimidate you into accepting the debt and paying it off.
Depending on your state, they may not be able to sue you anymore for the debt, as long as there's no judgement against you for it. Judgements last a lot longer than just unpaid debts. If it's been more than 3-4 years since the last payment and attempt to pursue the debt, then they probably bought the bad debt for pennies, and are hoping they can get a few thousand out of you.
From what I am reading here, it’s possible that someone could be guilted or coerced into making a payment, and that could reactivate a debt that was past the statute of limitations. That could be devastating for someone, especially right now when we are all scraping by.
That’s very interesting! I am not so much motivated by the prospect of collecting, as I am the thought of sticking it to a company that is using underhanded tactics to make a buck for themselves.
