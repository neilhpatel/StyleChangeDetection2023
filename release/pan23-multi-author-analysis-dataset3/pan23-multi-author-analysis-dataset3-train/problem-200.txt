But there were many days I struggled, where I'd wait until the last minute to write essays, in high school especially I'd miss home work assignments, and often I found myself not doing the most for my classes outside of the classroom (ie, didn't always do the reading!).
2a. I couldn't find anything useful on this case within studies on the Irving Trial so I'm linking the Obit of Hirst which mentions his connections to the Trial and Irving.
However, when I did read about this \other\ Hirst and his suit against Irving, what struck me was that Irving could have only put himself in the position to be sued due to very sloppy research - something that appears to be very apparent in the Irving v Penguin transcripts.
During the David Irving v Penguin Books trial, there is contest between Irving and the defence barrister Rampton over "the Hirst report".
However, based on context I think they're actually discussing Sir David Hirst, a noted barrister in the UK. Hirst was associated with a previous case in 1970, Broome v Cassel, that got a judgement against Irving for claims about Captain John Broome amid the losses of Convoy PQ 17 in 1942. My educated guess would be the Hirst Report would be something associated with this case- probably the evidence used to exonerate Broome of negligence in the loss of PQ17.
