Lmaoo who wrote that shit, we live in a leased apartment and no such law prevents us from having as many guests as we want and they can love how much ever they want.
Yes, a lease can prohibit a guest from staying for more than a certain amount of time because guests do not have the right to inhabit the premises.
Guests don't live there and they don't pay rent. A guest usually stays for a short time and has a plan to return home after the visit. A tenant lives on property usually for the term of the lease or remaining term of the lease.
Your lease is giving you the right to a roommate, who lives there, pays rent, and has to follow the rules set by the lease and local laws. It is prohibiting long term guests because if it doesn't squatters rights may apply and then the landlord may have issues evicting your 'guest' who is now an unwanted trespasser.
By "occupying a premises" the law is describing an individual who lives on the property. A long term visitor can become an occupant, which is some of what landlords are trying to avoid when they make rules limiting overnight visitors.
The law you're referring to is about your right to have a roommate. Meanwhile, your lease is not limiting your right to guests so much as long term visitors.
