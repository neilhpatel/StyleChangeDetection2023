I definitely understand where you're coming from. Thanks for your response. Would his writing an apology letter and admitting everything in a pretext phone call change anything in your opinion?
I'm waiting for a call back from victim services and from the DA. The DA did call me yesterday but I was so triggered by the possibility of 16 years that we decided to reconvene at a later date.
If I'm understanding correctly, even if the DA were to offer a plea of 30 years (for example) he would still be eligible to parole in 15. Unless of course he got life without parole, which I'm not sure what the likelihood would be for a these charges.
depends on the sentence, but since he is 19 assuming that life without parole is not on the table, yes he will be eligible for youth offender parole. Youth offender is the "maximum" duration that a inmate can serve without having a hearing for parole. It is determined by his "controlling offense", that is the crime that he is given the most time for .If he is found guilty of 288.7(a), he will be eligible for parole after 25 years. If he is guilty of 288.7b, he will be eligible for parole after 15 years, unless he is also additionally found guilty of 288a, to which his parole hearing will be after 20 years.. Parole is not automatic, it is a hearing and you and the victim have a right to attend to protest against granting the offender parole.
