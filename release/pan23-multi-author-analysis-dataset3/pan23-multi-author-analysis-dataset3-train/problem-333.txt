Primary answers require more knowledge than I own, so I'm inserting here to add: Nashville has a vibrant music history, and is very influential in country music, especially. If you can find a good music history book for Nashville influences, that might also be helpful.
I also recommend another bit of Nashville history, James Squires' Secrets of the Hopewell Box. Nashville was once just a little southern railroad town. I think now most Nashville residents haven't lived there more than ten years, and this will give you some notion of what the old days were like, when the low end of Broadway was filled with farm supply stores and light industry, and country music was just getting to be popular.
James McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom is still a great book on the Civil War. Stanley Horn's The Decisive Battle of Nashville will fill you in on much of the local history. You should also check out the Franklin Battlefield. The two battles were the end of John Bell Hood's Army of Tennessee. Franklin also could have been a useful lesson to the Europeans in 1914 on the new dangers of frontal assault tactics against newer, more modern weapons.
Well, you'll notice Lepore's aversion when she pretty much leaves off at the Congress' agreement to declare independence and picks up again at Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown. I can fully understand her not wanting to get into all the flanking maneuvers and uniform facings, but most people would say that the years between were, really, quite eventful and worth a narrative description.
