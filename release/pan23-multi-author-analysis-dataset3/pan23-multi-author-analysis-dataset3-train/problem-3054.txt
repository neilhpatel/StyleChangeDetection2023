Say I'm a small time American manufacturer and I really like the design but want American quality workmanship and materials, could I manufacture my own copies for the market?
During the 4 years of its existence, did the Confederate States government and/or the various state governments pass any notable non war related domestic legislation?
In the United States, are there any pre-Constitutional (or even pre-Articles of Confederation) laws that are still active or regularly applied? At the state or federal level?
I imagine with the mere passage of the Constitution they didn't just say "well, time to re-do every single law. Get to work, congress." I imagine there had to be some continuity among the transition; surely there's some Northeastern state with a "Anti-public nudity law of 1644" or something on the books. For example, anyway. I think it'd be kind of cool to have active laws older than the country itself. But I'm curious to know for sure if they exist. Thanks.
Hey, thanks a bunch. If you don't mind a follow-up I can clearly map those races to "white", "black", "yellow" and "red" but I don't know which "colour" ""Malay" would be. Would you happen to know that? Thanks.
