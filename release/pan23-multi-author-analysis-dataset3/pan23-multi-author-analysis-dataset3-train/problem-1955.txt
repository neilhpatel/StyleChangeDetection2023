Also you can cut any branch or growth that extends onto your property as long as it doesn't kill the tree...so if that 'sucker tree' is on your property, just cut it.
Before approaching the neighbors, get a good fencing contractor who can give you a set of options including:
once you have those options (and costs in hand) you can have a more constructive conversation with the neighbor. If you choose 1, make sure you send a letter to the neighbor indicating the fencing choice was intentional and you are not ceding that property to them.
You may get better advice in a sub such as r/homeowners \- this is really a question more about neighborly relations than law. It's good to know the law, but I think your question is more "how do I talk to my neighbors about this topic?".
. say hi, be friends, invite them to a bbq, leave them a pie, mention the fence in passing after knowing them for a bit… and thennnnn try asking them directly about the house.
A friend suggested installing a 3’ chain-link or wire fence to keep my animals in, as a temporarily stopgap until we got the neighbor issue resolved.
I’m sure once you let them know about your animals they will hopefully see from your side that you need a fence there to keep them enclosed. Well I’m hoping so...
