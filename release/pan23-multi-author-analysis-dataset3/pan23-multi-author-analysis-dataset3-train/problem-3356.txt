Insights like that can tell the Ukrainian military exactly what's going on in the fog of war. By comparison I doubt there are many Russia-sympathetic Ukrainians to the west of the line of contact.
If you go beyond the Ukrainian conflict itself and think of regional dynamics, I think you can see the broad outlines of the Western response.
Right now, we're in a position where Russia can't be allowed to win the war in Ukraine. If it does – if it makes it out of the war with a real advantage in territory, economy, or foreign position – then every small, independent nation on the border of a potentially aggressive power needs a crash nuclear deterrent capability. Nonproliferation would go out the window.
If Russia uses nuclear weapons in pursuit of its objectives, we've gone one step further. Then, Russia must not only "not win," it must decisively _lose_ and end the war with none of its objectives even partially achieved. In that case, the signal isn't to independent nations to not arm themselves, the signal is to existing nuclear powers to never use the weapons. Nations like India, Pakistan, or China must feel that it's better to lose a war of aggression than to face the consequences of nuclear first use.
I think they make a point of not using nukes, 1- to shut down any other countries that may want to use nukes 2- because it's a power move to show nato doesn't even need nukes to hand their ass to them.
