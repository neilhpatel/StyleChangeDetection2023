And it’s a long and complex investigation and we’re still early in the process but we’re making tremendous progress and I think you’ll see in the next several months more movement in this direction as more investigations get underway and we talk with more people who potentially may have more information that we could possibly use towards gathering what is needed to start the process on moving towards further legal actions.
I do think it’s inevitable that at some point they will be able to move forward with beginning the process of exploring a way to open discussion of the potential initial stages of initiating the process of moving forward with the consideration of looking into what an indictment would look like. Which is pretty exciting.
At which point they can begin to put together staff to collect information on the potential start date for exploring what a grand jury could conceivably do. In a few years, there could be some real progress made on setting a start date for the initial filings that may lead to appointing a prosecutor.
