And a “no-limits friendship” sounds an awful lot like a direct translation, more likely akin to the meaning “we will continue to be allied with Russia”.
Are they sending billions of dollars in advanced weaponry to Russia? Running a daily global media campaign to support Russia’s position? No? Okay.
Putin is a steaming pile of shit, yes. But China is in a unique position where Russia is one of the few large countries that would have its back when push comes to shove. Should they throw away a relationship with an economic powerhouse and dive into a future of western economic aggressions naked in the name of moral grandstanding?
And if you don’t think there’s western economic aggression, then geez, you must not be very into politics. “Beating China” is a phrase I hear daily.
And China really, really isn't lesser in any way. The only thing China hasn't done is outright war. In every other field of they outpace Russia. Plus, Russia aren't the ones with "re-education" camps. And in regards to being a surveillance state Russia doesn't hold a candle to China.
There is no denying, China is not Russia. If and when China becomes a problem the solution would be tailor-made. NK may be the next hostile the world will have to sort out and China may be able to play a very big part here.
