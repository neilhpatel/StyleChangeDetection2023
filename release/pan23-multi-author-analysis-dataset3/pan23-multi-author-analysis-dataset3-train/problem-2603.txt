Do you mean the registration, or were you given the actual title? (When you finance, the title goes to the bank to sit in their filing cabinets somewhere; you don't see it until it is paid off.).
The above is correct. Your deal is with the dealership not the bank, though the dealer can make the deal contingent on external financing.
Based on your description, the financing was to be facilitated by the dealer. Your contract with them will determine appropriate recourse based on them not securing financing. Most of those contracts have a 10-20 business day period to secure that financing. Some contracts don’t allow you to recover your down payment if there is a contract breach, as well. Be careful when reviewing yours, but as presented I think you’d be safe in recovering them if it moved to litigation, even if the contract states otherwise.
I’d recommend requesting they send whatever paperwork they’re asking you to fill out again as well as an explanation as to why. Compare this paperwork with the original. If you feel uncomfortable with the differences, you can seek help from a lawyer (source one from the NC bar). You’ll likely need to pay for that service, and you’ll have to determine if there’s value in doing so. You may also report them to the NC Attorney General by filing a consumer complaint on the nc doj website if you feel they are being unethical.
