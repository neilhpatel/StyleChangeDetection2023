Are there any charities that are focused on helping people survive the winter? I would like to donate to any charity that sends good winter clothing and other winter necessities to Ukraine.
Ukraine is also getting donations of cold weather gear in huge amounts from Canada and Denmark, both countries that know a thing or two about cold winters.
It's also not going to help in that it's much, MUCH easier for NATO to supply coats and blankets that Ukraine will need than it is for Russia to do the same for theirs.
Also not going to help Russia when their troops aren’t kitted out for winter, might end up wiping out their own troops before hurting Ukraine if they keep skimping on their own troops.
I’m kinda surprised by how underdeveloped Russia’s military is, I’d expect former KGB to understand the necessity of an effective standing army. I guess it’s just an ego thing of just expecting his army to be the best without doing anything to verify. Like if you’re gonna warmonger at least take war seriously.
