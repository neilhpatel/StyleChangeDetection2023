Ask for evidence that you were to blame. You say apartment's, what floor are you on, if multiple stories, and how close is your unit in relation to thr sewer? If you are the closest unit to the sewer, ask that they camera the line from the building clean out to the sewer to insure no other obstructions are present. If you are on the top floor and in need of constant repair, are other tenants needing services?
If you are person (1), then the response to your landlord is "Its you're just to provide me with fit and habitable premises. This toilet issue is problems with your plumbing, NOT problems with things I'm doing or not doing.".
Sure. Recognize that they may think you're in camp (2) -- there are a surprising number of people who really can't fend for themselves in the world. If you convince them you're in camp (1) and that there really is something wrong, then you're probably going to get better results dealing with them.
(There is (3) -- you're not using it normally -- but you already said that you are, so I 'm ignoring that option.).
Thank you for the reply. Thank you Nano as well. Trying to address you both in the same comment. I am in contact with some local tenant rights orgs as well.
I appreciate the time you took to write this out and will definitely think of your input in determining my next steps!
