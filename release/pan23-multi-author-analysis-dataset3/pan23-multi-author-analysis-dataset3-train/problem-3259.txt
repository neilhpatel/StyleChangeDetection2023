Isn't the first country you'd think of being strongly opposed to international justice systems the US? While it is indeed absurd to expect a country lead by psychopaths put the thumb screwsbone saw to one of their most important revenue streams, a country whose corporations have funded coups and wars across several continents without facing any consequences is hardly worth not mentioning at all.
But that's how every international justice system/international law works - domestic adoption by every single signatory. Even the ICC has no jurisdiction a) if a country has not ratified the Rome Statute, or b) if a country tries the case itself. When the US didn't like the outcome of an ICJ case the US simply quit and nobody could do anything about it. International law is just domestic law by international consensus (or pressure for smaller/weaker countries).
Edit: international institutions wish they were effectively domestic laws with international consensus. They'd have a lot more power if they were.
I think it's unworkable but, charitably, the point would be to force companies to do their due diligence in investigating any potential climate impact while still allowing flexibility in how you address it, right?
Speaking as American here but still general question: Arenâ€™t bad practices that lead to climate change already relatively illegal? Its just that the companies save more money from doing the illegal activity than the fines would be so they ultimately dont care?
Hell, governments dont even understand things like levelized full system cost of electricity for generation and now they want to criminally charge for impacts ?!
