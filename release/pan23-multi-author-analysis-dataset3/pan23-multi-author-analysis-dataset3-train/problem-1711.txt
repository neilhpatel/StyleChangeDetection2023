Suing for medical malpractice on your own is virtually impossible, because one thing you must absolutely have is an expert witness, and I've never heard of an expert witness who will work for someone representing themselves.
The first thing to do if you think you know better than the professionals what kind of case will win would be to find a medical professional who is willing to testify that whatever medical decisions were made were far outside the industry practices or standard of care and that those mistakes led to medical damages that definitely would not have occurred otherwise.
Before you invest a lot of your own time and money into something that you're going to lose, consider that it's not the lawyers that are the problem here.
If you are this sure, then you can pay a lawyer out of pocket to do the work instead of on contingency.
Ok so lawyers want to make money, if they think they wont make enough to cover their costs, they wont take it. Just because someone will not take your case, this does not mean that you do not have a case. This happens all the time to people who have been affected by medical malpractice. We get stuck in this place where we have every valid legal reason, but unable to find representation.
This makes it really hard to find help here, because everyone wants you to lawyer up. It is not that easy. I do have a case.
Right now you think you have a good case. That doesn't make it so, because it's doubtful that you have a lot of legal training or experience in malpractice cases- you wouldn't be here if you did.
