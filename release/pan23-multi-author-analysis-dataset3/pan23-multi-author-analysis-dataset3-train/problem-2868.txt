Unfortunately people the founders would have recognized as royalists in all but name have long since hijacked that process and made change impossible unless they manage to get it on their terms.
Exactly. They knew times would change, and society would change, they just couldn't fully predict how and wanted the Constitution to be able to change with those times.
They could have foreseen that things would change and made the constitution based on general principles rather then set rules.
Its almost like they wanted the constitution to be an evolving document. They knew they couldn't see everything so they left the task to future generations. Thats what the amendment process is about, or the constitutional convention.
They did the best they could, at the time the US Constitution was the cutting edge of political science. Extremely forward looking document for the 1790's.
It should have been amended and updated much more frequently in the following 250 years, but the Constitution was just good enough and it's bar for amendment high enough that the core issues have never been addressed.
