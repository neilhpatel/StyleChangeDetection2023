No one is pressed to do anything. They discuss why they disagree. Then everyone talks. Talks about what they think, why they disagree, clarify things, ask to look at evidence again if that is an option. The jury foreman controls everything and directed discussion.
the jury runs the deliberations. if one is a holdout (either guilty or not guilty) it is ultimately a hung jury and the state can try the person again. judges can give an instruction along the lines that no other jury would be better suited and to continue deliberations, if it appears deadlocked. but, ultimately, it is up to the jurors whether they continue or believe they are hopelessly deadlocked.
make different arguments, refine arguments, change the way evidence is introduced, try to exclude something the defense did, different jurors, more evidence...could be lots of things.
it has to be a unanimous verdict. the person is charged again, he is tried again (legal distinction). sometime the state tries the person again, other times not.
