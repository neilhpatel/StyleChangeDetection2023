So that could not be the only source of puppies, and further Googling on other parts of the "Friends of Pets United" details that are known show a much more substantive fraud:
According to the article he passed bad checks to the dog breeders because he needed the dogs for his fake Friends of Pets United charity. The dogs were bought just days before he'd have a pet adoption event where he'd charge people hundreds of dollars in fees to adopt the puppies.
Unwanted street puppies are not going to fetch whatever price he demanded for adoptions, while breeder-grade appearance puppies would be seen as worthwhile.
Scamming breeders out of puppies by claiming cheque fraud just seems unnecessarily elaborate and convoluted compared to just… easily and cheaply acquiring litters of unwanted street puppies. Occam’s razor and such.
Could I have your source on the puppies-to-rescue pipeline? OP’s article doesn’t mention that aspect at all. OP’s article says the charges were dropped because Santos reported the checks used to fraudulently purchase the puppies as stolen to his bank- but that doesn’t make any sense if there’s a direct link between the exact puppies that were fraudulently purchased and the puppies that you say he “sold as rescues”.
