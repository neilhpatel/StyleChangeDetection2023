"Its a fantastic baloon, tremendous, he's doing a wonderful job. And you know I would, I would, you see the balloon and I we have a great understanding. Just a terrific baloon.".
Yep. Montane, the Dakotas, and their used to be a ton in Utah (I'm from Utah). Some old college buddies tried to get into an abandoned one near Moab, UT when we were young and dumb and had to be checked for radiation poisoning after they got caught.
The chances of it being spotted by civilians with binoculars or semi-decent telescopes and creating a panic when it couldn't be explained was the risk. So, the government finally let folks know when it was over Montana. It had already crossed the Pacific, over the Aleutians (where the Pave Paws radar station is), and then down the western coast before the government went public.
Just because we didn't go public with it at first doesn't mean it wasn't tracked from the start. We literally have radars in Hawaii and the Aleutian islands that can spot targets the size of seagulls from thousands of miles away, and distinguish between that target and background noise or even active countermeasures. We absolutely noticed it days before it crossed into CONUS airspace, and the only reason the government said anything was because it was going to get noticed by the public. Source: I used to help design security measures for radar systems like the SBX in Hawaii and the TPY-2 theater air defense radars.
Besides the guy who worked on the radar systems in Hawaii, this is the most informed comment on this post. I took an international economic law class earlier in college but I honestly canâ€™t remember too much of it.
