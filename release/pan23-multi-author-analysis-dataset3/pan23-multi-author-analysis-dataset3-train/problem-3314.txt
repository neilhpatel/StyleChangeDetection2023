Thank you. Unfortunately yes, I would require literature in English. I've tried readin German books using Google translate (I was looking up the Munster rebellion - Fascinating) and it was hard work.
Kudos for trying to read German literature with Google translate. Unfortunately, German researchers are not known to practise an accessible writing style, especially in the humanities. Websites have an advantage as you can copy paste them into the translator. .
Eickhoff and Schopper present research on the Battle of Wittstock, which took place on October 4th, 1636, based on the discovery of a mass grave with the remains of 125 mercenaries. The book goes into archaelogical detail, but highlights the socio-economic circumstances and lives of the fallen soldiers in depth. The findings were presented as special exhibition during the commemorative year 2011/2012.
I suppose you are looking for English books on the subject? Otherwise, I would recommend German authors Georg Schmidt and Johannes Burkhardt, who are both experts on the 30 Years War and wrote standard introductions on the subject.
You've already got what's probably one of the best single books to read on the topic: Peter Wilson's The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy. Wilson does a very good job of delving deep into the causes of the war, tying it to the bizzare and complex interrelated nature of Central Europe in the early 17th century. Since you said you're interested in demography, you'll be pleased to know that Wilson does address that, particularly with regard to some of the oft claimed mortality of the war, but does talk a little about the people fighting iin and living through the war.
