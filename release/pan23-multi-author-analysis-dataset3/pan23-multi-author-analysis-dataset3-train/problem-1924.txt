Gentrification is occurring in many cities because private developers can make more money building for the affluent. In NYC, I see abandoned buildings being remodeled as luxury apartments. (I know somebody whose fourth floor walk up rent is being raised from $1800 to $2800.) Where is there affordable housing in big cities?
I'm all for affordable housing. But let's be honest. The person living under a bridge who's addicted to fetanyl isn't going to be able to pay 1200 a month for a studio either.
What we need is mental illness Healthcare, and addiction specialists. I also think some people should be forced into treatment and housing if they refuse.
It's certainly not the hell scape fox News makes it out to be but it does have its own unique problems that's for sure. Don't live there currently but still have family there and visit often. For me I always remembered the homeless there, they've been a fixture for generations. But the rise of fetanyl (or something) has made an atmosphere which is a lot more violent and unpredictable. I'm not sure how to even say it, but the homeless look worse and more desperate.
Tough times hit the homeless, too. For many of us, a slightly worse financial situation means we have to tighten our belt on doing fun stuff. For the homeless it means skipping more meals.
