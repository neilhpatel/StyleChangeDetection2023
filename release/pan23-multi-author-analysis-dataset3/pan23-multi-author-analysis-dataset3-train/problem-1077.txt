You can't negotiate with people who aren't honest about their motivations. It seems like Sinema is all over the place cuz she is - she has no foundational beliefs, it's whatever benefits Kristen Sinema in that moment.
Any all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful being would say "Getting a lightning bolt in might be tough but I think I can rig a stage failure and at least take 'em out of commission for a few months.".
Yep. There was an article in the NY Times last year that interviewed voters in Arizona after Sinema sabotaged Biden and the filibuster. The takeaway was that Republican voters might like some of what she was doing- but they'd never vote for her.
She knows she was elected in by voters that supported McCain and swing blue to vote against Trump actors.
The issue is voters already know what Republican policies are, and many support them. Voters handed the GOP the House this midterm and almost kept Trump in the WH in 2020. I don't think we can rely on removing the filibuster to cause wild swings or accelerationism in order to convince people to vote Dems.
While it's a good suggestion and I like the intent and idea, I think things would still get bottlenecked since new laws typically change how previous laws worked. Would still be better than the filibuster as we know it for new things like same-sex/inter-racial marriage and abortion, but for a lot of other issues we would still have the same problem.
