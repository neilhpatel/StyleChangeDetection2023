No, there is no strong evidence that Joe Biden committed any US crimes surrounding Hunter Biden's activities.
Biden’s son is kind of a train wreck, and Biden is guilty of still loving and caring about his son despite him being less than upstanding. But there is zero evidence anywhere that Biden’s train wreck son led to Biden himself doing anything wrong, let alone illegal, and hunter Biden has no involvement in his father’s presidency. Notice how little Biden has said about the tax fraud investigation into his son? And how there aren’t even a single allegation that Biden has done anything to stop this investigation. Hunter isn’t a good look for his father, and Biden could have handled his son better, but fucking hell, seeing this as a scandal after 4 years of trump? Hell, yes, give me political scandals like this one again rather than the president of the US’s attempted extortion of a foreign leader, etc, etc, I’ll take it.
Also yeah Ik the three letter agencies are all corrupt, but like Al Capone went in for tax evasion, this seems to be only thing that’s provable.
