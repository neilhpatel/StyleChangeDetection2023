I certainly agree with much of your argument, but it does sometimes feel as if academic treatments of the Commission's work ignore some of the realities at the time. This is, as you noted, really bumping up against the 20-year rule!
Fully answering this question takes us inside the 20-year rule's forbidden threshold, so hopefully that will be indulged by the mods.
a) The OP asked about the TRC's relative lack of popularity within South Africa and this issue is one of the criticisms that has been raised (in fact, not long after it completed its work): essentially that a dissemination plan for the TRC's major report and addenda was not thought through fully if the purpose was to create a kind of "nation-making document" in a country where online availability does relatively little for many of its citizens.
The notion that the TRC would be a foundational national archive was more widespread in various non-governmental organizations and in academia within South Africa, but it was a fairly influential proposition that created some enthusiasm for the TRC and some serious disappointment and frustration afterwards, which contributed to the overall formation of a negative consensus about the TRC within South Africa. Allais in her essay agrees with you that both academic and popular dissatisfaction with the TRC is somewhat inattentive both the constraints on its work and to what the TRC actually did accomplish, but I think you can still see why it seems less than it was expected to be within South Africa and why people outside of South Africa are largely unaware of these negative views.
In her essay, Allais makes a convincing argument that some other criticisms by South Africans are at least partially unwarranted but she agrees that these criticisms arose in part because the TRC did a bad job of informing South Africans about the connections between its various activities. One of the major issues raised at the time and ever since was the seeming lack of concern among the main commissioners in the most heavily-televised hearings for the trauma and suffering of the victims--they sometimes appeared to be unready to offer either some form of therapeutic assistance or any form of compensation to families whose main breadwinner had been murdered or tortured or who had property taken from them as retaliation for anti-apartheid activism. The TRC had a Reparations Committee from the outset, but they did a poor job of promoting its work and of directing people giving testimony to what it had to offer.
