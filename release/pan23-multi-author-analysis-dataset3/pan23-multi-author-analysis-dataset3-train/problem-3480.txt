For a Democrat to become speaker, they'd need to get votes from Republicans. I don't see AOC getting to dictate who becomes speaker; it's more likely to be somebody like Valadao or Newhouse.
Yes, he could if a few moderate Republicans voted for him. You'd probably end up with somebody well to his right in order to get those Republican votes though. Either one of the moderate Republicans or one of the most conservative Democrats.
The Republicans hold a majority in the House of Representatives. Unless several of them are willing to join the Democrats, there is limited ability to make the House do anything sensible.
Any moderate Republicans left in Washinon DC either joined the Dems already or they don't have a job.
The debt ceiling debate will be the true litmus test. There will either be defectors or the United States will refuse to pay it's debts. It's annoying that Dems have to be the solo non-insane party since the media never holds Republicans politicians accountable for how they vote.
What I've loath most about GOP Congress members is how effective their whips can be at shutting down bipartisan deals during budget talks.
And since most Republicans aren't in Congress to help the American people, why the hell would they ever do that? It would be gravy train over instantly. Dead Congressperson walking.
