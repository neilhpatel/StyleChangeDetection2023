First of all, a lawyer who you actually pay is going to do a better job of advising you than a bunch of random people on the Internet.
It's probably wiser to listen to your estate planning attorney over your non-lawyer friends or random people on the Internet. Your attorney is presumably privy to all of the details about your finances and your personal situation and should know the ins and outs of probate law in your state, so they will be able to base their advice on that information. If they advise against creating a trust given your situation, it's likely they have good reason for that advice.
The situations your lawyer talked about are the common situations where a trust makes sense, but they're not necessarily the only situations. (The $11M thing relates to avoiding taxes, so that's a bit different.).
IANAL. I am a trustee of both my own revocable trust as well as a couple family irrevocable trusts, I've been dealing with this all my adult life pretty much.
Personally, I don't agree that trusts are somehow only appropriate for people with over 11m in assets (which I am guessing that number is roughly based on the current lifetime exemption aka estate tax limits?) Nor do I agree they only have value for a complex estate with real estate, business, and potential family issues. But there are some reasons to not have a trust, including the added cost in tax preparation and legal costs associated with preparing, modifying, and terminating them... it's a complex affair, and not for everyone, but generally there's no broad qualifier of who should and should not have a trust of some sort established - that's up to you after being properly advised by your attorney, financial advisor, estate planners, family, and any other trusted advisors you might have.
