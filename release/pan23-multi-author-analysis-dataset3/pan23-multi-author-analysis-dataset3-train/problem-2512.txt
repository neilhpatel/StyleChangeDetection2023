Namely it helped launch some fascists into the limelight. And even if some of those fascists lost, the voters that voted for fascists have spread that bullshit ever so slightly, normalizing it.
So DO NOT ever do this fucking plan again. This is some accelerationist bullshit. It's far too risky.
It was a risk, but the payoff now is that most are going to dial back the crazy rhetoric a lot. None of these fucksticks believed their bullshit, they were spouting it to try and get votes and it failed. The ones who lost are going to keep it up, but they'll mostly be out of the limelight over the next two or three months. The rest will still be trying to doom and gloom to drum up their base (which honestly, both sides pull that on their base, but Republicans doom and gloom over fictitious scenarios) but it will shift from stolen elections and qanon crazy to DeSantis' anti wokeness message. Not that that is much better, but one thing at a time.
Dems did more than shine a light, they actively put forth ads during the primary season that promoted the crazier Republican candidates over some of the more sane and level headed ones. It was a massive risk, but it paid off. Most of them lost tonight.
Oh, they'll still be some of that going around for sure after every election cycle from now on, but it won't be the singular message that a candidate runs on. Then again, I'm just some random internet person, so I could very well be wrong.
