ARE there still undecided voters anymore? Before the political polarization of the last few decades, when you could have liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, undecided voting made sense, but in this day and age, you’re either picking up what the GOP is putting down, you’ll vote Dem or not vote at all.
Anyone who still self-identifies as centrist between the modern-day Republicans and Democrats just doesn’t want to admit they’re Republican, and “apolitical” people just don’t vote, period. So that just leaves so-called undecided voters, who have become a vanishingly small group of late, no longer the people who swung elections in the past.
If they lost, it was going to be that the election was stolen and their mandate to be bigots, cowards, and incompetents was just hidden.
Democrats keep trying to govern responsibly and helpfully and republicans cannot help themselves from shitting all over everything.
They will obstruct each and every Democratic effort to help the economy in any way and do everything they can to make things as bad as possible. They will then blame a shitty economy on Biden.
