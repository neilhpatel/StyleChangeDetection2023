All AP classes across the nation are based on one curriculum. The teachers must follow the curriculum because this is for college credit. All students take the same AP test at the end of the course. There are students right now in FL more than halfway through the course, which screws them over. But probably the kids who are in this class are the top tier students. Perhaps they can continue the course and receive credit from the AP board for college credit, but not for high school credit? At least until the lawsuits shake out. This is all performative for DeSantis at the expense of students. He’s desperate to try and out-trump trump.
This is why I'm hopeful that both DeSantis and Trump run against each other, and both refuse to concede after the primary.
Let them split the republican ticket, ruin things for the entire party, and blame each other for it.
I will ask the same question to Republicans and Conservative every-time they do some dumb shit like this.
How does someone else’s inclusion affect your insecurities? That’s what this is at the end of the day; insecurity politics.
