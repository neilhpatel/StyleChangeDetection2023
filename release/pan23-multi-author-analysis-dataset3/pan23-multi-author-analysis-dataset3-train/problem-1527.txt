In the 1950s, there was no open recruitment for agents/spies. Instead, students at elite universities or officers were “spotted” and recruited clandestinely (some still are). Given the class prejudices and hiring practices at the time, it was extremely unlikely that working class Jimmy Bond would have been recruited by MI6.
To be a working class student at Cambridge at all at that time would put Bond in the minority. Just 34% of all students in 1951, the last year for which there I found data, began their elementary/primary school careers at any type of state school. That doesn’t mean that they didn’t go to private (what the UK calls public) schools later on- just that they had any experience with state education at all.
This last bit suggests that he has other income sources from which to be tax exempt, and that they yielded at least £1000 per year. Doing a very rough and lazy assumption that this is based on a 5% return, Bond has income-generating assets of at least £20,000, or 200 times the average monthly income of a manual laborer. At least.
Just a note. Although Bond visits Blades, the private club, and its a location in a number of the books, I don’t believe he ever becomes a member. In Moonraker, the first appearance of the club, and where we get most of the info about it, he is a guest of M, invited for the purpose of catching a cheater at cards. He has moments of inner monologue during that book where he marvels at the amount of wealth required to be a member.
