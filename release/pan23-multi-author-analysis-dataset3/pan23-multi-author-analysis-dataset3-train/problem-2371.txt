NK "We're actively practicing to nuke SK and US... and we're flying our mssiles over Japan because we can".
NK General: US and SK are sending bombers in a preemptive strike in response to our missile test launch drills.
The US also has a lot of forces on the ground in SK and Japan right now and has been conducting "show of force" military exercises with supersonic bomber squadrons over SK. Not to mention the ROK army are a disciplined, well equipped, modern army in their own right.
If NK shot a nuke at SK, Japan, or US territory, it would be an open act of war, that would be met in minutes with a retaliatory US nuclear strike that would erase Pyongyang and likely other critical infrastructure in NK. Then the conventional bombing and ground force invasion would proceed to annihilate whatever was left of NK resistance.
If NK tried a conventional invasion into SK it would be an act of war and met with overwhelming conventional force -- NATO would dominate the skies with bombing campaigns, and then would invade NK with ground forces.
What the NATO forces need is for NK to strike first, this gives them justification to fire the missiles while keeping China back on its heels and out of the mix. But that is a gamble too because China just hopped into the fight back in '51 with no declaration or pretext, just hundreds of thousands of poorly equipped peasant conscripts charging south. China's political stance is to basically use NK as a "meat shield".
Same, I recall something about China and NK having a defensive part. I don't know if China would simply allow their buffer state to fall. I highly doubt that they would get involved though as I can't imagine China fighting the US and allies on at least 2, potentially 3 fronts (NK/China boarder, Taiwan/China, and potentially India/China - given some of their recent tensions).
