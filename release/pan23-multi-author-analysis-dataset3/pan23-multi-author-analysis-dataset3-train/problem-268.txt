Federal law (namely the FLSA) does not require you to be given a lunch break (or shorter breaks) at all, for what it’s worth. It just says “If you are given one, for it to be unpaid, these requirements must be met.”.
Note that state law / legal precedent may grant additional rights. For example, California requires meal and rest breaks and that you must be free to leave the premises (with exceptions based on the “Wage Order”). However, my understanding is that Idaho does not have any such laws.
They can prevent you from leaving the premises so long as they provide an appropriate place to take a lunch break.
There is no law (from the FLSA) that says they can't require workers to stay on premises during their lunch time. However, if you are required to be on call during that time it is almost certainly considered "on-call" time. Which they must pay you for even if you don't get called.
Neither of us was incorrect as stated. If they require you to be on call during a lunch break then they must pay you for that time. You qualified with the word "unpaid," which makes it correct. But they can require it if and only if you are paid regardless of whether you are called or not.
