A cursory google search (I know, I know...) tends to feature towns who's main draw is leisure activities associated with some form of water; either as an ocean, a lake, a hot spring, or skiing on snow.
On the other hand, Ski Resorts are a thing, and the towns that service them tend to also be known as resort towns.
I've always had the idea that resort town always referred to seaside places. Am I wrong there ? Is it more of an American interpretation of the term ?
First thoughts for the new capital were places like Versailles, Bourges and Fontainebleau, that had been centers of power in the past, but all of these were in occupied territory.
Raphael Alibert and Paul Beaudoin suggested Vichy as it had good train connections to Paris and a great hotel industry. That second factor was decisive for the choice.
Moulins and Clermont Ferrand were considered because of that, as they were pretty close to the division line, but they were judged too blue collar and not comfortable enough by the people in power.
