Because it can easily be misidentified as something else more deadly and it can kill if you're stuck in a confined space with nothing else to breathe.
Chances are the enemy won't be saying "hey we're only using tear gas" and even if that were the case, there would be very little reason to believe the enemy when they already engage in perfidy. It can easily just escalate into the next Russian field hospital getting slammed with a makeshift chlorine gas barrel bomb in retaliation.
The problem is that when Russia starts gassing enemy soldiers, it's not immediately obvious what gas they're using. Chemical escalation was a big problem in WW I -- "they threw gas at us... quick, send the worst gas we have back at them!".
E.g. hollow point rounds, CS gas, deceptive uniforms/disguises, capturing people without paying them, putting pictures of captured people on TV, etc.
When Ford ratified the Geneva Convention in 1974, the United States established implementation policy that prohibits use of CS gas in warfare except in very narrow circumstances (to control prisoners of war; to prevent civilian casualties in riots, and in rescue missions).
Additionally, had you actually done the reading you speak of, you'd see that the US has specific exemptions for tear gas use explicitly laid out in their international agreement.
You were never in the military. You're speaking theory, I'm speaking reality. We use these chemical agents.
We use both tear gas and white phosphorus overseas. I cannot be any more clear in that statement. That isn't an opinion. It's an objective fact.
Those criteria are liberally used. And none of this takes into account white phosphorus, which is also actively used.
