Marshall's data also only points to one conclusion, that in any given action, only 15 percent of soldiers fire their weapon. There are a variety of other reasons besides Marshall's reductive theory (that humans are adverse to killing) , which he simply does not address meaningfully. It is entirely possible that soldiers simply did not have an opportunity to fire their weapon. Depending on the ferocity of the fighting in that area, their might have simply not been any targets to engage. Soldiers may have been observing fire discipline for any variety of reasons. There are a multitude of other points to make about Marshall's work, and I suggest you look at my source if you wish to read more in depth into these questions of the validity to Marshall's work.Sources:
Scan any Infantry Field Manual for the US Army during the Second World and you can find references to the importance of covering and suppressing fire.
Indeed the most basic tactical doctrine explained to infantry for attack and advancing as described in infantry field manuals, is described in military parlance as the Four Fs:
I'm not sure how you are sourcing your claim, but by simply looking at field manuals from the era Marshall did his study in, and even prior to direct US engagement to the Second World War, the idea of suppressing fire and covering fire was well established as battlefield doctrine for all forms of infantry, specifically rifle and heavy weapons battalions.
I believe one of the actual conclusions that was arrived at rather than "Soldiers don't want to kill" is that the American training on marksmanship at the time encouraged careful aiming at distant targets rather than the modern doctrine of suppressing fire. Soldiers who couldn't hit their targets simply wouldn't fire.
