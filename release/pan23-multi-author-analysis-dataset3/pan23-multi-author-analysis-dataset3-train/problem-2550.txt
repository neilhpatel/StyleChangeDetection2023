Can he? He's not a natural born citizen and that doesn't exclude him from serving in House or Senate but Speaker is 3rd in line to President which requires citizen to be natural born so that may limit his leadership...
As a hypoethetical...let's say POTUS and VP are killed, and there's some ambiguity as to whether the Speaker is a natural born citizen. And we're at war, so time is of the essence.
Who hears the case and under what circumstances? Or are we in the "America is fucked, so just throw your hands up" phase of our great little experiement?
Thanks. It makes sense that they'd treat a "disqualified" the same you would incapacitated. But, what happens if there's a legal ambiguity as to qualifications. I paid all of 3 seconds to the birther nonsense during Obama, but I remember seeing something about an "even if..." defense of Obama that spoke to the ambiguity of "natural born citizen".
As I said, it was definitely a technicality with McCain, but I suspect he was slightly worried about the issue himself in 2008, which is why he tried to distance himself from the ridiculous "birther" bullshit aimed at Obama.
Or John McCain in 2000 & 2008. Granted, it was a technicality in his case, as both of McCain's parents were US citizens. But he was born in a civilian hospital in Panama, so he's technically not a "natural born citizen".
Cruz's father was definitely NOT a US citizen, and there's a question of whether his mother was American or Canadian at the time. And I'm not taking Ted's word for it.
