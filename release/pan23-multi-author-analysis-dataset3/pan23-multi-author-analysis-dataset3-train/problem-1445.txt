Chang Frick is an ambulance chasing journalist. It's not surprising that he helped Paludan. And I think Frick would have helped Paludan even if he did not receive orders (if that is the case) from Kreml.
Edit: This entire thing is a shit show. As it stands now Paludan has threatened to burn a Quran a week until Sweden is accepted into NATO.
Where as if he goes along with NATO letting Finland and Sweden join, it just makes him look like a leader who just accepts whatever the west want.
Of course it was on shaky ground, it was already widely reported that Turkey had opposition to Sweden joining NATO. Most people are well aware of the tension there between Sweden and Turkey, it just makes something like this happened and disrupting things that much more suspect.
To be clear Russia is helping far-right antagonists try to damage relations between Sweden and Turkey. It's not about $25.
It's enough to show affiliation. It could be a can of Sprite for all any of us care, it means they were in contact and planned this together.
