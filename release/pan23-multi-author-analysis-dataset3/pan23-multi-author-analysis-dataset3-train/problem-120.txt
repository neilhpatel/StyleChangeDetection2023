On , the National Defense Act of 1916 was amended to consider men serving under the Selective Training and Service Act members of the Army of the United States. The period of service of all men then in the Army of the United States or in it in the future was extended for the duration of the war plus 6 months, and the Selective Training and Service Act was amended to remove all references to territorial restrictions on the use of draftees. , the ages for registration under the Act were increased from 18-65 and the ages for liability for military service were increased from 20-44. On , the age for liability for military service was dropped from 20 to 18. The lottery system was discarded after men from the ages of 18-20 were required to register in June 1942, replaced by selection via order number (itself based upon date of birth) at the local board level.
From the signing of Executive Order 9279 until 1 February 1943, when the Navy developed its permanent manpower acquisition plan and presented it to Selective Service, an interim plan of regulated volunteering coordinated through local boards was developed to assign men to this service:
> n order to promote the most effective mobilization and utilization of the national manpower and to eliminate so far as possible waste of manpower due to disruptive recruitment and undue migration of workers, and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Statutes, including the First War Powers Act, 1941, and the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, as President of the United States, and as Commander in Chief of the Army and the Navy, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Volunteering for induction was done with the man applying for immediate induction at his local draft board, and then being processed through Selective Service as was any other draftee, rather than traditional "volunteering," which involved a man going to the recruiting station of the branch of his choice, outside of the authority of Selective Service (what was prohibited for the duration of the war with Executive Order 9279, as it disrupted the orderly operation of Selective Service). Volunteering for induction, in a sense, can be thought of as "volunteering to be drafted," as whatever number of men who had expressed a willingness to volunteer for induction ahead of when they actually most likely would have been drafted, and had been accepted, were to be mailed notices to report for induction first, before the remainder of the other men who had not chosen to volunteer and were just plainly selected in the order among themselves in the process of the local board filling the rest of its call.
