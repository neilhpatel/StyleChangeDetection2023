Well if you go that route then how about trump eating burgers made of baby's flesh and then splattering blood in oval office and calling it "best ketchup the world had never seen before" and then whiping his ass with American flag while kneeling and having confederate flag as a rag. Sure you will deny it but these are FACTS. (In CAPs so get your facts straight).
Oh.. I got it. So Trump meanwhile stopped the violence without violence while fuming and holding the Bible upside down up in the air in front of cameras and not being elected. That makes total sense.
This is entirely my point. The world keeps spinning with us as it's primary consumers. And the best bit is:
Honestly. Are you doing badly because the country sucks, or are you doing badly because your state government sucks, and it's prevented the feds from actually stepping in and making it slightly better.
I'm doing badly because our government is ineffectual, they're too worried about taking credit for any improvements that they often overwrite the progress of the other just to say they did this, and because of corporate greed.
