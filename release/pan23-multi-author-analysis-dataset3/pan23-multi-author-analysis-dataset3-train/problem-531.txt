If your lease had a early termination fee, that gets paid regardless if they have another tenant or not.
Michigan allows for early lease termination fees. You paid this fee to break your lease, rather than continue to be liable for the rent for the rest of the lease.
As previously stated, if you can break the lease successfully and only owe the one month fee it's likely a good deal.
Unless you have another agreement it sounds like they can charge you two months rent plus any discounts you received provided that you gave 60 day notice.
Unless the disturbances were being done by your landlord, you may not have had a reason to get out of your lease without penalty.
If they charged you the fee, and then charged you a month's rent on top of that while also having a new tenant, then you'd likely have a case.
If this was rent that you paid after moving and the landlord was "double dipping" on rent collection, you could have a case. But the fee wasn't rent, but rather a condition to break the lease. You aren't entitled to it back.
