Hopefully they will get the military on their side soon enough but meanwhile the women standing up in Iran need to show their government they are not backing down.
Damn right it is I hope the women get their freedom back in a way they can have rights for their bodies again and what they can wear like back in the old days.
Looks like the government in Iran is scared of a revolution rising and can't see how to stop it so they are going to execute the people who started it pathetic.
If your people are protesting how bad of a government you are, and then you sentence those protesters to death. You're probably gonna be put on a cross before those sentences are carried out, just saying.
Now theres every incentive to fight, if you know getting arrested means dying, you’re probably gonna start trying to take a few of the enforcers with you.
I mean…if the dickhead police officer is going to arrest you to await a death sentence…sounds like all bets are off and the arrestee’s option got taken down to one.
