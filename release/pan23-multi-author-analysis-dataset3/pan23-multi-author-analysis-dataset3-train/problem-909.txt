Mass Observation diarist 5427 specifically mentioned that she was considering getting her car retrofitted to use a different kind of fuel, costing the equivalent of $6,000 today, just to get around the gas restrictions; unfortunately for her, the gas restrictions came with a ban on most types of non-essential driving, so she dropped the idea.

Edit: rationing also helped prevent an inflationary spiral as increased wages (from women working) chased dwindling goods. I don’t have the inflation stats with me right now but it was kept under control much better than it could have been. There were some price controls placed during wartime - to varying degrees of effectiveness - and price controls pretty much only work when paired with rations preventing one person from buying out the stock.
So in other words, what price controls effectively did was to limit marginal demand on goods in short supply - except for those who really wanted to pay up for them. This too was one reason why there was little protest.
