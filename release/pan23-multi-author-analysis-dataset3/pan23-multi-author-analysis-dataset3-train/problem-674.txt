Tough one. From what I can see, does not apply to oral contracts for short term housing. Moreover, unless you found this listing on a bodega flyer, I'd imagine there exists some electronic communication about the mutually agreed contours of the deal (address, price, term) even if it's missing all the T&C normally found in a lease.
edit: regardless what else happens, the Monday deadline is bogus. Landlords can't double dip. If she gets rent from another tenant for any portion of May, you're due a refund in the same amount.
I've been assuming that the deposit is equal to one month's rent. If it's more than that, then maybe it's worth it to OP to try to find some kind of loophole, but if not, I'd disagree, as IMO OP is almost certainly on the hook for May's rent.
So in OP's case, if someone gets in to pay rent for May, then OP doesn't have to pay rent for May and may be entitled to the security deposit back. But if no one else is in there on May 1, then OP owes rent for May, full stop, and they're not entitled to it back, even if the LL finds someone to move in on May 2.
