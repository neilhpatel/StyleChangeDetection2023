You pay rent on or before the due date, if you cannot pay on the due date you pay before it, you are late, it’s legal to charge you a late fee. I’m also willing to bet that your lease actually says you pay on the 1st but that you have a 5 day grace period till the 5th.
If rent was really due on the 5th of every month, and you only pay by coming into the office, then you needed to pay on a day prior to the 5th that the office was open.
Most landlords who commenced a lease mid-month would pro-rate the rent for that month or the next month, then revert to having rent due on the 1st day of each month. Do you have anything in writing that establishes your rent payment on the 5th, instead of the 1st ?
Do you have any other method of paying rent other than walking into an office with cash or a check ? Does your landlord accept rent on any day other than the due date ?
What's more likely is that your landlord stopped giving a "grace period" or changed their enforcement rules, probably automating the system without reviewing your payment history.
