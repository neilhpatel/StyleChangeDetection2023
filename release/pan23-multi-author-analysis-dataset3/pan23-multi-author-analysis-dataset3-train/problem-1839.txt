In discussing these questions, I will make reference to three understudied works of Malay poetry by writers based in Singapore. They are Tuan Sim's Syair Dagang Jual Beli (Poem of Buying and Selling) and Syair Potong Gaji (Poem of Wages Cut), and Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir's Syair Singapura Terbakar (Poem of Singapore Ablaze). All three works were composed between the years 1820s to 1840s, coinciding with the early decades of British rule in Singapore.
Syafiqah Jaafar (/u/thebramblinhorns) presenting her paper, "'Merchants now rule our land': Early British Rule in Singapore (1819-1840) through the Eyes of the Native Trading Classes".
Good evening and welcome to the conference panel Q&A for "All Aboard the Orientâ€™s Expression: Reclaiming Asian Perspectives & Identity in the Age of Imperialism"! This panel discusses how various Asian groups responded to the imperial world of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
One of the things I really notice is that many of the panels touch on problematic expressions of Asian nationalism or national histories. To what extent is it useful to frame things as European Imperialism when we look at the rest of the context?
