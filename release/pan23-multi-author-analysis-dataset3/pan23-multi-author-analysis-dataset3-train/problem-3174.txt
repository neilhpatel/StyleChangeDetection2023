Nobody would ever sign a long-term renewal if they could just get a month-to-month lease for the same price by simply failing to file any paperwork with the complex.
All I can say is I know there are landlords that don’t have market rate (it was never a thing in one state I lived in) for month to month and people still sign long term leases for issues mentioned. That’s incentive. Yes market rate is a really good incentive. Landlords can also incentivize certain time lines shorter than a year that matches with specific move in demand.
You said there's no reason to sign a long term renewal if they could get the month to month at the same price. If you sign a year or whatever long lease, they can't terminate your tenancy with 30 days notice or raise rent every time local laws allow. That's incentive to sign a long term renewal outside the fact that market rate is higher than renewed rate.
Agreed that op’s argument isn’t valid, and they can do this. But this isn’t legal/practical because this is the only way landlords can secure renewals isn’t why.
OP is arguing that they shouldn't be able to raise the rent because the new rent isn't mentioned in their old (long-term) lease. I am saying that nobody would sign a long-term lease if the landlord had to keep renting for the old price if the tenants refused to sign anything.
