Ideally, in a democratic society that would be followed by at least a resignation, if not a legal case which is more probable. One thing Turkish people have to do now: decide their choice for the upcoming elections.
In other words elections in Turkey are (probably) free, but I have to point out that they're not in any way fair.
They are not fair because the deck is stacked against anyone opposing Erdogan. There's no free speech, political opponents are regularly jailed and convicted on bogus charges and he controls the media. For him to lose something has to go monumentally wrong... Which may be what just happened, we'll see if it's enough.
It is, that's why they did it. People don't just build shitty buildings because it's more fun or something.
It's quicker, cheaper and easier to build a building when you don't have to deal with permits and codes.
I wonder if it's cheaper to construct buildings that aren't up to code and then just pay a bribe, cost of doing business fine, rather than do it right the first time.
Yeah, I agree with you, I immediately thought of Grenfell Tower when I read the article. Hopefully there are prosecutions and blame is laid, rather than the everyone is to blame so no one gets blame approach.
