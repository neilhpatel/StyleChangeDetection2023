I hate seeing this take on here. Everybody likes to say the GOP is stupid or woefully incompetent, but they successfully stacked the Supreme Court and rolled back Roe v Wade. They got the least electable person I’ve ever seen in my life elected to president and seem poised to take back human rights a couple more decades. They’re about to stack the legislatures on their sides for decades and if the democrats play by their rules then guess what: that stacked Supreme Court will determine it to be narrowly unconstitutional for the democratic states.
Wouldnt the state legislatures amend the constitution or pass laws to set how elections are run, and the state judiciary has purview over laws and constitution?
They could pass a law granting the legislature the ability to vacate election results due to alleged vague "voting irregularities.".
Well damn. What will geographers do now, considering the only thing people think we do is make maps?
Fwiw- Geography is the dicipline for lots of growing fields like big data analytics, remote sensing, image processing and machine learning. Too many assume we just make maps, and others simply usurp our tools and methods.
