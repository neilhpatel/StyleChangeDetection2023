Most Egyptians are Arab/Berber by ethnicity, but there are certainly plenty of "blacks" in there as well, especially in the south. In the north, however, you also have plenty of mediterranean/southern European mixture as well, due to trade and cultural contact between Greece, Egypt, Turkey, Italy and even some Balkans (Albanians in particular). So in general, it is a pretty big mixed bag of the surrounding cultures, and cannot be defined as "black" or "white".
Why would it be racist to subconsciously associate “the west” with whiteness? At the moment I’m most concerned with why you felt I was accusing anyone of racism, when I wasn’t. It wasn’t implied or intended. You are offended over something you decided I meant.
Not what I said. So I’m going to ignore the rest of your comment where you rant about something I didn’t say, and instead ask why you think that subconsciously associating “the west” with whiteness is racist?
Are you now trying to turn my totally understandable interpretation of your quintessentially weird claim into yet another indirect accusation of racism?
The underhanded accusation of racism you piled on top just made it just that extra bit more anglocentric and rather arrogant.
