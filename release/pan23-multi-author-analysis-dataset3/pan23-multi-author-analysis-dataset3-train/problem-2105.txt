I know you're joking, but this is an interesting legal question. While there are monetary (and other) costs associated with raising a child, traditionally the court has been very loath to consider the creation of a human being to be "damages". This particular situation is an obvious non-starter, but it gets more complex and interesting in cases like vasectomy-related negligence that results in the creation of a child.
She cannot prove this. ALL birth control methods fail, and there is no way to show this would not have happened if she was on hormonal birth control. It would have been less likely, but pregnancies have indeed resulted from condoms and hormonal bc failing at the same time.
No. The doctor's failure to refill the prescription does not make them responsible for the pregnancy. Sam could have abstained from sexual activity that could result in a pregnancy until she had birth control. Sam could have obtained hormonal birth control from another source. Sam's choices and those of her partner are the ones that created this pregnancy, not the failure of the doctor to refill the prescription.
Joke aside, to add to this even had the doctor provided the refill there is no guarantee that ops friend would not have gotten pregnant. There are no forms of birth control that are 100%.
