Start by writing congress. There are already more people willing to host someone than there are people who can actually get into the US to use those hosts. There is a major legal issue in the US that we need to solve first.
If US law allowed them to come in significant amounts we could ask if culture is a problem as well, but right now the law is the problem.
If you live in the US the law is standing in the way of people who are willing. Even if you cannot 'adopt' a family now, writing congress and telling them to fix our laws would be helpful.
I'm on the Lutheran immigrant and refugee service ( list as a potential host. There are other charities as well that are doing work with whoever they can get to the US, though I don't know any others offhand. Most of the need now is actually with displaced Afghan refugees (some who are facing deportment because their VISA is expiring and they can't get it renewed - write your congressman about this!).
True. I assume the major difference is Haitians most likely wouldn’t want to return to Haiti, while most Ukrainians are just waiting for the hostilities to end. I’m just more afraid neither of them will be taken care of enough.
