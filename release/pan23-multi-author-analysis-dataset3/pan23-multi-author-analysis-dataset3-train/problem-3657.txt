Well yes he has done an actual good job (for what we can reasonably expect from a president), but I’m just concerned too many people don’t really think about that and focus on the “lol old man can’t even talk”.
I’m just worried too many people think of him as an old fart. If Trump is the nominee I’m sure Biden has it, but if it’s a more youthful Republican… not so sure :/.
Unless there's a major upset, Biden's going to run for reelection in 2024. And he's also going to win.
Sorry, following the facts that there was Russian interference doesn't mean he's an election denier.
Hmm did Trump not say that he believed Putin when he Said they did not meddle, over his own Intelligence agencies?
So how does Russia admitting to meddling convict Trump? That is quite a leap. So Russia invading Ukraine means Biden in involved and helping Russia. That's some pretty messed up logic. You know it's not 2016 anymore. You should probably look up news from this year with all the new revelations. Have you heard about the Twitter files?
