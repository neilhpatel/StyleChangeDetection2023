The Supreme Court will overturn this along with all the future weird gun control legislation Illinois passes that violates the constitution...
Like Your House Bill 5471 where people over 18 but under 21 would need parental permission to own a firearm. ...These are legal adults. It also bans AR-15s by name which is a semi-automatic firearm in common use. It has already been established that such a firearm would not be subject to a ban. The legislation due to how it defines a 'shroud' would ban all semiautomatic rifles.
I'll also note most of these "Assault Weapon Bans" tend to target certain grips, stocks, barrels, etc. which have little to do with lethality of a firearm.
Pistols are much easier to surprise victims with. And no credible proposal is getting rid of glocks.
Fuck the NRA, but don’t let your well deserved hate for them make you fall for false promises that only infringe on legal gun owners.
It’s not about the guns, it’s about the NRA being a control point of the Republican Party. Get in with the NRA and they get in with the Republican Party.
