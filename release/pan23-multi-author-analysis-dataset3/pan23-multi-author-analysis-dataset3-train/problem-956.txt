I'm not an expert but I am a woodworker that gets tool bits resharpened from time to time. I've found that it's worth paying for the service if the base item costs more than about $25. Some electric pencil sharpeners can cost more than $25, so I could see the math possibly working...
What is the best deal if you want to buy a pencil sharpener and make it the last one you ever need to buy?
Of course we know that in the end, the design with cylindrical milling cutters and planetary gears won out in the end. Perhaps the are the peak of hand-cranked pencil sharpener technology? Later ones haven't really improved on the design, they're just made more cheaply and with more plastic.
The horse was a big hit. And luckily, didn't get hurt or anything. Or get in trouble with the school administration, since the dean of the faculty was in attendance at the party. On the contrary when he ran into the dean a few days later he commended the students on organizing such a great party.. and asked ".. which students were the horse?".
