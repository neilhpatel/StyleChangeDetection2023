If you pay her to take it down make sure you have that you are paying for the distribution rights so that there are no issues in the future.
Legally it seems you were unpaid actors in a porno that you gave her the distribution rights to so I'm not sure you have legal recourse here.
I agree that she is morally in the wrong but legally it is gray at best. She is offering to sell you the removal of the video, which is not extortion legally speaking. Your lawyer could send her a letter and and unfilled claim. If you did have a case he would suggest you file a claim not use scare tactics. Her case is solid and it's not a given you would win any legal battle against her. She has the president of being able to use and sell the video until your current girlfriend got mad about it.
Frankly it seems your gf is mad you made a porno once. She can always just not watch it. Taking it down doesn't really change that it exists or that your previous relationship occurred.
If you gave her permission to sell the video that means she is the person who holds the license and copyright for the video.
The person holding the camera is the person who owns the rights to the film, and therefore has the authorization to have it removed from the website for violating the copyright.
