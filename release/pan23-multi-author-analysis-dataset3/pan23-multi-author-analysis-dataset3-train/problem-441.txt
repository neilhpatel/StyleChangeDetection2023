Yeah I read that whole thing it was amazing. Crazy to see many legal words that we still used today. Crazier to think that most of that probably disappeared in the centuries that succeeded Rome. I have never heard the words "lawyers" or "witnesses" when people discuss medievel trials.
When brought before a court an advocate will be essential. Such advocacy can come from friends, patrons or hired speakers (see Ciceros career). Did this help?
In 10 AD under Emperor Augustus (Octavianus) the “police force” would be the 500 men strong military unit under the command of the prefectus urbi. So you should not expect a high degree of specialised training and - unless you were of high rank or at least well connected - rather rough treatment. Torture would not be an option unless you were a slave (or some unprotected foreigner), but imprisonment (or house arrest for the richer) is probable.
“At the time of Cicero (early 1st century BC), there were two urban courts in the city of Rome: one for citizens and one for noncitizens. They were presided over by praetors, the second political post in the cursus honorum (course of honors) followed by senators seeking a political career. The two consuls could take jurisdiction and reverse a praetor’s ruling when they wished. A person unhappy with a ruling could also try to get the tribune of the plebs to intercede, but there was no formal process for appeal. Gradually the citizen/noncitizen distinction disappeared, the number of courts increased, and each court specialized in certain types of cases.”.
Actually your rights of defence and the kind of investigation that will happen depend quite a bit on your personal status. Which class do you belong to? The whole thing will turn out very differently if you are from a senatorial or at least equistarian background. It also makes a difference even for plebs whether you have citizenship or not.
