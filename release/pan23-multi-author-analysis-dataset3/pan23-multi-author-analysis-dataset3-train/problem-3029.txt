IANAL. So your neighbors dog never left their property? And your dog was presumably on the neighbors property before your neighbors dogs ever made physical contact with yours? I think you may be responsible for any damages the neighbors dogs may have suffered.
Sounds like one of the big issues (and confusion) is whether your dogs were 100% in your yard or were partly on the neighbor's yard when this happened. It's also unclear if your dog stuck his head through the gap in the fence and was pulled through when the neighbor's dog grabbed him or whether the neighbor's dog stuck his head outside the fence to grab your dog who was standing in his own yard.
can i get a bit of a clarification here - your neighbors dogs are outside in their fenced in yard and your dogs are outside in your yard which is not fenced in. one of your dogs due to its small size went through a small gap in your neighbors fence into your neighbors property and got attacked by their dogs. did i understand that correctly?
