The cop said they only stopped me because they were looking for a car the same color and model as mine so can i do anything because i wasnt supposed to get pulled over or something?
No. The fact that they were looking for a car of the same make/model is 100% a valid reason for them to pull you over.
I know thats a valid reason to get pulled over and i know i shouldn't have been driving. I was just stating that it doednt make sense for those 2 laws to be in place since they kind of contradict each other. I was just asking if since i wasnt doing anything wrong (as in speeding or something to cause them to pull me specifically over) if i could use some loophole or whatever to get out of it.
And by the way i never said i wasn't going to deal with it just because i acknowledge that most of the laws we have in place are ridiculous and/or outdated. I was asking for help on how to deal with it so obviously i intend to. I was asking for help on what to expect and what to do and all you people have done is latch onto the tiny part where i said this was ridiculous and make fun of me for it instead of trying to be even slightly helpful so get over yourself.
The fact that somebody who has no idea how to drive but just renews their license for 40 years without touching a car is allowed to drive but somebody who drives every day but didnt have the money to renew their license for 1 month isn't allowed to drive? How can you not see the blatantly ovbious problem with that. Gees i posted this asking for help from lawyers or people who know what their talking about and instead i got some idiot even dumber than i am.
