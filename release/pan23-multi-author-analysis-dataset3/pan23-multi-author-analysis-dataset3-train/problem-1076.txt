Aha! We're straight off with the big question: WHY? Why is always tough. But yes, basically the English favoured their tactic of dismounting their knights and men-at-arms to deploy them as 'super heavy-infantry' until the end of the Hundred Years War in 1453. After that point, as the Wars of the Roses progressed, we see a renewed interest in the use of armoured cavalry. Tentative at first perhaps, but increasing. We see decisive cavalry action at some of the later WOTR battles, like Tewkesbury (1471), and then the take over of heavy cavalry charges towards the end at Bosworth and Stoke. And hey presto, the evolution of armour follows that trend, slowly moving away from optimisation for infantry service, to designs more favourable to mounted combat. And indeed heavy cavalry continued to be important in Renaissance warfare up to the middle of the sixteenth century at least.
Could the English who got dragged into a french civil war by their masters even afford to serve as heavy cavalry in numbers where their decision would have mattered to overall trends?
Would you say that the cavalry charge was the most effective tactic that a late medieval army had at their disposal? Was there anyways to defend against such a tactic?
