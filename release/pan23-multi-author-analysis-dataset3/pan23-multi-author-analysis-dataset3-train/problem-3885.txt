A traditional historian, I am not, but I lecture on this subject in university classes and have taught broadly about this subject and specifically regarding the grass species evolved for mowing and grazing.
Modern lawns are areas maintained through mowing or grazing – the latter having had an effect on even modern day turfgrass species for many thousands of years. I previously mentioned the Poa species. These are some of the most wide spread species around the world – having the ability to move in animal feed, straws, mulches, ruminant animal stomachs, poop (AKA fertilizer to a 16th century serf). Today, some of the most common turfgrass species include those from Steppe regions of Asia and northern Europe that are 100s of thousands of years in the making due to the grazing experienced in that region. In northern Europe and the UK, you can experience a grazed landscape in traditional hay meadows. There are lots of examples worth checking out – just the pictures of them are emblematic of what would have been fairly regular in the 16th century grazinglands of Europe.
There are lots of paintings of farmyards showing fowl running free in the daytime in continental Europe, although that's usually in more modest homesteads.
