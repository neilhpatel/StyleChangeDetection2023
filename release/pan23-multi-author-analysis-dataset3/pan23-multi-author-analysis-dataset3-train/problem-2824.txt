Oh, here they march right past my desk to the director. Who walks them right back to my desk. Same user, more than once. It's honestly more amusing than annoying at this point.
Working in IT we see them all the time. Captain "Going to the Director" because they can't be fucked to put in a ticket and are FAAAAAAAAAAAAR to important to talk to the people that'd fix it. Obviously go straight to their bosses boss. "Don't you know who I am?".
This. Trump was the man on top and he learned a lot and used it whenever he could (see “Graham, Lindsay” and his quick about-face). If he doesn’t get what he wants from the GOP in 2024, he will go nuclear. And it will be glorious.
Hahaha yeah, because THAT’S an easy thing to do, right? Not going to happen. He’s a a wet sock and he’s going to stay a wet sock.
The only thing is… sometimes wet socks win. Nixon lost to JFK because he was a wet sock, and then when he ran again later on he won. I don’t think DeSantis is the powerhouse that Republicans think he is, but I would never count him out.
If Trump isn't the GOP Nominee he will burn the party to the ground. There is simply no limit to describe the lies, conspiracies, and dirty secrets Trump would split about Republicans if they deny him the nomination. One can't overstate or exaggerate the negative rhetoric Trump would spew.
