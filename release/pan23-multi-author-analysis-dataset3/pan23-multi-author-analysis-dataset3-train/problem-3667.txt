So the goal is to take a whole bunch of lawful firearm owners and turn them into criminals because of crimes which are already crimes...that largely don't involve the thing he wants to ban?
This is true. As someone who is Trans and Jewish, I would love for society to be more civilized, but I also live in reality and that current reality has a lot of people whose politics include me not existing. So here we are.
Yeah yeah. I guess it's just putting one more barrier into someone acquiring them. Idk, man, just spit balling ideas here. I just don't believe guns are banned, but I do find it wild how easily I get them.
I'm just saying to assault style weapons, such as the AR, they just be a special class of weapon that would have stricter regulation similar to that of a SBR.
What they ban is assault rifles, which has been come to mean anything with a pistol grip and/or adjustable stock.
Assault rifles are _not_ banned in Connecticut, they are still for sale legally and they are cheap (around $750). We just read the law and innovated around the ban. And we will continue to do exactly that. All you are doing is forcing responsible, peaceful gun owners to buy new hardware.
You do know that you could buy featureless AR-15 rifles during that ban, right? You can still buy them today in Connecticut, California, New York, and every other state that has an AWB. The receiver isn't banned, nor is the gas block or anything else other than the pistol grip, adjustable stock, and a couple other accessories.
