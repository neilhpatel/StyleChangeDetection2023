The ACA hasn't solved our healthcare problems, but I will always be thankful that John McCain voted against his party to preserve it.
No, the position of the Democratic Party is to maintain the status quo and retain the ACA rather than some form of universal healthcare that would improve things vastly. Most people on this thread also want to toe the political line too.
Person 2: No ACA must stay, it’s the ONLY way, and besides Bernie isn’t even a democrat, why should we listen to him???
What, what? She's never run against Bill Clinton since she was married to him, and she against Obama unless you count votes for contests that neither candidate was allowed to campaign in because of DNC rules. Obama's name wasn't even on the ballot in Michigan in 2008. Regardless, she never went up against any of the three in a general election.
I'm not saying that the rich and powerful have no say in government policy, but to say that they have "complete" control, which is what you wrote, is belied by many examples to the contrary, and it does a disservice to the many many people who are working hard to make actual positive change happen. After all, if the rich and powerful are going to get what they want anyway, then why bother campaigning for Bernie? Or supporting his new role on the Senate health committee?
That ACA was definitely not written by Romney, I have no idea where you got that from. And even if you're just trying to make the point that it's similar to the healthcare bill that passed in Massachusetts, given that the Massachusetts healthcare bill was essentially a universal healthcare bill passed in a blue state, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
