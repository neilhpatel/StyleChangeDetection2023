Your original comment that I replied to had several statements that would have worldwide implications if true. So I asked you for your source. You don’t have one. End of story.
There’s also a ton of evidence to suggest that Russian voting procedures are tampered with. So. Votes made by Crimeans shouldn’t be taken at face value when they come from Russia reporting.
So the argument that Crimea was very pro Russia before annexation should be treated with scepticism.
Like it or not, Crimea is very pro Russia and was even before the annexation. Russia is very fortified there an retaking it will be a huge, bloody operation.
Seems like a horrendous foreign policy miscalculation. How many hundreds of billions of dollars could this cost? Why didn't the Obama Biden administration get to arming Ukraine then?
Yes, how strong would today's Russia be if they didn't have a stockpile of Soviet-era military stuff? Take that away via this war and where will they be militarily for the next 50 years? Heck of a Christmas gift to the world.
