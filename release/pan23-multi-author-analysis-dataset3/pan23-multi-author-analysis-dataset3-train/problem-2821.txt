Sorry, the way you were speaking I thought you were simply a tenant renting the space, rather than the owner of the property.
Generally speaking, when there are no rules, the status quo or a snap decision of the owner is the policy.
Unfortunately, this would be a civil issue between you and the other owner and would have to sue them if a resolution cannot be reached.
If the operating agreement doesn't specifically mention signage, I'm unsure how difficult it will be.
Not much is said about allocation other than the signage should be in compliance with code, ordinance, rules and regulations.
No. This small building always only had 2 owners. According to HOA doc, there should be 3 board members which I believe the 2/3 owner held the two seats and the other 1/3 owner had 1..
The HOA board can decide to give the other owner/themselves 3/4th as long as they do so in good faith. Because they were there first and it would be costly to replace the signs with a smaller version is probably good enough to fall under the business judgement rule.
Being a 1/3rd owner of the HOA doesn't always mean you get 1/3rd of the signage. The same way you don't get 1/3rd of the parking spots unless that is written into the rules.
