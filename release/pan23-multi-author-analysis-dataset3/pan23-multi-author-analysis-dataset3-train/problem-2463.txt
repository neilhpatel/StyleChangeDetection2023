Plus it’s state and not federal, so no hope for presidential pardon. Plus Kemp knows that they need to get rid of trump to clear the path for desantis, so he won’t pardon him either.
The catch is that if Kemp (and by extension, GOP leadership) turns on Trump, they need to be 100% confident the DA can secure a conviction. If Trump gets a Hail Mary and skates away from these charges, he we’ll go nuclear on absolutely everyone. At that point the GOP had every intent to see him behind bars and missed their shot.
The GOP is going to be at an uncomfortable cross roads again with this investigation. They know that all GOP witnesses are not in lock step and have given varying amounts of information to the grand jury. Kemp has every reason to hate Trump and right now is a prime opportunity to torpedo him as the party attempts to create some distance.
I have no sympathy here, Trump was cultivated and created by the GOP and to quite a favorite movie of mine, is now a “Malfunctioning $20 million dollar weapon.” It is a high stakes gamble for all involved.
