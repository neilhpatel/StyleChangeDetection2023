Reminder to anyone who believes the lab leak and the China is in control theory, before anyone knew what it was China sent samples to other countries to help with identification.
Nope not at all. Well it was a consensus from conservatives and conspiracy theorists who knowingly push false theories, but never by any scientific journal.
I’m absolutely not a conspiracy theory believer(especially fucking conservative conspiracies - yuck) and nor am I saying I believe this one 100% - but if you told me tomorrow that the whole lab leak thing was 100% true and there was science/data to back it up, I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised.
I would be happy to believe the lab leak theory if they actually had evidence for it, but in 2021 when conspiracy theorists were yelling that it was 100% a lab leak, they did not have evidence to back it up.
The problem was that they WERE baseless. There WAS no evidence to support it. It was just a possibility.
Almost like we have very little evidence to support any specific conclusion. Yet, for some reason, people are VERY convinced they know the answer even though they haven't even looked at the tiny bit of evidence that actually is.
