They've got 9 of the top 10 cities in the world for pollution, but keep saying pollution isn't a big deal and they don't need to stop.
India is well over a billion people, that's not an excuse for them to have 9 out of the top 10 polluted cities in the world.
I never said only India needs to address climate change. Did you reply to the wrong comment? That would make sense.
Yeah, get used to it. As NASA tracks the worlds climate changes by satellite and measures the carbon in the atmosphere we will see more countries reporting this. Not to mention the tripling of multibillion weather events. Interesting that the climate scientist were able to predict this decades ago, it’s almost like they were right….
It's not like no one knows here the impact pollution has on global warming. Mainly the CO2 particulate matter is affected due to crops being burnt by small farmers for agriculture in the winter season when there is a downward force of winds from Punjab to Delhi and increases the particulates overall.
