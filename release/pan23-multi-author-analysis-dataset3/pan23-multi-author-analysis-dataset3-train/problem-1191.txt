I wasn’t mad on the phone. All I said to her on the phone was that I was so glad they found the card. I went up there to speak to them and that’s when they told me it was billed to room 155 because I changed rooms. I explained I didn’t change rooms and they said they had no idea what happened and they had zero ties to the restaurant. Please don’t assume I was angry. I am actually a very nice person.
You may be a very pleasant person. It doesn't mean people want to engage you in a situation where you're complaining. I mean I've literally spent however long now telling you over and over again that what was done is legal but you seem to keep coming up with more and more things that don't make any difference in the fact that it's still legal. I can understand the want to disengage from a conversation.
Billing the room number with a card on file is common for people who don't pay the bills associated with that room number. It's the same as if they found out you did something that occurred an additional fee after you left. You agreed to let them do this by placing your card on file with them.
