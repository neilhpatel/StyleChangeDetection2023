Agree with this, and also - If her guys did a shitty job installing the fence, document that with pictures and even video, from your side of the fence line, of course. If she cheaped out on the fence, I doubt she's going to spend the cash to make an issue out of this by bringing you to court for some inane reason. But there's always the chance that her shitty new fence collapses in the first storm and takes your old-but-good fence with it.
This could possibly assist you in making sure your fence is in good standing or give you an opportunity to make any corrections that may be needed.
I do not understand how your fence can be leaning over the property line and touching her fence at this point. How far away was her fence installed from your fence? 6 inches?
If not, get estimates for repair from a few respectable fence companies and send her the bill. If she doesn't pay, sue her in small claims court.
Do you have a survey that proves without a doubt that your fence is on your property? (don't assume anything, as some of my neighbor's fences are actually on my property by a few inches, but we don't care as we don't need a fence and thus will not remedy the situation or pay for repair or upkeep).
At the same time, after confirming your fence is up to standard, if you believe it to be that your neighbors fence is not, then you could submit a request for code enforcement to check your neighbors fence installation and they will be given a notice to repair or correct any violations that they see.
Take pictures of where her fence is (or is not) touching your fence (assuming your fence has not moved), and send her a certified letter explaining that her new and recently installed fence is either touching and possibly damaging your fence and that she must remedy the situation or be held liable for any damages to your fence.
