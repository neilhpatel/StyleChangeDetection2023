Search for obituaries of your mother that list living relatives (e.g. you) as pre-deceased and pre-deceased relatives who are potential next of kin as alive. In the trust documents, is anyone who is deceased listed as the trustee ahead of you?
Wording of trust is I am sole remaining trustee alone when others are pre-deceased. Met with the lawyer last year due to incapacity issues for remaining grantor (my now deceased mother).
All forms by me (OP) were correct as I checked this out with funeral home. In other stories I have read like this, I believe it may occur when you are next of kin which I am.
Thank you, I did get some cash from my physical bank. I have read some horror stories online about this. My husband also has a separate bank account in his name only.
I emailed the Department of Public Health that manages EDRS for the State of CA. They telephoned me and said we didn't do it - check with funeral home, Coroner, or DMV. The latter makes zero sense as my mother only had ID card not CDL.
