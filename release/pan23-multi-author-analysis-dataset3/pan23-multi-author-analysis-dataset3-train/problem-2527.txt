You can just tell them that paying out of pocket with the discounted price would be more cost effective for you as opposed to using your insurance plan. Even if you have health insurance, you have the option to not use it if you don't want to. Or does this clinic only service the uninsured population?
Oh absolutely. You’re not tied to one doctor or clinic under your insurance plan. You can totally switch if you’re unable to get the service you need through your current doctor. Your insurance benefits and coverage doesn’t change if you go to a different clinic or see another doctor. The key is to make sure that the new doctor/clinic you’re going to is in your insurance plan’s network.
Oh no, that wouldn't mean that you're not insured. Most insurance companies are actually required to cover the cost of immunizations as part of preventive care, and I was just suggesting that you should verify your current health insurance plan's vaccine/immunization benefits so you can make sure that you're going to the right place (i.e. an in-network provider/doctor or pharmacy) that can bill your insurance plan directly so you're not having to pay for your vaccines out of pocket.
I am looking to get the vaccine I need, i just don’t want to pay the full price for it. My question is in the legality of saying i have no insurance in order to get a discounted/free vaccine.
it says free vaccinations for those that are uninsured, lower cost options for those whose plans don't cover the vaccination. Even though I have insurance, it explicitly states that I can't use it for vaccinations outside of my primary doctor's office if I am under 19.
