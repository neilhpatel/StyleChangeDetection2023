Your mother-in-law's remaining estate, after all of her debts, including this mortgage, are settled, will be distributed either following her final will, or if she does not have one, following the state's rules for intestate succession. If your MIL has no living spouse, and your husband is the sole heir, then her remaining assets will pass to him. He can either step forwards to administer that process, or wait for the state to intervene, as he sees fit.
In general, when a reverse mortgage comes due, the entire principal (the sum of the payments made to the borrower) plus the accrued interest is due in full, promptly. Usually, this means that the property must be sold to settle the debt. The remaining equity after the mortgage is paid off and the costs of the sale are paid goes back to the owner, or in this case, to their estate, to be distributed to the heirs.
Frankly, if her only significant assets are her home and her car, and if her home is encumbered by a significant mortgage, then he may not be inheriting much even if she does write a will. Her will can't avoid her obligations, such as to repay her reverse mortgage, and those creditors come ahead of the heirs.
