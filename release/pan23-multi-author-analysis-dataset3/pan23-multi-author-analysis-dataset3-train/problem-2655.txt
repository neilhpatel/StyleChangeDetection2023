Nobody claims that Mongols were invincible after their decline, the problem here is that many historians argue that their decline was completely catastrophic for them from the military standpoint.
In short, the consensus is certainly that Mongol military power did degrade after the middle of the thirteenth century, though the question on why and how it did so has long been a matter of discussion among Western historians. The theories I've mentioned so far were held by people concentrating specifically on Central Asia and/or its immediate neighbors; suffice it to say that there is another tradition of world-historiography that seeks to place the decline of steppe power in the context of global shifts in circumstances, but for reasons of space I won't treat it here.
Many Western historians would, I think, certainly dispute the claims of "real" Mongol invincibility after the decline of the Mongol Empire—at least past the fifteenth century. You bring up Timur's campaigns against the Ottomans, but not his wars with Toqtamysh in 1391 and '95—or, even more relevantly, the failure of the Chaghatay Khanate to maintain a hold on Transoxiana earlier in the century. (It's important to remember that while Timur came of nomad stock, his power really rested on the sedentary population of Transoxiana—and if you can make the argument that his troops were more nomadic than those of the Ottomans, there were states still more nomadic than his.) Quite a bit later, and on the China side, the Battle of Jao Modo in 1696 showed that the Qing Empire was decisively able to hold its Inner Asian frontiers.
