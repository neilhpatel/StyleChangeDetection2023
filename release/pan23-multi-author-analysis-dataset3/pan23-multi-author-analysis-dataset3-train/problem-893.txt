188 is a catastrophe. I thought he'd be closer to 200 and I was still skeptical he could get to be speaker.
Pelosi is not an option. What might be an option is if Republican moderates want to form a power-sharing agreement with Democrats that would nullify subpoena power but would allow the House to come to order under a moderate Republican speaker.
That's not really relevant to what I'm describing. If McCarthy can't get 218 Republicans to vote for him as speaker in January (he only got 188 in caucus), then no one is elected speaker on the first ballot, and that is when negotiations might become possible to choose a coalition speaker.
lol, ok. Pelosi pulling in 15 of the remaining 19 votes of the 2021 Dem caucus is still a lot easier than imagining how McCarthy can get 30 of the remaining 32 Republicans in 2023.
If you only need a plurality of votes, then IF nine or so MAGA reps voted for somebody else, Nancy Pelosi would get 100% of the Dem vote and be re-elected Speaker. That's not going to happen.
Yeah, of course that's more likely. But your original posit was that the speaker election is a choice between McCarthy and Pelosi -- which is just purely incorrect. So I walked through the other options that could be on the table after McCarthy fails.
