Honestly folks, this used to be a party of ideas. But def no longer. Every time you'd think, "they can't get lower than this," they (the GOP) go ahead and prove me wrong. I don't think we ever end up with a one party system, but can't quite see how the future plays out; Dems and Independents?
Isnâ€™t this an unsustainable model for the GOP? Disenfranchising your voters (by ruining their faith in elections) while also proving to them that their candidates are completely untrustworthy? I mean we know politicians are liars, but this is crossing another line here.
Because prior to 2016 GOP politicians thought that being blatant liars and racists would cost them elections.
So yeah blatant lies especially from the republican side have traditionally and for a long time been par for the course. Before tht you had Ronny reagan telling people that if th government gives the rich money it would trickle down to the rest of us on national TV.
Before that Nixon lied about ordering people to break into buildings and hid recordings evidence of it. And he thought it was all OK because he was the good guy and he was willing to do it for america. This is also the clown that started the trade relations to china that has destroyed the US's manufacturing and giving china more money, technology and power than they ever had before in the last 100 years.
