It is, and the current Supreme Court is the tool that the Republicans were planning on using to perform that coup.
Fortunately people showed up and secured state legislatures and election supervisor positions to Democrats so Republicans won't be able to repeat a coup attempt in 2024 with the possibility of having their own electors.
It’s undeniable that gerrymandering gave Republicans the House: my state’s 5th district was split between 3 different R districts to give Republicans another seat, along with the gerrymandering in other states like Ohio and Florida. With the narrow majority that Republicans will have, even 3 seats would have probably flipped the House, and they didn’t gerrymander only 3 seats.
Considering how Republicans just got slaughtered in swing states, I think democratic voters are perfectly capable of being different during midterms.
Any raw popular vote numbers are going to be misleading, because there were a huge number of districts with no Democratic challenger, specifically because that district was safe Republican.
