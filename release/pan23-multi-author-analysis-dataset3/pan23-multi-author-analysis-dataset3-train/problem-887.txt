There isn't really any way to force your gran to insure you, or to let you use her car. If you're parting ways with her, the best thing to do, depending on who owns the car is.
3. if you both own it, take it with you, get your own insurance, and write your grandmother a letter offering to buy her out of the title or to sell her the car for a fair price.
This isn't the issue. Backdating contracts is fairly common. The issue is that you're trying to foist terms on someone without their agreement and without giving them anything in return, so this is unlikely to be a viable contract in the first place. There is nothing you can put in the offer to make it binding if she fails to reject it: contracts _cannot_ be sprung on someone.
2 - Having a contract does not prevent her from doing any of the things in the contract, but it gives you a remedy if she fails to perform. Are you willing to sue her if she breaks any of the clauses?
3 - Some of those do not seem like things you can enforce via contract. Things like "You are never allowed to remove me from your will", and especially things like "I will always be the head of household so I can fraudulently use your address for my mail and insurance".
