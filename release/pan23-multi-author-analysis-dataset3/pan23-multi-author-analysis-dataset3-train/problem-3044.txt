But is it really surpassing regulation, or is it perfectly legal? I know that it’s legal for an 18 year old to build their own handgun, so why would it be illegal to take payment to build someone else’s gun if they already had the parts purchased?
I’m not going to engage your attempts to go “but it isn’t really a gun” to sell firearms to federally prohibited individuals.
As an avid gun owner, I am suspicious of anyone who uses unconventional methods to acquire firearms. I have walked away from more than one private party sale due to weird vibes.
It doesn’t matter in what order you buy or sell… what matters is that once you machine it, you’re now manufacturing a firearm, which is also perfectly legal in the United States on a federal level (I am unfamiliar with the laws in your state).
Regardless of whether or not your intention was to manufacture it for yourself or someone else you cannot transfer a firearm to someone that you would reasonably know to be prohibited. The sales aspect is gone, so is the machining. Once the machining is done, it is a firearm, and you cannot transfer it to a prohibited person.
Once it is machined, it is now a firearm. If you machine it with the intent of transferring it to another person, you’re now a manufacturer and need the appropriate licensure from the ATF.
