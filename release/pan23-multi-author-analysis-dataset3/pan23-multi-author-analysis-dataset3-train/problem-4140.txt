I've talked to a few attorneys and they don't seem to be interested at all. I guess I'll just wait to call his bluff and if he doesn't give me my check in the next few days I'll start contacting attorneys again. I'll look into the other thing you said as well. Thank you.
Agreed. I updated the post with my location. But yea my reasoning is that he can't have it both ways. You either fired me so give me my check for the two weeks I worked and I'll collect unemployment or you're just saying that I don't have to come in for those two weeks then give me my paycheck for the last two weeks and I'll be expecting a final one for the two weeks you denied me to work.
If you come in to work today and give two weeks notice, and your employer then says you are fired, you are no longer an employee immediately and not entitled to any wage past today.
You are entitled to money for hours worked. In this scenario as I read it, you were not employed for the two weeks after you gave notice and would not be entitled to any wages from those weeks.
Two weeks notice is a courtesy. Assuming you donâ€™t have a contract or state protections, your employer can choose to keep you on or not. It sounds like in this case they chose not to keep you on.
