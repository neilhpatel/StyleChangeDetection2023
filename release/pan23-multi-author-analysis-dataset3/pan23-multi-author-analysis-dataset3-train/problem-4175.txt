I've heard similar estimates to the 7 gallons of pure alcohol drunk by each American every year in the 1830s, and to put that into context, that's almost 26.5 liters of pure alcohol consumed by each person, on average, in a year.
Great answer, I find it almost impossible to believe that 7 gallons of pure ethanol per year were consumed for every adult, do you really think this is an accurate figure?
Note that this is legal consumption per capita for anyone 15 and older, except for Prohibition years, where they are pulling estimates from Rorabaugh for total alcohol consumption by adults.
ETA: Here are the WHO stats for the United States in 2016 - 17% of men did not drink, 39% of women, for a national rate of a little over 28%. Half of male drinkers engaged in heavy episodic drinking, and for male drinkers they consumed 19 liters to women's 6.7 liters).
By contrast, 38.6% of Russian men and a whopping 44.6% of Russian women do not drink (30% of Russian women have never drunk alcohol). This adds up to 42% of the population. So to get that national average close to France's the drinking population drinks a lot: almost 80% of Russian male drinkers engage in heavy episodic drinking, and drink some 30.5 liters of pure alcohol a year (compared to 10.5 for women). Also, unlike France which overwhelmingly drinks wine, the single biggest source of alcohol in Russia is hard liquor, and a significant amount of it is samogon or homebrew.
