America still has people in prison for possession. What a fucking insult to so many people who are here at home in prison and not in a place who has a less than a one percent acquittal rate for marijuana charges. It is a weak ass negotiation with a terrorist nation.
Honestly don't care what she was going through it was her choice to break the law in another country that any reasonable individual would have seen the potential risk she was taking in a place that convicts 99 percent of those with weed charges and it is still illegal here so I don't see why she was worth trading a merchant of death for.
How does it help? Cause It fucking doesn't. What you're saying is we should worry about the dummies abroad breaking other countries laws that we still uphold over a literal international arms dealer.
Probably because, bear with me, this is a hot take: We shouldn't have traded one of the most prolific arms dealers for someone who chose to violate another country's laws.
Ehh when we have thousands locked up at home in our own country for the same shit but yea let’s trade an arms dealer for a domestic abuser that hates America. Very bad trade.
I will say, this is actually the worst trade deal in history. Wasn’t the guy they traded her for an international arms dealer who was willing to acquire and sell Anti-Air Missiles to terrorists? I feel like a WNBA player really isn’t worth it letting that guy loose to potentially acquire weaponry on Russia’s behalf so they can continue their aggression against Ukraine.
