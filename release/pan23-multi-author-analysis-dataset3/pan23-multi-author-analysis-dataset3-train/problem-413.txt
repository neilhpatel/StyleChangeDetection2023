There is no reason for them to. They want 100% of their money. They wouldn't agree to just get 50% from you and 50% from the deadbeat. That said, you may be able to negotiate your 100% down to less.
I would. Just to get this moving forward and then over. The longer you wait the longer this goes. And if they get a default judgment you'll spend money and time to get a new hearing.
Avoiding service isn't going to help. Figure out when court is, and see if you can make a deal with them prior to court. What's most likely here is that you'll owe the whole debt, and then can, in turn, sue your ex. Presumably this wasn't addressed at all in the divorce?
No it wasn’t addressed in the divorce, I was young, and incredibly naive and just wanted out and for it to be done. I paid for the divorce myself too bc I couldn’t rely on her to pay.
I don’t know how much it is yet since they haven’t been able to serve me. I just know this is what’s going on because they went to my brothers house looking for me and I put the pieces together. The amount left on the auto loan was a little over 13,000. Im assuming we owe what is left after they sold the car at auction plus interest and all the other bs they will probably tact on.
I was also never contacted (as far as my knowledge) as to when the car was being auctioned, which I read is a possible defense?
