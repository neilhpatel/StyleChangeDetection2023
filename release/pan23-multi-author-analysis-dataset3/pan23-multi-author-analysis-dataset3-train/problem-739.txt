That's unknowable to anyone on the internet. You'll need to discuss this with your attorney, about piercing the veil. Also understand the bankruptcy court isn't automatic approval, you can dispute there as well.
Him being able to file for bankruptcy to simply avoid paying you isn't a given as the court won't like that if he's filing bankruptcy to spite you.
There's nothing stopping him from filing for bankruptcy even if you do reduce what you're willing to accept. If he does, you'll have to pay that back anyway (as a "preference" under bankruptcy law) and the amount you'd get as a bankruptcy creditor would be reduced further.
If the company files for bankruptcy you will get in line with all of his other creditors. You will not be given a priority. Your debt is not currently secured by any of the corporations property. You may get 10 cents on the dollar. You may get nothing.
However, none of that will result in any determination as to whether a debtor is eligible for discharge or any specific debt is dischargeable. In order to do that, you have to file a complaint (basically a lawsuit within the bankruptcy) citing one of several exceptions to discharge (none of which it sounds like would be met here).
