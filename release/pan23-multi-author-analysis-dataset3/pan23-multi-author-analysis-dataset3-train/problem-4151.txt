I'd be careful about counting your chickens before they hatch. A lot of people, myself included, held their nose and voted for Biden simply because he wasn't Trump, not because we really wanted him. That worked in his favor in 2020, but "eh, at least he's not Trump" isn't really going to inspire people to get out, vote and fire them up to get politically active.
Without Truml on his side, and I mean fully on board and campaigning for him, I don't think DeSantis pulls as many people as Trump. He's not even that popular in Florida tbh. He BARELY and I mean barely won in 2018 with a decent democrat candidate. (Won easily in 2022 because, well, it was goddamn Crist...) With all his fascist moves, I wouldn't be surprised if he's polling lower with key demographics across the state. I'm getting tired of hearing about him as if Floridians love him like they do Trump. They simply DONT.
He is polling lower in 2023 than 2022. I cannot find any statistics or polls in 2023 noting a 64% approval rating in Florida?? Unless you mean the poll from nearly 4 years ago... Currently, nationwide, he isn't even breaking 50% favorability.
Charlie Crist was the most popular solely because he was the biggest name. Not because democrats in Florida love him. Not a single Democrat I knew was excited to vote for him at all. Most ended up not voting at all.. like I said, democrats have an issue with strong candidates in Florida since Andrew.
I think if there was an actual strong Democrat candidate with roots in Florida for 2022, they would have won. The issue for the entire party seems to be strong candidates. I'm still shocked they pushed Crist.
