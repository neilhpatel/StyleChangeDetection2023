The city is very strict with how landlords handle security deposits. It seems your potential landlord is in violation of multiple clauses.
First, it's legal for HOAs to have restrictions on renters and require approvals if it's in their CC&Rs. This is most often a credit score requirement and/or clean background check (where this is legal). If the HOA had a requirement that the landlord did not meet or exceed when qualifying you, that is the landlord's fault, and entering into a lease agreement with you is dubiously legal. For safety the approval process on the HOA's side should have been completed after the security deposit, but before you signed the lease agreement.
The issue gets a little murkier if you were turned down for a non-financial reason. Frankly, I'm struggling to think of a reason that a landlord would not be reasonably expected to know and communicate to you. (EDIT: I am assuming here that you acted in good faith throughout the process, but one exception would be if the HOA found something you did not accurately represent to the landlord.).
You need to find out why you were denied, obtain in writing exactly what it would have taken for the HOA to approve you (in case there's some wishy-washy reasoning being given to you), and compare that to what your landlord required. Armed with that information, you can write a (polite) demand letter for your entire security deposit due to any discrepancies, as the lease was offered to you in bad faith. If the landlord refuses, you will want to seek the help of a local tenant's rights organization (there are several which cover Chicago); this hotline () should be able to help you out with referral to a lawyer if that's necessary.
Also, under the Chicago municipal code regarding landlord/tenant issues, you would likely be entitled to attorney's fees, so it may be worthwhile to consult with a Chicago landlord/tenant attorney.
