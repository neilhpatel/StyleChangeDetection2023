In Maine we are actually arguing that it is, and working to pass legislation to protect your biometric data. We also already passed a bill limiting the use of facial recognition by LE.
As for LE not using facial recognition... I can see monitoring it because the police have been misusing it constantly like it is some magic tool that can auger the identity of a person from a grainy screen cap.
Also, your face is not "private information" protected by the fifth amendment. It is a publicly available data point that we each present to the world when we are in public, and if the technology is properly applied it would do a much better job of detecting and flagging potential malefactors than our current TSA security theatre is able to do.
But your face is literally your primary social signature to the world. We don't all go around wearing masks covering our faces to keep them private, we have them out so that people we have met can identify us. There is no rational reason to proclaim that a person's face is private biometric data.
I can see biometric data like one's genetics, health records, retinal scan, or even finger prints being classified as sensitive private data that cannot be collected without cause.
