The law does not appear to reference the depth of the water as an element to the charge. Unless you find that paddle board does not meet Wisconsin's definition of 'boat' then it appears that that law was broken.
Pretty common amongst boating laws to require a life jacket per occupant on-board so Iâ€™m not surprised that the same goes for paddle boarding, kayaking, etc.
The only relevant part is that you did not understand the requirement for a life jacket on a paddle board. While ignorance of the law (vague as it is) is not a valid excuse, it may help you if you go to court and take a newly purchased life vest with you. The judge may reduce the charge or fine. The other possibility is that the game warden doesn't show up, in which case your ticket should be dismissed.
Actually a citation means you are responsible to pay or appear in court. Many people are scared to death to go to court, but it's really not that bad. I think this is a good case where going to court would be worthwhile, if the OP has the circumstances.
It's not a good or legal argument. The officer's conduct does not negate him violating the law in the first place.
He could have brought him closer to shore where it risked beaching his vessel, getting his prop caught up in vegetation.
