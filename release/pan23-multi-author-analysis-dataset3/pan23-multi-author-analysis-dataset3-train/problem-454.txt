I’d love to have some sources on this wonderful answer, and I also have a follow up? Based on your answer, is it fair to sum up your answer as “Uncle Tom was super important, but once the black community reached a certain level of lawful and social rights it was done with anything slavery, including a hero of the slave era”?
And in the 19th century, "Uncle Tom" did have a more neutral meaning; it's later on that the black community came to understand it differently. I think we have to be careful about projecting our own readings onto/into the text.
This seems a little less fair to sensitive readings of the actual text. I will say that I am not familiar with how turn-of-the-century black activists articulated their response to Uncle Tom, but the answers here, and including sections like this:
A simple analysis would say something like: under white colonial ideology, sure, Tom has feelings, which is important if the question "do black people actually feel?" is at stake, and sure Tom is polite, which again is only relevant if "are black people uncivilized?" is a sensible question, and ditto for Tom not being a pushover ("do my stereotypes include black people having no moral compass whatsoever, being conniving, useless, and so on?).
