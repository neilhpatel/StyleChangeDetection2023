You are missing the nuance. Russia claims things are false flags when they do something on purpose.
Why now, false flag? Mistake or intentional, or Russia used foreign rockets without their identification markers. Time to see where these missiles were from.
NATO: We have telemetry data showing the origin of these missiles. They were fired by Russian units operating in this area, here is the radar track.
They've only confirmed that it's a Russian-made missile, not who fired it. Ukraine uses Russian-made air defense missile systems, so it still can't be ruled out that it was one of theirs that went off course. There is also speculation that it could have been a missile fired by Russia but veered off course after being struck by a Ukrainian air-defense missile.
I was reading the missile in question was a s300 missile that could of been shot at a Russian missile but missed and landed in Poland. This is very strange statement as this hasn't happened before with the numerous missile attacks from Russia and none have landed before but the same goes with Ukraine air defence system.
