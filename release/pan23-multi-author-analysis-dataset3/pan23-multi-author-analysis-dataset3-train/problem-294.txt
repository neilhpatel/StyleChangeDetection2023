All the points you made certainly hurt the Republicans, but they still lost a lot of winnable seats by running super unpopular candidates. What is maybe more important is that these candidates are all in a social media pissing contest on who can get in a twitter fight with AOC and make the next news cycle. So they are incentivized to be as loud and publicly crazy as possible.
DeSantis was canny enough to implement some broadly popular policies early on and use COVID to distance himself from Trump. Ran against a weak candidate and absolutely trounced him.
The smartest political move Kemp has ever made was not going down with the Trump election denier ship and beat a strong candidate in Abrams.
Which would baffle me because Kemp obliterated Stacy Abrams in the same election. If the election was stolen, how did Kemp win over Abrams then? Wouldn't the dems want to steal the governor position too, not just a senator?
Just thinkâ€¦..people got in their cars and drove to the polls to vote for H. Walker, a man spectacularly unfit to hold the office of a US Senator. I bet the majority were white Christians. Cult?
