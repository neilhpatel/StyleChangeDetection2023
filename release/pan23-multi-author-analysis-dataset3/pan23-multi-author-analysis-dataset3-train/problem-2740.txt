I'm not sure how to go about convincing the jail. The DA, your County Counsel, or legal counsel for the sheriff's office might all be able to explain it to them. Whether you can convince any of those people to make a phone call, I don't know.
I don't think you can refuse in-person service. Again, I think this comes back to the jail being idiots. They should know better. Is this a really tiny county where they don't do this all the time?
Have you tried paying for civil service by the sheriff's office in the county where the jail is? Many sheriff's offices have a civil service unit that serves papers and subpoenas.
In Texas is it the county constable you will hire to serve the papers. Just call the county you live in (or more specifically where she is) and they will tell you how to do it and the fee. Worked in Texas jails, inmates are served all the time.
In order to someone in jail in Texas, you first have to have the constable (or sheriff in some places) serve them. If they won't accept you then have to mail the papers to them in jail. This is what the internet, the jail and the constable told me. She wouldn't accept the service from them so I mailed the papers. This is where the trouble started, since there is no contact order in place the jail will not accept correspondence to her from me. I did call them to explain it was just divorce papers and I'm not trying to get her to call me or write back but it didn't work.
Why does the divorce papers have to come from you. If she cannot get mail from you have someone else mail them to the jail. Process servers serve divorce papers so have one mail them to her.
