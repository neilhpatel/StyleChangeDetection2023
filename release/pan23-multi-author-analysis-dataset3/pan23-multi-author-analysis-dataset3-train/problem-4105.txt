Nonresident aliens can't hold a stake in an S Corp. So you're really between an LLC and a C Corp if that's the case.
You can always elect to have the LLC TAXED as a C-Corporation. Converting it to an actual corporation can always be done, but is easier in some states than others. (Some states have a conversion statute, to allow for it. In others, you'd form a corporation and merge the two.).
Ok, so first of all recognize that you don't pay taxes based on where your entity is formed, but on where its operations are. You don't avoid paying taxes in California by forming your entity in Wyoming (or Delaware or.....). In addition, you may have to pay sales taxes where your customers are located.
Secondly, you should discuss with with a CPA. We don't know enough about your finances to tell you how to structure your entity. On first blush, I'd form an LLC, either in California or Delaware (depending on who all was involved and their various relationships to each other), and have it taxed as a partnership. But, that advice could be wrong for you, depending on your circumstances.
