Man brotha, they wanna make state sanctioned camps to concentrate the homeless in. let that sink in.heres a to the nashville thread. They have also made homelessness a felony too. Oh and criminalized "public drag and cabaret, are refusing federal funds for HIV/AIDS, planning to refuse federal education money bc "it tests too much.".
Because it is. That's why they're not bothering to offer any actual policy positions or programs aimed at solving problems: that's the kind of stuff political parties do in a democracy. "Give us the power to govern and this is our plan to improve things." is how you pitch to your voters if you want to get elected; you convince voters that your vision of governance is superior to the opposition's.
The GOP isn't interested in democracy: they don't care to govern, they simply demand to rule. What we're seeing with DeSantis, Abbott, et al, is the Republicans telling us what they want: obeisance, compliance, and subjugation. They're not trying to improve anyone's lives, they're trying to force their narrow, regressive, fascist bullshit on everyone else because they want to.
The GOP is a fascist organization and it represents the greatest threat to the Republic since the Confederacy.
