You are correct. You cannot be (eta: successfully, see comment by /u/toxicostrich91 below) sued for a review based on a truthful impression, under the CRFA. You could be sued for defamatory statements.
All in all, if it is a false statement causing something or someone reputable harm it is defamatory. The key element here is that it must be false and must cause reputable harm.
It is not what is stated that makes it defamatory but the fact that the added in part is a negative lie which makes it defamatory.
It wouldn't be defamatory if it is suspected, but it can be defamatory if you are lying when you are saying you suspect it and that lie damages their reputation.
Opinions aren't facts but depending how they are told it can be misinterpreted as one, and as long as it is clearly stated it is an opinion than it usually isn't defamatory. Though there can be cases where someone lies and tells a false opinion which is defamatory but is very hard to prove.
Truth is an absolute defense to defamation and the onus is on them to prove that what you claim is false or likely false (remember, civil court is 50% or preponderance of evidence).
To be successful in a suit, they would have to prove that you lied with either willful malice or at the very least reckless disregard for the truth. The burden of proof lies with them. Many companies threaten to sue people who leave bad reviews, very few go through with it and almost none win. If you do decide to repost the review, you should definitely include the fact that the business threatened to sue over it, as that is a massive red flag for any prospective clients.
