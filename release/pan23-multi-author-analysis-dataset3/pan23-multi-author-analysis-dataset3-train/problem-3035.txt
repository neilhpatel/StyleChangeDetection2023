The GOP won't have to blackmail or strongarm President Pigshit if any of the criminal cases he might be facing end the way they rightfully should. And oddly, that may be the endgame much of the GOP wants to see after he's lost them 3 election cycles.
The only way this is different is if the GOP has finally realized Trump is a loser and will continue to cause them to lose. They can stand bullying, name-calling, selfishness, treason, etc., but they can't stand losing. But even if they realize this I don't see any easy way out because of his base.
I think you underestimate Trump's selfishness and disloyalty to anyone other than himself. He cares about Trump and that is it. If DeSantis wins he will still undoubtedly run as a third party and take his 10-20% MAGA base with him, even if he knows it will doom Republicans. Because in his mind it would just be punishment to Republicans for rejecting him. Trump is only your ally as long as you help him, but the second you show the slightest inkling of going against him you become public enemy number 1. Just look at his attacks on DeSantis and Youngkin and they haven't even done anything yet!
Yeah I have a feeling if Trump announces and starts seeming like the frontrunner they will all fall back in line. Since 2016 Trump has had low points where it looks like the GOP may split from him (2018 midterms, 2020 election, January 6th, etc), but within a few weeks he always seems to get everyone back because he has a stranglehold on 30-50% of the GOP voter base who would walk off a cliff for him. Now if DeSantis or someone else is able to put up a challenge or even win the nomination, I think the party gets split. Trump will be on the ticket in 2024 no matter what.
