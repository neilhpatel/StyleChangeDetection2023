Thanks for your question. I'm not sure I am the right guy to be answering it. And even less sure how Switzerland's democracy can be of any help to the rest of the world. As it's quiet peculiar, and developed organically through out seven hundred years. I'm no social scientist and even less of a political expert. So I'll try to answer it as a normal Swiss citizen in my forties, with the similarities and differences I see with other countries...That being said, take my opinion well as an opinion with also a huge grain of salt....
LOL. And how are the people gonna do that when all of their media, including social media, politicians, etc. literally brainwash them into divisions, polarization, rugged individuality, etc.?
Lmao. The UK returning with all the previous benefits would have to come at a moment of crisis. It is not likely at all. But you are very perceptive regarding the French.
But knowing the French, and how their twisted mind works. I'm pretty sure they took that as an insult. Indeed it was humiliating and very sobering to have to depend so much on a once former main adversary or even enemy. So, as a typical French, Charles de Gaulle made sure that the UK repaid its debt of having insulted his and that of his government's honor by helping them in times of great need, thus by showing how superior the Brits were to the French. I'm sure he enjoyed the two vetoes to heavily delay UK's entry into that European club...
