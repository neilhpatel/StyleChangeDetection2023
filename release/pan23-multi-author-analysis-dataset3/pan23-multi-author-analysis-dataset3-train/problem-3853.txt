Well there was the ad where he said Pennsylvania is sick, and then turned dramatically to the camera and took off his glasses and was like "But I have the cure.".
Well yeah.. I asked for any current policies AND the other person's comments were related to how they feel NOW. So, yeah. I was straight up asking what the current right wing policies were to someone who right now stated they hold some right wing views.
You're conflating the right wing views today as what has always been. I'm 31 and a fiscally conservative person. Republicans haven't represented that notion in decades as you've mentioned by benefitting the wealthy class.
This is something most Americans look over. I'm 31 and never in my life has a third party really had a shot. It's been incredibly obvious they have no support because of donations from corporations and private interest groups. Most independents can hardly afford to show up. Ad campaigns? Forget about it. The disparity in wealth in this country has all but guaranteed no grass roots efforts pass the buck.
But even so, Democrats have never come close to my ideals of fiscal responsibility. And if they've proposed as much they havent acted on it. When people say they lean this way or that way in their values they are evaluating themselves historically as well as currently. But your assessment only accounts for right now. I hope this helps.
