No such a time ever existed. When Ford was rolling out Shermans he did so because he had a paid government contract to do so, same with Chrysler, Boeing, and every other defense contractor in WWII.
Is there any precedent for manufacturers/defence contractors supplying the US military and allies and having to cover expenses out of their own funds?
Why is SpaceX being singled out as a supplier that needs to supply Ukraine out of their own company funds?
SpaceX is not paid for by government subsidies, SpaceX is paid for by winning public contracts open to all private companies. SpaceX's responsibilities to the US government are about the same as the contractor you hired to build you a house, and that is to provide a service for an agreed price, and not much else.
I've read nothing to suggest that the service provision cost (plus some of the end terminals, especially those that arrived early on) is being paid for, rather than being covered by SpaceX.
SpaceX was charging Ukraine’s military $2,500 a month to keep each of the 1,300 units connected, pushing the total cost to almost $20 million by September, the person briefed on the matter said. Eventually, they could no longer afford to pay, the person said.
