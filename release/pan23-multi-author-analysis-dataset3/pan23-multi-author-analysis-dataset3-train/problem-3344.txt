You hit the nail on it's head. After the turkish election is done with we can see their real 'issues'. If the US and rest of NATO is completely powerless in front of Turkey then it severely hampers their credibility and raises questions about their 'unity'. It's in the west's interest for that to not happen. That and the fact that Finland & Sweden joining helps secure the baltics for basically free.
I wonder if the rest of NATO minus Turkey could write up a be deal with Sweden and Finland in. Identical to the rest of the NATO treaty.
Basically two overlapping alliances. Kinda like how the USA has other alliances outside NATO with Japan, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, and I'm sure many more.
If the US, France, Germany, Britain, etc... Just sign security agreements with the Baltic countries, it would achieve similar goals of isolating Russia. Putin and Erdogan can call it whatever they like.
And there isnt anything stopping all the other countries from making unilateral alliances with Finland and Sweden.
True, but up till now they’re trying to do Finland and Sweden’s ascension the right way, which ultimately strenhens NATO.
Going down this route though could mortally wound NATO as an alliance or reduce its attractiveness and effectiveness over the long run.
If Turkey is unreasonable and won’t budge, than a Baltic/Europe alliance isn’t out of the question and could ultimately achieve the same thing without Turkey’s involvement. There’s nothing to stop a country from being part of more than one alliance.
While Erdogan can be frustrating to deal with diplomatically, unfortunately the geopolitical situation forces NATO into a position that we need Turkey to continue to control the Straits of Bosporus and Russian access to the Med.
