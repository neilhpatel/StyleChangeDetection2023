lmao really grasping at straws with this one CNN. Did anyone actually read the article? The parts being found ranger from GPS modules to ubiquitous and undefined "semiconductors". How the fuck are we supposed to ensure that consumer grade microchips and modules do not find their way to Iran?
2) Most people in this comment section did not read the article, and are thinking the US military industrial complex is sending Iran full military parts for drones when it is commercial parts.
Then that means that the US can theoretically halt or slow down the production of Iranian attack drones by blocking exports from those companies or at least just tracking where it goes or something.
I guess maybe "Components from US companies unknowingly used in Iranian drones" to try to drive home that fact. Someone reading only the headline could still walk away thinking that the companies had sold directly to Iran but are just claiming they didn't know their components would be used for drones; which is already the problem with the current headline. "Components from US companies used in Iranian drones; Iran likely obtained components through 3rd party sellers" works I guess but its not a very clean headline.
You mean to tell me that Iran has been ordering parts, products, and pieces, from shell companies and foreign nationals of theirs in other nations, and then shipping the components or products back to Iran for production into their drones?
To answer your comment more directly, they never say in the article that we can/should be able to prevent Iran from getting their hands on these components entirely. In fact they even directly state that is not the goal of government agencies, the goal is to make it more difficult and more costly to do so therefore reducing their ability to produce these weapons. To me thats a pretty reasonable take.
