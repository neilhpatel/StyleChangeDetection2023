We can already see president Xi making more dramatic moves and everyone knows he wants Taiwan. I do think war is preventable, but something miraculous will have to fall into China's lap to keep them preoccupied.
My point being, I don’t envision China being a threat for decades upon decades to come, they’re likely on a bell curve of sorts - of course, this might stir them up into desperate action.
If China wasn't actively threatening and provoking all of its neighbors they wouldn't be so united against it. "China is for actual defense" is a joke.
You might want to read up into what China is doing in the South China Sea and the nine-dash line because you're missing quite a bit of information. And ignoring that the only reason that North Korea is flinging nuclear-capable missiles over South Korea and Japan is Chinese funding. Those are clearly provocative and threatening actions and even all that ignores the wolf-warrior diplomatic core.
We all realize that. Unfortunately Taiwan becoming a territory of either side is an existential threat to the other, so if either side goes in the other must.
Only "neighbor" China threatens is Taiwan which US and China agree is part of China since 1949 when US installed Chiang regime in Taiwan and planned to use it for invasion of China while claiming Taiwan was the official government of all China.
A waste of money for US and a reason for China's military, as equally enamored of money and weapons as US military to build more.
China's military buildup would be justified by US military planners if roles were reversed. US dials back its direct threats to China, China military has less legit claim to military buildup and China can spend more on schools, railroads, solar power, hospitals as could US.
US needs to dial down it's threats to China, the 100 encircling military bases in Korea, Japan, Philippines.
