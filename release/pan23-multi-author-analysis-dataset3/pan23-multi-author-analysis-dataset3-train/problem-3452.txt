Mastercard and Stripeâ€™s financial partners have regulations about what products and services cannot be processed on their networks and a violation of these regulations is subject to substantial fines. Examples of violations include selling copyrighted products without authorization or selling pharmaceuticals without proper verification.

MasterCard likely does have the authority to charge you fees, for instance if you are responsible for transactions that have to be reversed. They may call them fines, but MasterCard isn't a court of law, so all they're doing is trying to collect money from you under the agreements you have with them through Stripe.
