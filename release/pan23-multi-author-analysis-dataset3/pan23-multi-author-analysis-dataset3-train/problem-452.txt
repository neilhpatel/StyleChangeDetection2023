"His “macabre” approach to the pandemic, including organising large gatherings of his supporters and disparaging scientists, constitutes a “crime against public health”. Some 65 others are also implicated and could face criminal proceedings.".
So why are you defending this huge piece of shit? Why are you pretending that he's a good person? Where's your argument that he's a good person worth defending?
It's no wonder you defend him tooth and nail even when he's committed so many atrocities. You're not mentally equipped to see the many terrible things he's done.
Well this will be an unpopular comment, but by in large, he's equally bad but just in different ways. Bolsanaro did some good, but a lot of bad, and Lula really is the same...only the topic changes.
And no, I'm not a Bolsanista nor am I far right. I'm a foreigner living here long enough to have seen both sides rule... They're "same same, but different".
Lula is a far better public speaker than Bolsanaro, and far less aggressive, this helps his public perception, but the changes he makes are not all amazing. Additionally he gets favourable press since Bolsanaro took away a lot of completely unnecessary and grossly expensive public grants to some of Brazil largest media houses. Not sure if Lula is giving them back, but I'm sure he's being asked to.
