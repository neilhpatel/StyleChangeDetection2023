I think it's a variety of reasons. First, accumulating wealth is evidence of your success. Second, a corporation is there to maximize profits (i.e. increase stock price) for the shareholders so a CEO is restricted by that -- he would have to show that increasing wages will increase profits. Third, donating to charity brings more status than paying your workers a little more. Fourth, they probably see donating to charity as more useful because it goes to help those most in need in a way that the donor feels most align with their vision.
OK? But The Gates Foundation does great charity work. You make it sound bad that they are donating their money to a good charity just because it's their own charity.
Why wouldn't you donate to your own charity if you know everyone running it and you agree with the mission?
Paying a damily member through said charity -is- a thing though. If Ol' Daddy Warbucks makes obscene income anf pays the highest rate of taxes on it, and his daughter doesn't have a job, he can have her greet guests at his Foreign Legionnaire's Dinner, and then pay her 100k per year to do so. That's a write off since it's a charity expense, but she only pays the income tax at the rate a person making 100k does. Doesn't matter thst he also let's her use the family house in Martha's Vineyard and the family super-yacht.
A surprising amount of super wealthy people have very low incomes because most of their assets are tied up in trusts. So giving someone a nothing job can be a way of essentially deducting the 'walking around money' that someone gets. But that isn't unique to charities, Trump pays Ivanka and considers it a business expense. Family run enterprises do things like this often, although the amount of actual 'work' expected varies from family to family.
