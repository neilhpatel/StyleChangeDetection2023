And then when we decided we wanted nuclear subs, instead of just buying existing french designs, we fucked them over and bought US subs.
Oh and those French subs were originally nuclear subs that Australia insisted on modifying to diesel.
Sure, but one of the reasons the French subs were taking so long, and costing so much, was because australia was asking France to modify their nuclear design to conventional power.
Now, you might be able to argue the French were correct that Australia wouldn't cut its losses and terminate the contract if the nuclear sub deal wasn't on the cards. However, it's hardly the fault of Australia if it makes the desire to seek alternative options known and another viable option is presented.
It's safe to say you don't understand the American defense industry if you are making this comment. The only concerning barrier is how quickly Australia can acquire the trained workforce to operate the nuclear submarines.
At the end of the day, nuclear submarines are much more suited to future warfare and the types of seas surrounding Australia.
