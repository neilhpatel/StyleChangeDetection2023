Many people don't have exposure to this kind of footage. After all, this is the first time it's been filmed in US pig slaughterhouses. So I daresay once more people start witnessing the horrors that animals endure, and more of their social networks go vegan, the more likely it is to become dominant among a majority of people.
Even better, don't slaughter and eat them in the first place! So many vegan alternatives available now, we really need to move away from our addiction to animal slaughter.
So if anybody comes up with a solution for this, then you really made a change and maybe saved some percents of animals from being born and raised for meat.
They are bred and rises in factories, they don’t know any better life? Why can’t vegans just keep eating their grass and leaves, while leaving the rest of the world alone. Everytime slaughterhouses will come with a more humane solution to kill them, there will be voices saying ohh no, that’s not right they still suffer, eat meat grown in labs….
Animal testing, in-breeding for profit, abuse against animals that have a basic understanding of freedom…i also stand against shit like this. I only buy eggs from free-range hens because they live more humane lives. I would also do the same if I had the chance to buy less cruel obtained meat.
There is a choice you go by the local butcher and pay tripple the price for 'good meat' or go to the shop for cheap meat. I'm a cheapass so i go to the normal shops hh. A middleground would be nice i guess.
