Now, we can’t tell you whether this one company will decide to actually go through with it. But they can do it.
Credit card issuers may choose not to sue because they instead sell the unpaid debts to collections agencies. It’s faster for them and saves them legal costs. However, that is purely a business decision on their part but they do have the legal right to sue.
IANAL- not only can they file suit, they will win and be granted a judgement. If the collection agency has lawyers on staff (most do) they file these suits all day every day, so it’s no extra work for them. And you will be charged for collection fees/lawyer fees on top of the debt you owe.
Of course they want you to pay your debt; that's not a scam. If you "Regularly default" as you say and you've never received a phone call about it, consider yourself very fortunate in that specific regard.
If you're unsure if the person you're talking to has the authority to settle your debt or arrange a payment plan, you can always call the lending institution and ask about repayment. They may give you the phone number of the people that have been calling you and that would settle your concern.
Also I keep calling the company which has a 12 digit contact number. Had to experiment and delete two digits for it to work…but every time I call I either have to press 1 or 2 as an option….it’s rings for 15 seconds and then plays the menu again….does that all the time.
