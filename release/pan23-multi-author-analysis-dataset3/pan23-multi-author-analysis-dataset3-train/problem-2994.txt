Damn, if those employees are so vital to the economy you'd think the "pro-union" Democrats would give them at least one unpaid sick day.
For sure, but personally I would respect the democrats a lot more if they were willing to hold the economy hostage to make sure people who are so critical to the economy could get a fucking sick day.
Why would you assume republicans wouldn't support a combined bill? The gop is run by wallstreet and a rail shutdown would crater the stock market. Republicans would vote for a bill with sick leave and they cry that them democrats played dirty.
And then when the economy crashes right before Christmas I bet you would blame Democrats too. I don't think 99% of the people commenting here understand how much gas would skyrocket if the rail lines shut down. I work in that field and you would be seeing $7 a gallon in no time. Of course I wanted to get the sick days for rail workers, but commenters like you are part of the problem on where the blame should go.
Pretty sure unpaid sick leave is the thing they wanted most because it allows them to not worry about being fired or getting sick. The unions that contain a majority of the workers all voted no for this deal, so they could still strike (since we havenâ€™t heard otherwise yet).
