Pathetic, they abandoned their supposedly-precious principles for money. What would their god think?!
Great. Threat of losing EU money or whatever else is the driver, doesn't matter - this is progress. Really glad for the people in Poland who will be less discriminated against thanks to this.
Not trying to defend some of the anti-gay sentiment in Poland, that hopefully changes. But Poland like most Europe is extremely religious.
Point is that western countries force their ideology and intrest on Poland. It doesn't matter how Poland joined or if it can leave. Imperialism is imperialism anyway.
Wrong as usual. I said nothing like that. For a person spamming dozen of links for whole articles reading and understanding few lines I arote shouldn't be a problem for you. Or maybe you just blatantly lie? Which is it?
BS. That's no democracy. That's just popularity contest where winner has no obligation to own voters. It's just blatant propaganda made by these corrupt liars. Polish (similar to many other western countries) people have virtualy no real power over politics.
Polish corrupt politicians choose that but it's typical imperialist trick to buy local leaders and pretend it's all their choosing and you falll for that.
