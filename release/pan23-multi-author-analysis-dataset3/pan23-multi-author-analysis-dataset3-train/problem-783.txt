Russia using nukes wouldn't be to help them win a war against NATO, it's to make sure NATO also loses. Also, if NATO intervention is the only thing keeping Russia from nuking Ukraine, Russia would have no incentive to not use them if NATO is intervening anyways, either through Article 5 or a no fly zone.
If a fighter is shot down, then that's the red line, NATO would have to intervene at some point, especially if it comes from belarus, go clean up all those launchers and see how russia reacts.
And S400 SAMs stationed in Belarus could easily target NATO fighters trying to enforce a no-fly zone in Western Ukraine.
They could extend NATO air defence zone into Ukraine and declare the right to shoot down missiles inside of it. Russia started a shooting war in Ukraine if it wasn't for that there would be no missiles landing in Poland.
The bombers firing these weapons don't need to be anywhere near to Ukraine to attack every target in Ukraine or even in Poland. What would a no-fly zone in Western Ukraine help against that?
