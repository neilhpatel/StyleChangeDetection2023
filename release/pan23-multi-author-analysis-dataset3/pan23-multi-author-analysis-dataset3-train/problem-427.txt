Sounds like there might very well be meat to those accusations, if she literally physically abused him in front of you with no provocation (and no, ignoring someone is not a provocation. You can't go around punching people if they refuse to talk to you, adult or otherwise. The action is actually more heinous, not less, when it involves a child).
Unless you never want to have a relationship with your (soon to be) adult son, not to mention possibly face up to felony charges yourself for child endangerment.
If you don't take steps to protect your son from her, you will face consequences for protecting your son's abuser.
Protecting your kid from your wife's abuse is your legal responsibility. A protection from abuse order for your son is the minimum. Consult with a lawyer to see if there are other specific actions you need to take to protect your legal relationship with him. Your wife also needs a lawyer, but that's her problem.
You and your wife need to have a talk. She needs to leave the home -- or you and your son do -- immediately. This is going to get reported to CPS. The only question is if you do it -- which may help the situation and lead to help, therapy, and reunification -- or if someone else does. If you're divorced, consult with the lawyer who handled it or get a referral from them. This is serious. Not only is your wife in criminal jeopardy, but you are at risk of losing your son.
