Sounds to me like they don’t want to use their sick time for this purpose. I don’t see why an employee would have to take sick time to make a full 8 hour day as opposed to just opting not to be paid for those 4 hours but then again I’m no pro on nys employment law either. I think maybe the employer is confusing needing to allow time off due to the vaccine with requiring the use of that persons pto/sick time.
This is probably going to depend on the companies sick time policy. If they have the policy that sick time must be used if it’s available and it’s applied unilaterally there’s nothing to be done. If they allow people to take time off with the option of not using sick time then there’s something funky here and maybe there’s a case to claw back that sick time if the employer is allowed to claw back the 4 hours of pay.
Did she negotiate with the employer and get approval to work overtime/make up the hours in lieu of using sick time for actually taking off work for being sick?
If she took 4 hours off because she was sick, it only makes sense that the employer require her to use her paid sick time for that.
An employer is free to require use of sick leave for any hours missed, even if it results in them paying for more than 40 hours of pay. As long as your fiancee is paid overtime for any hours over 40 in the week that are worked, and regular time for any other hours over 40 (which it sounds like is happening), no laws are being broken.
I'm not seeing the issue here -- she's being paid for all hours she actually worked (plus applicable overtime), plus the 4 hours she took off being sick. Am I missing something?
