Lived in a few other states,the answer to your question is Nope. Taxes in Texas translate to zero to little improvements. On the other hand,if you like driving around with no insurance and expired paper plates. This could be the state for you. The amount of traffic enforcement is laughable. The police have ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù things to do üòÇ. Get ready to pay outrageous property tax,sales tax. Thank all the uninsured drivers that have little to no chance of being caught by police,for high car insurance rates.
No, the bigger surprise is auto insurance rates. Homeowners insurance premiums are still reasonable if you don't insist on waterfront/adjacent coastal property or in a flood zone. Property tax isn't exorbitantly high compared to many other states. But auto insurance? significantly higher. And it's absolutely warranted. People can't drive for shit here.
Yikes. Mine (about $2200 a year) is on a $600k home, 3 miles from the coast in Brevard. Including flood insurance even though it's not required.
You hear far more about the people paying astronomical home insurance premiums than you do about those of us with reasonable home insurance premiums.
Location has a lot to do with it. Want to live walking distance from the ocean? Of course your premiums are going to be sky-high. Ok with living a 10 minute drive away? Your premiums are more likely to be reasonable -- as mine are ($2176/yr including not-mandated flood insurance).
