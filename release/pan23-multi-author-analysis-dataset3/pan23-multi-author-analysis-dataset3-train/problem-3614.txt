The first step would be stop breaking the speed limit. It doesn’t matter how safe you think you are or everyone does it.
Some areas do allow a restricted/ hardship license but they won’t do that if you’re continually doing what they suspended the license for in the first place.
Do you or do you not not have valid plates for your vehicle, do you or do you not drive without being properly licensed to do so, and/or do you or do you not exceed the speed limit frequently?
Speed limit signs are usually posted conspicuously just about everywhere, and when they're not, the written law itself usually has default speed limits for different types of roads.
The hard truth is that if you cannot afford to properly license and register your vehicle, then that vehicle cannot be on the road, period. Public transportation, if available in your area, would likely be the legal alternative.
The fact that you didn't realize -- presumably on multiple occasions -- is largely irrelevant (or, very relevant, depending on how you look at it). You're basically demonstrating to the courts, over and over, that you don't pay attention while driving, and that's dangerous.
