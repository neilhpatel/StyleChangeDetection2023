Paradoxically, the late Middle Ages were a moment when the factors mostly associated with it (castle lordships, vassallatic service, holy wars, enclosed economies, etc.) had either changed deeply or disappeared entirely. When Tywin Lannister and Robb Stark yell "raise the bannermen" in a XVI century society by customs and dresses, would have received a big, fat "f\\k you" when requesting their retainers to go to war for free, when it had become standard hiring soldiers and even one's own knights behind a regular contract and salary. This, by the way, was gotten right when Stannis Baratheon raises an army of his vassals through money he borrowed from the Golden Bank (another very common practice for kings from the 1300s onwards).
Perhaps as a professional deviation, I've recently attempted some alternate timeline short stories and some attempts at historical novels, because I feel there can be much to be explored if earlier periods of history (I was doing a lot of research on AD 950 Normandy and VIII century Lombard Italy) both with "what ifs" and planned used of folklore without fantasy actualization.
In that sense denouncing The Witcher as anachronistic is a bit misleading, most fantasy works are anachronistic beyond belief, there's mythical creatures originated from celtic, germanic folklore smashed in something that closely resembles the french or the english high middle ages, and also literacy rates are high even among the poorest possible farmers, remember that writing fantasy is writing, most stuff is just whatever the author choose to put in their stories and just roll with it as if nothing was going on. Also now thinking of it, a lot of castles are built inspired on 19th century revival architecture, or not, it depends on the author for how it goes. Sometimes they're so anachronistic even for the contemporary perceptions of common sense, where else than in a videogame a poor farmer with malnutrition and a wooden club is a 1:1 match to a professional soldier wielding 17th century weaponry?
