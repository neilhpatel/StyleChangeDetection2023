No worries! It's been all over FB lately, especially with vehicles and trailers. Semi-professional photo, cheap price (they seem to be getting smarter and going for "good deal" and not insanely cheap), "email this address for more info", and some story about how they're out of town, overseas, moving soon, had to escape an abusive relationship, friend's cat's brother's plant died.... And have to sell it quickly but can't handle the deal themselves.
The truck doesn't exist. They'll want you to send the money to an "escrow" company and then they'll send you the paperwork and have the truck delivered since that is cheaper than delivering it overseas. You'll send the money and never hear from anyone again.
Maybe they convince you to send them money then ghost you. Maybe they convince you "whoops, we lost the title, don't worry we'll send it to you" then they never do, and you find out the truck is title jumped or belongs to one of their other military buddies who shipped out, or they took out a title loan on it and you can't sue them because of the SCRA.
If they'll send you a VIN number (which might even be the actual VIN of the truck !) you can check to see if it's been reported stolen:
Most things that are too good to be true are scams, and Facebook Marketplace is among their most common sources.
