Title: I had a pre employment drug screening hair follicle that came out positive for the use of cocaine with Disa, I do not use any type of drugs or take any medication, I took another test with a different clinic and came out negative...cont.
I work for this company most of the time, i work on the plants, and like i said on the post I dont consume any type of drugs, in this case cocaine I had the 2 tests with disa come out positive (same hair sample) and another one with a different clinic different sample that came out negative, the only valid one they say is the sample they have, should i just accept what they tell me and take the program? Even tho i dont consume drugs?
I have worked with them before, but everytime we go to a different jobsite we go thru the process of pre employment for the different plants drug screening training etc. I was going thru this pre employments drug screening with this result, and now like i said lost the job opportunity on this jobsite and iam suspended for 30 days with the company.
commenting on this months later because i’m scared of this situation… so you failed a drug test with disa, then you did the RTD program, it’s been over 30 days so are you working again?
