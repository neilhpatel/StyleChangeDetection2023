Designating a location as "holy" serves to provide the believers with motivation to fight for control of that location. This specific holy land happens to be a major hub for transferring goods & military forces between the mediterranean, the middle east and north Africa, and the more granular holy places such as Jerusalem, Hebron or Safed happen to be situated on tall mountains overlooking some of the major pathways in the region.
Of course holy sites are going to be in strategically important locations, if only because people are more likely to live in strategically important locations, so holy figures are probably more likely to do stuff there.
They're holy sites because lots of people lived there thousands of years ago. Lots of people lived there thousands of years ago because it's an important location. It's an important location because of geography.
I think you're right in a sense but we can go further, even if we aren't considering it from an agnostic standpoint rather than atheist.
