Technically, the Chinese (ROC) had the first escort carrier before Wight Brothers made their first flight. It was a commerical vessel that was laid down before the first flight, refit by the Japanese to be a seaplane tender, then like most of the Republican Navy, end up getting destroyed by Imperial Japanese Navy.
Then you are eliminating US Navy amphibious assault ships, Japanese helicopter destroyers, and possibly others from your definition of “aircraft carrier”?
Not a great example for Iran to use, but as long as helicopters, tilt rotors, and VTOL jets are around, then container ships will do in a pinch.
I’d love to know what technology Iran has put in their escort carrier that could even the odds against a US fleet carrier. The Gerald R Ford costs 5% of Irans GDP, more than they spend on their entire military budget. Hell, a Nimitz class is 3.8% and there’s 10 of them.
That “east” technology seems to be getting destroyed in Ukraine right now as well. Russia has the only fleet carrier in the east outside of China and it can’t get out of a dry dock for more than a few weeks.
