If are allowing her to have the keys and access to the car, as another person said, you're opening yourself up to serious risks of she has an accident. You need to get the keys and stop her from driving it by any (non violent or illegal) means necessary.
If she does give back the keys, don't let her have them again. It'll prevent this from happening each time you loan her the car, since there won't be any more loans, and without a valid license she shouldn't be behind the wheel anyway.
Not only are you putting yourself at legal risk every time you allow her to borrow the car, you are putting yourself at legal risk every time she gains access to it, with or without your permission. You know that she has taken the keys without permission before, and now that means you have to take extraordinary measures to prevent her from getting the keys again. Otherwise, it's the same as you giving her permission, if she crashes - it's your vehicle, you either gave her permission or didn't prevent her, AND you know she's unlicensed. You absolutely will be held liable, criminally and civilly.
I cannot emphasize enough how much you need to stop being complicit in her driving without a license in your vehicle, even if you don't care about anyone else on the road.
