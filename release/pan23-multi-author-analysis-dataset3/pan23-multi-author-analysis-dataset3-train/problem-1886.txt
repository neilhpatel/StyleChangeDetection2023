Not a lawyer. Rape charges take a long time and for good reason. The DA wants to get as much evidence as possible so they can have the highest chance of locking him up for a long time if he is found to be guilty by the jury (He is allowed to have a fair trial aswell). I'm so sorry this happened to your daughter.
First of all, I am really sorry that this happened to your daughter and the people who love her. The suggestions about therapy should be taken seriously, this isn't something anyone should try to process alone, even if it seems harder to reach out for help. It's terrible that they have to exist, but there are professionals who can really help not only her, but you and your family as well.
That being said, getting involved, contacting the alleged perpertrator, etc., can actually hurt the situation. The DA will contact you when they need something from you. They are very aware of when the statues would run out but it is a matter of years, not days. But once they charge, as said above, they have to move forward. The last thing they want is to find something out that could have helped their case AFTER the trial. Double jeopardy stops them from being able to charge a second time.
Court backlog is real (don't know where you live, I practice in AB, Canada), but once you charge you have to be pretty much completely ready to go. If you find out new information, and have to push trial dates, you risk the alleged going free (our Supreme Court has actually set hard caps on the amount of time you have).
