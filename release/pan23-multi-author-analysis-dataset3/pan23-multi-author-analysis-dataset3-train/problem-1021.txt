One thing I really want to point out is the current situation in Afghanistan parallels the Soviet withdrawal.
Long before the soviets came on scene though, Afghans were already being pulled in different directions. Afghanistan has always been a crossroads - it occupies strategic passes through the mountains that allow it to serve as a land conduit between Tibet, India, Persia and the Caucasus. In modern times that puts it between Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan/India. In addition to its own internal issues, Afghanistan's recent history since 1800 has been characterized by periods of competition between great powers. First the British Empire looking to curb Russian influence in Afghanistan but also with Persia. The result was three wars with Britain, with Russia and Iran both becoming involved - with all sides seeking to court Afghani tribes into helping tip the balance.
Would you argue that USA & pakistan are at fault for the crisis of Afghanistan,btw the reason US got involved as the do in every conflict was for their own interest.
