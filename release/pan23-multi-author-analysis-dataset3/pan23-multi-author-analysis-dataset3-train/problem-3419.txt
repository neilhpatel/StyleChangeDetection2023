There were definitely political and economic aspects to antislavery politics. I would go so far as to say the majority of opposition to slavery (or at least slavery's expansion) was political and economic in nature. Bona fide abolitionists\--properly defined in the 19th century as people who wanted not only the end of slavery, but enfranchisement of former slaves, were a small minority of Northerners (and were often disliked even by their Northern brethren). If you were to poll Northern residents about the morality of slavery, most would probably say it was "wrong," but they could shrug it off easily enough.
Is there any evidence of Northerners’ views on the morality of slavery, and is that evidence substantial enough to assert that most opposition to slavery was political and economic in nature?
You mention that, if polled, most Northerners would be opposed to slavery but could shrug it off easily enough — I’m not sure quite what you mean by that — and that the opposition to slavery was mostly political and economic in nature. But I don’t see evidence of public views on the morality of slavery to justify that claim.
That raises the question of why the slaveholders didn't do that. I'm aware of the ideology that only farming (with slaves on giant plantations) was a suitable occupation for a gentleman; still, there are limits to ideology. I would be surprised if the Southern elite were so monolithic that literally none of them would stoop to making money "in trade". So, why were there no slave-manned factories or mines? They don't even have to be in the North, there's presumably nothing stopping a younger son (who won't inherit the plantation but might get some startup capital) from buying a warehouse in Charleston or whatever, and making widgets there. Or maybe there were some enterprises like that, but they disappear among the much more numerous plantations?
