I’m on record being against settlements though I withhold that objection for East Jerusalem. We can discuss that specifically if you like but it’s somewhat irrelevant to this topic. Jews did not show up and start stealing Arab land. This is well documented, and it’s a cornerstone of the pro Palestinian argument even though it’s demonstrably false.
I’m far from an expert on those topics but I believe the annexation through war bit applies to offensive wars. Taking what would be considered a buffer zone in a defensive war is something different. And Israel didn’t place people in the settlements. It was their choice to go there. Many of the settlers are religious fanatics who believe the shit about God promising them the land. That land.
So you know nothing about the start of this conflict? Pity. I’ve already stated that that I’m against settlements excepting East Jerusalem, and at that only to a point. Beyond that I’ll stand next to you and criticize Israel and often have, but the claim that Jews showed up and stole land is false.
So you cannot legitimately state that Israel didn't steal land. They did, and still do to an extent.
