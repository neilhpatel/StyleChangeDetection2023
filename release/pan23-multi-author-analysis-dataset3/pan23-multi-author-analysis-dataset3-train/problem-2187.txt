But also he declassified them. Because sometimes you declassify Top Secret national secrets so that you can keep them as souvenir keepsakes, before they're planted by the FBI as part of a national archive hoax.
You want people to believe that the FBI somehow got their hands on the very documents that the National Archives later said that they did not ever receive, all for the purpose of subsequently planting them in your office (and into those folders)?
How would the FBI even get access to those documents, if the National Archives had them (or even if they say they never received them)? Are you suggesting that the National Archives was somehow in on a plot to frame you?
If any of what you say is true, then why didn't your lawyers offer up this simple explanation when the National Archives first wrote asking for the documents that they said that you didn't have (after all, you would have been alarmed to learn that the National Archives was saying that they didn't have the documents to the folders that you now say that you kept, while your lawyers were writing that you didn't have anything that belonged to the National Archives, correct)?
Of course this latest version is hogwash (as are all of the previous explanations), but the really fascinating question is whether he is so delusional that he really thinks that this story would scour (the signs of cognitive impairment), or whether he really thinks that people out there are that stupid so as to believe it (the signs of a sociopath). Take your pick.
