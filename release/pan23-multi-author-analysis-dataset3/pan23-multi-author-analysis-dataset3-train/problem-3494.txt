3. Bellamy, Absolute War, Figure 8.1 (180) for a map visualization of the echelon structure and the correlation of forces at the outbreak of the war. For a very detailed discussion on the force structure and the intended missions & behavior of these defensive forces, including a review of the Soviet doctrinal debate of 1929-1941 over the nature of the initial period of war, see Jacob Kipp, (Fort Leavenworth, KS: Soviet Army Studies Office, 1989).
1. See Mawdsley, Thunder in the East, Ch. 2, heading "The Element of Surprise" for brief discussion of the decision not to man the предполье or security zone. See also: Bellamy, Absolute War, 147-148 for discussion of the incomplete border preparations & the Zhukov/Timoshenko-Stalin debate over the force posture of the covering force and 151-163 for a detailed time breakdown of the 36 hours leading up to the invasion proper; acknowledging the weakness of citing Glantz in a discussion on whether or not Glantz is right, Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, Ch. 4; Glantz & House, When Titans Clashed, Ch. 3, heading "Soviet Planning"; and Gorodetsky, Grand Delusion, Ch. 6 & 13.
It is bedtime but I will pick up in the morning and address the broader question of "was the Red Army incompetent in general?" I think /u/white_light-king has already made the other point I was going to make, which is that Glantz is actually quite critical of Red Army failures, and is not at all hesitant to take the Soviet/Russian historiography to task for being itself too lenient on RKKA commanders & heroes like Zhukov. In fact, in some Russian-language amateur-history circles not unlike this subreddit, there is actually some animosity towards Glantz for what they see as typical American chauvinism and Cold War rhetoric.
Isn't Glantz's whole thrust with the 'forgotten battles' angle that the historiography has focused on the Soviet headline successes like Stalingrad, Kursk etc. while ignoring failures like Operation Mars, or am i misinterpreting his argument?
