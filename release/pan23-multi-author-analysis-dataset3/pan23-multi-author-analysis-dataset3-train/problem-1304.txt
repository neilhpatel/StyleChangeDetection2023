I think you and I are on the same team here. So far it doesn't look like it was malicious or done with intent, but if it gets investigated and it was proven that there was some intent then I wouldn't mind if he gets prosecuted.
So far, it doesn't appear that anything malicious has occurred; certainly nothing with criminal intent. But that's precisely why it's being investigated, as it should. I'm as liberal as they get and I fully support a rational investigation (read: special counsel, not some GOP revenge-fueled fishing expedition).
With what public information exists so far, I'm not terribly concerned with the Biden story because it looks like a genuine fuckup that, while not great, never resulted in unauthorized viewing of documents and received full cooperation upon discovery of the problem.
It’s obviously a scandal that it’s possible for top secret documents to walk off without anybody noticing, a problem that seems to span multiple presidential administrations. The problem with the Blockbuster comparison is that intentions are everything when your video tapes are late but they don’t keep you out of prison when it’s a matter of recklessness around national security. Regular people have gone to prison in recent years over taking home classified docs so they could work longer hours from home. Here’s just one of them:
These are not the same thing. One of them is perhaps irresponsible. The other is a deliberate attempt to steal classified documents by keeping them without permission after Trump was no longer entitled to have them. I'm not sure whether he intended to use them seditiously, but he definitely intended to keep them illegally.
