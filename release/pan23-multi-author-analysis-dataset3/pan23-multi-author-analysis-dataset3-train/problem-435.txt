When asked to return the gun to their vehicle before being helped they absolutely freaked out and started to verbally abuse my employees. Calling them sissies who were afraid of a gun. The video shows them repeated touching the weapon during their tirade, but never drawing it. Then slammed a door on their way out damaging a newly painted mural.
They preceeded to write Google reviews of my business on three review accounts, repeating word for word the arguments inside the business.
I run a business which doesn't allow guns on premises, and while I logically know some people are conceal carrying, we still actively post signage and enforce when needed. Recently a customer walked in with a gun on their hip, holstered but not snapped in or anything.
If someone is too paranoid to walk into Starbucks without a loaded firearm, my opinion is that they're too paranoid to be carrying a firearm in the first place.
these people carry a gun because they are paranoid that they'll need it when there is no perceived threat. well someone carrying a gun is a real threat, not perceived. plenty of people saw someone carrying a gun, thought nothing of it, then the person started shooting.
Alternatively, you could have a bunch of friends with guns and everyone vows to kill anyone who shoots any of the group. This is called a gang.
Yes that's how defending yourself with a gun works. You can't shoot bullets out of the air, you can only shoot the other person first.
