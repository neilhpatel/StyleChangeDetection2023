What else do you want to know? This is a very bad idea and you shouldn't do it. You should not buy a car from a private seller unless they have, at a minimum, a lien-free title in hand.
The issue is not whether a bill of sale is a valid contract (it might be or might not be, depending on who drafts it and what it says) the issue is enforcing it if there's a breach. And that can be very difficult and expensive. You can be stuck with a car with a lien on it that you can't register, which will be repossessed when the seller stops making payments, and no potentially no enforceable remedy.
This is a terrible idea and will backfire on you, and you'll likely end up with a car you do not own, that you can't insure, or drive, or sell, or get your money back for, and you'll end up in court and then chasing him for years to get your money back.
But it does: "you'll end up in court and then chasing him for years to get your money back." The document doesn't need to be notarized, but you're not buying anything. You're giving him money so he can lend you a car that you cannot insure or drive legally. But sure, the document would be "legally binding" like everything else that's legally binding: to the extent you're willing to sue to enforce it.
