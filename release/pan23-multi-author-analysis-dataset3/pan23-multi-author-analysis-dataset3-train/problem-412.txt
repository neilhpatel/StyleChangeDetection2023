So much this. California's primary election is on March 5th, 2024. Even if they announce 1/1/24, that gives them barely 60 days to campaign lol. I'm pretty sure the as well.
Yup. Most House Democrats and the overwhelming majority of California House Democrats voted against the Iraq War including Pelosi, Barbara Lee, and Maxine Waters. Another reason to dislike Schiff.
Secondly, even if Iraq had WMDs, toppling Saddam was a terrible idea. Whenever you topple a brutal strongman who is holding a country together, the result will be even more chaos, more sectarian violence, and the rise of terrorism.
This is why Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, Barbara Lee, Ted Kennedy, and Barack Obama opposed the Iraq War. The Iraq War was opposed by the majority of Democrats and the overwhelming majority of California House Democrats. If you are a Democrat, Schiff was clearly way out of step on his vote for the Iraq War.
