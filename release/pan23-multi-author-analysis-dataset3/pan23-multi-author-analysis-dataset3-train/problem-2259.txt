And the Trump team tried to justify by saying, "Oh, he meant to say "Wouldn't," as in, "I don't know why it wouldn't be Russia.".
Idk. Go onto r/Ukraine or listen to Zelensky's speeches. Ukrainians give a lot of credit for the USA's vital role in all this. From weapons to intel, our help has been decisive.
Don't conflate tyranny and oligarchy. It's a real problem of false equivalence, but I can't keep reposting my main post from yesterday.
Politicians deserve accountability, but that includes good credit where credit is due. Biden helped save Ukraine.
A Biden presidency is the reason that Ukraine still exists. I don't think it can be argued otherwise. His administrations plans and functions in the lead up of the war provided the intel to stop Russia's decapitation attempt in the first few days. If Russia had been successful on it's airborne special forces incursion to Kyiv to assassinate Zelenskyy we would not be discussing Ukrainian resistance today.
> CIA Director Bill Burns met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a secret trip to Kyiv ahead of the Russian invasion last year to share news that appeared to surprise the Ukrainian leader: the Russians were plotting to assassinate him.
