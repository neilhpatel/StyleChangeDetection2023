China knows that the only way they can continue their level of technological development is by relying on Taiwans supply of American designed chips. China’s “president” is watching what’s happening with Russian Ukraine very closely and knows if he tries anything with Taiwan, the remaining of the western nations will probably severely sanction. China even if that creates another economic panic and supply chain issues.
China on the other hand is the most economically vulnerable country in the world. All the US has to do is stop buying and China will cease to exist.
China has very serious problems and they know it. They can't afford a war with the US despite all the big talk you hear from them. They're just like the Russians with all their bluster.
80% of trade in the US is within North America. It is by far the most insulated system in the world. We are not reliant on other countries.
What other countries? All the other countries are in trade agreements...where is the U.S. going to pick up this 540 billion dollars of goods, what you are really saying is import from other countries who would be importing those same goods from China. So all you are doing is adding a middleman and increasing costs for the U.S.
You have to look at what the U.S. lacks in terms of resources, and what China has. What other countries have in terms of resources. For a lot of things, everything is going back to China.
Have you not been paying attention to China? You give them unfettered access to something and they will just figure out a way to copy it.
