There definitely was some amount of civilian air traffic that fits your description, albeit not risk free, there are a fair amount of instances where 'civilian' aircraft were shot down.
Obviously no direct air traffic between belligerent countries, but for sure from belligerent countries to neutral countries as you point out.
Yes, there were civilian flights between belligerent countries and neutrals, even those surrounded by their opposition. This answer will focus mainly on flights from Britain made by British airlines.
In the immediate pre-war period, there were two main British airlines. British Airways had been founded in 1936, as a merger of several older airlines. It ran mainly short-haul services to European destinations. Imperial Airways had been running since 1924, and, as the name suggest, was responsible for longer-distance routes, especially to far-flung regions of the British Empire, though it also flew some European routes. While the two airlines were commercial rivals, the threat of war following the Munich Crisis of 1938 brought some collaboration. The two airlines agreed to, in the event of war, move their operations to airports at Exeter and Whitchurch, near Bristol, for landplanes, and Falmouth or Poole for seaplanes. These bases were judged to be safer from air attack in the event of war. The airlines would focus on transporting supplies for the RAF (which did not, at the time, have its own transports), carrying VIPs, and airmail, in that order. Meanwhile, the Cadman Enquiry, sparked by poor labour relations within Imperial Airways, was investigating the operations of the two airlines. The report of this enquiry was used to justify a plan to nationalise the two airlines and combine them into a single organisation, though war would start before this plan could be realised.
