The Bible (It is rather difficult to find copies of the Bible that only contain the Old Testament, even more so if you wish to also buy one with Dore’s illustrations. If you are interested in extending the historical time periods you are learning about, then I would recommend reading both the Old and New Testament. If you are only interested in learning about events before 500 BC (as your post implies) then the New Testament will likely not be very engaging to you (as it was written in and takes place entirely within the first century AD). The Old Testament is useful in learning about Ancient Near Eastern societies (especially Israel and Judah), it also contains a lot of information on the geography of Canaan (it should be noted, however, that the culture of the Canaanites, their religion, and practices, are not elaborated much in the Old Testament, it is quite clear that the authors of the Old Testament did not like the religion and cultural practices of the Canaanites, and so specific details of the lifestyle of the Canaanites are often exaggerated for the sake of presenting Canaan as evil. Though the King James Version (1611) is the most widely read English translation, the New Revised Standard Version (1989) is usually the modern academic preference. I would recommend reading a modern translation, as the King James Version uses archaic language that can be difficult to understand).
I would also recommend reading at least one version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead if you’re specifically interested in Egyptian religion.
Ancient Egyptian religion is a very complex subject, and no single book can do the subject justice. I provided a lenhy list of reading suggestions .
