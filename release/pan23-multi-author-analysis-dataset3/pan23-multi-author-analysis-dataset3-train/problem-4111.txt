The DoJ memo says the constitution doesn't allow them to prosecute a sitting president. This has never been tested in court but this is the opinion of the government's council.
So, if a president is being incarcerated and cannot perform his duties there is no mechanism outside of impeachment to take the presidency away from him.
If the incarceration lasts longer than their time in office it would de facto take it away, but by incarcerating them you aren’t literally removing them from it but are instead letting the VP take over until they are able to take over again once out of prison.
There’s no way he get indicted. The investigative purpose here is so that they know what classified information may or may not be compromised and who might have seen it. It’s a risk assessment for security purposes.
I presume that’s the point of the security assessment. From what I read when they first raided Trump it’s not so much the documents were mishandled as that Trump tried to hide it. If I remember correctly every single prosecution under the relevant laws has been when they actively tried to cover up the mistake or it was outright espionage.
