This was affected by other events – including the first two Japanese diplomatic missions traveling to Mexico, and the second one from there on to Spain and Italy.
Point of curiosity – how were the Japanese ambassadors getting to Mexico? Were they travelling on their own ships or hiring Western ones, and were they going across the Pacific or taking the longer (but perhaps better-charted) route across the Indian Ocean and Atlantic?
It was not just public pronouncements such as these where Manchu coexisted with Chinese. Imperial seals often had Manchu down one side and Chinese down the other, such as . The Manchu text reads (credit to the Wikimedia uploader for transcribing it so I don’t have to):
The key thing to note here about Manchu script is that it reads left to right, while Chinese reads right to left. As such, your linguistic context can affect how you interpret this seal: if you’re reading from a Chinese perspective, the Chinese text comes first. If you’re reading with a Manchu frame of mind, the Manchu does. Similarly, the stele I showed above also has Manchu left, Chinese right. These subtle features of Qing bilingualism play into the sorts of deliberately complex identity constructions of the High Qing period, where the emperor’s image increasingly became a sort of blank slate onto which ideals were projected by different audiences. By having these texts side by side in such a way, either a Manchu or a Chinese audience could interpret it as they wished.
