My Hypothesis is that it's due to the lives they've led. If they have been constantly screwed over by Conservative ideology for what reason should they trust it simply by aging?
That's the cause of the Conservative ideology of indoctrinating people from a young age as possible.
The real cause is regimes that follow Conservative ideology suppressing and controlling the population through heavily propagandizing stuff.
You are correct, except with the claim that conservative ideology is the real cause; Authoritarian governments are the real cause and suppress and rely upon propaganda to establish and remain in control... it's similar to how narcissistic people control things around themselves. A market system only functions as effectively as the government allows it to. You can have a more socialist economy and have an Authoritarian government and the suppression and propaganda will be, essentially, the same or at least very similar. Left and right market systems are different from north and south governmental structures; it's the north and south that establishes how effectively the market system can work and how much they will try to suppress.
