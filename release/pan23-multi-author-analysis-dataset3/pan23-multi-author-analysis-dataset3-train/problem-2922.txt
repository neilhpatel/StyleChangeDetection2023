I mean maybe they did prior to the cap. Now they insure somewhere else. And the western insurance company just lost a chunk of its revenue. Thats all there is to it.
Furthermore Russia doesn't have a currency problem. You can buy any currency you wish in Russia. And the rouble is a freely traded currency as well. Ie you can exchange it for whatever you like on exchanges without issue.
Why would western insurance be required? Its not a monopoly. Plus the way to look at it is that western insurance companies just lost a client. Thats all.
Insurance is required yes. For any cargo ship. But I fail to see the point of why would Russian ships be even attempting to insure their cargo in a western company.
Insurance is required because these are russian ships, which are old unreliable undermanned and poorly trained. An oil spill is much more likely than any other ship.
An oil spill in the Bosphorus would be worse. is home to some 16 million people. It would be an ecological and humanitarian catastrophe. No transit via ships, no fishing no cross strait ferries.
