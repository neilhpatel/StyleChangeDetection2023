Yeah, Iran is going for systems that can't be sanctioned. They don't make it themselves, but the chips are so available there's no way to check for them.
True, I don't know the details of the chip only that the performance ratings are at Zen 3 levels. It could well be that they're designed specifically for military use which would change a lot of things about them.
Non-government entities in China don't really use it. They're mostly on self developed ARM CPUs. Like Alibaba's Yitan 710 CPU, which is possibly the world's fastest ARM CPU.
Apple also designs best Mobile CPUs in the World. You are right silicon dominance and quantum supremacy is new superpower. That is why new semiconductor factories are opening in US, and thatâ€™s why China wants Taiwan now, rather than later. Boing falling behind airbus because they lost a huge government contracts, that spacex and others took over,.. space is going private and boing kinda loosing talents to space companies. While airbus is supported by large EU companies and government with all EU talent they want.
