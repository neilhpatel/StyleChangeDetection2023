2) The far more likely, it's to ask if Cuba can supply them with any equipment, including military and medical. Cuba will probably say they're in no position to, and that Russia can't offer them anything substantial in return.
If Cuba is supply military equipment to Russia then it means their military is in a much more dire spot than we realized.
The comment was more of a joke pointing out the embargo and Russia's sanctions(I'm sure everyone here knows that), not that Cuba is currently some rundown shithole with no trade partners.
Cuba has stockpiles of soviet shit out of the 50s and 60s that he's probably hoping to get, so he can send more Russians into Ukraine with junk equipment, where they will die.
The weird thing though is that most Cubas military is horribly outdated stuff from the 1960’s and 70’s that Russia itself should have thousands of units in storage of. It doesn’t make sense to ship this stuff across the world when Russia should be able to pull stuff out of storage nearby and fix it up.
Also Cuba doesn’t have a ton of stuff that Russia really could use. They’ve only got around 100 units of self propelled artillery for example. I’m not sure Cuba would even be willing to give that up.
