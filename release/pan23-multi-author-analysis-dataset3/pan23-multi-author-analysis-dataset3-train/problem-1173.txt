(While a -- meaning, a life sentence with the rider "and you're only ever getting out of prison in a pine box" -- is an option, they're vanishingly rare and are generally reserved for aggravated murder, typically serial killers. (The logic for not applying them to lesser crimes than aggravated murder is that it might give a criminal intent on such crimes an incentive not to leave any witnesses alive: there's an old saying, "may as well be hanged for (stealing) a sheep as a lamb" which applies.).
Unless some future Home Secretary has a serious brain fart he won't be out of prison before he's 80.
He's 48, he just pulled a life sentence with a minimum 32 year tariff (your typical murderer on a life stretch serves about 18 years in the UK, IIRC).
He was sentenced to a life sentence, where after the 30 years it will be reevaluated if he’s no longer a danger to society.
His sentence is for his whole life - even if freed for parole there would be heavy regulations on his daily life and what he is allowed to do.
He was given a 32 year minimum sentence before he is evaluated for release. But he may never leave prison.
I’m not defending it. I’m making a factual statement. He wasn’t given 30 years in prison, he was given 36 life sentences but will be eligible for parole in 32 years. Even if he lives to 80 he may never get out.
If he makes it that far that is. He's 48 so will be 80 before he even gets an opportunity to apply for release.
