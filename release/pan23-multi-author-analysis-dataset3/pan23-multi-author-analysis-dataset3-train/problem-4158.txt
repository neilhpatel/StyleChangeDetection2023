Because that's all you can do. Nobody is going to go to jail here, likely no laws were violated, the most you're going to be able to do is recoup the cost of the puppy. You aren't going to get pain and suffering or anything like that either. And you have a 0% chance of getting them "shut down.".
Yes. I have video footage of what happened. The bigger dog wasn’t even supposed to be in the same area as my puppy. It seems like my pup sniffed him and the bigger dog hit my pup’s head with his own head. He struggled for 3-4 minutes running in place while the daycare workers walked past him not noticing and then he stopped moving.
Honestly I just want my dog back and I wish this never happened to me. I’ll reject all the money in the world for that. So I’m not just trying to get paid for my pain and suffering.
You're not going to get paid for pain and suffering. That's not going to happen and I know that's what you want to happen.
This is not going to happen. A dog is considered personal property. You can recover replacement cost for the dog. Your emotional anguish and the dog's suffering are not recoverable in the legal system. Find another attorney in an adjacent city and listen to his or her advice no matter how upset it makes you. There are certain damages that the legal system does not address.
I am very familiar with how damages work in a lawsuit. You could not get an award of damages high enough to render them broke.
