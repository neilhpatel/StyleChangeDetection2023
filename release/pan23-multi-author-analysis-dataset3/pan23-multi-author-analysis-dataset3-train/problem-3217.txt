Remember when Trump said he was The Chosen One? And when he was asked later on camera about it, he said it was sarcasm, but he said like 'sarcasm' was a brand new word he had just learned? He told the reporters what sarcasm meant then called them 'fake news.'.
Yeah. I remember when the Trump - inject bleach and stick a light up your ass - statement was later rolled back as a supposed joke.
If someone called for someone else to be shot - and later claimed it was sarcasm or a joke - it would be taken very seriously.
But without claiming the type of joke that would actually make sense with what was said. It would still be horrifically poor taste if she was just joking that Jan 6th would have succeeded with her in charge of planning - but if she said that sarcastically then the implication would be that she's deprecating her own ability to plan a coup. Which just doesn't make any sense. This literally makes me think she doesn't know what sarcasm is.
I bet she could not even define sarcasm. The fascist Republicans always use this excuse when they are caught saying something seditious out loud. I have no doubt that traitor would have loved to have gone to the Capitol armed, and would have harmed anyone who got in her way.
