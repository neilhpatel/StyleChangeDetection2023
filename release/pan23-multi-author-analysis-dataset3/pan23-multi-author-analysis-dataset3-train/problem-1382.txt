I feel like presidents pick a vp that appeals to audiences they don't capture. Generally this is identity and politics based. There is no point to cloning the president having both the president and VP appeal to the same demographic.
Now, i personally don't like Nikki Haley, i think she is just as crazy as trump, but hides it better. I do however think Trump picking either (or both) a female or black VP would be a good idea.
She's running for President with the ultimate goal of her's (and the GOP) to be VP running mate. She'll run, drop out then be courted by the two remaining candidates.
She would do better among independents than Trump, Biden or DeSantis. Add in the factor of her being the first female POTUS and a minority and middle of the road liberals who’ve proclaimed for years how important that is would have a harder time justifying voting for a geriatric white instead of her.
Reps would vote for a candidate who’s a woman because there’s an R next to her name and be emboldened by the chance to pretend to be feminist/gender equal and laud it over progressives (like they tried to do on a smaller scale with Herschel Walker).
Dems would vote for a candidate who’s a woman based on her policies and if anything be emboldened by the fact she’d be the first woman to be president (the first point, in combo with gerrymandering and the right wing news cycle being what sunk Clinton).
