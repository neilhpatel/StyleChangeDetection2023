You suggested just straight-up taking their stuff as "the best way to protect yourselves." Granted you did follow up by saying there were other options. But it's a pretty sociopathic thing to suggest, even if it were possible to get away with it legally.
I realize this is r/LegalAdvice, but the owners and their kids lived in this house for however long without getting themselves killed, and anyway you already told them they could. I think you're being a little paranoid.
The seller told the buyers they could come get their stuff. Do what you need to do to protect yourself, but don't punish people acting in good faith because you didn't fully inspect the house before buying it.
Your best way to protect yourselves is to simply say no, as anything left in the home was sold with it unless stated otherwise, but it's also the least friendly. Depending on the amount of stuff I may offer to just bring it out to them. Otherwise, if you do allow them inside you should monitor what they are doing, only allow adults, and wait until insurance kicks in.
I would not allow their children in the house, period. I would also not allow anyone in the house until insurance kicks in (but I would have asked insurance the week of the sale to correct the date).
