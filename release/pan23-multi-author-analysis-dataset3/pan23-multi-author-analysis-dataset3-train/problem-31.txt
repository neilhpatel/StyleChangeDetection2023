You mentioned that he damaged your car. Do you have proof of this in video, audio or written admission? If so what you should do is go and get a quote from a few different auto repair places and let him know that you will be applying the damages towards what he's says you owe. He may end up owing you money in the end considering how much it costs to fix cars these days.
Also if providing internet was in the arrangement you made regarding the price you payed him for rent then he has also violated that agreement.
The moment he sent back your rent and cut off your internet, is the moment that became the new agreement (imo) and I would make him take you to court to decide otherwise. He doesn't get to pretend to be a landlord and not follow housing laws. There are landlord tenant laws for a reason, and many judges to decide what rights each of you were entitled to.
Edit: in fact you may be entitled to damages because he cut off your internet. Let a judge decide. And he's subletting which may, or may not be a violation of HIS lease.
I'm not saying to get him kicked out, I'm saying regarding his lease if he's even allowed to sublet. The apartment may know, but did you sign a lease with him regarding things like rent amount and cutting off internet and price increases? He still might legally not be able to do much according to actual housing laws, and only a judge can determine that.
But he can't just change the agreed amount and cut off internet. Now he should take him to court and let a judge decide. He wants to "play landlord" but doesn't want to follow laws.
He probably refunded it thinking he couldn't accept it if it wasn't the full amount he had requested 5 days prior. Either way it would become something for the courts to decide since he wanted to "play landlord". Heck, the one on the lease might be 3 months behind with no subletting allowed. That's why I say just let small claims sort it out. That's what they get paid the big bucks for.
