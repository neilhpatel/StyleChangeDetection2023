It's a long time until summer. And before then is mud season, when everything gets stuck in the mud.
That's also why the bulk of serious training if Ukrainian soldiers is done outside of Ukraine, while inside its quick and dirty courses. And NATO soldiers definitely aren't the ones touching or directing the guns when they're attacking Russian positions. NATO provides Intel, but it's Ukrainians all the way down selecting, planning and carrying out attacks.
It's going to get bloodier as Russia refuses to surrender. Even a peace treaty at this point would just be pretense for Russia to rebuild resources for the next 10 years to do it all over again unless Ukraine is able to formally join NATO, which won't be possible if Russia keeps tensions up.
Russia is desperate for a breather, Ukraine is under no obligation to give them one, And Ukraine is within their rights to never have diplomatic relations or deals with Russia ever again. Every promise, treaty and agreement made by Russia has been broken, Russia invaded them. Russia never had any intention of honoring a ceasefire. It's all talk. Russia acheived the monumental task of making even the Americans and Chinese look more credible with the amount of bold faced lies they spout.
Ukraine never agreed to, and is under no obligation to honor a ceasefire in a war which they're defending themselves against an aggressor.
can someone explain to me why ukraine needs military aid every time russia shoots something? I thought russia started to use old weapons or even to not gear with weapons their soldiers..
