If she's with your insurance co, yes, give a statement and any pics they request. Your insurance company is there for you, but you do need to work with them. Do whatever your insurance company asks, but make sure to direct the other driver's insurance to contact your insurance if they reach out to you.
The person calling me is my insurance's claim adjustor actually. I wasn't sure at first so was hesitant to tell them anything. It happened two weeks ago and the adjustor just called me today. At this point, the adjustor says the person is telling them the rear of their vehicle is smashed in and that there was a passenger that was hurt. But there wasn't anyone in the vehicle besides her. And there is no damage to my car at all. I didn't take any pictures. I was tired/ fighting a cold and didn't think to take a picture. Was just worried that she was okay. Embarrassed that I had let the brake go and bumped her at all. She even said she didn't see any damage. I regret it for sure. I'm just hoping the fact that my vehicle has no damage helps here.
That's where I fucked up. I was tired/sick, and didn't think to protect myself. Was just worried the person was okay. Have never been in an accident before. So no I didn't.
It's supposedly my insurances claim adjustor. She's asking for a statement. When she explained the other person was claiming severe damages, I told her that I couldn't talk at the moment and she asked me to send a picture of the front of my vehicle. I don't know if I should.
