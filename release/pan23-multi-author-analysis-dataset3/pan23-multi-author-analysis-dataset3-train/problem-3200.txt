You realize that the Soviets were first to establish relations with India? The US attempted to establish good relations as well, it India was already firmly within the Soviet sphere. Pakistan was the 2nd choice.
Exact India doesn’t really care. You can offer to give India the F-35 and they’ll take it and still support Russia. Their relationships with Russia data back to the Soviet Union. If India chose to be a friend of a literally regime of communist oppression, then I highly doubt they will break from Russia now.
By india renouncing russia and the benefits that russia brings to the country, the war WILL spill over to india.
What exactly has Germany done for India that warrants India throwing away eight years of close and warm buddy relations with Russia? France, which also has never had a close relations with India, is also asking India for the same favor. Germany or France is not exactly on that level of relations with India. Is it the lack of self-awareness or just the stereotypical European arrogance and habit of ordering other (brown and color) people to do this and do that?
Germany and France or just most any European country, which have never really had any sort of close relations with India, now wants India to turns its back on an old buddy for something that happens between Russia and Europe, i.e., none of India's business.
France and India are so often described as being close that even the Wikipedia entry for France-India relations has mentions of them as having a "special relationship". France worked with India to de-colonize its assets in modern-day India without the violence that was associated with the UK or Portugal, so it has a different path for a Western European country.
