Property manager here. Is there a rule or a stipulation in your lease not to sublet or use the property as a place of business?
Would it be possible to write an enforceable clause into the lease saying that all or some of the profits from an airbnb rental would go to the landlord?
The only way you would have rights to money he has made through Airbnb is if your lease provides for it. Most leases don't, although some commercial leases do. Most leases do have a provision limiting who can occupy the premises or addressing subleasing, so you probably have grounds to evict, depending on what your lease says.
I would recommend changing your lease so that future tenants cannot run a business or use the property for subletting and or AirBnB or anything like that.
I would reach out to AirBnB and let them know that you are the property owner and landlord and that the former tenant did this and does not have permission to rent out the property. And explain to them that they are being evicted. Now, AirBnB may ask you to that they would keep the listing up and give you the money for the AirBnB renting. That's between you and them. But you gotta contact them like ASAP.
