After all evidence was presented to my attorney(police report, pictures, ticket, witness statements, etc), he said I shouldn't have been issued this ticket as the person who hit my vehicle was traveling at an unlawful speed, and lost their right of way according to 46.2-823.
The only reason why I was able allowed to get a continuance the first time is because I told the judge that I believed the ticket I received was an unlawfully issued ticket, and that I needed time to be able to retain a lawyer. The judge granted my request.
Even still, I filed the appeal yesterday at 9:30, and it has been moved over to circuit court with a hearing date set for December 10th. No time has been given yet, and I most likely won't find out my Tim for the hearing until about to 10 days before the hearing.
That is something that I asked him after the court hearing, and he told me he has never had an issue before with his clients bringing in the letter of representation and a request for a continuance the day of the hearing, and he has never had an issue with the judge granting the request. My issue is a first for him.
I filed my notice of appeal this morning, and my court hearing is on December 10th. At least now, we should be able to successfully argue the validity of the ticket, and present all evidence as it appears.
I did see that, but the OP indicated that he was given a ticket, which is equally plausible as the charge could be issued either way. Further, the attorney indicated they'd appeal to the circuit court, which wouldn't occur if it was a misdemeanor; it would have to be appealed to the appellate court under that standard. So I responded based on the statements made by the OP. But it doesn't make it any less sketchy for that attorney if it turns out it was a misdemeanor; if anything, I think it makes it even worse that he did that.
