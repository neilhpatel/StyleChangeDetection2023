More of we would like to impress upon the board that by rehiring this person they are endangering the mental and potentially physical health of their other employees. It is more of we would like our voices to be heard. as it is documented that this person has abused their employees in the past to the point that many have had to seek therapy. Technically our manual is not clear on if the board actually has the power to reinstate someone.
I mean I get that I think what I'm not conveying here is it goes beyond meer unpleasantness to abuse of multiple employees I understand that the board can do as they please it just seems to me that when every other staff member has sent in a written statement that they find this person to be intolerable or have documented cases of being harrassed or abused by this person there should be some recourse. Also we are a non profit and a public service the way the board works is a bit different that a regular company. But I do apreciate your insight it is just grossly unfair.
Life is grossly unfair. As I've stated elsewhere, harassment with a nexus to a protected characteristic is actionable. In extreme cases, bullying has been found to be actionable (I recall a case where the boss would scream at employees, charge them, throw chairs, etc.). Otherwise, finding one of your bosses to be intolerable doesn't mean anything illegal has happened.
If you're so sure that everyone despises this person, why not just pretend they don't exist en masse? It's unlikely the entire office will be fired in favor of one person.
