-Wagenknecht has called for the dissolution of NATO and for a new security agreement that links Germany and Russia. Throughout her career, Wagenknecht has argued in favor of a closer relationship with Russia; in 1992, she penned an essay praising Stalinist Russia.
>Throughout her career, Wagenknecht has argued in favor of a closer relationship with Russia; in 1992, she penned an essay praising Stalinist Russia, a view she said in 2017 she no longer espoused. In the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Wagenknecht was a prominent defender of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, arguing on February 20, 2022 that while the United States was trying to "conjure up" an invasion of Ukraine, “Russia has in fact no interest to march into Ukraine.” After Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Wagenknecht admitted that her judgment had been wrong.

-Wagenknecht opposed sanctions against Russia over the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and, in a speech in September 2022, accused the German government of "launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier".
As for Wagenknecht, the impression I get from reading her wiki page it looks like her stances attract better reactions from far right politicians and parties than from her own party.
For some reasons communists still think russia and china are model communist countries when in reality both of them are somewhat functioning fascist dictatorships.
Of course when you consider they are merely sayimg they want communist systems applied to authoritarian governments instead of being resistant against them it should really kinda be obvious they are not doing so in good faith.
Horseshoe Theory in its most basic sense is just that the authoritarian right and the authoritarian left are more similar to each other than either are to democracies and democratic republics, which I find hard to argue against. The way I was taught it wasn’t as a Nazism/communism comparative, but as a modification of the political spectrum being a straight line (which arguably has many of its own flaws). I think horseshoe theory itself has only gotten a bad rap because the discourse around it is often stupid.
