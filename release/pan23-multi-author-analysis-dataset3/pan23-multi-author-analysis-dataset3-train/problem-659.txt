We have a system of virtual battery. Any excess production over summer can be used in winter when solar output is low.
Solar should not be the only solution. It should be a way to make other solutions (hydro, wind, natural gas) work better by working less. It doesn’t matter if you can’t predict how often your solar electricity works beyond a ballpark “30 to 45 percent of the time” if you can have the remaining 70 to 55 percent of the time covered by other sources… again, like Hydro, or Natural Gas. Hell, even having some solar means we use less coal, which means coal is cheaper, which means we can extract less of it, meaning we don’t need to import as much.
Getting storage for your solar system makes a lot of sense, not only financially but also for making you energetically self sufficient.
In my ideal world the energy producers would be taking care of storage and distribution on whatever you generate. It's cheaper and safer for everyone that way. But we also need someone to represent the people generating the power when it comes to negotiation with the power suppliers. That's why we have governments in place.
Interesting. This is exactly what I want, the ability to send what you generate to wherever you want. Where I'm at you can only send back to your provider and that creates a power imbalance since they can set whatever prices they want and you can only accept it. Sending the excess wherever you want creates competition and doesn't hook you up to only one company.
