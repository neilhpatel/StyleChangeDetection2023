Pretty sure they were facilitating FSB operations anyway. That's without taking in account, I assume, all the pro-Russian preaching in Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk.
This bit if news concerns the Russian Orthodox Church, which very much acts in concert with the Russian government. The real comparison would be if the Pope declared war on a country and actively preached for it to be invaded. Would that country be justified in limiting the practice of catholicism? Of course it would.
Orthodox churches are "autocephalous", meaning they belong to a country. So you have the Geirgian Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, and now the Ukranian Orthodox.
Russian Orthodox Church has not been in communion with Constantinople Patriarchy for a few years already over their recognition of the independent Ukrainian church.
To all the people about to yell "free speech/religion", the organisation(s) in question is Ukrainian orthodox church of moscow patriarchate, which is basically an FSB branch. It's priests are the ones spotting targets for the bombings, leaking personal data of Ukrainian servicemen and their families to russian army, doing propaganda and a lot of other shady things. There's a UOC of Ukrainian patriarchate too and the dogmatic differences between these are non-existing so there isn't really a justification to staying in russian intelligence organisation 10 months into the war. I am actually surprised they lasted this long.
Also the Idea of someone banning religion in Ukraine is down right idiotic with how religious the country is.
