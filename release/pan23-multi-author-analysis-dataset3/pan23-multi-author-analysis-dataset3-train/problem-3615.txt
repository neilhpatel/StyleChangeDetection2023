This is actually a story specifically about Versailles, as I understand it, rather than a statement about general hygienic norms. In Louis XIV's (1638-1715) time - which is actually the Baroque rather than the Rococo - yes, the standards of sanitation and toilet manners were quite low. At that time, it was considered quite a shining palace and to have an impressive courtly air, but with the sheer number of people there every day, the lack of modern toilet facilities, and an earthier sense of what should be done privately vs. publicly, people ended up urinating in corners. The Duc de Saint-Simon wrote that Françoise de Brancas, the Princesse d'Harcourt and one of Louis XIV's contemporaries, would walk away from company, urinate on the floor, and walk back, and people simply accepted it; he also wrote that Louis XV's regent would receive visitors while seated on the chamber pot. (That being said, court memoirs and diaries are notoriously subjective and unreliable. Saint-Simon used to be taken as a true authority, but he must be taken with a grain of salt like all the rest. If he had a grudge against these people or simply liked gossip, he may have made things up or passed along rumor as fact.) There were public latrines, but even today these can be barely better than using a spare corner.
Flushing toilets, called lieux à l’anglaise (English places), began to be introduced in the 1730s, spread quickly to important members of court, and by the 1780s were even installed for footmen.
From a previous answer of mine to a similar question (which I would note was about public urination, the usual accusation aimed at Versailles - the idea that people pooped on the floor isn't commonly bandied about, which should tell you something):
It is useful, if not imperative, to bear in mind that the sources mentioning any kind of public urination and/or deffication at Versailles (or any other major European court for that matter) fall into two categories:
