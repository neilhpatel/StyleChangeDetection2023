And keep the emails that show they said "she is not an employee" and then after saying "you are welcome to come back." They are probably going to dispute your unemployment claim (that's why they wanted you to resign), and these emails are proof that you were fired. So you will need to show them to the unemployment office if/when they rule against you and you have to appeal.
I see a lot of back and forth about them asking you to come back and your refusal causing you to lose unemployment benefits. Your boss took your mode of transportation (work car) and threatened to call the cops on you. I don't think that is a healthy environment for anyone. It doesn't seem right that you must tolerate these abusive practices or lose unemployment benefits.
I canâ€™t help but wonder if something about your employment, tasking, or termination may have been illegal. Or at least unethical, and they are trying to stave off a future lawsuit, judgement, or fine.
(also not a lawyer) Re-read the decision. The individual was made 2 offers to resume employment, the 2nd came with the knowledge that the hostile supervisor had been terminated. The court found that only the 2nd was an offer for suitable work because of that additional information.
