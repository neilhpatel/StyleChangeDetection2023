I'm not sure what's unclear about the rule, but you are welcome to send us a modmail or start a META thread if you disagree with the application here.
This submission has been removed because it violates our . To discourage off-topic discussions of current events, questions, answers and all other comments must be confined to events that happened 20 years ago or more. For further explanation of this rule, feel free to consult .
I mean, your post is literally asking people to compare the past four years to another era in history; we don't allow discussion of events that happened less than 20 years ago.
I understand my post mentions current events, but isn’t it constructive in drawing parallels between the early 1900’s when I’m asking specifically about repeating history?
Ah okay, I understand. Nothing’s unclear, I guess I just thought it would be some sort of exception. I’m new to this sub, I found it just now after some thought so I hadn’t really taken a look of what other questions would look like.
