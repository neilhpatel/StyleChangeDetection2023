The GOP, on paper anyway, promise to protect that ideal life and as far as they are concerned the only people that matter are those in their small social circle, and they Dont care about anything else… Out of sight out of mind I guess.
From talking to several republican gen z that I work with the answer seems pretty simple, the promise of protecting “traditional family values”. They were raised with the image of the bread winner father caring for their devoted stay at home wife and 4-5 children because that is their identity, and they see the way the world is changing as not just a threat to their dream life they were raised to expect, but also an affront to their morality.
I’m a millennial and I am blown away at how wise and empathetic the majority of gen z is turning out, so I do hope you are right.
There are people like that in every generation, and probably always will be. But considering Gen Z is almost overwhelmingly Left-leaning, I don’t see their shitty messaging reaching too many people. In the cold light of day, Republicans simply offer nothing that Gen Z or Millennials want or need, hence why Cons want to restrict voting so badly. The generational fight is already lost, and it gets more apparent every election cycle.
Remember the baby boomers will be almost extinct in the next few years , and the millennium and Gen Z will be the voting blocks. Based on the accessibility to higher education and information, I do not see the Republican Party as a viable party in next few years if it does not change their political and philosophical trajectory.
