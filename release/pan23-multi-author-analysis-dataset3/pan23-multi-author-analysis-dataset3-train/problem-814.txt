and people they view as “less than” (I.e. caste system while officially not a thing anymore has repeatedly been shown to be alive and well).
And don't even get started on the deeply entrenched caste system that is still pervasive in Indian society to this day. Where some people no matter their ability will never be allowed to achieve anything because their of an 'unclean' heritage.
But what changed this year is that I see that Indian exceptionalism for what it is. You think you deserve to become the same as the British Empire. There is no actual desire for a better world. You want to be the boot on other peoples heads. In the same way as Russia and China are. Re-read your last comment. You think you should be free from consequence in propping up an authoritarian regime while it's literally massacring people. At least with Europes and Americas last couple of decades of investment in Russia and China there was a mistaken sense that maybe we could liberalise them by improving trade with them. India though?
How is India gonna become Russia? India is very different. Increased imports of Fertilizers and oil doesn't matter much when their energy shortage in the world and bidding wars.
