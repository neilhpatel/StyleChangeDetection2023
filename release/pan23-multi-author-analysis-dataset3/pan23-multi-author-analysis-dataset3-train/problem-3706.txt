Morning Thanks for doing this AMA I had the chance to visit Plimoth Plantation last summer and crossed paths with a very zealous historical reenactor. It was very important to him that I understood he didn't get on the ship for religious reasons but because he wanted to own land. Something, he told me dramatically, that wasn't available to him in England. He implied that most of his fellow travels were similar - religion was secondary to land ownership.
Is that an accurate way to think about them or was that particular reenactor being a tad hyperbolic? Thanks!
Thank you so much for doing this! One thing that has always grabbed me is how little Plymouth did to save its charter following the collapse of the Dominion of New England. While I understand that they were far smaller than Massachusetts and lacked meaningful representation in England (Massachusetts had Increase Mather on the ground). Is there more in your mind that could have been done to save the colony from being absorbed by Massachusetts?
Also, at least some of the colony's leaders were not adverse to absorption into Massachusetts. Those most disgruntled or disadvantaged were the inhabitants of the western townships, such as Bristol and Little Compton, which contained many Baptists and Quakers who did not want to become part of the Bay Colony.
When white Americans began to lionize the Pilgrims (and call them the Pilgrims) in the early 1800s, there were already some dissenting voices. William Apess, a Native Methodist minister, asked how New Englanders of his day would react if some foreign group of people washed ashore on Cape Cod and started taking over. And plenty of white Americans as well recognized that the Pilgrims were not the religious tolerant folks they were sometimes made out to be.
Well, it was illegal to meet in a religious conventicle, so the Pilgrims were criminals in that respect.
