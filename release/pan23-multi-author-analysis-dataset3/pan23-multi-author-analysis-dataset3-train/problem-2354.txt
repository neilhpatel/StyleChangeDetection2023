The article does a good job of Sweden acquiescing to Turkey's demands, including handing over a 'terrorist' and dropping its arms export ban to Turkey, even as Turkey continues to make humiliating demands: firing a minister who attended a PKK rally ten years ago; demanding the names of rally attendees who criticized Erdogan; demanding the extradition of people who were granted asylum decades ago.
No other country has made demands of Sweden. I think there's a number of demands Erdogan could have made where we could write it off as realpolitik (e.g. such as lifting the arms ban to Turkey, or providing for trade concessions), but these are demands that go against core values of Sweden.
>In September Sweden lifted the arms export ban to Turkey, and in August it agreed to hand over a man whose name featured on Turkey’s “terrorist” list. The Swedish government insisted, however, that the handover was in line with regular legal proceedings, and that the decision to extradite the man had not been influenced by Sweden’s aspirations to join NATO.
To be fair, from a practical perspective, Sweden and Finland are already EU members and basically for anything that Sweden and Finland would get from a defense perspective as a formal member of NATO, they are already defacto getting.
Putting aside that NATO has no obligation or remit to protect Scandinavia, how is the second largest military in NATO and the ability to unilaterally cut off a key Russian strategic and economic hub unimportant?
Maybe just pursue defense pacts with the NATO members that would actually matter for a war in northern Europe instead of sucking Erdogan's cock for nothing in return.
They do have a large military, but does anyone actually expect Erdogan to live up to the alliances commitments?
