This is more tolerant tbh. Atleast they will allow black people if they bring in a white friend. But will the designer allow gay couples if they bring in a straight couple?
Why would a same-sex couple use her services knowing she believes it's against her religion? Just go somewhere where you'll be welcomed. Even though a white person cannot flat out tell me I'm not welcome in their business as a Black person..if I found out they were racist I wouldn't give them business. I was under the assumption private businesses can choose who they give their services too.. Of course I said assumption, so correct me if I'm wrong.
I guess the point I'm making is, why bother supporting the company? Why would I purposely go into a business knowing that the people would make me feel uncomfortable simply becase I'm Black? Would it make me angry they are racist, of course. Who's to say the designer can't say she's completely full and cannot take on any new clients if two women came in and requested her to make a website for their business?
In the article it said that the designer will work with all people regardless of sexual orientation , but she won't create websites celebrating same-sex marriage. I'm not sure legalities of that since it's her creative work that she would be using. I actually read about the situation you posted in your comment. Of course I don't support that.. I know I wouldn't go there and I would look crazy at other Black people who would try to go there. They don't support us, so I wouldn't give them any business..
