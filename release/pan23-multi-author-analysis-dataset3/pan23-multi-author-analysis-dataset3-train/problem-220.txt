An example of a "spite fence" might be if you built a 15 ft tall fence on your property specifically to spoil your neighbors view. If this is a normal 6ft privacy fence, you're probably fine.
(Not your lawyer) It's hard to be certain without knowing where you are or exactly what your fence/property looks like, but spite fence law generally covers a pretty narrow range of situations.
A few elements to spite fence analysis in Georgia: the fence must be erected with malicious intent, have no useful purpose, and be actively infringing on the neighbors property rights so as to constitute a nuisance.
If nothing else, you now have a neighbor harassing you which provides additional justification for building a fence for privacy. If their deck abuts the fence, make sure you consider their deck height above ground level when determining how high to build.
The CC&Rs likely have rules about exactly how high and what type of fence he can install, so I doubt he can adjust it based on his neighbors deck height.
