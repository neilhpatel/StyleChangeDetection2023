If I was trying to avoid conscription, I would try to be subtle as I can and avoid any interview and photos being taken. Just so I can put less attention to my family.
So he was visiting his sister in Canada when his parents in Russia got the letter. Title made it sound like he was already living in Canada when he got the letter and I was confused how that happened.
But now Russia knows his name, his sister's name, and his family. He made himself stand out among hundreds of people who are seeking refugee. I hope he didn't make his family in Russia a easy target by openly exposing who he is.
The way to say Russia is unrealistic and therefor not worth doing. Instead, it's better that those with the will and energy to change it, should leave. Leaving all of those who have suffered to die. Those who cannot leave, don't matter, so fuck them. It is better that those who can escape leave the rest to rot.
Instead of affecting change and standing against Putin, this guy would rather put his family in harms way, add to the housing crisis, take jobs away from Canadians, and receive privileges that those born in this country are fighting for.
