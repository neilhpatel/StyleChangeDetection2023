I'd like to add an element to your discussion of the Yamasee War which I think complements your point. The strenh of the Yamasee revolt against slaving proved to American slavers that enslaving people on their own lands was a high-risk enterprise. Indigenous people knew the land, and they had local allies and networks they could call upon to help them. An escaped Indigenous slave had a much better chance of reintegrating with their people than an enslaved African who had been shipped across the Atlantic. This is a significant factor when accounting for the dramatic shift in numbers from Indigenous to African slaves. In the 18th century, this was one reason for sending enslaved Indigenous people from North America to work in the Caribbean. We also see this logic carry into the early 19th century, when Indigenous peoples were forcibly removed from the South en masse to make way for plantations worked by enslaved Africans.
Africans have, of course, been in the Americas since not long after Columbus, and the first documented slave revolt in the modern United States took place in 1526 under the Spanish, nearly a century before British colonies would begin to arise along the east coast. For much of the 17th and early 18th century, black slaves existed alongside indigenous slaves in the British colonies, and up to 1715 there were probably more indigenous slaves imported out of Charleston than black slaves imported in.
For clarity, were indigenous slaves often captured initially by other indigenous people and then sold to Europeans, akin to what was done in Africa? Or are Europeans more often actually doing the direct enslaving (in the American South, let's say)? Thank you.
