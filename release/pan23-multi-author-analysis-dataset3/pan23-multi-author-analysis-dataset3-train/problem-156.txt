Likely the exact same. Had you said you were covered under Medicaid and they weren’t in the network they wouldn’t have been able to accept you as a patient. This is a common Medicaid restriction.
Sorry but Medicaid in CO is very restrictive — the provider cannot bill a Medicaid recipient even if they do not accept Medicaid.
Medicaid does not require states to offer dental insurance for adults — so it is not as comprehensive as medical.
At the state level, Colorado law (C.R.S. § 25.5-4-301(I)), provides that no Health First Colorado member shall be liable for the cost, or the cost remaining after payment by Health First Colorado, Medicare, or a private insurer, of medical benefits authorized under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. This law applies whether or not Health First Colorado has reimbursed the provider, whether claims are rejected or denied by Health First Colorado due to provider error, and whether or not the provider is enrolled in the Colorado Medical Assistance Program (C.R.S. § 25.5-4-301(II). This law applies even if a Health First Colorado member agrees to pay for part or all of a covered service.
Based on the statute posted, it is of my understanding that no Medicaid recipient in Colorado is allowed to pay out of pocket for any service performed. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize a provider that accepts Medicaid (solely) as form of payment from that patient because they cannot charge or accept anything else.
Thanks. Why/how does this apply differently to my dental billing? I pay out of pocket almost each time I visit, as the costs aren't typically fully covered by Medicaid. Had 4 amalgam fillings replaced with ceramic fillings and 1/4 fillings was out of pocket. This was just a few months ago.
