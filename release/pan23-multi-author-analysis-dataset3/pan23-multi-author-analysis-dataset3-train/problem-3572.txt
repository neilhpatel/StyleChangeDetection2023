I understand your community may be a small one, but your best solution here is to not talk to them at all. Ignore them. Don't engage them. And don't use the term "divorce" -- say you were together and dating but never got legally married.
If neither of those situations applies to you, and you never took out a marriage license, then you have never been married. The Islamic divorce only applies for religious, not legal purposes. (I assume the ED accusation has to do with an inability to have children being grounds for a religious divorce.).
Well. Like in the other comments i mentioned. We didn’t have a civil marriage only religious marriage and that to in the state of NJ. As one the people mentioned, NJ doesn’t have a common marriage law. So it’s not recognized.
I don’t even understand what their demand is ? Like they said the lawsuit would be me paying them money for the marriage that was done on her families part.
Did you sign a contract or make a verbal agreement with witnesses in regard to paying for the wedding? If not, you don't owe them squat. Doesn't matter if it's a common law or real marriage. In laws can't sue you because they paid for the wedding unless you specifically agreed to pay for it whether on paper or verbally.
