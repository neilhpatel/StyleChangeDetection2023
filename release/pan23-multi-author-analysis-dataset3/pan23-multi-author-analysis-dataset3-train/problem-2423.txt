If your school has a student government, graduate student union, or something similar, they might be able to advocate on your behalf or help you navigate your school's processes for appealing this decision.
Then go back to the dean with a representative, be it a lawyer or someone from your nursing student advocate organization (if you have one) and press them.
In the meantime I’d get that attorneys letter to the Dean and communicate that you’ll be going to the provost as you believe this is a violation of policy and possibly your legal rights. Hopefully this will scare the dean out of their power trip.
Do you have an advisor or professor you have a good relationship with? If the provosts contact info isn’t available online, fill them in on the whole situation and if they’re sympathetic see if they’ll reach out to the provost with you.
Yeah I would make it clear to the dean that you’re escalating this to the student body President and provost.
That’s shouldn’t matter. Policy is policy. They can’t just violate their own policies (which OP agreed to when they paid their exorbitant tuition) because they personally felt OP is flakey.
If they doubted they could ask for a doctor note. They’re just in a shitty power trip. Maybe they don’t think COVID is real lmao.
