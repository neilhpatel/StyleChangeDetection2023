If you decline to take on that responsibility, another guardian will be appointed for him or he'll become a ward of the state and placed in a group home or assisted living facility depending on the magnitude of his needs.
There are a lot of options here, and it appears that you could be his guardian at some level, while receiving in-home services from a caregiver at the expense of the state. That would take a lot of the burden off you. It couldn't hurt to discuss these options with your brother's caseworker to pre-plan, it looks like the state of CA has many levels of involvement to facilitate keeping DD people in the community rather than institutions.
You are not obligated to take-on the responsibility of being your brother's caretaker unless you want to, and if you do, you'll likely be eligible for the government subsidies to continue his care.
I do not expect that you will be able to move on from your caretaker role to an independent life as a tradesman but also retain the government subsidies your family gets now.
If your current housing is part of the government subsidy for caring for your brother, then you may have to move out if you no longer qualify for that housing on the merits of your own situation. That would definitely be something to discuss with the housing administrators as you weigh your options.
