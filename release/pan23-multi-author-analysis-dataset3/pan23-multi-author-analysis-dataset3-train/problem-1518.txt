Certainly you should push back on any costs you might suffer related to this error by the selling dealer. But certainly you will ultimately need to fulfill what you promised in the contract to purchase. Unless you're perhaps somewhere with an exceptionally short statute of limitations.
No. You engaged in a specific transaction with the dealership and you haven't paid what was promised to be paid in that transaction.
I understand, but how is the posted scenario any different than one in which the dealership loses their records of OP's payments, or simply falsely claims to have lost them?
Yes in the sense that the dealership must take the necessary steps to compel OP to pay, as in notify OP via certified mail of intent to file legal proceedings.
But OP did pay, he brought the financing paperwork which was a de facto payment. OP was never supposed to directly pay the dealership. In the paperwork it would have that the money is coming from X bank who hold the loan.
The loan was supposed to fund when they submitted the proper paperwork to the bank. Showing OP used the loan for what he specified he would. They did not submit the paperwork.
