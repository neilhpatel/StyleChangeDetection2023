But what I will say is that Democrats have been trying to convince swing voters for my entire lifetime and I haven't seen it work yet; passing legislation doesn't convince swing voters, signing laws doesn't convince swing voters, campaigning and messaging doesn't convince swing voters, track records don't convince swing voters, state governance doesn't convince swing voters, hell, an violent armed insurrection perpetrated exclusively by one party at their party leader's public behest didn't seem to convince swing voters.
I wish I knew what to tell you, I really do. The best I can think of is to get involved at the local level, local government has a much more significant impact on most people's lives than they know, and it's a place where hard work can still pay off. Clearly federal abortion rights are a thing of the past, but if you can elect a Democratic Governor and legislature then at least the women in your state can have them back.
It might also just be time to realize that Democrats, liberals, and progressives are on our own, swing voters and non-voters don't have our back.
Hadn’t encountered the “recalled vote” strategy for polling, but in a way it’s like they’re TRYING to eliminate democratic bias, which could be a good sign. I think I’m just desperate to know the polls are BS.
