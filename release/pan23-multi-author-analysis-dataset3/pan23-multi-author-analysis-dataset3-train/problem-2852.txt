He had to step onto my property, walk 15 feet around a bush in my yard, and 15 feet up my driveway. Basically he had to step around my bushes and onto my property in order to get a view of the sign. He could have taken a picture of the sign from down the street 100 feet but didn’t. He took a picture of a Trump 2020 sign. So I imagine he’s trying to Dox me. And it’s not even my sign.
You should also consider a few other things that may be considered trespassing according to Attorney Brian Farkas of Are Videotaping and Photography Allowed on Someone Else's Private Property?
So while he may have trespassed, he did not violate your privacy by taking pictures of your home's exterior which is visible from a public place.
If you have an eight foot privacy fence blocking the whole front of the house from the street and he climbed it, then THAT is a privacy violation.
If he got a picture that didn't have the oak tree in the yard in the way, that's not going to be a privacy violation because he can see the whole house from the sidewalk.
If I take one step forward onto your lawn, I am still recording the same things (that can be seen from a public space) so the recording is still legal, even if I am trespassing.
Taking pictures of someone’s property while flying above it can be trespassing. With drones becoming so immensely popular in communities, it can be easy to want to snap a photo of someone’s stunning backyard. However, this is ‘private’ property as it can’t be seen from the sidewalk and therefore is illegal.
The property owner doesn’t need a ‘No Trespassing’ sign to establish whether the area is private. This can make it a little extra challenging to know where to go and where not to go. However, if you stay in the public spaces, you shouldn’t have an issue with trespassing.
