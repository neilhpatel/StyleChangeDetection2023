When it came down to it, she felt like she couldn't believe in anything, because there might always be a tiny, tiny chance that's she's wrong, so she has to keep an open mind.

She has facebook brain. Flat earth is the onramp to identify and target people vulnerable to more damaging conspiracy theories, now there's a conspiracy theory for you.

There's a difference between "a conspiracy" (which is a real thing that happens sometimes), and a "conspiracy theory mindset" which is a way of thinking that avoids accountability and critical thinking.
