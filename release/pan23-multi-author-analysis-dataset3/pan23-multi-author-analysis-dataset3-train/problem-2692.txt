This is going to be another situation where the dyed in the wool Democrats will insist he did nothing wrong and is a saint, the dyed in the wool Republicans will insist that he's a traitor and should be executed but anyone whose mind isn't already made up largely won't give a shit.
This sort of casual approach to classified documents is rampant at the top levels of government. The only way you can really get mad about it in a partisan way is if you were already pretty strongly biased one way or the other.
