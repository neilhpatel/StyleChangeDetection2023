>So all their posturing in realty is for armies with broken , poorly made gear for the masses. They special forces might have the real prototypes or hang made gear that can do what they actually say it does , everyone else is the equivalent of 90s Chinese knock offs of their own stuff.
Now they made it worse for themselves - if they lose they will be more motivated then ever to join. Exactly what Russia was afraid of will happen - border monitoring bases and Iron shield facilities run by NATO start popping up in UKRAINE .
Oh certainly, it will be a painful one for the Russians, but the Ukrainians are gonna need ever munition they can get to sustain that defense. If US cuts military supply to Ukraine in February, that won't help their cause.
Sadly it wonâ€™t come because republicans are going to take over the house next year, nothing will get done ðŸ˜‘and top of that they wonâ€™t send aid to Ukraine.
The way I see it the US ainâ€™t letting go of supplying Ukraine any time soon, even if public opinion sours over time.
A good analysis. American public opinion unfortunately doesnâ€™t even matter all that much when talking about US involvement in international conflicts. The war in Afghanistan had years of negative polls with Americans saying we should leave, and yet the US was still spending money and being involved until very recently.
