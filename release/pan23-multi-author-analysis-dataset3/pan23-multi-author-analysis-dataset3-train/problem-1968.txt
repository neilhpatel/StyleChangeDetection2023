The rapper Ye and far-right white supremacist troll Nick Fuentes were among those who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Nov. 22, both Ye and Trump confirmed last week.
Fuentes reportedly told Trump during the dinner that he was unimpressed with his 2024 campaign announcement because it wasn’t “authentic” Trump. Trump reportedly responded: “He gets me.”.
Former President Donald Trump had dinner with a well-known white supremacist and antisemite, and refused to denounce him after the fact because doing so might alienate his base, according to the Guardian, raising some questions about what Trump believes about his own base.
Trump won't denounce the white supremacist because Trump agrees with the white supremacist about white supremacy because Trump is a white supremacist.
If you associate with white supremacists, and rely on white supremacists for support, then you are most likely also a ___________________.
If denouncing a white supremacist would upset your base than your base is made up of __________________.
The sad thing is if he did denounce him (and white supremacy in general) his base will follow suit. They’re lemmings who will believe up is down if he said it.
