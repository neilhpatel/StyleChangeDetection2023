Man, as a lawyer with friends in JAG, I'm going to be real when I say y'all are really just spinning a ton of conspiracy theories to feed a narrative. I agree. Fuck DeSantis. He has a horrible track record for human rights given Don't Say Gay, human trafficking, and his other bullshit legislation which has grown too long to keep track of, but there are some issues with your logic:
First, when you (I use the word "you" generally here) are a government attorney, especially for the military are assigned to your position. Yes, you may have a say in where you would like to be transferred, maybe in San Diego or Florida near your family, but you don't exactly get to choose. Could he have volunteered to literally move to Cuba--as American military in a country where we forcibly took land to install a military base--and be a lawyer for the American government? Sure. Is he more likely to have been stationed there without any say in his post? Yes.
Itâ€™s not just the right though. Americans, across the board, continue to vote for people with horrible track records when it comes to wars etc.
Just goes to show you how long the GOP has been corrupt and how far they will go to destroy human rights.
