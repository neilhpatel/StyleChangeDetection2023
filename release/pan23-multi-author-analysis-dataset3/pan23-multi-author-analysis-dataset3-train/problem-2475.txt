Ya, a clearly insignia covered medic was not shot, a man in civilian garb was. Come on, its not even like the article is a long read or written at a advanced level of English comprehension. How much do you people get paid, per hour or post? Post per hour?
I absolutely no way can you prove that the IDF was trying to shoot the medic short of the shooter volunteering the information. Shooting in the general direction of someone is not shooting at them. Geneva conventions don't say you cant shoot anywhere near the medic, it says they are "protected and respected". Was the medic between the two groups shooting at each other? We know none of this, what we do know is that the medic was in fact not hit, therefore we have no way of knowing if he was be shot at.
And yeah I suppose your point about the medic not knowing whether it was a militant or just a civilian is a good point.
The war crime is not having mind reading ability to tell that someone on the battlefield is a medic and not another militant.
As there was an active fight going on it is entirely possible the IDF was not trying to kill the medic but still shooting in the direction of the medic is a crime.
If the accounts from the witnesses are correct they had to be shooting in the direction of a medic to hit the guy near him.
They shot in the direction of/at the medic and hit the innocent guy trying to help. Shooting at medics is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.
