European kings are famously intermarried because the pool of suitable spouses was so small for them. Did lesser nobles marry ‘internationally’? How far down the hierarchy do you have to go for it to become rare or maybe even unacceptable? For example would the couple dozen English dukes be more likely to intermarry, marry down or marry foreigners?
English dukes (and peers in general) were vastly more likely to marry across or down the social ladder than internationally. Royal marriages were difficult and often expensive to arrange because they involved ambassadors traveling and corresponding with each monarch whose child was being bargained for; it was worthwhile because it could have important ramifications for politics and diplomacy for both countries, but if the son of the Duke of Marlborough married the daughter of the Duke of Guise, there was much less of a return on the investment. In England, aristocratic marriage involved the trading of money and land, and the preservation of the noble class - keeping their status and money from flowing away.
For more on aristocratic marriage, you can look at John Cannon's Aristocratic Century: the Peerage of Eighteenth-Century England (1984).
"Dentistry in the British Isles" by Anne Hargreaves in Dental Practice in Europe at the End of the 18th Century (2003).
Her teeth probably weren't black, but they were bad (growing up in the Caribbean gave her access to a lot more sugar than most people of the period got). Artificial teeth did exist at the time, but using them would have meant having every single real tooth pulled without any kind of sedation or painkillers, which ... is any more explanation needed? Many suppliers of false teeth claimed that theirs were totally undetectable and could even be used to eat with, but one does have to wonder if that was really the case, as well.
