There are alot of Armenians that hold the Kurds just as responsible for the genocide as the Turks. Several massacres committed by Kurds predating the genocide, namely the Hamidian massacre, also didn't help.
Kurdish people are minority in every country and get discriminated and killed by the government host countries.
Deliberately targeting and killing a particular ethnic group in a country does further the goal of reducing the population of that ethnic group in the country. Both by literally driving down numbers through deaths, and by dissuading other immigrants from coming.
Those are not two mutually exclusive things. You can be aiming to influence political actions by killing people, and the act of killing people can be political in nature if you do it for political reasons.
But that action doesn't further his goal politically, his motivation was to kill brown people, there was no greater political plan or consequence.
This would require some degree of co-ordination on their part, as the argument of being scared of the violence doesn't have a political impact if said people are then behind bars.
