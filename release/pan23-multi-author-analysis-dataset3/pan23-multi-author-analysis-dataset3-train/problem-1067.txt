I meant the Arabic part of the Ottoman state, the one they renounced. The nationalists had no interest in the Arabs, but did anyone from any side try to oppose this partition/ recommend keeping the Ottoman state as it was ?
The whole experience really kind of swayed the Ottoman intelligentsia to the nationalist viewpoint, which was that the Turks needed their own homeland and that the multi-ethnic empire model had failed.
Once the nationalists had control over the territory they claimed, the Republic of Turkey was declared and the Ottoman state abolished -- the last sultan was sent into exile in late 1922. Ataturk was able to renegotiate with the Allies at Lausanne, cancelling the Treaty of Sèvres, and gaining international recognition for the Republic as the legitimate government of the Turkish people, with guaranteed borders as they are today (with the exception of the province of Iskenderun, which voted to leave Syria and join Turkey in 1930).
To clarify: partitioning Ottoman Territory does not refer to the separation of the greater Middle East or the Balkans--the territories the Ottomans held in the 19th century; the Ottomans were forced to renounce claims to territories that had either declared independence (or became European mandates), and the renunciation of territories outside of Anatolia and Thrace (the small part of Turkey in Europe) was upheld by the government of the Republic of Turkey that succeeded it. The Turkish government later claimed that they did not renounce their claim to Cyprus (which was a British protectorate at the time of the treaty of Sèvres) at the time of Cypriot independence in 1960, but that's a whole other issue.
