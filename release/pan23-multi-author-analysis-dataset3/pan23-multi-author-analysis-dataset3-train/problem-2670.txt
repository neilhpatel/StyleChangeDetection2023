NAL but I work in the financial industry. Ask US Bank if you can file a fraud case on the pending charges. Let it be known you have a police report filed as well. Some institutions will allow you to file a dispute / fraud case while the charges are pending (the investigation starts if / when the charges are processed) while other institutions will make you wait for the charges to be processed prior to filing the fraud / dispute. Check with your bank and see what their process is for fraud.
A bank has specialists who look into the case and decide if it's fraud. The bank can not do anything about a charge until it posts to the account. They already closed the card to prevent further charges. A dispute covers charges you didn't approve, whether it's somewhere you regularly do business or not.
The reason for this is there are many times that a pending charge doesn’t make it through. There can’t be fraud if the charge doesn’t end up with money passing hands, and you can’t reverse a pending charge.
