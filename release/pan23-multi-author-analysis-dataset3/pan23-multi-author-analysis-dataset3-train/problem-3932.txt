Hard to say no to that sort of money if what they ask you to do is fully in line with your trolling agenda anyway.
I wonder if they will investigate him for treason. Deliberately thwarting your country's bid to join a defensive alliance that is crucial for defending against an expansionist terrorist state ruled by a maniac sounds quite treasonous to me.
I think you misunderstood the idea. The original NATO that includes Turkey would still exist. There would just be a second orherwise identical NATO that includes Sweden, but not Turkey.
Except the only thing this clown can do is rile up Turkey and stall the accession of Sweden and Finland, which on the whole means basically nothing to NATO. It’s not like NATO can’t perform it’s function without them - nobody has been counting on them to join ever and NATO has been doing fine without them for all of its existence.

Once again, please show me where anyone is doing that. You can critique religion without agitating them like that.
If you’re buying a book just to burn it, that sounds like you’re wasting your time being edgy. It’s not simply a freedom of expression, people like that want freedom from consequences of their actions.
One, show me where I said that. Two, how exactly is burning their holy book an effective method of criticizing their religion?
