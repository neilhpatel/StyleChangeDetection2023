To cover increased wear and tear to the unit and to pursue the ability to have the pet in the unit.
"To cover increased wear and tear to the unit" Right... which they're not doing. We also paid monthly pet rent.
Is it also normal to charge a separate fee when a tenant has lost one pet and is bringing home another pet of the same species? I can't wrap my head around any non-exploitative reason for this. It's not like I went "well my goldfish died, but his fee will cover this golden retriever, right?".
I'm trying to, it's just difficult without solid proof. I have pictures of what the place looked like when we left but not like, in-depth videos of everything working exactly as it should. I wanted to ask about the pet fees because that's sort of the opposite situation, where I have proof but wasn't sure if it was shady in the first place. Thank you for the advice.
If it makes any difference I am talking about fees between $200 and $500 per pet here (not to get too specific) on top of the monthly pet rent.
Generally pet fees can be looked at as rent you pay to have your pet live there. Just like with the human beings living there any damages caused by your pets beyond normal wear can be considered damages that you will have to pay for.
