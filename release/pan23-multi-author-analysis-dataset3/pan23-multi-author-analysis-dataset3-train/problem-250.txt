How old are the siblings? What are there genders? Do you have adequate housing for an additional two children? Can you show your ability to financially take care of two additional children? While DCS prefers to keep children with family members, their first responsibility is to make sure the children are well cared for, both emotionally and physically.
DCS has raised a few legitimate concerns about your ability to provide kinship care for your 6 siblings.

The bottom line is that if you have any shot at all at having your siblings placed with you, you're going to have to learn to play nice with DCS. Your attitude that DCS is out to get you at every turn will not serve you well, particularly since it's only been a week since your siblings were removed.
