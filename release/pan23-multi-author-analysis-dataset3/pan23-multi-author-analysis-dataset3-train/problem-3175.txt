lobbying for decades to lower the minimum headcount necessary to operate the trains, and then shitcanning their entire buffer for the skeleton crew to be able to take leave, was also prety short-sighted.
Sounds like it’s time to strike, regardless of what congress says, if the railroad doesn’t come to the fucking table with an adequate proposal that results in their employees not being treated as subhuman slaves.
A more accurate headline would be "Railroad companies are threatening to grind the US economy to a halt just to deny their workers paid leave".
I'm fairly certain if a rail worker strike could cripple our economy to the point that it 'grinds to a halt', one could argue that the rail system is a public good/commons. That's all the justification the White House needs to declare eminent domain and take ownership of the rail system. Don't even need Republicans for that. Unfortunately, it also alienates a lot of top dem donors, so it's a no go.
Fortunately (unfortunately) global warming may speed up the occurrence of pandemic level viruses re-emerging. Add that to modern levels of globalization, we likely speed up the occurrence of global pandemics.
Yeah, but as a politician, would you rather spend all of your time fundraising to garner many small donations, or put a minimum amount of effort courting the monies class? One option is much more time consuming.
