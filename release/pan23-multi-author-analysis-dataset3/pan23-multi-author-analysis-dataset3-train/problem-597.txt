That last one sounds horrible only bc of the weird inquisition. Imagine the MAGAs in the US getting some influence or authority over this inquisition. Pro democracy Americans would be rounded up for being "pedos and groomers.".
They do though. Various Catholic charities consistently rank highly on various lists, including Catholic Relief Services which raises funds for Ukraine.
"Pope Francis asked Catholic parishes in Europe to take up a special collection for humanitarian support in Ukraine. To the collected 12 million euros, the pope added six million euros of his own charitable aid for the country.".
Yea. Good intentions and message, but my government has already paid the difference for every US citizen ten times over while people here are struggling with prices. All for helping those in need, especially during war, but damn do some citizens need help too.
I fully support helping the Ukrainian people. No Dictator should be able to just steamroll through innocent lives and claim land. My issue is with my government not being able to also support it's own citizens properly. I do not see why we can't help the Ukraine people and also help our own citizens.
