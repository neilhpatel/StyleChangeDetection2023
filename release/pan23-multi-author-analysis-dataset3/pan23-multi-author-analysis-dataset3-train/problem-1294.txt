Early in the war, the Belarussian President Lukashenko, an obsequious Putin dog, had a photo-op of him meeting with military leaders. The map showed the plan to take all of Ukraine and Moldova. Russia would certainly take aim at Moldova after Ukraine. Moldova is also not in NATO and so is a target of Russia in the region.
Russia has been funding Transistrian separatists in Moldova for a while now, makes sense Moldova will crack down on Russian influences in the population.
Moldova, on the other hand, given it's small size and current position, at this time doesn't really have many choices when Russia is actively spreading organized war propaganda. The US would not have allowed Japan or Germany to operate multiple legal radio stations across America during the WW2, no matter what the constitution says.
I fully agree. The US is a massive country and you can pick and choose between thousands of different medias. Many of them will always be crazy and that's just a fact that has to accepted.
We could also argue, that a government providing a medium for media outlets has the right to choose to which outlets they sell broadcast frequencies by legislation regarding content. Just like spreading child porn is illegal basically everywhere, I believe there's a good reason to ban spreading enemy war propaganda. The US is not in this situation right now, quite a few countries close to the Russian borders are.
