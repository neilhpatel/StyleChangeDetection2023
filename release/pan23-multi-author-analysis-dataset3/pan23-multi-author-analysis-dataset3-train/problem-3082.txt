NAL, but I used to work in insurance. Have you filed an insurance claim then? Who is "They", the driver of the other vehicle or their insurance company? Have you contacted your insurance company?
If all of this was the other guy, remember they are not on your side. You need to speak with your insurance company. If you already have, you can try filing a police report and see if there are traffic cams at that intersection they can pull from.
That said, unfortunately left turns ARE secondary to right. If the other driver was legally allowed to turn right there, without any footage or him claiming he did something wrong, it's going to be hard to prove not at fault. Your insurance should be dealing with this though.
NAL, but I work as an adjuster in insurance. Unless you have any form of proof that the light was yellow, and even then it would have to be a yellow arrow, not yellow solid, then Kemper is correct in this case. Based on the evidence provided, any insurance company, and typically most arbitrators would be lead to believe that you failed to yield the right of way to the oncoming traffic.
