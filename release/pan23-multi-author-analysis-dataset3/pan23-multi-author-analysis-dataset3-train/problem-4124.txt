Hell their days would already be over if they hadn’t been allowed such egregious gerrymandering and disproportionate power through the electoral college.
It’s how oppressive regimes operate the world over when they are trying to cling to power and the GOP knows it’s days are numbered in a democracy.
That’s their ultimate goal of course, to kill an idea by killing off those who agree with the idea.
Conservatives will never learn this simple lesson: you cannot kill an idea. They tried in Vietnam, they tried in the American South, they tried in Afghanistan and they’re currently trying in our school libraries. They think shutting this play down is a success, but the only reason I know about it is because they tried to shut it down.
I’m sensitive to the idea that this has practical implications. You’re right that they, through action, harm people.
Unfortunately, I can’t share in the pain to whom they direct their angst. But I disagree with you that they aren't ultimately trying to kill an idea and that your experience is simply the result of their machinations.
