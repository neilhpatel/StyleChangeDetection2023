About 10 years ago, my impression of Ukraine society was: plenty of racism, rampant corruption, low education on display, overall a pretty average country. Then through Maidan protest, years of Donensk and Luhansk violence - where people going off to die at war became normal, Crimea craziness, and now this current all out invasion, society must have changed.
At one time western Ukraine lived its own life and Luhansk, Donetsk lived theirs, but when the fact came out that our home could be taken away from us, all that disagreement faded into the background.
Our education is very good, many foreigners studied in Ukraine because of the price, but it is not worse than the European one and it is a fact!
Millions of volunteers who are waiting for an opportunity to take up arms and go to defend their home, I am proud to be from Ukraine, and I don't really care what anyone thought before, you just didn't know what it was like to be in Ukraine at least for a day.
I would say 50/50 - because of the partial blackout, many residents use the Internet, the network is overloaded, prices for services are increasing due to demand and other things, so it's hard to answer.
