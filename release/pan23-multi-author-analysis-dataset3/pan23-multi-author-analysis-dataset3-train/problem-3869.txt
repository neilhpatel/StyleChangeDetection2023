This is the reality of human existance - there is always human suffering somewhere and we ignore it.
If you can afford to not get involved and dont suffer any ill effects then neutrality is the best option.
For example Switzerland 🇨🇭 they can and will remain 100% neutral because they are far enough away from Russia and can safely remain neutral.
__Switzerland cannot remain neutral in the face of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, says Ukraine’s ambassador to Switzerland Iryna Venediktova.__.
The ambassador says she respects Swiss neutrality. “But please let other countries send their Swiss-made weapons to Ukraine,” she said.
Personally, as a Swiss, if I could decide for my country we would already be fighting with Ukraine. Without talk of alliances, just because fighting a genocidal maniac is the right thing to do. I'm disgusted that we aren't doing that, but even more so, I'm disgusted that countries that can't even pretend to a tradition of neutrality aren't doing it either. Do better, world.
