What carrot do they even have anymore? Do poor conservatives think more tax cuts are coming? If they do, is this the most motivating factor? Is it even a factor at all anymore?
Remember, the most serious criticism of Trump came from a voter when she revealed: "he's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.".
Yep. There's generally three big categories of modern conservatives (from my observation) and there's often overlap. Those are: 1. the ones who do it for financial reasons (like you mentioned), 2. the religious zealots who want to impose their beliefs on everyone, and 3. people who have grown up in rural towns and/or very conservative families who are that way because it would be social suicide not to be. Cultures in small towns can be very oppressive and going against the grain can lead to complete isolation. You either conform or you lose your primary social circle. And some people aren't willing to take that chance.
These folks donâ€™t resolve their issues in a healthy manner. Which is why so many have to permanently cut ties with family members whose espouse these ideas.
