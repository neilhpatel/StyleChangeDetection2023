It's 24% over a four year period, and they'll still be working under the barbaric points system that literally punishes them for taking sick days. So no, they didn't get a great deal, and Biden shows once again that he's little more than a neoliberal ghoul.
The narrative would be Biden did nothing to help and if he does something republicans do everything they can to screw it up so they can still blame Biden.
However, it is both okay and necessary to blame Biden and the democrats for doing bad things when they choose to use their control of the government to do bad things. The fact that republicans joined them in doing the bad thing doesn't somehow absolve them. Forcing a strike to end against the wishes of the workers and to accept a contract they find unacceptable is an unjustifiable abuse of state power and a betrayal of democrat's supposed values.
By splitting the bill, you get to make a strike Illegal while also hiding behind opposition that you know is going to kill the concessions to the workers. Everyone knew that bill absolutely was not getting 60 votes in the senate. Yeah fuck the Republicans for killing it, they are clear villains. That doesn't excuse the Democrats from making the provision that the workers wanted easier to kill. The government stepped in and neutered a Union, and a lot of people share the blame in that. I don't think that's unfair.
