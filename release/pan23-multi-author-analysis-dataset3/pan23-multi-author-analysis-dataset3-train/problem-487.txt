I'm sorry? India and China are full of natural borders, you may have heard of this little range called the Himalayas. Even beyond that, to say the south is "hilly" is an understatement, significant parts of the Deccan are more that 3000 feet above sea level with the highest point being well over 6,700 ft above sea level. India has 7 major mountain ranges and some enormous rivers providing plenty of natural barriers.
India does not have any geographic barriers. The entire region is basically flat land just waiting to be conquered. The South is a bit more hilly, but relative to Europe, its not at all significant.
The fact that Asia was ahead of Europe is irrelevant to the thesis being discussed. In fact, its expected that areas that lend themselves to large, unchallenged empires (like in Asia) will have the early lead, but that overtime, the crucible in Europe will out innovate, and thus outperform them. Regimental organization was one such innovation.
Nearly all the important regions of the Hapsburg Empire became powerful due to environments that perfectly support the crucible theory. Sure, once they were all joined together (not by conquest but political machinations) it wasn't as clean, but that's not really here nor there.
