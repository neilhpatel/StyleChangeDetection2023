Title: My girlfriends ex-husband is harassing her via text message and now threatening me with violence.
If he's not threatening violence to her, and he doesn't comply with her request, then she should follow through on contacting a lawyer. In most states, it is possible to petition the court to modify her custody agreement so that her ex-husband would be instructed to only communicate with her through a 3rd party about their son due to the nature of his texts. But she would definitely want to consult with a lawyer about doing that.
INAL. Your state is important in these matters. Parents can petition the court for a change in their custody agreement after the divorce decree is finalized. Typically there is a waiting period unless there are extenuating circumstances such as abuse or neglect. In most states, the waiting period is 1 year from the date the decree was finalized. Whether it's granted or not is an entirely different matter.
As for the text, if he is threatening physical violence to you, then you could get an order of protection (aka restraining order) against him.
As for previous threatening communication, you and her can seek an order of protection. However even if it's granted, that would not necessarily terminate his visitation rights to his son.
