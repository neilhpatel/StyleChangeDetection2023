It's bullshit. The Turkish military creates these narratives to justify occupying, attacking and displacing Kurds in northern Syria. The Kurds there have 0 interest in a war though Erdogan wants in to drive votes.
Both Kurds and Turks are voting in majority to Erdogan. I've also stated that the opposition coalition running against Erdogan is getting almost no votes from Kurds which you conveniently ignored. The only reason I brought this up in the first place was that people keep saying Kurds are suffering under Erdogan, while Kurds keep voting for him. I stand by my argument until you prove it otherwise.
Kurds are not PKK, don't refer to them as the same thing. We've been living with our Kurdish brothers and sisters (there are 15 million Kurds in Turkey), while PKK kidnaps Kurdish children from their families to raise as militants.
Also, Islamism has been pushed to Kurds and supported by all the Turkish governments as a way subduing the Kurdish national rights.
I won't argue that they have engaged in terrorist tactics, but again, when your cultural identity and your rights are being taken from you just because of your ethnicity, can't say I blame the Kurds.
To be fair, you guys tried eliminating anything culturally Kurdish(to the point where speaking Kurdish was punishable), which is still genocide.
