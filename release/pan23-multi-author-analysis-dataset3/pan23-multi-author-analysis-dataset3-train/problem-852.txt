"We've gotten into physical fights" does not and should not imply that Dad is hitting children. OP didn't say that Dad committed assault.
There are several instances where the term "physical fight" could have different interpretations. I'll let you ponder that. Here's one example: Teen is mad at Dad. Teen screams at Dad and strikes father out of anger. Dad puts up arm to protect face, then grabs teens arm to prevent second blow.... whatever....
Both parents will always love you. These difficult times will pass. Most judges will honor your requests if you articulate your living preferences.
At your age, the court will usually consider your preferences. However, it's extremely unlikely your father would get 0 custody. Your mother could get primary physical custody and maybe you see dad every other weekend representing like an 85-15 time split. For your dad to get 0%, usually there would be finding of physical/sexual abuse or something similar. You can tell the court about any physical abuse you mention in your post.
I've read posts already encouraging the abuse route... only you know what you've endured. If you've suffered real abuse, you know what to do...
