So the Russians lost the element of surprise and suffered heavy losses to move up closer to Ukrainian guns. Ukrainian learned their lessons from Soledar and counter-attacked early and in force, negating meager Russian gains.
- Ukraine needs more and better trained soldiers to fight the Russian invasion forces. In addition, they need to increase their competence in several professional fields. It is important that Norway takes its share of this and contributes where we can, says Gram.
- The training will complement the other training initiatives. Our contribution will strenhen the overall training effort and will be welcomed by both Ukraine and our allies. We will help quickly increase the capabilities of Ukrainian soldiers and increase the total number of soldiers western countries can train, says Gram.
Ukraine will have a significant need for military support going forward and training an important part of this support.
Norway is already contributing to the training of Ukrainian soldiers through Operation Interflex in Great Britain. This effort will continue in 2023, and the number of instructors will increase. Norway also contributes financial support and instructors to the EU's training mission, and Norway will help train Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal officers.
- Norway will train Ukrainian specialists in sanitation, sharpshooting and team leader training, says Defense Minister Bj√∏rn Arild Gram (Sp).
