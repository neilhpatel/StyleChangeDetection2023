Some Parisians or Londoners spend 4 hours a day commuting. When they manage to get away from their capitals and find jobs in smaller cities, an hour long commute seems short to them. It feels way too long for people used to living in these smaller cities.
I’ve never attempted such a drive but I think driving to Portugal from the UK would take more than a day.
In smaller cities, people who pursue the dream of a home™ will have to do the same: buy in a village or town situated 10, 20, 30 kms (or more) away from the city. Driving into the city at peak hour with all the other happy house dwellers will lead to congestion thus long commutes.
In capital cities it is almost impossible to find a location suitably situated for two working adults. Most of the time you need to get far from downtown because it’s unaffordable to live there. At least one of the adults will have to travel to work, sometimes to the other side of the city. Hence two hours in cars, trains and/or mass transit to get to work.
Wait I don’t understand why are commutes four hours in the city? And still one hour in the country? Can’t you drive to Portugal within that time??
