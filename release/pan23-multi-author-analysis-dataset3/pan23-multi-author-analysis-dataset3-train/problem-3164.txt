I wonder if itâ€™s a thing to hide tracking devices deep inside tanks in case of capture, so that if the other side proceeds to use them you have important information (although they could trick you into thinking their army is somewhere else if they found out what you were doing). I feel like it probably is.
Yep. I don't think enough people understand the demographuc,economic, and social consequences that all these missing you men will have. Russia was just getting out of the demographic problems from the economic problems of the 90s. As long as Europe doesn't loose their nerve, which they are VERY likely to do, this is going to cause generational problems for that country.
Their biggest problem is going to be that this is happening in one of the ripples from the missing generation of the world wars. It's going to fuck their population distribution up in a way we haven't seen in modern times.
It didn't really do that the last two times. And honestly losing a couple hundred thousands out of 70+ million is not really going to make that much of a difference.
