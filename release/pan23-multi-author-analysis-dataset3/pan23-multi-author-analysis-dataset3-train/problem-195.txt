how has it been debunked? it was used as a focal point by the nazis which contributed to their rise to power. If Germany hadn't been humiliated (economically and otherwise) I don't think the situation for the Nazis to arise would have been possible.
My dude, if they tried to cripple Germany any more than they did they would have dramatically worsened the lives of Germans far far more, making a much higher percentage of the population prone to extremism.
If you try to do that to Russia today (you can't) then it won't just be the top cronies and head of state wanting Western blood, it'll be the whole Russian population.
"Oh, ye Gods Russia is overrun with Mongoloids But what if I were to kidnap Ukrainian children of Slavic descent and pass them off as Russian citizens? Delightfully devilish, Putin.".
Privyet. American here. I lived with some Russians once, have a Ukrainian friend, even know a Belarusian girl. I know you're all normal humans. Some people perhaps haven't had interactions with that culture. I for one love your culture, very solid. I tried learning Russian, no class at my university, but oh well. So we don't all hate you man, but this IS America, we've got our problems as well. I just hate your asshole president and government lol. But good luck to you friend, and be safe. Poka.
