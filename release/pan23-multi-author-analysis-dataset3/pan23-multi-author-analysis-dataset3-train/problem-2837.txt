In almost all aspects of his life, from birth to death, Genghis Khan had acted with decisiveness - a force that none could resist or dispute. Yet, when if came ultimately to the question of his own succession, he proved curiously - and ultimately for the sake of his own dynasty, fatally - uncertain. In the years prior to his death, Genghis had convened his four prime sons - those born to him by his queen, Börte: Jöchi, Chagatai, Ögedei, and Tolui. He had asked their opinions and for their mutual assent on choosing from among themselves a successor. He felt it important, it seems, to maintain the ancient tradition of the khuriltai, or election via unanimous acclaim, in the rites of the Great Khan. The tradition held that, while there would indeed be a large ceremony with all the Mongol nobles and notables on the steppes along the Kherelun River, first the "inner court" would pre-determine among themselves who would get the top job, and the great gathering would simply affirm it.
Very good write-up! I'd say you've covered quite well the sort of unachievable, deified legacy of which not only Khubilai - but all of the various scions of the Borjigins post-Genghis - felt about the First Khaghan. It's certainly telling that Khubilai made sure to enshrine his grandfather as the "Founding Ancestor" (太祖 Tàizǔ) of the Yuan Dynasty, even as it became only the most sinified fragment of Genghis' once pan-Asiatic Great Mongol Empire.
Chinggis Khan (the Mongolian pronunciation of Genghis), despite his rather negative portrayal in most western literature from the 13th century to present, has quite a different reputation among the Mongols and many inner Asian peoples, dating right back to his final years. By the time of his death in August 1227, Chinggis Khan had brought the Mongol tribes from near total disunity, to near total domination of much of Asia. To quote Timothy May:
