And probably further advanced US interests waaaay more than that dollar amount would in other ways. Foreign countries love American things that go boom.
Exactly. Any confrontation with Russia would, basically, require an ally to get punched in the face . Then NATO would respond with force. So for whoever ends up as the initial recipient of Russian aggression, life would suck.
I find it hilarious though, that Russia fighting pretty much any of its neighbors, will be fighting AGAINST their own weapons (until the NATO stuff gets brought out).
considering the state of the Russian military, I get the feeling that the big hitters wont even need to turn up to stop a russian invasion anymore. The Baltics can probably hold them back on their own as it is.
The Baltic states aren't exactly in the best position when it comes to a Russia vs NATO conflict. Russia could relatively easily take them and there's not a ton NATO could do about it directly due to the lack of overland supply routes. They know their best bet is to make sure Ukraine weakens Russia considerably.
Those guns can currently slow down Russia much more effectively in Ukraine. If Ukraine gets enough weapons to get significant victories against the invaders, us in the Baltics will have plenty of "safe" time to replenish our weapon stocks before Russia can mount an attack again.
