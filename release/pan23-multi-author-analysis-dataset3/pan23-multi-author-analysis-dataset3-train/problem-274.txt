Are the police in possession of enough facts to support at least probable cause that a crime had been committed and the potential arrestee is the person who committed it?
It’s a piece of paper in which the officer says, “Here are all the facts that I know that establish probable cause, and I swear under the pains and penalties of perjury they are true.”.
An affidavit is a written statement of facts and circumstances, offered under oath or affirmation and potentially carry a penalty for perjury if it contains falsehoods.
Then the answers is about a day, or less. The arresting officer prepares an affidavit that lays out the facts and circumstances that establish probable cause, goes before a judge, and the judge reviews the affidavit. If he or she agrees that the warrant establishes probable cause, he or she can issue an arrest warrant.
But I asked you if the police could establish probable cause, you said they could, and I based my answer on that assumption.
Let's say they have enough facts to at least support probable cause that a crime has been committed. But the crime was committed online using an application like discord . They dont want to delay the arrest.
