As you've pointed out, the black population in Canada has been historically quite a bit lower than the black population of the United States - and since the NHL has historically been predominantly Canadian - it would explain the low numbers of black hockey players in the NHL from a historical perspective.
It is because the sport of hockey (and the NHL itself) started in Canada. Before the 1940s, hockey simply was a predominantly Canadian sport - with mostly Canadian based teams, and an overwhelmingly Canadian player base.
There was also an issue of racial segregation. Canada did not have the types of codified racial segregation that many US states had in the 20th century - but there was still a social sentiment that favored racial segregation.
Consider that demographically, Canada has been a much more homogeneous country than the US, with a higher percentage of the population being white (that is to say, of European descent). This of course means that proportionally there are fewer black (and other minorities; see below) to play the sport. However it is worth noting that they did play it, even if the numbers were small. As mentioned the Coloured League existed in the Maritime provinces at the turn of the century, which shows that there were enough black players to form a league, albeit a small regionalised one. But even after that there is the fact that the main hockey-playing countries all have small numbers of black and other ethnic minorities. Even the parts of the US that are most into hockey, the Northeast and Minnesota, are some of the whitest parts of the US, so demographically it was always going to be a struggle.
So /u/Oldmanthrowaway12345 has pretty much given a great answer, but I'll add a little more, and provide some reading:
