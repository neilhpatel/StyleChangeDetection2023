There isn't a federal level protection for vacation time. An employer can force you to use PTO for absences from your core work hours, until your PTO drops to zero. At that point, they cannot decrease your pay, as long as you perform some work during that work day.
Another question would be, is there a minute/hourly threshold that salaried workers can be late per day or pay period before deductions can occur? Obviously I wouldnâ€™t do this but if I wanted to show up only 1 hour every day will they still be required to pay my full salary? Until they fire me of course haha. But I have the email where my employer says they will deduct our pay if no vacation time is available, this is clearly illegal, right?
The first is "can they deduct vacation time?" . The only rule in NJ is that if there's an employee handbook or policy that promises payout when someone leaves, then that must be honored.
Nope. DOL regs state that if you're salaried, you get paid your salary, and that deductions are not kosher except for missing whole days (or summative whole days). They can fire you for being one minute late (or for wearing mismatched socks, or for having a moustache of a certain style, or for breathing funny, or for any other non-protected reason), but they can't take your money.
My read of the DOL policy the answer is that the answer is "one day." As long as you do at least SOME work on a given day, then you are due your salary for that day. (EDIT: This is not to say that if you miss, say, half a day on Monday and half a day on Tuesday, they couldn't take it away. They maybe could, as a suspension on Wednesday. That's a bit more nuanced and I'm not sure that I'm entirely certain on this part of the topic.).
Yes. And as another poster pointed out, you should take this as a clue that this employer is run by people who don't care about you.
