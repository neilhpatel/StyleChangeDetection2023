We technically can produce more oil barrels than we use in a year, but it's the wrong type of oil, so we still import about 40% of our total oil use per year.
Alright then. I'm going to continue to get my information from places that are not investment funds, and are able to produce their data not in YouTube video format. Have a good one.
Our refining capacity is for oil that comes from the middle east and Russia. If we would have invested in refinement capacity in the past to be able and refine all of the crude we produce, we could be oil independent. As of now we are reliant on foreign imports.
Aside from the weird politics surrounding protecting the planet. It's just the right thing to do national security wise. Why would we want to be dependent on places like Saudi Arabia and Russia? True energy independence will come from renewable energy production.
Primary energy, in this analysis, comprises commercially traded fuels and modern renewables. It doesn’t include Biomass (6% of global supply) or geothermal. As a percent of the total it’s lower than stated in the article.
