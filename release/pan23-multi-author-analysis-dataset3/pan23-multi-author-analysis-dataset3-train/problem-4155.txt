Legally, no, but if they levy against your bank account they'll take whatever is in there, and you'll have to go to court & prove it was SSI funds, which will be inconvenient and time consuming.. If you tell them in advance that the funds are exempt then they won't try to take them (or, if they do, you can sue them.).
P.S. If the creditor refuses to talk to you because all responsibility has been handed over to the collection agency, I would still try and negotiate a monthly payment plan with the agency before giving up. They would rather have some money than none, in most cases.
DO NOT just think you can dodge this. AT BEST, you will have a delinquency shown on the reports maintained by the credit agencies. This will dramatically lower your credit score and thus impact your ability to get credit, rent an apartment, buy a car, etc. The creditor could further decide to pursue this in court. If you don’t show up in court, the case will automatically be decided against you AND court fees and costs may be added. Moreover, some debts will continue to accrue interest, so that soon the amount you owe could be exponentially the size of the original debt.
The debt may continue to grow but after the ten year mark it’s considered time barred and they can’t sue me for it any more.
