I'm wondering why in 2022 there is any objection? As a non-voting member would they really have any power other than to voice concerns for the Cherokee people?
Second I agree with the argument that the delegate represents the tribal government and tribe as a whole rather than individual members of the tribe. Tribes are recognized as "dependent nations" and while states are representation at the federal level, tribes have no official representation. As I said before, coexistence requires cogovernance.
So I will just speak as a citizen aware of the objections. There are currently 3 federally recognized tribes affiliated with the Cherokee, The Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee, and the Keetoowah. One question at hand is, which tribe is the "true successor" deserves the promised delegate?
To the first point, I am a massive advocate of repealing the Reapportionment Act of 1929 and expanding the House as it is massively underrepresenting the total population as it is. That being said all tribes should receive a delegate. Landback means coexistence and that starts with cogoverning.
Another argument is the concern that this violates the one-person one-vote precedent. The Cherokee Nation is located in North East Oklahoma, currently represented by OK-2. The counter to this is that the delegate is representing the body of the tribe, rather than its individual members. It's important to remember that tribal governments are sovereign governments recognized by the United States through treaties. Whereas typically a Congressional rep represents individual members of a district and not a government.
