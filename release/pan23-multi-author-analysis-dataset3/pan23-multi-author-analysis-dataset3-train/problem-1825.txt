Changing windows is moderately technical, even if you are keeping the frame and replacing just the window system (pop out old window and replace with new window with identical dimensions) - especially when it's a cold time of the year.
Another easy, low cost, low technical way to insulate your windows without replacing is by removing the frame around the window (wood detailing that is really just hiding where the drywall ends and your actual window frame begins) exposing the wooden frame everything is mounted on, and spraying (window and door specific!) insulation foam in the gaps to eliminate draft as much as possible.
Having a single pane glass isn't great, but it's a million times better than double/triple pane with 0 insulation around the frame and allowing draft to enter the home.
If you're still on single pane windows it's worth upgrading, but the improvement from double to triple pane is not big enough to justify the cost usually. At least not compared to other insulation measures.
Replacing your old windows without also improving your home's insulation is a recipe for mold problems. The windows should be the coldest point in the room, otherwise the moisture will cling to the walls.
Whenever there's a cold/windy day, trace your hands around the window to feel for cold air. You can also visually check for condensation lines around areas where your window moves/tracks for proof of steep temperature gradients and need for something to stop the draft.
