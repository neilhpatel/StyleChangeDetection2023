Can't speak for agriculture but I think it's a stretch to say it would destroy the restaurant industry. I know different parts of the country are different but I've worked in many restaurants in a few different states and not come across any undocumented immigrants. J1s, COFA immigrants, immigrants in general, but everywhere I've been if you can't prove you can work legally, your application goes in the trash.
I mean have you ever tried to sponsor employee visas it’s a money pit and a fucking disaster of a process omfg - two , three , five years ffs - I don’t blame them for hiring illegal folks.
Officially it's already a federal crime for the employer to hire undocumented workers, except in the case where they do the whole I-9 thing as required and fake paperwork genuinely fools the employer. Enforcement against businesses is approximately nil, but any administration that wanted to make it a DOJ enforcement priority absolutely could without further legislation or regulation.
From this article in Food and Wine, they link to an estimate that 10% of restaurant workers nationwide are undocumented, and 40% in urban areas. Clearly not everywhere, but clearly not rare.
