“People are saying that Trump Party is one of the great third parties, possibly the greatest seen since the late great Theodore Roosevelch and the Bull Moose Party. Teddy Roosevelch. Teddy is what I call him. I invented that nickname. Teddy. One of the greats. ”.
Edit: Oh my goodness. The gerrymandering when DeSantis literally shut the wifi off in the state building when actually good representatives started protesting. He kicked out all reporters forcefully and refused to acknowledge it too. He bypassed the house to draw his own map, and his cronies let him.
Ah- So in the article, it links to a tweet by @CurtisHouck, who posted the images from Trumps' statement.
It would tie into the entire ring of Roger Stone, the Miami Proud Boys, Seminole counties' Tax Collector scandal tied to Gaetz, the FPL donations and other companies suddenly flooding the 'Friends of DeSantis' PAC funds after he got Trumps recognition initially, etc.
Bill Nelson also warned as much, and rang the alarm bells. A few critical races were incredibly close. Might be why they also tried to bring Dominion voting machines into a huge lawsuit. To get people off the trail of ES&S machines.
