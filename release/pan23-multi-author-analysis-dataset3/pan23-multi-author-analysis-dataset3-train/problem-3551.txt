I’m just relaying my experiences my dude and your getting wildly combative about it. Yes people have heard different slurs against them I was just saying I haven’t heard this personally even though I’ve heard many racial slur levied against me. You going into your meltdown is why we can’t have discussions about shit like this.
No one called you a liar. I’m saying I haven’t heard it before and most people that saw this haven’t heard it before so it’s a very niche racial slur. Changing names of things because a extremely small minority saw it as a slur isn’t how we combat racial injustice. I’ve been called stupid shit like tar baby but j don’t think that the North Carolina Tar Heels should change their name. It’s about context. Redskins with the obviously racist caricature of an native person is obviously not very cool. Attaching racism to things that are super loosely related to it diminishes the actual problematic behavior. It emboldens racists when we grasp at straws because it gives them ammo to say “look they’re being ridiculous about this so everything they say is racist is ridiculous”.
If you hear the word "brownie" and associate it with something racist, that makes you come across as way more racist then the person innocently saying it.
Either this means I haven't been around enough racist people, or I've been around much more racist people.
Someone said nobody ever uses it as a racist term, I said people do. That's it. The end. Nothing more, nothing less. You don't need to read between the lines, it's not that cryptic if you're not a moron.
Imagine defending racists. It doesn't look good. You may as well start spamming the N word for all this conversation is worth.
