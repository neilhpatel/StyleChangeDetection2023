What u/Hurin88 said is true, the term “Franks” could include people that we might describe as Italians and Germans. Muslim authors typically always called the crusaders “Franks” as well (“Ifranj”), although they did sometimes distinguish between French, German, and English crusaders.
While "Frank" or "Latin" might be good signifiers for Western Christians as a whole, the Crusades were hundreds of years after "Frankish" identity would actually have been significant. In contrast the first part of the crusades was not that far at all from the Norman conquests of England and Sicily, so the cultural and linguistic connections between the French, English, and Norman Italians would have been relatively close, and their connection with Germans would have been much less close.
So, whenever you read about “Franks and Normans”, it’s actually just a convenient shorthand for the majority of people who participated in the First Crusade and who stuck around afterwards to create ruling dynasties. But they weren’t all literally Franks and Normans, and they quickly intermingled with other Western Europeans, as well as Greeks and Armenians.
