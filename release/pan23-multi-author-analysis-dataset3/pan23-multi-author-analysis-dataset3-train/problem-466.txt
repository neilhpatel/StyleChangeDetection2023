Former StUffz here, you are only partly right. Rheinmetall is telling the german Government they need that long. KMW, the main manufacturer of the Leopard, already said that they would need less than a month to get a Brigade Size Force of Leopards ready for transfer. Its a big lobbyism work and deals between Rheinmetall and the German Government. Germany could send around 60-80 tanks for sure, but only if new expensive contracts are signed again in Rheinmetall's Favor. The whole German Defense Apparat is a clusterfuck.
It's not about Germans having not enough tanks. They need to give permission for others to give German tanks to Ukraine.
This is about sending western tanks TO Ukraine. Not refreshing the supplies of those who send older tanks. As in the poland example, up until a point nobody would send western tanks to Ukraine, only older mostly Soviet stock.
It's not like anyone west of Ukraine needs the tanks for "just in case" either, because Ukraine is the one keeping russia away from them in the first place. This is the war that everyone beefing up defense during the cold war+ has been waiting for.
