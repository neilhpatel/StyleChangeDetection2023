Proving he is unfit is extremely difficult, and also him signing away his rights isn't a real option. You need to talk to a lawyer, if he decides that he wants visitation with the child you can argue that it should be supervised die to drug use but realistically if a dad wants visitation he will get it in some form.
Not having any contact at all with you while pregnant is going to have little to no effect on future custody proceedings. Just wait a month and listen to your lawyer.
I came here first because my lawyer wants to wait to discuss it to see if he gets put in prison next month or not. And honestly I can't tell if him no longer trying to have any contact with me or want details about my son is his unspoken way of telling me to eff off and that he doesn't care.
My lawyer did tell me that with the past evidence that the court has found in the past of him, neglecting his current child, drug use and violence that it wouldn't be difficult to prove him unfit. I'm more trying to decide if i should take him to court over custody or wait and see if he decides to take me to court.
