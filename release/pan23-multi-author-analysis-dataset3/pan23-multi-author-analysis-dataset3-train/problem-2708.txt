If the constitution hasnâ€™t changed how can it go from unconstitutional to constitutional. It always was and is either constitutional or unconstitutional, it may have just been interpreted wrong at some point.
The judge overturned the law on the basis that it was unconstitutional at the time the law was enacted. He acknowledged the state legislature could pass a law now, and it would not be invalid by the same reasoning.
This is not some great win for abortion rights, it's just a temporary reprieve. It appears the judge supports the right to abortion and looked for a way to block this particular law.
as long as roe v. wade stood, all bans on abortion before viability would be considered unconstitutional. therefore, regardless of what some members thought, or the wording of their decision, if the law was passed prior to dobbs then the law was going to be unconstitutional.
To add on to it that the overturning is retroactive would mean that every legislative act that was previously ruled invalid was actually valid, and so is now in effect, and always was in effect. That could mean people who were deemed not guilty are actually guilty and can be sent to jail; that actions that were legal are now, suddenly, retroactively a crime; and so on.
Stare decisis is an important principle. SCOTUS shouldn't overturn precedent without good reason, because overturning a long established precedent has extreme ripple affects.
