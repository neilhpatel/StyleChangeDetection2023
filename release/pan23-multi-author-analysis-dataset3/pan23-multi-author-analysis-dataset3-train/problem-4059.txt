True, if a stranger in Sweden has the possibility to choose a free seat, and still sits down next to you on a bus, run. That's the situation those hammers to break bus windows are for.
The land of coffee and hard liquor for a reason I guess. And online gaming nowadays, cause who doesn't prefer being a cool elf to going outside in -30 degrees Celsius. (although sunny spring days, when you take a walk and hear the crackling sound of the snow beneath you, with a thermos filled with hot chocolate in your backpack are pure bliss).
And yes! Northern parts of Swedena re very nice, and the Stockholm archipelago is lovely in the summer too .
Norwegian nature seems like Swedish nature but even prettier in pictures. I really need to visit just for the scenery around Bergen or the archipelago around Lofoten. What is the best norwegian hot chocolate?
Ooh, you are a seasoned hot chocolate connaisseur . I'll ahve to try it. Do you really add cinnamon? Is it good? I made a banger cinnamon syrup a couple of days back to make a cocktail, so I kind of have to try it.
If you make the hot choccy from scratch with cocoa and then dunking in loads of sugar in a cooking pot, I think you'll be happy. In my family we just buy baking cocoa and sweeten it while cooking. Reaaally unhealthy, but that way you can add liquor, or add kanel or some vanilla haha.
