yea lukashenka needed putins dogs to beat down the belarussian uprising after the election was rigged in lukashenkas favor (pathetic). he is on very thin ice. lukashenka won't fight a war against ukraine but a civil war against his own people.
The Belarusian people don't want any part in murdering innocent Ukrainians for Putin or his lapdog Luka. There are Belarusians actively fighting and dying for Ukraine against Russia.
Luka and Putin both know the Belarus military is not in a position to actively fight in the war. But the point of statements like this is to maintain a constant threat of the possibility that they could.
They can't send their army in because it would get shredded against a well defended, and prepared Ukrainian army at the border.
Its more like they don't want to be in the war at all and would rather not kill Ukrainians. Its no secret that if Putin wasn't backing Lukashenko, his ass would have been overthrown and locked away forever. Most speculate that the military has actively refused his orders to enter Ukraine to assisted the Russian military and only opted to remain at their posts.
