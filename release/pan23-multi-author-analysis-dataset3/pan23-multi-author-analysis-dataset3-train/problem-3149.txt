It's hard to keep up with them. First, they don't want votes counted out of secured boxes, then they do? It really just boils down to count our votes only, and everyone else's are "compromised" or "illegal.".
Also. Reading the mueller report. His conclusion was that Donald Trump would be indicted based on his findings had he not been president. He also concluded that the Trump campaign was receiving info from Russia, but was too dumb to execute. Look, I can post articles too….
Yes, there was some cloudy evidence of 2016 election fraud l. However, Hillary did not show up on camera at 3am and declare victory. You’re grasping at straws friend.
So… I missed the part where Hillary Clinton filed lawsuit after lawsuit, failed to concede the presidency, then talked her followers into subverting democracy and storming the capitol building. Am I missing something?
Cool… again. When did the left begin ridiculous lawsuits and advocating for the overthrow of government after they lost? You can’t see the forest through the trees.
