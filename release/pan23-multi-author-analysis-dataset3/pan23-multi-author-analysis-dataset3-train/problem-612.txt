Others have pointed out the risks involved here concerning your parents' finances. Another thing you need to be aware of is that if you go through this, you're going to lose the opportunities you get as a first time home buyer with any future mortgages you decide to take on.
As a guarantor, you will not have any legal interest in the property, and for example would not be able to force a sale to cover the mortgage if your parents fall behind.
Your parents can't "remove you from the mortgage" until they can afford to refinance it, and until they find a lender willing to agree. Their promise to take you off is meaningless and if you agree to guarantee their loan, you should plan on being on the hook for the life of the loan (25-30 years), not just for the near future. Their six month estimate is wildly out of line with anything that's likely: if they were able to do that, they'd also be able to secure a loan now.
Your parents can't afford the amount of debt they're trying to take on - if they could, their bank would lend them the money without a cosigner. That risk doesn't go away just because you act as a guarantor, as your signature doesn't change their finances, and if they default, you're on the hook.
