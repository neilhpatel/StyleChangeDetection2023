The thing is, he’s trying to get on the Israelis’ good side so hard, to the point where it’s just begging at this point. Israel isn’t going to let Ukraine use weapons that will be used on the Russians, especially as it would put them in the crosshairs of the Russians in Syria.
Second, if the impossible happens and Ukraine invades Israel, it’d just get nuked in exchange. Not that complex.
Israel’s most powerful enemies are not the Palestinians, but Hezbollah and Iran. Since Russia controls Syrian skies, Israel would have a much easier time bombing Hezbollah and Iran. Israel and Russia have an on-going deconfliction mechanism which enables Israel to continuously bomb Syria, which we have seen hundreds of times in the last years.
Israel would hold the logistical advantage relative to Ukraine, and certainly has a much more capable military anyway.
What’s gonna happen when Ukraine is armed with the best military technology on the planet and then turn on the providers of such equipment and March on Israel? It’s become increasingly clear that a lot of the boots on the ground on the Ukrainian side are vitriolic racist neo nazis.
