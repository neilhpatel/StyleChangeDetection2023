Even if they don’t respond to wrecks by sending an officer, you can still file a report. In my state (Washinon), we never get officers for an accident unless there is an emergency. You file the report online through the PD’s website. But that at least creates a report you can submit to the insurance company.
I would go through your insurance. They will pay out to fix your car (minus your deductible) then they will subrogate to attempt to collect from the other person's insurance. Given that you have multiple people claiming to have seen her hit your car and she gave you her information after the accident you have a strong claim and will most likely win in the end. After subrogation you will get your deductible refunded if they successfully collect. Since the other insurance company has already said they don't want to pay, subrogation will likely take several months because it will likely go through arbitration, but you should win in the end.
Then the insurance company appoints different people to represent each party and they follow pretty much the same process except it's all internal. With accidents you are more likely to end up with outcomes where the insurance company tries to get both parties to split liability when there is only one insurance company, but OP didn't have an accident there was only one car that was being driven the other was parked so splitting liability shouldn't be on the table.
It is unlikely. If subrogation is successful then there is no chance of your rates going up. But if they are unable to get the money back in subrogation then it depends on your policy, how the claim is filed, how much damage was done, your state laws, and your insurance company's internal rules.
It depends on how many claims you file within a policy period, how much is paid out, and if you were ticketed for anything, also a multitude of other factors. Make sure you get your neighbors info to give to your insurance for a statement as well.
