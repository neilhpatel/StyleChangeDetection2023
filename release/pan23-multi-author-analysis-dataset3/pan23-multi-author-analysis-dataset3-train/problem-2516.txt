This is an interesting question and I'm going to say off the bat that I don't think I have a definitive answer, but I have some useful information.
That's what I mean though - believe it or not I think it might all be the same flag, ie the tricolor hoisted on the barricades of the Russian White House. I'm seeing different pictures of the protest on different days from different angles and with different people alongside it...but actually just the one tricolor flag. I'm not discounting that there were more, but I'm not actually finding a photo with multiple tricolor flags in it (I could be wrong and would be interested to see such a picture if it exists).
Not to discount this answer in regard to Moscow, but there is at least this photo, supposedly of Leningrad (not St Petersburg for another couple weeks IIUC), showing many tricolor flags:
What's interesting about this flag is that it was actually made by artists Konstantin Zvezdochetov and Andrei Filippov for an art installation. Zvezdochetov attended the protests on August 19 and brought the flag along with him (apparently to protect himself from the wind while protesting), and then donated it to the protestors. So it's a little bit of an accident and some artistic coincidence that this flag was at a protest and then prominently used on the barricades, and then captured on video and in photos by the world media.
