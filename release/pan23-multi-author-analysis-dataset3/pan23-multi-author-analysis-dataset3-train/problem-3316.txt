That was my first thought as well, but how can they even think that they could bring that up in litigation? Maybe they were going to try to blackmail OP into a favorable settlement, but if OP already has her own lawyer, I don't know how they could think that would get past them.
I am wondering if your exâ€™s attorney is trying to lure you into something to use against you in court by showing you have a questionable character.
Does the attorney realize who you are, or is it possible this is a coincidence? And are you represented by your own attorney?
First, he shouldn't be contacting a represented adverse party. Second, he's actively creating a conflict by trying to form a relationship with an adverse party. It's wildly inappropriate.
This is completely inappropriate - professionally and personally. If the facts are as you present them, your ex's attorney will be well on the way to being disbarred. Imagine all that money and all that school, literally flushed down the drain because the attorney couldn't keep his thirst in check.
This is definitely NOT okay, and you are definitely not crazy. You did the right thing by sending the screenshots to your attorney.
And while it's gross for you to be on the receiving end of this person's incredibly poor judgment, imagine how bad it is going to be for your ex. He's about to find out that the person he has been paying (tens of?) thousands of dollars to represent him went out of their way to create a conflict, and has likely intentionally misrepresented the client's interest in the process.
So sorry that you have to deal with this, and for the prolonging effect it's likely to have on the divorce process.
