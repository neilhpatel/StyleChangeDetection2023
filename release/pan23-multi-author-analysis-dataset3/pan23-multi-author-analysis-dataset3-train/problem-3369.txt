What are universities, by the way? Education was in the early Middle Ages generally the domain of monasteries, and then it shifted to cathedral schools in the 11th century (these taught canon law and the sacraments) and then universities came to dominate in the twelfth century. The word ‘university’ derived from ‘universitatis magistrorum et scholarium’ (‘guild of masters and scholars’). Initially, universities didn’t have campuses, but were based on space rented in town centres. Each was unique too. Bologna had a legal specialisation, and was student-paid; Oxford was crown-paid; and Paris had a theological specialism, and was Church-paid. Universities were also centres of satire, drinking, gambling, and prostitution. There were other institutions with subject specialisms too, such as the medical school at Salerno.
Salerno became famous for medicine with its Scuola Medica Salernitana. They benefited from a treasury of old sources such as older medical texts, some Arabic originals, some translations of Greek physicians like Hippocratus and Galen. The school had in its library the translations and adaptations of "Al-malaki" of Ali ibn Abbas, the study of ophthalmology of Hunayn bin Ishaq and the "Viaticus" of Ibn al Jazzar.
A studium generale welcomed students from the whole Latin Christendom and differed from the "studium particulare" which had only local significance. The presence of foreign students in Cambridge is mentioned in a 1231 writ of Henry III: there were three Scotsmen, two Frenchmen and a Spaniard. There was also "studium generale respectu regni" or a studium attracting students from within its own kingdom only (such were some Spanish universities founded by royal authority).
