The US has been fucking wild with weather. I was in Arkansas a week or so back and it was -2 with windchills at -10. Get home to Michigan and the next week all the snow is melted and it’s raining.
My winter sucks, 10°C, rainy and low thicc clouds, so my window just shows dark white for too long now.
I'm in South Georgia and christmas weekend was the coldest it has been here since I moved here in 2007. That, or it was like 2 degrees short of coldest ever. But, I'm pretty sure it was coldest ever. The weather dropped to like 16 or 18 degrees. A lot of winters here never drop below 30.
Can they mount a counter offensive in freezing weather with feet of snow? Isn't that as bad as mud? It seems like Russia can't go super offensive either. And It seems to me that any kind of stalemate benefits Ukraine(I could be wrong about this though).
This has really screwed up Putin's plans to control Europe by cutting off gas so at least for this winter, it's a good thing. Not good in the long term, but if it means Putin loses his war, we should celebrate that at least.
