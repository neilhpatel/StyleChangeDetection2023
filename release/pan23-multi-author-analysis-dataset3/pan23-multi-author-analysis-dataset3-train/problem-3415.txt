1. If your final divorce agreement was done properly, all these issues would be resolved on a full and final basis.
It sounds to me that you had a divorce settlement agreement that you both signed for an uncontested divorce. Typically in these agreements there is a phrase used "relinquish and waive all future claims." I would look into your settlement to see if that phrase or clause is there in the settlement agreement. When you made this agreement did you seek legal counsel? If so I would contact them to ask them about the terms of settlement agreement. Depending on the wording in the agreement and what you signed, these claim for the car and small amounts of marital assets are likely waived or already addressed.
Not only are these two things gross, but theyre not actionable in terms of a lawsuit. He isn't going to be able to go into a small claims court and tell the judge or ALJ that you owed him sex and that the sex amounted to a specific sum of money. I would just stop speaking with him because hes just trying to coerce you into having sex with him. If you are served papers for small claims court, I would speak with the attorney you hired for the original divorce proceedings or look for a an attorney then.
IANA family law attorney but if the divorce paperwork says neither of you is to pay the other any money in the divorce settlement, I’d ignore him. He’s being a jerk. If he wanted money for those things he should have gotten it sorted in the settlement. Also, he is a class A piece of garbage especially for the bit about wanting you to compensate him for not having sex with him. If I were you, I would block him and move on with my life.
