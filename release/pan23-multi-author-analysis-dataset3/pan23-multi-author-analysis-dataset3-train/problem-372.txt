It is, but unfortunately we have the wrong people in power in all countries. They want to prove who has the biggest dick. When in reality people like us lose.
I see what you mean, Russia is having a hard time as it is. Poland intervene could be troubled for Russia. Makes me wonder if Russia actually has powerful missles. If you can't win on ground how can you actually have these nuclear bombs.
If NATO has 200 warheads ready to go which will destroy your country and your best effort is maybe taking out one city, your nuclear posture does not work.
and judging by the way things are with Russia right now, they are closer to perform a SAD (self assured destruction) than actually destroying other countries if they launch a nuke.
If i remember correctly, the budget Russia uses on those several thousand warheads (or whatever they claim to have) is just a bit bigger than what France spends every year to mantain their nukes, that are about 300.
There is no way in hell those russian warheads work as they should, specially when you take into account how much money is diverted to personal gain in the russian military.
Considering how much those missiles rely on complex electronics which Russia has had a bitch of a time importing with the sanctions, i lean towards accidental fuck up.
They wont, because ART. 5 means everyone gets involved, it isnt just Poland, and not everyone wants direct military intervention+Russia has nukes and if all of NATO starts bearing down on them theyre much more likely to use them.
Could they help the Ukrainians reclaim all of their lost territory? yes, the influx of manpower and materials would have been a massive help to the UKR, especially in the early stages of the war, with the current state of the Russian armed forces struggling against just the UKR forces, the combined Polish-UKR forces would like smash the shit outta them.
