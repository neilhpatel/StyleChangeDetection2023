Yup. Corporate lobbying. To date there has not been any evidence presented of CCP spying via Huawei. Yet interestingly after they surpass Apple in global sales suddenly they're a threat.
As a consumer in a post-Snowden world, we actually know factually and have ample evidence that the NSA and by extension the CIA have backdoor access to not only your device history and entire google account, but also to your literal phone conversations, with ample evidence of abuse including spying on spouses. This wasn't without knowledge, Apple, Google, etc cooperated with authorities and put these backdoors in their products for the US gov.
I much prefer an "adversary" of the only government which can litigate against me having my private information than the one which is my "friend.".
And everyone else. I mean, you know in a place like Russia where money talks, probably like a third of their military staff has sold secrets to NATO.
Mainly just being able to hear of Russian moves before Russians make them. It's not normal to be able to predict enemy actions with such ... reliability.
