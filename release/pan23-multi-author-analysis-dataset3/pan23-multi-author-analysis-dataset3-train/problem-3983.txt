People get whipped up into their "just war" frenzy and just start firing wild with opinions that sound like they're from terrible fiction. They don't look at things from the perspective of "Would x country in y situation do this?" Instead it's more like "Would Dr. Evil do this?".
This. Iran still flies F-4 Phantoms. A Vietnam era US jet. The fact that the fly them isn't a shock, it's the fact that they make spare parts for them that is. Same with the F-14 Tomcats.
People can mock the Su-35 all they want, but it's vastly superior to anything in Iran's air force and it instantly makes them a much tougher opponent. Plus they'll get spare parts direct from Russia.
Let's be reasonable here... Russia is getting the better deal. Iran is going "yey airplane We give drone" Russia is thinking "Idiots... they don't even realize we are using THEIR drones somewhat effectively and OUR planes are useless".
All kidding aside, what exactly is Iran going to do with 24 of these planes? Are they going to flex their "air strenh" now?
