Because the price cap affects those shipments which rely on western shipping, transport costs and western insurance.
The sanctions are not imposed on countries, but on logistics and insurance companies that are primarily based in Western countries. You can buy the Russian oil as expensive as you want, but good luck to find a ship that will deliver your oil if it is above the price caps price.
It's about making the rest of the world pay much less for Russian oil than what it's worth. There's a reason why it's seaborne oil, it's because the shipping insurance is owned by Western nations. So if anyone else wants to buy oil from Russia overseas?
the point is to still have Russia supply oil but limit their profits. We don't actually want Russia to stop supplying oil because if they do global prices skyrocket. Yet if we limit them to just enough profit so they don't stop we can limit the amount it helps them in their war effort.
It's actually not sell at a loss, but sell at just enough profit to keep supplying oil but keep those profits at a minimum. The whole point is to keep them supplying oil to keep global prices down but limit how much money they make for their war effort.
