According to 4473 instructions, it does not need to include the words domestic. It is defined as a crime “committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.”.
Was committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.
The system is ridiculous and the laws written even more-so. I spoke with the county clerk of comptroller office and confirmed it's not a DV case. Getting certified copies of disposition now in case the ATF tries anything funny.
This does not clearly indicate my situation. I was the child, the so-called "victim" was my (abusive) father.
