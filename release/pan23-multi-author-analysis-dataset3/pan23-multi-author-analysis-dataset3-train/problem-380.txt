This is what I'm talking about when someone (white) says they're afraid of using "OK" because they might be called a racist.
1) Racists love that fear because it assumes minorities are stupid and waiting to call someone racist. "It's just an OK symbol, they think everyone's a Nazi.".
Well said. It’s scary being next door to this. Watching the speaker fiasco, on top of the absolute bozos that were re-elected recently, the US is going down a scary road. 40% of voters just don’t care who they vote for unless there is an R next to the name. The Republican Party is essentially made up of a few absolute wing nuts, the rest are just plain cowards and/or evil people.
This republican party is nuts. They care more about clicks and chaos than running the government for the people. If the whole country is one vast insane asylum, they're letting the worst patients run the place.
This guy has a lot of gall, throwing out the white power sign. Even if that was not intentional, his character speaks for itself.
