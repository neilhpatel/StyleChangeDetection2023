Thank god it’s rare for anything to happen. The most dangerous part isn’t the bomb squad’s job but actually finding it, because if you don’t know it’s there, you may cause vibration or movement that causes an explosion. Usually these things are found by excavators.
Many bombs are found near railways, as that was crucial war infrastructure during WW2 and therefore heavily targeted.
In every larger German city, there will be evacuations and bomb alarms a few times per year, because some construction effort found an unexploded bomb from air attacks in WW2.
Unexploded bombs from WW2 also, are found all over as well such as unexploded german bombs in UK gardens and I presume similarly the opposite.
Not just landmines, but devices which were supposed to detonate/trigger on impact or after a few seconds, like artillery shells, grenades, bombs, chemical weapon shells etc.
The Chernobyl exclusion zone was literally safer than those parts of France, simply because it's so difficult to safely locate & defuse/remove those unexploded devices.
