Again, wow. That must have taken a lot of courage from those children. Do you know if the white people there knew the significance of the act and recognized it as a gesture of mourning, or did they just dismiss it as “savagery”?
Wow, my stomach twisted with the detail about the schools cutting the childrens’ hair and the association of cutting hair with mourning. Thank you for sharing.
Thank you! So likely its been something spoken about for awhile, and they just needed to wait for the perfect time and technology to uncover, and the right ppl to come fwd. thank you very much for answering and helping me have a better understanding.
I think the answer is a mixture of the above, but I'm sure you have details that would illuminate on this question.
This is a late answer and my understanding is not as extensive as many who have written here, but I hope it helps.
In my understanding of the residential school system (in Canada), the expectation was not one of equality. Racism was innate within the training that children were given. The hope was for girls to be raised to be washer women and housemaids - not the (white) women employing washer women and housemaids. Boys learned handy-work and limited trades - it was never a goal or expectation that they would be business owners, politicians, or other prominent members of Canadian society.
