Like who cares. If it falls, something will replace it. And maybe Twitter has been needing to die for a while.
Are large parts of Twitter a cesspool? Yes, absolutely. Is it still the most efficient way to get important information out to the public? Yes, absolutely.
And why do you keep coming in with these assumptions and ad hominem attacks? I'm not saying everyone uses Twitter, I'm saying it's integrated with our society - and it is.
But the reason all those things are there, is because Twitter is not meant to be a means of communications, but rather a tool to gather information on the consumers' habits and that is their true service.
I agree too, Twitter is now, unofficially, a direct means of communications for any organization or individual to inform the world, all news outlets give tweets as much weight as spoken words right now.
We literally saw a single tweet cost a company billions of dollars recently, I don't know how anyone could argue it isn't integrated into our society right now.
