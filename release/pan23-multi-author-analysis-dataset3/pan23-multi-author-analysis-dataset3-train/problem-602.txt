I just got off the phone with the store's support number on their website. They said the same thing. Because of the graphics card shortage they don't accept returns or exchanges and can't make exceptions. Just like the manager they said since they don't accept returns its impossible for the problem to be on their end and I need to contact the manufacturer.
The box and computer both looked normal. This was a bit over a week ago so I don't remember specifically what it looked like but nothing to make me think there was any funny business before turning it on.
The receipt just lists the model number for the computer. That model number matches the number on the box. The box the computer is in and an invoice inside the box from the manufacturer both list it as having an RTX 3060.
If the box states a RTX3060 and you didn’t get one, you should be able to return for not as described. You might try returning it at a different store and just say it doesn’t work instead of trying to explain the difference between a 2060 and 3060 to people that don’t care or understand.
