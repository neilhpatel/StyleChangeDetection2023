It is discriminatory, but discrimination - even protected class discrimination - is not illegal in this context. Your child's relatives can file for custody on the basis of discriminatory beliefs, and there's not a damn thing you can do to punish them for it or to dissuade them from their beliefs through the courts.
The courts are unlikely to award the child's grandparents sole custody or to remove your child from your care over this, unless there's also concrete evidence you are a danger to your kid in some way. Merely being nonbinary is not dangerous. The courts _are_ somewhat likely to grant the child's grandparents visitation, but not custody, all else being equal, for reasons u/severe_thunderstorm laid out.
Definitely look into the jurisdiction issue as mentioned, although if you had a previous custody order with the father that could be grounds for a judge to grant jurisdiction in that court.
I imagine you and the child’s father had shared custody before his passing, and you were the primary caregiver. If that was/is the case they will have a very hard time getting actual custody.
If they’re reasonable people they will understand they’re not going to be able to see your son 50/50, but they did see him quite a bit before their sons passing. Possibly offer that if they provide transportation he can spend a week with them in the summer, and maybe the weekend before or after Christmas.
