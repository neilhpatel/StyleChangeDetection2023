Ok not crazy if you strictly limit your news and media consumption to one source only and willfully tune out the vast variety of extra data points and platforms debunking the Fox News lies. But sure its not crazy that a crazy person that only listens to one source completely beleives only that source that retracted their own lies.
You might argue it’s crazy to believe that all media but this one specific media outlet is lying, but that’s what manny people believe. More often than not, these people operate on faith — hence their religious disposition. They don’t need facts because they have faith.
This isn’t surprising because you want your delegates to be the most devoted individuals from your party. It just so happens that for Republicans, that also means your most crazy party members.
Another Republican doing what they do. The DNC needs to take this, and so many other examples of Republican fraud- going all the way back to Bush- and show the whole world who the real frauds are.
It simply does not occur to wingnuts that the reason so few Democrats are caught committing fraud is because Democrats are not committing fraud in the first place.
