Everyone is getting confused here. The reason why SpaceX is baulking and limiting use here is due to one very specific example. See, Ukraine has directly integrated SpaceX Starlink terminals into the suicide drone itself. The Starlink terminal is part of the weapon, which in this case is effectively a tv guided torpedo.
This device is supposedly carrying the starlink receivers, meaning that starlink supplied parts are actually an integral part of the weapon. I dont believe there is another case of a guided weapon that is wholly reliant on starlink. Other types of drones or missiles are far too small to carry a starlink antenna. Would possibly classify the receiver as a weapon component under ITAR and subject starlink to export restrictions. Its not that the network is weaponized, its that the actual starlink hardware is weaponized. with spacex being the direct vendor to the UA military.
Gotcha, but space x isn't selling arms, they're selling a service. I'm no lawyer but from what I know you're not responsible for the ways people use your products so long as they're meant to be civilian.
