Fascinating reply, and as a bit of a follow up (if you know or an historian can weigh in), was Donald set up as an archetype of a common character in that era; i.e. prone to temper tantrums, irrational, anger management problems that were seen in other media of that time? Or was it more to contrast with the pleasant demeanor of other disney characters, as in Donald just is, not necessarily connected to tropes in movies or books?
My thinking was that perhaps the artists had decided early on that Donald should remain a bachelor, so that he could have a "love interest", providing room for all kinds of comic situations. Your post seems to confirm that. And then, perhaps someone came up with the idea of adding some younger characters (perhaps to appeal to a younger audience?), but the idea of a single father of three chasing girls was frowned upon at the time, so they decided they should be his nephews. But perhaps this overinterpretation from my side.
Wow, thanks for your extensive and really informative answers. It's amazing how detailed and consistent the back stories are for all these characters.
I am still curious if we know anything about how this situation was perceived at the time? Wouldn't an uncle living with his three nephews be considered a bit unusual?
