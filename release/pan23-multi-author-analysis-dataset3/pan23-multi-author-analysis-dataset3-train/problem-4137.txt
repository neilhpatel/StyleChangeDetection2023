/r/legaladviceofftopic for hypotheticals. People have been saying this for decades and decades. This is not new. In the 60s people stopped paying taxes because of the Vietnam war. Then the IRS told them "do you want to keep your house, because this is how you lose your house" and most people started paying again. And taxes come out of paychecks. SS has issues but not from tinfoil. And if people "walk away from their benefits" then more for you. Also you may be conflating the Department of the Treasury with the Federal Reserve.
But the debate over social security aside, defunding "The Fed" refers to the Federal Reserve system. The Fed is the central bank of the United States, and "defunding" it would be very, very bad.
Along those lines, unless where you live has an extraordinary low cost of living, you're probably not going to be drawing enough in social security to exist in anyway.
The Fed basically is a safety net for banking in the United States. It is the bank for the banks, in addition for regulating and overside of private banking. It's also almost entirely self-funding.
During the 2008 housing crisis, absence of the Federal Reserve would have pretty much resulted in the complete demise of the US dollar and entire collapse of the US economy. Essentially turning us into a third-world country overnight.
