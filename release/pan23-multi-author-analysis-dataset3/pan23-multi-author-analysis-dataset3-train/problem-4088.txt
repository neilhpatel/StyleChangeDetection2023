Consider the possibility that you got a careless driving ticket because the accident was avoidable, by either you not traveling so fast, and/or you leaving adequate room between you and the car in front of you to stop in time.
If you want to drive carelessly in the future, maybe don't go crashing into people and getting the attention of cops who are completely entitled to issue a citation for that.
It doesn't matter why they stopped, what matters is that you control the forward motion of your vehicle and you have an obligation to not hit the vehicles traveling or stopping in front of you. (It would be different if the other vehicle did something other than simply stop... Such as cutting you off.).
2. The driving must be in a manner that either endangers or is likely to endanger a person or property.
"A person who drives carelessly, or without due caution and circumspection, in a manner so as to endanger, or be likely to endanger, a person or property, shall be guilty of careless driving under N.J.S.A. 39:4-97.".
You can be ticketed for stopping without a good reason on a roadway. You might even be considered some percentage at fault in a collision by your insurance. But none of this negates the person behind you from being responsible for stopping their own ass. If you read end someone on the road, you goofed.
