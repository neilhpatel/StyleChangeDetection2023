If you are truly looking to get a full title report (including any liens), then you would need to contact a local title company. As another post mentioned, talk to a local realtor for a recommendation on title company.
If you are just trying to find out the owners name and/or current address, you can use public records for that.
You can look at the land records and tax roll records for Harrison County Mississippi but I think you need to have an address to do a lookup.
Since you are limited to a single property, you should check your county's property appraiser and tax collector site. They can give you a lot of the information you are wondering about.
You could try a title company. They generally handle closings for real estate transactions, so title searches is what they do. If you know a realtor, ask them if there is a title company they prefer working with.
A title search might find any liens on the property. I guess that might be helpful if you are trying to take the property through adverse possession (not sure how that works when there is a lien).
