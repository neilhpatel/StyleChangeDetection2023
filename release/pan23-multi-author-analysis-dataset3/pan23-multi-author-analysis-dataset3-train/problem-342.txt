Stuff like this makes me wonder what the ship is doing. I imagine they're trying to listen in on communications, but what are they listening in on that's of any value? Wouldn't anything sensitive be encrypted? Wouldn't it be easier and cheaper to have a spy or something on land so they wouldn't need such large antennas? What value is this ship giving to Russian intelligence?
Spotting spy ships is something the us military does on the regular. They really don't have very good stealth or field craft.
But a north Korean vessel filled with north Korean soldiers that we already know are incredibly stupid/crazy getting stopped.
My theory is there was an aircraft down or vessel in trouble the Russians were trying to get to, and to avoid an accident the Coast Guard was letting them.
Keep in mind, this happens all day, every day. There are ALWAYS Russian spy ships off US waters. In fact, there are almost always Russian and Chinese spy ships IN US waters.
Given the speed of boats and the nature of American Russian relations. I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that it's always there and they are reporting on it cause money.
