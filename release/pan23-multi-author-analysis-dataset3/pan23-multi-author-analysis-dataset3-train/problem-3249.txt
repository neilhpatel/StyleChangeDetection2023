If these are just generic fabrics intended for home use you need a license for whatever your Etsy stuff. Being on the down low doesn’t mean it’s legal.
You as a producer can’t make things you don’t have the license to do. It’s similar to a print shop and a customer asking hey make me 1k posters of this Avengers poster you bought. Generic fabric without images on it usually don’t have protections.
Does that also affect non-licensed fabric (like plain colors, basic patterns...) ? If so, how would one even go about acquiring the license to create items made from fabric by small companies without contact info ?
Oh great to hear about basic fabrics. Is there any possibility the shoip selling the fabric have a transferrable license ? I know some DIY item do have that kind of thing where you can make items from licensed stuff as long as it's bought from a specific place (I assume it ups the prices since the license likely end up being paid in the price). However I also assume it's likely only "official" stores or companies doing that, and I also wonder if it's possible with fabrics ? Should my relative even bother asking the store about that ?
They're fabric meant for sewing. They're not intended for use as-is, but are supposed to be turned into cushions and other similar stuff. Well I come here exactly to ask that. If I was gonna assume down low is fine but illegal I wouldn't ask for advice. What about if the customer REQUIRES a particular fabric made from licensed stuff, or even provide it themselves ?
If a client sends you trademarked fabric, you can make something from it like an apron or a quilt or whatever.
If the fabric is trademarked (NFL, Harry Potter, Sanrio, etc) you can resell the fabric you have purchased. You cannot create something from it and sell it.
