I remember seeing a lot of those: "Ukraine claimed that they've killed 600 russians today!" and being like: "Mhhhh ... sounds suspicious. Could be propaganda to boost morale.".
I feel a bit bad for all the "low value non-ethnical russians" who get drafted from some poor villages and get forced to go there as canon fodder.
But to be honest, I rather have them get blown up while trying to kill Ukrainians, than Ukrainians who defend their country.
There is no space between those soldiers. Sometimes it seems like that they are almost cuddling while moving in a trench or something similiar.
Then you go to a subreddit like this and see new clips every few hours of some missle attack/drone ammo drops on like 50 russian soldiers in some house and I went like: "Well ... the numbers start to make sense.".
Yeah. Pretty sad the amount of delusional people on these threads that believe UA and NATO are not also using propaganda. It's perfectly normal to have both side use it in a war. It's been like that since the dawn of humanity.
