This is good, but everyone forgets that Trump suddenly fired several key members of the cabinet after he lost the election. And he replaced them with flunkies who he thought would carry out his orders. He really thought that these people would order or carry out his orders to send troops on the capital or do whatever. This is a colossal issue. Was this addressed anywhere?
Edit: the people he appointed were temporary, I think the term is recess appointments. They were not approved by Congress. Perhaps there is a way of taking away that power after an apparent lost election.
2016-2020 he was president and nearly broke our democracy. these last two years he's not and the DOJ and various states are gunning for him. Our democracy still hasn't healed and it definitely isn't going to be repaired until he is held to account.
Nah, listening to the oral arguments o don't see them going all in on that insane theory. I think they'll just use this to expand the federal judiciary's ability to step in if they don't like what's happening with a federal election.
I've seen discussion that SCOTUS won't rule to give the state legislatures any additional powers but will instead rule that SCOTUS themselves can overrule rulings from state judges/Supreme Courts regarding election issues.
