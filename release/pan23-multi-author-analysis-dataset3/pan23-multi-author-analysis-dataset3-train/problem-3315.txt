A “wound” was “piercing of the body by a projectile, a fragment of shell or bomb, or an object set in motion by enemy weapons or by weapons of U.S. or allied forces while engaging the enemy,” or “torn flesh or broken bones received from a moving object propelled by the enemy or by U.S. or allied forces while engaging the enemy,” while an “injury” was an “abrasion...sprain...fracture...[or] concussion...where the body has not been pierced resulting from a source outlined in subparagraph (1), above. Hospitalization must be for twenty-four (24) hours or longer.” Men both wounded and injured were reported as wounded.
I finally found some good data on the casualty breakdown for a typical U.S. infantry division during World War II separated by unit and type, in this case, the 80th Infantry Division. The first table come from a handwritten document compiled by 318th Infantry Regiment machine gunner Robert "Bob" Murrell sometime after the war. It can clearly be seen that assignment to the "tip of the spear" was very hazardous to one's health; infantry regiments incurred the vast majority of all losses, and it was basically a guarantee that assignment to a rifle company meant that one would become some type of casualty at least once.
Looking over the data again, admittedly with minor sleep deprivaton, I'm not quite sure how I see that 'it was basically a guarantee that assignment to a rifle company meant that one would become some type of casualty at least once.' While infantry made up 96.62% of total casualties, that doesn't translate to infantry having a 96.62% casualty rate. I guess what I'm asking is what the actual infantry casualty rate was, as opposed to as a percentage of total losses.
