Interesting, I didn't know that was a thing. Never seen a lease where the term would roll over like that and not simply become month to month without a new signature.
How do you still have a lease after leaving 5 years ago? Surely whatever you signed has expired by now, right? Is the lease now a month to month?... Normally you are on the hook for a month or so up untill the place is rented out again or the lease is over. If your name is still on the lease but it had expired than you are just on the hook for one month.
It could be a month to month lease now, or it could roll over annually, depending on the terms of the lease.
It sounds like the lease is probably month-to-month. The unpaid rent would be the rent from the time that mom & sis stop paying to the time that the landlord completes an eviction. How long this takes depends a lot on covid moratoriums and the functioning of the court.
Some leases also state that the loser in a legal proceeding pays the attorney's fees of the winner. This could be included as well depending on the lease.
You need to know what is on that lease. If you signed and your mother leaves owing money, or has to be evicted, youâ€™ll be liable as will your mother and sister.
When your mother and sister threw you out, you were illegally evicted by them, but that is likely not relevant.
