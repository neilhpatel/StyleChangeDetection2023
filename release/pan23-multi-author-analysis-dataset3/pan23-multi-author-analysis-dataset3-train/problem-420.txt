Two things - Russia didn’t attain air superiority even before western weapons poured into Ukrainian; Russia bombed civilian targets from the very beginning of the war.
So Russia didn't have air superiority over the whole Ukraine, but they were actively blocking Ukrainian air force from doing anything. There were days Ukraine could send 5 sorties and Russia were able to send over 300 that day. Russia could even send T-95s with iron bombs to Mariupol and Ukraine could do nothing about it.
There’s also the case of Russia investing heavily in anti-air rockets like S-400 and S-300s that Ukraine also uses. It just seems like both sides have better air defense than air offense, leading to a stalemate without any air superiority.
The difference is air defense. Ukraine has iirc 200+ S300 SAM systems and thousands of MANPADS. Iraq during the Gulf War had similar numbers of older systems and still managed to down about 100 allied aircraft against the might of the US airforce. Russia simply doesn't have the numbers or technology to degrade Ukraine's AD enough to overwhelm its airforce.
