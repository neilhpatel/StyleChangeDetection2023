And yet, millions of Ukrainians remain displaced, their homes destroyed, and most of their financial lives ruined.
You’re missing the point. N Korea could still level S Korea if they wanted to. Sure, that’s about all they could do before we wiped them from the face of the earth. Nevertheless, they could still kill tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of S Koreans if they choose to.
It's more likely we'd completely genocide North Korea with conventional weapons before they actually took out Seoul. Their nuclear weapons are essentially firecrackers, and they don't have enough of them to get through the ballistic missile defenses in place. Not to mention the short range factor.
The real problem with North Korea is mopping up after their failed offensive. You'd need to build a giant wall to keep the Northerners from fleeing into South Korea, and many of them would be fleeing to start a street-level insurgency. You're not talking about "trillions of dollars of massive infrastructure damage," but hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of civilian casualties are not off the table.
Not even South Korea's interested in that mess anymore. Everyone's pretty happy with the tinpot dictator status quo, for better or worse.
