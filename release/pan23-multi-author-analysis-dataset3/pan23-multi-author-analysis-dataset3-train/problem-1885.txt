The Russian dead reached about 1000 per day recently. That means 4000-5000 per day casualties (or maybe only 3000 if you trust Ukraine about how bad Russian medicine is). This is before Russia begins any big attack which would open them to casualties much much bigger than the Ukrainian ones, so it means that we may reach 10k per day within weeks or months. Even if Russia goes for a maximal 10million mobilization, that puts them at 30% total casualty rate of their young men within a year and within two would basically end the Russian nation.
There have been claims, before, that they were overstated, with people saying that you would have to notice such casualty numbers but recently and now we know there are at least as many as Ukraine claimed, but possibly many more.
That bigger ratio of dead to wounded was reached about 6 months ago it's only gotten a lot worse since then, Videos have come out showing the horrifying state of RussianField hospitals, and some of the latest claims put about 80% of the wounded dying.
Last we heard was that the Ukranians when they advanced took major losses on the front and the Russian artillery was eating their entrenched troops alive (from a news crew interviewing some of the injured in the hospital). That was a few months ago. It seems they have since barring reporters from interviewing casualties.
Maybe, Ukraine is in fairly bad shape and is contingent on significant Western aide for their population as well as their military.
If anything the Ukraine war is showing how bad the Russian Space assets are in the area of intelligence and jamming. All of which NATO gives freely to Ukraine and most likely contributed to many of the Russian War leader deaths.
Ukraine can do whatever it wants, however, so can itâ€™s allies that have supported Ukraine. If my neighbour is broke, I decide if I want to lend him a dollar to help feed his family. If he comes again next week, what has changed? Then every week for a year? What is the end game?
