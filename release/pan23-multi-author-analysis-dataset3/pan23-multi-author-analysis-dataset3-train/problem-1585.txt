It's possible that there was simply a mistake - especially if they other person has the same or similar name. My mom has 2 other women tied to her credit report who she has gotten mail and credit card offers for for 2 decades.
A credit score is based on having used credit somewhere, so it's possible that if nothing has been reported to a credit bureau about you, you aren't going to have a credit score.
My apologies for the misunderstanding this isn't tied to a credit report I mentioned the attempt at getting a credit score because it had led me though this rabbit hole. I went to a public records site not tied to my credit just records because I jokingly thought I must not exist if my SSN doesn't work on the credit score site and that's where I found this information or lack of.
I've had a couple credit cards. I eventually figured out the problem with that I put in my SSN wrong trying to get my score, but my main concern is my public record why does it say I'm some 66yr old African guy and it has some of my addresses and relatives information on that report was my information stolen or something?
