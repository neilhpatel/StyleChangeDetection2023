Sure, that'd be acceptable. Except that's not what happened; the employee wasn't salaried, he was day-rate (I.e. played a daily rate for each day in the pay period that he worked).
The employee was not paid hourly, he was paid a set day rate. Let’s use $100/day for simplicity. The employee would be paid $100/day for each day that he worked, regardless of total hour amount unless stated differently in the contract. A standard “day” in O&G is 10 hours. Day rate pay means he would be paid the same on a per hour basis if he worked 10 or 70 hrs a week.
Day rate means you only get paid for the days you work. That's not how salary works. That's what made the Court rule in his favor.
It is against the law for companies to waive employees' rights to overtime pay via contracts (day rate pay does have a possible exception if it meets the requirements to be considered a salary). It doesn't matter what a contract says regarding overtime: An employee is legally entitled to it.
Because if you're non-exempt, you get overtime pay. It doesn't matter what you're told. That doesn't trump law.
I don't understand the ruling here. Can someone Explain it like I am 5 years old? So if someone is paid salary, but works more than 40 hours a week. Then they get overtime?
Hell yeah give him overtime pay. Yeah they make a lot, but it's a job where any day you could literally die. One of the most dangerous and isolating jobs out there.
