Well sure its probably unfounded garbage. But is like... the reporting stinks, but theyre not even focusing on the stinkier portion of a story that stinks.
Edit: ahhhhh or maybe thats the point. Legitimize the Iran selling enriched Uranium to the Houthis by having it as an "accepted minor truth" of a larger story.
For those that don't want to click on the link, it's an unreliable source claiming that Iran was shipping uranium to Houthi rebels, and al-quedaa now has it.
The material was allegedly being delivered from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen when some of it was intercepted by the terror group, Israeli newspaper Maariv said, citing unnamed sources.".
Yeah. Which is worse? The perpetrators of 9-11 getting this or the Houthi rebels engaged in a war with Saudi Arabia getting it? Both are going to use it for similar attacks. Maybe the only difference is Al-Qaeda would for sure use it to attack the west or Israel and the Houthi will only maybe use it to attack Saudi western suppliers instead of the Kingdom itself.
