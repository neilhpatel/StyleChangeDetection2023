Hire an attorney NOW. Reach out to everyone you know for recommendations. It sounds like you werenâ€™t married and the mother essentially left the child with you. You need to make sure you are LEGALLY established as the father and then file a motion to establish sole physical custody.
I'm a dad who has been trying to get physical custody of my neglected son. I've been to court pro se (representing myself) and with my lawyer. You're welcome to ask me anything you like. I'll be happy to share what I've learned.
Additionally, don't panic. It is very, very difficult for a non-parent to get custody from a parent as they would have to prove that your child is being abused or neglected and it doesn't sound like that's the case at all. Even in the absence of a parenting plan or other court order. They can try, but it's going to take a lot of effort and convincing evidence for them to convince the court to take a child from their natural parent.
Jurisdiction is where the case will be heard. In family law, that's usually the court where the initial filing, the petition to establish a parenting plan, was filed.
You don't even have to wait until you have retained a lawyer. You can start the process now. Find the nearest courthouse with a family law self help center petition for custody. Most courts have a website these days where you can information and forms. You lawyer can pick up where you left off. Do this tomorrow.
