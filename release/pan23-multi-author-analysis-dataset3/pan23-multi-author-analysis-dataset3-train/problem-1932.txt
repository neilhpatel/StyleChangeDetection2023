Not sure if this is something you are aware of or not but ESA have no public access Rights. You have FHA housing rights for your Assistance Animal which includes ESA but ADA public access Rights are only for service dogs and service miniature Horses.
Your landlord's obligations under the Fair Housing Act do not extend to providing a reference for you so that you can adopt an animal. They had no obligation here, and not cooperating with you to this extent is almost certainly not actionable.
You can talk to a local civil rights attorney for a second opinion, but I suspect the answer is going to be to find a shelter that doesn't require a reference from your landlord.
Your landlord didn't really have an obligation to contact the shelter or communicate with them in any way. If that caused the shelter not to turn the animal over to you, that's not really the landlord's problem. Your landlord seems to somewhat misunderstand what it means to reasonably accommodate someone. For instance, the concept that they must meet all ESAs could be waived under the theory of asking that they reasonably accommodate a request to waive that requirement. Still, I'd make the effort to instead find an assistance animal that is local. If your parents are in a position to help transition the animal, probably work that part out first (move the animal into your parents' home so it's not adopted away in the meantime) and then approach your landlord with the request.
