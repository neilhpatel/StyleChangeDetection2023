Makes sense. Is the reverse also true, in that it's also not a fact that you can't get COVID twice?
Whether you can get COVID twice or how probable that is in a given timeframe is something to argue with points on each side.
That you can get COVID twice doesn’t appear to be the sort of thing that is so certain that it is beyond question which is what is required for a court to take judicial notice of something. In fact there is an active debate about this among the medical community. As importantly you need to talk to your attorney about this. The court could probably take judicial notice that the vaccine isn’t approved for those under 16, but that’s also so easy to prove that it would take the same amount of time to prove it as to get the court to take judicial notice.
Yes, but I would also caution that I don't think the court is going to want to get into the weeds of a medical discussion and ask for proof one way or the other. I think the judge will simply say its an open question and that the court doesn't have the time to get into a factual dispute about if you can or cannot get COVID 2x.
