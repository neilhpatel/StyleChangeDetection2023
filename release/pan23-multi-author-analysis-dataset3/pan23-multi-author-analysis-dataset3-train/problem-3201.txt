Inflation kicked up interest rates, bonds became worth way less, pension funds (and other financial instruments) were using bonds as collateral to buy more bonds (margin), their collateral became insufficient and they were margin called and the government had to start buying them to artificially lift the demand (and value) to let wreckless pension funds off the hook (bailout).
Without this bailout a lot of funds would have become insolvent and worthless, triggering fear on the UK financial health (drop in forex).
I follow macro economics pretty well but have no idea what almost imploded the British bond/forex market earlier this year. One day I saw the exchange rate fall off a cliff almost to 1to1 usd/pound. This was not really talked about in the American news cycle but I was just looking at the chart with a dropped jaw, because I know that symbolized trillions in lost money. Then something else happened and the markets recovered but I suspect that was a band aid.
Unfortunately the American Federal Reserve is trying to increase unemployment to stop inflation, they will likely kick us into a depression in the process.
