for sure, obviously a lot of the price is tied to russian aggression in ukraine and them being sanctioned. I'd argue that it wouldn't have mattered what the real cause is behind gas prices when one side of US politics pounces on the everything bad is democrats fault.
I understand thinking that way, but you have to remember it also dropped pretty low in 2016 when low gas prices would benefit the Democrats. So the price inputs are a lot more complicated than simply "election year, price it to help Republicans".
If you think the Industry, the one that spent $12.4 million just in the 1st quarter of this year, would be below manipulating prices to feed the Republican talking point and make a few bucks in the process, then I don't know what else to say.
Politics, or the formation of policy, is just one of the factors that the Industry tries to guide, through lobbying and influencing election cycles through price manipulation.
The question is, how could you not consider that as a factor among the other four you mentioned? They have a legal obligation/duty to maximize the return to their stock-holders. For them to ignore the manipulation of regulations through formation of public policy would be dereliction of duty. I expect them to do that. Frankly its the easiest one to accomplish.
