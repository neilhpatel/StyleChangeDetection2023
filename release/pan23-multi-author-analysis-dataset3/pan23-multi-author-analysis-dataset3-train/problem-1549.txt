Save any and all communication you have had over the years with this person for when you contact an attorney as suggested by another user.
Not only should you ask about defending yourself against a rape allegation (it's hard to say whether this would legally be rape as there are a number of debatable facts at play, but if you really were asleep, no I do not believe this would be rape), but you should also seek advice about if your situation involves any blackmail or extortion. Depending on exactly what she has said / threatened, you could likely seek charges against her, though that would obviously place the underlying "rape" case on the police's radar as well.
The fact that she's blackmailed you will not necessarily assist you in case the rape is being prosecuted.
Stop all communication immediately. Even if she shows up in person, act like she doesn't even exist, though record anything she does say to you and screenshot any messages that you've had with her. The fact that you've paid for her silence will certainly not have helped you.
Whether this does fall under rape or not you want a criminal defense attorney immediately. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 bucks, immediately call your state bar association to get the best criminal defense attorney you can afford.
Given that a year's passed and that she's demanding money from you, you ought to speak to a criminal defense attorney and decide how to move forward. Obviously do not speak to her (or anyone other than your attorney) about this.
