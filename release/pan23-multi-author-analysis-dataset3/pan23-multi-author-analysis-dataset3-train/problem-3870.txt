In a game I play: ultimate general civil war, I can detach a skirmishing unit from my line infantry and use them as skirmisher.
Thus it makes sense to use them, they are a low risk way of figuring out where the enemy is and in what strenh, with that information I can better deploy and use my line infantry to win the battle.
In the larger battles of the war, both sides used mostly line tactics, and the British had a substantial advantage early in the war before the Continental Army had had the opportunity to drill its soldiers to something approach regular army levels of skill and discipline at line tactics.
The Aspern-Essling case highlights two key features of how line and skirmish order worked in Napoleonic tactics: Firstly, the two operated in tandem rather than mutually exclusively, as a formed body of infantry behind would, ideally, be screened in front by troops in extended order. Secondly, the same troops could be called upon to perform both roles: Lannes' corps had fought not just in line in the open but indeed in more chaotic non-formation in the urban conditions of Essling, and then was transitioned to skirmish screen for the Guard when needed.
So what we can see here is that when it came time to try and silence the guns, the infantry of Lannes' corps moved out in loose formation, with the skirmisher screen and line behind it working in tandem to try and lay down a sort of suppressive fire on the Austrian guns.
A follow-up, would a more traditional "heavy infantry" (,maybe not so heavy that could not move) rushing in between volleys from the muskets not be able to wreak havoc in close quarters? Particularly if they're just standing in a straight line? By heavy I'm thinking some armor, maybe a small shield, a spear or sword etc...
