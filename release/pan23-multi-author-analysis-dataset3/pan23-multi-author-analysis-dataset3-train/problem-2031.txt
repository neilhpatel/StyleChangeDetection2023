I'm missing something here...what was called 'folk music', roots music and the blues. American folk music which pre-dated then became folded into a lot of 'country' songs; people like the Carter Family were considered folk singers when I first heard of them...I'm thinking of the kind of music that was field collected by the Lomax's and...was it John Hammond?
Country music's origin myth is famously on July 28th, 1927, in Bristol Tennessee, when Ralph Peer, an A&R man at the Victor Recording Company, set up shop looking for local talent, which he found in the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. This is the origin myth for country music because it marks a clear dividing line between the folk music of the people and country music as a commercial enterprise, country music as a kind of (rural) pop music; both Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family became massive stars, and their success inspired many others to try and make it big in what was initially called hillbilly music and later country music. So while there was certainly a variety of music that would have sounded fairly country music before 1927 - the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers obviously didn't grow up artificially in petri dishes - it's the point at which rural Appalachian/Southern folk music and country music become different things, especially after it becomes a big commercial enterprise, and the likes of the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers run out of interesting new traditional folk songs to do, and you get the likes of Roy Acuff writing new pop songs rather than just relying on the traditional music. So that's why I draw a distinction there - it's the point at which it starts to make sense to talk about a country music establishment pandering to audiences.
But yeah, I think what I'm getting at is that Country Music is not just a sound, not even just a set of song topics, but in many ways, it's a perspective on the world. That perspective is not impossible to inhabit while engaging in critique, but it is an art in itself to do so!
