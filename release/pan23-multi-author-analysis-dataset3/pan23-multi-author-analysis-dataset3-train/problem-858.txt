I don't put much stock in treaties, at least when it comes to dictatorships like Russia, China and others. The promises of dictators is worth less than dogshit, as we have seen time and time again.
Yes I know they were dictatorships (30 years ago). In the current tense though, they have greatly more freedom than China. Are they perfect? No, but I would much rather live there than China. Again, I'm saying that China's economic dominance is not due to the CCP's direction, but by following the natural progress that most developing countries have followed.
Ruling parties have to implement competent policy. Simply not being ousted is not enough. The country coasted on the wave that being the World's Factory brings.
Again, I don't consider coasting the wave of money from being the World's factory to be a big accomplishment. Every other developing country offered the same opportunity has taken it and done well with it. South Korea is doing well, and so is Taiwan, Hong Kong, and India. Suppression of billions didn't need to happen to improve the quality of life.
Democracies are suffer from incompetency. Of course they do. However, there are more checks and balances in democracies. Dictatorships have less of those and thus suffer more from incompetency and corruption.
