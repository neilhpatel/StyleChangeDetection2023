A lot of ancient documents are known to have been written "about X years ago" or to have happened "around Y date", but what's the oldest historical record of a date where we know exactly when that date was? I'd imagine there's a Sumerian record of an eclipse or something where we can identify exactly when that was, but have we been able to use that kind of reference to work out even earlier dates?
In the article I’m citing below, the authors claim that they have precisely determined the date of an eclipse mentioned in the Biblical Book of Joshua to an Annular Eclipse that occurred on 30 October 1207 BC.
I feel I should mention that it is under debate where that passage even refers to an eclipse and the authors of this paper developed their own method for calculating eclipses and these results are under debate. I would still refer to the Battle of Halys as the earliest precise date until more research is done on the ‘Joshua Eclipse’.
There were HMS Dreadnoughts before the 1906 battleship, and I can give you no answer for how their names should be interpreted.
I know that the original ship HMS Dreadnought was launched in 1906 and to put it mildly was a game changer in naval history. What I am curious about is the name itself. Was it just a cool sounding name? Was it already a word? Is it a combination of “Dread” and “Nought” and if so is the intended meaning “Have no fear, the ship is here” or “this ship fears nothing”?
His personal motto, for which the ship is named: Fear God and dread nought. If the ship's name should be interpreted in line with the motto I would suggest that your second suggestion is the accurate one.
