You would have to get a quote on the repair, not your guess; however I'm going to throw out that repairing it might be a lot more expensive than you think, which is why they have stores that specialize in 'scratch and dent' appliances. It must be cheaper to take the hit in price than pay for the repair. Given the thin sheet metal in appliances, I'm guessing it's probably not that easy to get the panel straight again.
It would be just like a car, whichever is cheaper - repair, or depreciated value. If it's replaced, you should either get the washer/dryer (you paid for it) or the landlord should have to deduct the value as it sits now (think CL price) from the depreciated value.
As other posters have pointed out, you aren't responsible for the entire replacement cost, only the depreciated value or repair whichever is cheaper.
If it’s not a serviceable part, then you would be liable for the depreciated value of the appliance - which isn’t the actual replacement cost. If it was $1599 new but used for 3 years, it’s not still worth $1599. It’s only 2/5ths of that according to the book (5year depreciation).
You’re liable for damages that you’ve caused. If you caused the dent, you’re responsible for making the landlord whole.
