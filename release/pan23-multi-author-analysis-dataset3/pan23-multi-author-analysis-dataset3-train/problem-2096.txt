The article literally says it’s not Trump Ice. It’s a brand that exists and operates now at his resorts. Let’s focus on the Trump deregulation which led to the derailment.
The train derailment happened specifically because of deregulation by Trump. And yet, somehow, it's the Democrats fault. And DeWine has been handling this like a gutless, sad excuse for a leader.
They literally have zero consistency in their beliefs. It's just "everything this guy does I like, everything that guy does I don't like.".
Ah, here it comes. Second good-guy-trump post on the front page in a few days. Previously it was offering the guy a job that chased down the mugger that assaulted trump’s mother. In 1991.
Sorry, he’s still an asshole, and his good deeds are more an exception than the rule if we have to dig in decades past to find decency. Even decade+ old bottled water.
Edit: Maybe the water isn't 13 years old. Conflicting reports on that. Regardless, giving each person 3 bottles of water isn't going to help them much beyond a single day. If Biden gave everyone BIDEN branded water, I'd call it out as lame as well. If it were DARK BRANDON water, however... I'd be cool with that.
I kind of thought they had moved on from Trump a while back, but it looks like they're all seriously aroused by him again.
