YPG are certainly not blameless. They are a militant group and there are concerns over their use of child soldiers (ages 16-17) and past terrorist attacks, but YPG/the Kurds fascinate me because they do not fit the mold of what we would normally think about terrorists.
As you mentioned, they led the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Now, they are aiding people fleeing Iran, and I suspect they may be supporting the people protesting their government there in other ways, since they have a border with Iran, and we know Starlink satellites are being smuggled into Iran to get around the internet shut down. But on the other hand, they are in a conflict with Turkey which dates back to their Marxist past.
I wonder if there’s any way that a peace agreement could be reached between Turkey and the Kurds. It would be difficult both because of YPG’s history of terrorism and their current support for labor rights within Turkey, but if we could work out a settlement it does seem like a the Kurds would make a natural partner.
It’s pretty simple, Kurdish terrorists did the attack (in Turkey’s view) and the US has helped Kurds in various ways over the years in Iraq and Syria.
Turkey thinks that because the US has been accused of arming the Kurds, they think the US is indirectly responsible.
