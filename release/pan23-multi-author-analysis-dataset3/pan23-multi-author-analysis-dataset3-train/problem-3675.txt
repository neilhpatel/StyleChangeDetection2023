They will fight everything that distracts them from their paralyzing fear of women, and themselves. They’re all terrified little “children of god” who literally freak the fuuck out at even the thought of true self awareness and acceptance. Filthy fuckin cowards.
This vile. Banning gender affirming care is appalling enough as it is, but forcing trans teens to de-transition is fucking disgusting.
Speaking as a non-trans guy, fuck you if you try to force trans people to not be trans. Lets see how well that will hold up if you try to enforce that.
Send these people to court. This is a direct violation of the contitution, as well as discrimination against transgender people and these idiots should be sued out of office forever.
The fact that people are trans does not affect those whom are making these ridiculous laws that are obviously based on hate and narrow-minded opinions. It's their lives are who they are. No one should be allowed to step on their right to a peaceful life, regardless of their identity.
