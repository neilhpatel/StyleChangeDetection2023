The Whig response was not unified. Some, such as Macaulay, objected to the idea that the venerability of Chinese civilisation was worthy of respect rather than ridicule; some that opium's harmfulness was exaggerated. The key thing, though, would ultimately be the question of what the war was about. George Staunton, probably the most experienced China hand in the House of Commons, was a fierce opponent of the opium trade, but nonetheless supported war on the basis that Lin Zexu's actions constituted an act of flagrant disregard for the established conventions of the Canton System, and so British national honour would have to be defended. In this case, honour was not some ephemeral concept, but referred to something quite specific â€“ the willingness to honour agreements. For Staunton, opium did serve as an inciting incident, but that was irrelevant to the matter of honour. We may never know how many votes he swayed, but for the pro-war position every vote counted, as Melbourne won out by just 9 votes. Ironically, he refused to honour his earlier statement that he would resign if he achieved a majority of less than 10. The war went ahead.
Well, first off, the amount of opium in the Canton area had been greatly over-estimated by both the British and Chinese authorities, requiring the opium merchants to actually buy more from India in order to meet Lin's demands!
IIRC many opium merchants had misread the Chinese political debate at the time and thought there would be imminent legalization, which was why there was so much opium gathered there when Lin started confiscation.
Did Lin or other Chinese officials ever consider a more gradual stepping up of enforcement of anti-opium laws? Something like months/a couple of years of room, slowly stepping up enforcement/confiscation, buyback at market prices (or at any prices), and lots of communication with Britain at the same time to let Britain know what was happening to prevent a diplomatic incident?
