Second, the government does not buy; it is done by private economic entities. India mostly purchases crude oil, which is required because India ranks third in terms of vehicles per capita globally.
You must also consider the country's per capita income; people in India cannot afford higher oil prices.  As a result, the government has a moral obligation to ensure that people in India have access to cheap oil.
China has claim over Mongolia(country below russia) and Russian territory so Russia knows that it can't trust China too much but they must get together because if they don't US will destroy them one by one because all 3 India, Russia and China are potential superpowers which can displace the US.
Blaming Russia will show Russia has no friends but when they have India and China with 40% of the worlds population defending them either directly or indirectly, Russia feels more empowered. If China and India agreed to sanction Russia, it would be over for Russia.
India has been propping up Russian war efforts by buying Russian oil. This can’t possibly be related. That was sarcasm, you morons. I hope you learn to understand reality and that a statement can be sarcastic.
