But what I already mentioned is there was no intent to hire the contractor for the position as it was confirmed by the person I report to. It was always meant to be a fixed term contract for a specific project. She also admitted that they have told recruiting agencies to stop telling candidates that there is a permanent position possibility meaning its obviously an issue they have had in the past.
So essentially what you are saying is its ok for recruiters to lie to you about there being a full time position offered at the end of a contract rather than being truthful and saying its just a fixed term contract?
I had the same thing happen to me, only the recruiter told me to resign from my current job before they had a signed contract with the client, who then changed their mind when the employee I was going to replace decided to come back. I found myself without a job and without a signed contract for a new position.
I put in my 2 weeks today as I found a higher paying direct hire/permanent position. Upon doing that the original recruiter reached out to me trying to convince me to stay offering more money/PTO etc.
