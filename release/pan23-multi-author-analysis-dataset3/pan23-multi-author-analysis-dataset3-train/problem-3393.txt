Sure. That's fine. Florida has the same shit. But you can't claim to be a primary resident of Texas while claiming you are a resident of Georgia for running for office.
No you cantâ€¦ you either live in Texas and you are not eligible to run for office in Georgia or you live in Georgia and cant claim residency tax credit in Texas.
Well, if he is claiming the credit by saying his primary residence is in Texas, that would be tax fraud because he is living in Georgia. It would be election fraud because he states his primary residence is Texas and voter fraud if he registered to vote in Georgia but the government has him down as living in Texas.
The credit he took though requires that he move back to Texas within two years of leaving if he plans on claiming the credit. So that would be in 2023 since he moved to Georgia in 2021.
It would have been day 1 news but it wasnt until recently that it came to light that he claimed the credit again. To claim the credit, you have to move back to texas within 2 years of when you first claimed the credit. That would be in 2023.
