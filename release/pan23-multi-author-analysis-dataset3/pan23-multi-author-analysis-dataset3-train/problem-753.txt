Russia doesn’t have nuclear weapons deployed outside their borders? At least not permanently. There’s Russian submarines with nukes on them but that’s it.
Can Russia really afford (in a literal sense) to rearm a whole bunch of nukes? Great saber rattling but when your conventional forces are tied and getting ground down in Ukraine, surely that'd warrant a bigger investment than more active nukes. Doubly so if you want to have a military capable of expeditionary work rather than purely for state defence.
I wouldn't go that far, it takes a surprisingly amount to financially cripple a country like Russia. But the fact they are modernizing T62s means that their production of modern tanks isn't enough to make up the losses. The army is going to need a serious bit of time to re-equip itself with modern gear and that's already looking like many years but if money is spent on a bigger active nuke force, it could well be decades. Which I don't think Russia will accept unless they plan on being a minor global power due to no 'physical' ways to exert influence.
We just can't allow a next-generation Russia warlord to hold the world hostage with constant threats of nuclear strikes.
I get the desire to mock Russia’s joke of a military, but there’s a real danger in downplaying their serious nuclear arsenal.
It should be pretty damn clear that a US dollar goes significantly further in Russia than in the US.
