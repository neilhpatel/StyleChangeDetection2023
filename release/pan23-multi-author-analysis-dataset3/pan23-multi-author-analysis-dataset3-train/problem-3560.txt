Political violence, banning books, intertwining politics with religion, a rise in domestic terrorism, increasing anti-semitism, and attacks on personal freedoms. If only there were warning signs /s.
American voters sent a message in the mid terms that they’re over anti-Democratic, election denying candidates, but some got through and some were very close.
It’s not even radical - these sentiments and desires to kill democrats and liberals - it’s becoming mainstream slowly, which is the whole point. Republicans are hoping a useful idiot will handle their opponents for them.
One of those things that's hard to intuit about the GOP is their leadership is much smarter than the rank and file, and their leadership are a bunch of idiots.
Democrats spend way too much time pointing out hypocrisies in their arguments that they couldn't care less about. We need to focus on how dangerous and out of touch these people have become, because not only does that actually resonate with voters, it accurately shows the threat of the modern Republican party.
