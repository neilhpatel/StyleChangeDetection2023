I think most Californians are disappoint have all agreed that Feinstein needs to go. Whether or not you like her, I think we all realize that she needs to just go back home and be with her family for however long she may have left.
Fair enough on details of nomination compared to appointment. However, I still don’t think Porter would back down. The appointment would still only be until the next election so whoever is appointed would still need to be re-elected and I think some folks are underestimating Katie Porter’s popularity.
I don’t think it really matters who Newsom nominates, I think the problem is for him that Katie Porter has a fairly large brand for someone who is still relatively new to politics. Can you name for me one black woman of note from California who is not Kamala Harris? I certainly can’t. I think the problem is though that Porter has already announced and the only real way that Feinstein is leaving her seat is if she dies as morbid as that may be. Sure, I guess she could always walk back her nomination, but I kind of don’t think that’s likely. No one is owed a Senate seat, so even if they are the incumbent, I think many people would be very disappointed if Katie Porter did not run.
Honestly I voted against Feinstein in the primary last time, so 100% I'd vote for Katie Porter, she's absolutely wrecked the people she's had in front of her House Committee.
