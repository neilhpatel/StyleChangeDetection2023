Your sister should be aware that a court can compel the child to be returned to the state, however, so she might be better off if you were to help her to find a place to live locally, and to find her an attorney who can assist with divorce/custody matters.
The court would absolutely order the child returned to Michigan if the father filed for an order requesting that within the jurisdictional period, which is generally six months. It doesn't matter the circumstances. Michigan is the only court that has jurisdiction during that period.
If the child leaves Michigan, Michigan's courts retains power over child custody determinations for six months after the date the child leaves. At any time during that period, a Michigan court can issue a binding order to return the child to Michigan. Once the child returns, custody would be determined in Michigan. Obviously, the mother would want to return as well and argue for custody. If she wants to leave the state with the child, getting a Michigan court to order that could be difficult unless the father agrees.

This should be the top comment. A DV organization is 100% the best place to start. OP, If your sister calls 211 they can connect her to a place in her area.
