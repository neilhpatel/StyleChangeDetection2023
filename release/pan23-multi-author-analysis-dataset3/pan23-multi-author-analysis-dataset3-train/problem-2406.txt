I see what you are saying as he’s said that himself about it not feeling like his home. He’s discussed buying his own property at some point so I told him if he wanted we could delay a potential engagement of any sort so he could buy his own property and keep it under his name alone (to which he is considering going into some property purchases with family). He knows what I pay in bills so I wouldn’t pocket any money.
The bills part is just because he is the one that uses the most water and electricity (he leaves the A/C on with doors open, leaves lights on, etc). Maybe I can discuss adding that to the rent (as in increasing it by $10-20).
Also consider what you're saying he should be doing (and admittedly he may have just wanted to keep renting). You're saying he should forgoe any equity accumulation in any property so he can improve your accumulation in yours.
In economic terms? You could in theory bank the money you don't have to pay toward the mortgage to buy him out later if necessary (and I would think you could put that clause in any agreement). You could just use the money saved if he's a renter to do whatever you want. I think part of the idea is the setup you're proposing is very unequal in your benefit. He won't have any of the traditional benefits of being a renter and you'll have the potential for a weird power dynamic. I.e. say a room needs painted. What say does he end up with over his living conditions? Imagine being a renter and having to live with your landlord.
If you own your house, and the two of you are not married, he will be your tenant. Some form of written rental agreement could protect both of you, particularly in the event that you break up in the future. One thing it could do is make clear the nature of your financial arrangement, including making clear that he is renting from you, and is not putting any equity into the house.
