Well, I resisted because I feared for my life. It is really scary when two armed strangers opens your doors without any explanation. I thought it would be my last day on earth. And part of me had contempt for them because the cops from the same department have a history of profiling me and violating my rights. I have the complaints to back it up.
All they had was the suspect was a black male wearing dark clothing who was running. The crime happened at a house approx. .5 miles away.
They could have asked me questions without opening my door (though I am not legally obligated to do so). Or ran the plates.
Okay. I thought if they unlawfully seized a person, violating his 4A rights, the resisting arrest charge can be dismissed via suppression since the person is the "evidence".
If they had reasonable suspicion to detain you (and I am not convinced that they did) then they can remove you from the car as part of that detention.
Any 4th amendment violation would likely be de minimis since it doesn't seem like any contraband or other evidence was found.
The remedy for a 4th amendment violation is to suppress evidence found in a legal search. There was no evidence here, so there's nothing to suppress.
