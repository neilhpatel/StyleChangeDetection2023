Title: Is it legal for a mother to enroll a child in camp without notifying said child or the father?
But if the parents are still together (and therefore there is no custody order), there is no legal issue. Simply a relationship one.
It's legal. If there is a custody order that requires either parent to notify or gain the consent of the other parent before enrolling the child in activities, the parent may be in violation of that order by enrolling the child without the other parent's permission. It still wouldn't be illegal for the parent to have enrolled the child, but the other parent may have recourse for the violation of the order.
Unless there is a parenting plan in place that was violated this isn't a legal issue. If there is then there may be an issue he could address in court depending on what resolution he wants.
