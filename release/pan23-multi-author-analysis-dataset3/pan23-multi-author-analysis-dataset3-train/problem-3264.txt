To be true, there's a lot of gatekeeping and, uh, "resistance to change" to say the least, in all areas of science, and IMO the current culture of publish or perish exacerbates that.
I remember someone saying that true revolutions in science can only happen every 30 or 40 years, which is the time for every figure of authority gatekeeping a given area to either die or retire and open space for new blood.
And frankly that hardly matters, eventually correct theories will either float to the top or a new theory will become popular and 'correct' and then decades later science historians will find old papers with the same type of thoughts. Sure it sucks if you are trying to chase fame and fortune in the here and now, but in the end the important names doing the discoveries will be remembered and the ones trying to hold science back for their pet theories will be discredited.
Are you going to easily admit that you wasted two decades of your life and that all of your research should be forgotten, or are you going to do everything that you can to discredit the new discovery? And before you answer remember that scientists are not platonic idealizations, they are people driven by personal interests and politics like everyone else.
Any scientist should do it with an honor, for the interest of the humanity and good for everyone else, without representing the selfish self-interests. The feeling of pride should be greater admitting that you were wrong rather than trying to dodge the information and spread the disinformation by postponing the progress and innovation. Educated minds should simply not have a problem accepting the facts, and continuing to move on in this direction rather than living in a world of delusion. Not taking it personally is what separates a person with education from a regular one... a professional form an amateur... informed mind from the anti-vaxxers or similar.
