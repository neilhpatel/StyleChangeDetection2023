Something tells me that Jordan has no interest in sharing their land with a Palestinian state, the last time they sort of tried they had to expel most of them.
The land is Palestinian.. you can try and force them to move to Jordan, you can try to move their capitol there, but you can't make people forget their history. The Israeli rhetoric online is just getting started, it's important for people to stand up for Palestine, no matter how many toadi bots downvote it.
The Arab states used to want to keep the Palestinian-Israeli conflict hot, but now they just don’t want to deal with a bunch of Iranian-brainwashed extremists. They use the Palestinians as labor and accept a relatively small number when they manage to sneak across borders, but that’s it.
More Palestinians live in Jordan than Palestine, because of decades of illegal occupations and settlements pushing them out of their own country. Now the Nationalist govt of Israel wants to move Palestine's capital out of Palestine... To Jordan... It's makes as much sense of Israel having their capitol in DC.
The Israeli claim to that area in the world is from over 2000 year ago... Why is it more important than Italian, Arab, Christian, Muslims, Ottomans who have all called that area home for hundreds of years since then.
They emigrated from these countries (which didn't exist back then) into Israel (which didn't exist back then). The point is that they are not native to where they are right now. I think that we are agreeing.
