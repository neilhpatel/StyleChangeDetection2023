I once got so exasperated at my high school home ec teacher when he said in a lecture that "things that are on sale usually cost less" that I wrote "Mr. V: Font of Economic Wisdom" on my notebook and held it up for a friend to see. Someone the object of the burn saw it, and remained low-key pissed off at me forever after. I wonder if that's on my permanent record.
There is no permanent record. I'm the same age, and I've gone to grad school and taught at the university level and "permanent record" is on the same level as "if you're bad Santa will give you coal.".
Not to mention, if I'm on the panel looking at prospective college students and two identical kids come in but one of them got reprimanded for participating in a pro-lgbt walkout, that's absolutely the kind of fuck off energy I'm putting my weight behind.
And what they instead did after 2012 was double down on the hate shit and go all in on voter supression policies. Because no shit those kids will never vote conservative, but who gives a fuck if you can make it as hard as possible for a young person to vote. Former felons about to vote? Throw them back in jail. Majorities in Texas want to decriminalize weed? Keep it illegal to keep selectively cracking down on young people and minorities.
In 2012 after Romney lost, the GOP commissioned an independent report to summarize the problems of the party and what to change going forward. It was often called the 2012 "autopsy." It said the party needed to drop hateful rhetoric and dogwhistles and offer policies that help minorities because any day now the GOP would be the minority and wouldn't be able to win big elections anymore from numbers alone.
So how do you counter all of the Republican party's rhetoric against minority groups and get people to vote for Democrats, etc? The answer is to point out the the Republican party's many failings in education, health care, worker's rights, the environment, the economy, etc. The following post is a great read:
