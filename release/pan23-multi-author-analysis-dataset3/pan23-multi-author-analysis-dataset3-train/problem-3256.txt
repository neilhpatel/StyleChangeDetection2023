Thank you. This answer seems quite functional. However, I'd like to know more specifically about this particular requirement in State Law. Is "race" defined by Texas for the purposes of filling out a juror questionnaire? Does Texas Law refer to the US census races?
No idea, but I seriously doubt Texas defines "race" at all in this context. You asked what answers would be true and correct, so that's what I gave you.
The races listed on the US census are White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. You can also say "multiracial" if that is a true, good faith answer.
What race are you? Write it on the form. That's it. You're either screwing around over grossly overthinking this.
Because despite the fact that race is entirely a social construct, these are the "races" the US government has settled on to count us for purposes of the census. It's not "right" in the sense of being scientifically correct, because race isn't scientific in the first place.
