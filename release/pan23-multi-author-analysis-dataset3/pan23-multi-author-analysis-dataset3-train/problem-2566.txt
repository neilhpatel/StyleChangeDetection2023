Aren’t these the same asshats that claim we need “mental health reform not firearm restrictions” and then they openly mock a US Senator for seeking help for mental health?!?
And? He can barely speak, process what he hears, or walk? Have you actually seen what even a minor stroke will do to a healthy individual, it’s human nature for him to act like he’s okay and it was only minor especially with all the eyes on him.
I just think you’re giving him more credit, and I believe he’s doing what any human would do in that position and make his stroke seem nothing more that a minor inconvenience.
I’ll agree. I’m not sure why I’m being downvoted, I’m rather neutral in fact I didn’t even vote. We can go back and forth about hypocrisy from each side, but I’m not sure why everyone gets defensive when there is a clear hypocrisy. When you have a moral obligation because you have seen first hand how addiction affected your son.
I’m the furthest thing from liberal. I live in an constant investigation of election fraud state that holds no penalties for faithless electors, my vote truly doesn’t matter.
