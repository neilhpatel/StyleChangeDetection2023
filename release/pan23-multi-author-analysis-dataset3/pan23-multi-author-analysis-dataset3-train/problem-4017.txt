The moratorium only applied to evictions for nonpayment. Some states passed extra protections, but most did not.
Landlords can still evict you because your lease is up, you violated the lease (noise complaints, place is trashed, unapproved roommates or pets, etc), you broke the law, and a myriad of other reasons.
Also be aware that in most jurisdictions, a landlord is required to store a tenant's valuable property for a certain period of time after the eviction or abandonment. The exceptions to this is if the property has no value (I.e. is junk or garbage) or if the property is contaminated or hazardous (i.e furniture infested with bedbugs, cockroaches or if the apartment is strewn with used needles, feces, or other biohazards). So be aware that is a potential defense to your claim the landlord may try (although they would be required to show evidence of the contamination).
Do not bring up testimony from other tenants about how they were treated by this landlord--the only relevant testimony is what happened to you.
Be prepared to explain in court how you could afford to pay rent at a different apartment when you had past due rent at the previous apartment.
