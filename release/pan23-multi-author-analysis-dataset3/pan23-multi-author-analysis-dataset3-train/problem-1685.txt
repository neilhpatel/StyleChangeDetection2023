Unlikely honestly. There's a massive difference between being able to bomb Dugin's daughter straight into hell or blowing up some factories to assassinating head of state. Especially when said head of state only shows up in public when surrounded by dozens of snipers and bulletproof glass AND they have a private royal guard on top.
it's also true that killing him would likely be met with an over the top response. Russians (especially older ones) love their tsar and can't imagine life without him. Hearing that Ukrainians have done something like this... honestly I could imagine them being crazy enough to decide that an appropriate response is nuking Kiev, consequences be damned.
Killing Putin in the Russian mind would mean their views are justified, that they are the real victims of this war and Putin indeed had no choice but to defend against the brutal west.
With how successful the Ukrainian special forces have been inside Russia, if they wanted to kill Putin they probably could pull it off. But that doesnâ€™t necessarily end the war. It might make it worse.
How would it possibly make it worse? Russia is already actively trying to assassinate the Ukrainian government. What are they going to do, kill them twice?
