Because in classic Indian fashion, they’ll turn the US down and opt to chose “closer ties” with Russia. If India not stopping business with Russia, who uses the said profit is to conduct a war of genocide in Ukraine, isn’t an indicator of Indian geopolitical policy, I don’t know what is.
By that logic India should turn down European markets and trade agreements because of what powers like the UK and French did to the subcontinent. But you don’t.
Also, you shouldn't be asinine. The modern concept of the entire Indian subcontinent as one united nation is a modern invention younger than the US. I will grant you, many cultural aspects remain from earlier times, but the Indian state that exists now is not some ancient institution, anymore than the PRC is a seamless continuation of the old Chinese Empire.
I just think that, in the face of an increasingly belligerent China, led by Xi, India might want to start considering the question of sides. What are they willing to do to keep their neutrality?
Yes they are neutral just like we wanted. Last time Russians were on Chinese side during 62 war. No matter how many times you screech about Russia and India being allies, we are neutral towards each other.
If the US wants India to stop being friendly with Russia they gotta help fill the void that losing russia would leave. There is a reason that India is more friendly with Russia, and in large part its because the US refused to help them numerous times and has picked Pakistan over it.
