211/435 races have been called for the Republicans, compared to 199/435 for Democrats. The magic number to control the House is 218 (435/2=217.5, so 218 is a majority) and Republicans lead in the votes for 10/25 uncalled races. This would put them at 221-214, a narrow majority. Democrats would need 4 of those remaining races to break for them in the final few ballots without losing their lead in any one of their current 15 leads to hold their majority. It's not impossible, but it is unlikely that it happens.
Regardless, whoever the Republicans (or Democrats) would elect as Speaker of the House is going to have to contend with the need to reach across the aisle for votes or placate the extreme fringes of their party. If the Lord of Hamberders continues to drive a wedge between the Republican base, things could get difficult for a Republican majority leader.
If anything, the republicans will probably want him to go away at this stage so he won’t have a chance to rip the party apart when he inevitably loses the primaries to DeSantis.
I just don’t think trump has enough political capital remaining after these elections. They have a real chance at making him go away, and if they don’t, they run a real risk of him ripping up the GOP.
Ah the stalling tactic. Because he doesn’t have any legitimate defence and clearly has something to hide, he’s going the procedural route.
In this case, he’s literally going to be successful because “success” is avoiding testifying, not prevailing on the merits.
For someone so confident that he's innocent, he sure is taking every necessary step humanly possible to avoid having to talk to someone.
