This really does feel like youâ€™re abusing process trying to catch a tow operator on a technicality. If your car was righteously towed you should pay your fees and retrieve it. If it was not righteously towed there would be a better argument than this one.
You can sue here. Obviously in that litigation if they show up with a copy of the letter they sent you lose.
Sue for the fee back, on the theory that the letter was never sent. If the letter HAD been sent, then you would NOT have had to pay the fee, correct? The lack of a letter caused the fee to increase, or to exist at all?
6. You do not know if they sent the letter to the CO DMV, the NY DMV, or not at all. If they did send to one of the DMVs, you do not know what might've happened to the letter, or if either DMV acted upon the information in the letter.
The letter or proof of notification to the DMV. The paperwork I've filled out states I'm not feeling any financial gain from this, just proof the letter was or was not sent. If it turns out the letter was not sent and they're not properly notifying the DMV, I'd proceed from there. But the first step is proof the letter was sent or not sent.
And even if you could "sue to get a letter or proof it was sent" there is no way to find that out definitively.
