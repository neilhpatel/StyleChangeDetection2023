Yes, but it was nothing secret, he got the money from Gazprom by being a board member and it only was after he lost his re-election. I think this article is more about secret payment channels but then a gain who knows if Schr√∂der already got Russian money when or even before he was Chancellor.
I'm not saying that Boris got paid by the Russians, maybe he just really likes former KGB agents... and we know he was short on cash and took out dodgy loans for which he is now being investigated for.
Being vague about who actually got bought discredit everyone who is on Putin's side not just the ones who actually did get paid.
Anyone supportive of Putin or critical of support for Ukraine will be suspect of being in Putin's pay and discredited a bit more.
If Russia ever expected their money to result in teh Tories going against NATO, they were delusional. But I highly doubt they ever expected that. I imagine most of their money for that went to Farage and co.
The Tories know how to have the best of both worlds. Take money from Russia for enabling money-laundering, take money from Ukraine for weapons exports. Win win.
