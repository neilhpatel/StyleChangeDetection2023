As for the latter part of OP's question, the osteological research of skeletons across medieval Europe seems not to show any noticeable difference between Scandinavians and non-Scandinavians (Cf. Steckel 2004).
Really sorry that I don't have time to write full-lenh answer to your additional question right now (at least until this weekend) and that I'm neither so well versed in the alleged Anglo-Saxons, but AFAIK the climate change hypothesis as trigger-event of the migration is not so popular.
AFAIK the overpopulation and the colder climate as primary incentives of the Vikingshad been based on the classical/ medieval literary cliche, and has been refuted in any serious academic literature on the Vikings for long (at least for about half a century).
However, regarding the assertion of famine I find no sources, you seem to be correct that it had more to do with overpopulation, which instead suggests the Vikings forebears were used to eating rather well, and their offspring wanted to keep doing so. Thus falls one premise of my question: if they were taller than some of the people they met, it was simply because their parents had fed them well.
