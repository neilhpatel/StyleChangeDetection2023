Imamoglu won the local elections where he ran for mayor of Istanbul in 2019 and took it from Erdogan's party (AKP).
He, funnily enough, won the repeated election by a much higher margin and has been the mayor of Istanbul since then.
AKP claimed he "cheated", so they cancelled the election, taking the victory from Imamoglu who later commented "the people who are cancelling the elections are fools".
Elections are only rigged on a very minimal scale, other than that the Turkish elections are pretty legit, the AKP government tries to do stuff to hinder it like the re-do for the Istanbul election but as we saw CHP won with even a bigger vote the 2nd time.
2- They will announce someone else as the candidate, which will divide voters and possibly lose a chunk of them, which will benefit AKP.
Thank you for that- people don't seem to understand that the opposition vote is usually very divided, which has allowed the AKP and their coalition buddies, MHP, to dominate. But the "Table of Six" has tentatively united this time, so hopefully, they can work out their differences to beat the AKP across the board.
