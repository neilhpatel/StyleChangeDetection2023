Does not matter that you use the name outside of work — that is not work. You could call yourself “f@&k everyone” outside of work and that would not pass at work.
A slang term for a sexual organ sounds like it cause discomfort to too many —and that is something that is overall agreed to be inappropriate in a work environment.
Yes, its technically true that it's slang for penis... but in a professional setting it's inappropriate to focus on that just as it would be inappropriate to focus on it if someone was named Dick or, as you mentioned, Willy. Or if someone habitually made crude jokes every time someone referenced a door knob or a weird bulge in the floor tiles or any number of other terms that can be used as an innuendo but also have legitimate usages.
I wonder how this company would respond to someone named "Richard" whose been called "Dick" his entire life. I'd imagine telling him that he can't use his non-slang name because they're too immature to keep from sexualising it wouldn't play out well and might even count as sexual harassment.
My concern is that I don’t have a leg to stand on saying they are inappropriately sexualizing my name because it is technically true that in some places it’s slang for penis. When you google it, that is what comes up (as well as a children’s book character with the same name, funnily enough).
The name is really so tame and not comparable to your examples. Its more like if my name was Willy. Also, my main question is if I legally change my name, are they still allowed to not use it as they claim?
