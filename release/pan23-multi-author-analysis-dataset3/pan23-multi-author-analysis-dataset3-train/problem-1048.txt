If airlines can easily externalize costs into the customers, it is bad for the economy as a whole. It makes commerce and other travel less efficient for the people doing it and they are all part of the travel economy as well as the airlines corporations.
Helping to "convince" the airlines to hire a lot more staff and pay them better, to adapt their schedule and to guarantee better customer service. Multiple new or strenhened regulations going through the necessary process (of which this letter is a part). $600 millions in refunds for passengers this year, record level of fines both this year and in 2021. How exactly is this "standing with billionaires"?
Given that his default position is support for airline passengers and all workers, including railroad workers, calling him a "blatant corporate shill" is just stupid hate.
Maybe if Buttigieg could have the default position of being in support of railroad workers and airline customers he wouldn't be seen as a "blatant corporate shill".
Buttigieg is pathetic in how blatant his support is for corporations and oligarchs. Between this and the rail transport strike it's clear he stands with billionaires like Warren Buffett and airline companies who have corrupted the political system though legal bribery (donations and lobbying).
