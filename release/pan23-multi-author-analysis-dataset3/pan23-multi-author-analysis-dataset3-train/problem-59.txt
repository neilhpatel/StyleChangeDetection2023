your not thinking big enough, firstly, if kadyrov wants to take out prigozhin or lukashenko, he doesn't need that nuke to necessarily be a projectile. a truck might just do the trick.
though in reality i think the CIA, MI6, Mossad, and pretty much every other western clandestine operational orginization would be working overtime together to seize or sabotage those weapons.
yeah, this is terrifying to be honest. if russia falls into a period of warlords chopping up the country. Russias nukes would fall into their hands, thats very very bad for the rest of the world.
Except those smaller states now have nukes. So instead of one big country threatening nukes weâ€™d be faced with lots of little ones doing so. Plus whoever group these small and likely poor states end up selling a nuke or two to.
Even a small nuke will kill thousands and with planning, etc., far more than that. The world treats nukes differently and the world will not support someone willing to use a nuke as anything but a last ditch self-defense weapon. No one wants to be next to a neighbor that has proven they can use a nuke aggressively and get away with it.
Nothing like a nuke has been used since nukes. Even the WMD gas attacks in Syria have been hard to nail down and prove and in the end "only" killed a few hundred, when you're considering the scope of war, that isn't very impactful.
