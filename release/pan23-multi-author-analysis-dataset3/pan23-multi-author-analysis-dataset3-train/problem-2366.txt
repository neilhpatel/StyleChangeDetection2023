Not really. It would be if Russia had a profit motive in all of this. But there isn't one - it's an absolute lose-lose of a war. Every participant is already set to lose - it's a matter of how much.
That would be the second best thing to Russia not starting this war at all. But Kremlin had too much copium to go that route. "Here's how we can still come out ahead in all of this mess!".
Well said. You and I know that, but the "unify the Russias" justification Putin used to drum up his base denied that reality. From his own nationalist perspective, by recruiting foreigners, Putin is a traitor to his own nation.
Don't be fooled thinking this war is about NATO, the West, "protecting" Russia from homogay agenda, or even Putin's personal ambition.
Putin's whole Russia first thing isn't just about restoring Soviet Union territory but also its pan-Russian cultural and economic integration (don't mind all those minorities btw) and dependence on Moscow. Ukrainian cultural/economic independence threatens that, but what Putin didn't expect was for the west to decide this was a European and global issue, not just an ex-Soviet issue.
