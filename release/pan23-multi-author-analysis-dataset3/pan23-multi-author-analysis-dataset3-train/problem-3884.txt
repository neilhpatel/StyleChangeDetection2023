Nobody says he doesn't work hard but hard work doesn't get you even close to a body like that. Did you see the stack he's on? Its time to get rid of all these fake natty fitness gurus that just overinflate the publics perception of what is natty.
The problem with this fake natty culture is that it's all about looking the part, instead of promoting a healthy, balanced lifestyle. I dont care if you pump yourself full of steroids, that's your choice. But dont claim natural while peddling potentially harmful stuff to gullible beginners that just want to make a change.
You completely miss the point. It's not about these people putting in the work or not, it's the shit they peddle and sell to unsuspecting beginners, making them think they can achieve a physique like that naturally when they really cant. "Just take my 30 supplements and eat some raw liver and you'll look like me." No you wont.
No kidding. Most people I know would think he’s natty. The general public’s concepts of bodybuilding and body standards are just way off.
As much as i admire, to me bodybuilding shows are the extreme opposite of drag queen shows. Exaggerated body proportions, hyper-gender and full on drama!
