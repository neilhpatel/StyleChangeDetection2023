I’m not sure the law stops them from doing this. It isn’t something they logistically can do; where would they get the information for the insurance application?
What do you want to have happen here? Legal recourse would restore your loss. It seems you have a substantive gain rather than a loss.
How did they not cause the loss? Not arguing but genuinely not understanding, if I only paid that out under the assumption that I was still responsible for my own premium? Had they notified me, which they did not, I would have cancelled at the end of Feb.
I have no idea how they signed me up, I have provided them with my address and other basic contact information but not to the level where they should have been able to sign me up. I understand that I’ve gained a lot by them opting me in, obviously I’m saving money but the issue for me is, why was I not informed and why was my express consent not required? Health insurance isn’t a trivial matter so I’m looking at this more seriously than “why complain, you’re getting free insurance”.
