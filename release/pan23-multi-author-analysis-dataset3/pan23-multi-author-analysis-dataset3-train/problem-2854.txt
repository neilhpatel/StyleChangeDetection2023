Doesn't matter. He's still a tenant and you're his landlord. You just also happen to be his roommate. Having said that, this is a family situation and having an eviction on his record could hurt the possibility of him renting in the future. One way that landlords get around the hassle of evicting someone and it incentivizes the person to leave so they don't get evicted is to offer money to have them move out before you take legal action against them. That may be an alternative here.
That sounds like the best option. Legal proceedings for eviction aren't free, and I'm sure you want what's best for your kid. It's true that part of "legal advice" is suggesting options that can help you avoid going to court, while still providing the best possible advice for your situation.
You can either serve him with notice to leave, and then proceed with eviction procedures, or arrange a "cash for keys" situation where you give him whatever amount of money would help him establish his own apartment situation without having an eviction record and with a minimal amount of hassle & financial pain on your end.
So then why are you asking r/LegalAdvice? You could go to r/Parenting or r/relationship_advice but this sub is specifically for providing \legal\ advice. You've been provided with good advice that details your options to take that are legal, if you want your deadbeat son out of the house.
