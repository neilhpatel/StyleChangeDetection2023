Thank you for the reply! I’ve been wondering about this for a while now and I find the whole topic very interesting.
Also, do you know how these war plans against each other became public knowledge? Because I feel like if people found out that a country was developing potential war plans against them, they wouldn’t take that very lightly.
This is definitely worth a question of its own - I've not really read much in depth on War Plan Orange or American strategy in the Pacific. Putting it up as its own submission would make it much more likely for someone who does have that in-depth knowledge to see it.
A plan to invade Canada alone would have been called War Plan Crimson (Much as Britain was given the codename Red, its colonies were given shades of red as codenames). There was such a plan, developed in the early 1900s, though I'm not sure if it was kept updated into the 1930s.
There's also the interesting asymmetry between the American plan ending with the capture of Canada, and the British one essentially starting with it.
I appreciate the way the American war plan essentially revolves around invading Canada, and the British war plan revolves around abandoning Canada. Thanks guys, we really appreciate it.
