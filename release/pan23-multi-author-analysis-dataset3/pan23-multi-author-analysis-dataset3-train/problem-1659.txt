It's hilarious that Republicans claim that the FBI is run by Lefty Democrats. I believe the FBI has never been run by a Democrat.
They gonna investigate the FBIs involvement in all the Democrats that have been charged and convicted in the last few years?
They will do this with the determination that democrats should have investigated the FBI, SS, and DOJ. It’s over. Vote, but it’s pretty well settled in my mind. The right will win. I will vote and volunteer just to be able to tell myself that l tried my best to stop these fascists….
Fascism in action. They’ll keep pressuring and attacking these essential gov departments to just continually force out the career employees that are loyal to the country, so they can fill those spots with Republican loyal replacements. We’ll see it this round of midterm elections as all those poll workers and local and state election officials were attacked after the last election for doing their jobs and many of them resigned and are now replaced by Republican cronies that are ready to not certify results unless they are Red.
