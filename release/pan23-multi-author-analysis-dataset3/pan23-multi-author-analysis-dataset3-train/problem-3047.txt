For example, super long time ago I lived on an old farm. There were 3 houses on the property. One day the landlord decided that having housing tenants was a pain so he didnâ€™t renew any of our leases and then leased the land to a managed development company to build a gas station and mini mall. So those people tore down the 3 houses and built a gas station. With the land - and house- owners permission. Now he owns developed real estate instead of 3 super old farm houses with leaky roofs and rats in the basement.
Yeah but someone else is the owner and the area is on rent and someone is buying it and trying to destroy someone else's house because its on the area of land she rented.
Did the Owners of the land who have no rented it out know the House was on their property? Did the Guy who has the house know it was on someone else's property?
Was there some kind of easement recorded on the deed? Because this sound like a really complicated property situation. Your friend may need to get a real estate attorney involved(well, or more likely the Landowner will).
