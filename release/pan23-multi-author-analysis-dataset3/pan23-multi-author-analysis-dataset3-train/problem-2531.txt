Interest started to increase though around 1908. Other physicists and mathematicians began exploring the implications of SR, notably Hermann Minkowski, a former professor of Einstein's (which is mostly coincidental — they didn't care for one another). Minkowski basically reformulated Einstein's work in geometrical terms (worldlines, spacetime), which initially Einstein disliked but he soon came to embrace as a core way of formulating his work. There were also some Cambridge physicists who happened upon Einstein's work and saw it as complementary to their own re-thinking of mathematical understanding of physics.
The other aspects of SR, such as space and time dilation, were ignored by most physicists (they are clever geometrical manipulations but it wasn't obvious they are real effects), though there were a few whose work overlapped sufficiently with Einstein and who took his work up with other work on similar topics. Those who would have denied Einstein though mostly just ignored him; SR didn't seem to have huge implications at that point for the rest of physics. When it was referred to, it was considered the Lorentz-Einstein theory of electrodynamics, a clever re-derivation of the Lorentz equation.
A technical point of amendment is that Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect is not really part of special relativity. It hinges on Planck’s formula for photon energies (though I’m sure that wasn’t the term used) and doesn’t require or touch on the machinery of relativity (Lorentz transformations, space-time, the invariant speed of light).
