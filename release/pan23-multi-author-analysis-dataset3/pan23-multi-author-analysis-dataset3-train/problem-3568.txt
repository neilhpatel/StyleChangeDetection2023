Also: "Why should we should we care about Ukraine it's not our problem, also here is a list of all the times in the past 75 years when you didn't help us and we're still pissed off about it so we're going to pretend that justifies not opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine".
...you guys? Who exactly are you generalizing - I found this out from Indians themselves...they're literally saying this in the comments here? And everything is not black and white - THIS is.
EUROPE IS CUTTING ENERGY IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA WHILE INDIA IS INCREASING IMPORTS. 90% of Russian oil imports are expected to be banned by the end of the year.
Nobody is blaming you for Russia invading. But your self-serving hypocrisy is on full display. What countries like India are really about is becoming crystal clear now.
Today, India is up there on a super power nation list. Couple the old relationships with Russia along with cheaper gas prices and the past non support from other European nations and America, I would do the exact same thing.
What a shitty article, you want everyone to cut off purchases for Russian oil, while none of the other oil producing countries have increased their oil production. This means there has been a huge spike in the prices of non-Russian oil, while its supply has remained constant but demand has increased due to Europeans pivoting to other sources. Now rich Europeans can afford to pay this skyrocketing price, but developing countries cannot. So you expect poor developing countries to starve, because Europeans were either too dumb or too greedy to understand that they shouldn't become so reliant on a country for their energy, especially after Crimea.
