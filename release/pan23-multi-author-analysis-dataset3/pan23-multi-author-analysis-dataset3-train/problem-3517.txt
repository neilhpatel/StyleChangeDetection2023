For you to successfully sue for libel, you would have to prove that he knowingly published false statements AND that it had a negative impact on you (business, reputation, etc).
He has technically committed libel if he spread information that he knew was false in an effort to damage your reputation, but you also need to think practically. What do you hope to gain from a suit? Can you prove lost income as a result?
Think also about his financial position. Even if you were to sue for demonstrated damages - which, given the size of the audience likely won't be much - and get a judgment in your favor, he can't pay that judgment if he doesn't have money. You'd then have to go back to court for further orders allowing you to seize funds from his bank account or garnish his wages.
In short, you can absolutely consult with a litigator, but I wouldn't do so with high hopes. However, if he's following you around in public places or forums and making threats, you can and should call your local police non emergency number and ask for an officer to take a harassment complaint when one has time. It's entirely possible a visit from the police will make him wise up and shut up.
Then think about your financial position. This isn't something a lawyer would handle on contingency; you'd need to pay the fees and costs up front and hope to recover them later.
