Well, this is cutting edge stuff. The US is the first to develop laser defense systems and the first to deploy them on combat vehicles. It wasn't until the advent of solid state lasers that they became small enough, light enough, and cheap enough to deploy in large quantities.
Given the way a laser works they probably won't be that good against saturation attacks. Patriot missiles, RAM, and good old CWIS will still be relevant.
PAC-3 is one of the best anti-ballistic missile systems in the world. Sure, it's not a THAAD or SM-3, but short of those systems, it's right up there.
They're already consistently shooting down 80-90% of Russian missiles, and they don't even have our best anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles yet.
Ukraine is routinely shooting down 80-90% of incoming Russian drones and missiles. Remind me again how successful Russia is at shooting down incoming Ukrainian attacks?
If Russian bombers and ships feared for their safety whenever they launched cruise missiles at Ukrainian cities, they would stop launching those missiles real quick.
