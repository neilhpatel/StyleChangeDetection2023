You will likely be named in the eviction lawsuit. Put in writing to your landlord that you've vacated the property. If you get a subpoena for court, show up and provide proof you no longer reside there, such as that letter you sent the landlord saying you don't live there anymore or a piece of mail with your new address. The judge may remove your name from the lawsuit.
I suppose the landlord could possibly bring legal action against you for breaking the lease and allowing unauthorized people to reside at the property and try to get damages (money) out of you for them continuing to live there, but I don't really see this happening.
so, if that is the case the better legal strategy would be to remain in the apartment, evict A, B and C as a live-in landlord, and only than vacate himself?
but if he vacates than he becomes a normal landlord evicting tenants and his legal stance becomes much worse?
The landlord cannot evict your subtenants, that is something you have to do. You are their landlord.
In either scenario though, this is not your landlord's problem. You owe him rent so long as you have not surrendered the apartment back to him (i.e. no humans left behind). You also owe for any damages caused by yourself or any of your subtenants. You may also owe if having to reschedule the contractors incurs monetary damages to your landlord.
