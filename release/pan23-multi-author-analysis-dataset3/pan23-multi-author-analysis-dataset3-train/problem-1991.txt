I think the one reason this might go the other way is that this isn't a permanent solution to the problem and would only take money away from the government, not private institutions. Long run this allows the status quo to go on rather than education reform. Plus, if this doesn't go through it gives Biden and Democrats a huge platform to run on whereas Republicans can sneer at the Supreme Court decision all they want but not have to deal with people voting for very clear monetary incentives.
Fuck every citizen this helps, and the solid fiscal reasoning behind it, in order to stop Biden from doing something inherently good that might reflect positively on him. I really hate what republicans have become.
God I wish Democrats would publicly criticize Republicans the same way. I would take out television ads, billboards and online pointing out how the right doesnâ€™t want to help the common man or woman. Scream it from the rooftops over and over. Name them , show their voting records all the way through the 2024 elections.
This should be a TOP talking point for Democrats in 2024. Young people have terrible voter turnout. Go tell them we literally were going to forgive your debt but there's an entire party committed to denying that for you while they forgive millions in their own businesses. Drill that shit home and get young people to the polls.
