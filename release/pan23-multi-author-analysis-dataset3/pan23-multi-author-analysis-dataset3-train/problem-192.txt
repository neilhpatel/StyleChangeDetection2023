It would be sweet, but do you really think there would be much interest? It would be fun to learn, but it's not going to serve students as well as learning a major international language.
To me, the cool part of learning a language is being able to talk to native speakers in their country. I'd love to learn Dutch and then go to Amsterdam and use it. But if I learn Navajo, whom am I going to talk with? The Navajo people all speak English and prefer English, and the younger ones may not speak much Navajo at all. So at least for me, that makes it less appealing.
Yeah, I agree that it's "dope" and "sick as fuck". I just don't think too many students are going to take it. Schools are not going to want to hire a teacher and run native American language classes for 4 or 5 students.
Most of the native language programs Iâ€™m aware of operate in schools on or near reservations with lots of native students. I also remember hearing language teachers talk about how once you learn a second language our brains know how to learn new languages and it becomes easier. So, the students are more connected to their culture and have a leg up if they want to learn a third language.
Though, I would LOVE to have access to learning a Native language. Probably would've sucked at it in high school, but these days I'm seriously interested.
