Not saying I agree with Ticketmaster or support them in any way, but why do you specifically want to make this particular practice illegal?
If you don't think Ticketmaster has too much power and influence over ticket pricing and sales, and the broader market, then ok. Lots of people disagree with you, including countless insiders, performers, and lawyers.
From what we've seen throughout history, "breaking up" monopolies leads to more competition and, therefore, better prices for consumers.
However, breaking up TM's monopoly would reduce fees via competition, spread out load to multiple providers, and allow different tech so become prevalent. Right now with TM having all the venues (and the barrier to entry as a ticketing company) there is a drive to just mimic TM instead of taking a risk on something different.
Fundamentally wrong. Ticketmaster did the ticketing for the venues where they have contract. SeatGeek did the ticketing for the venues where they have the contract.
Ticketmaster is the only provider. They have an overwhelming monopoly of any venue big enough for Swift to go to, they can’t just go to a venue for 20k when she sells out 100k for multiple reasons, so their monopoly has to be brought down here.
Why is the onus on Swift’s team here to hunt down a reasonable alternative to an actual monopoly? Ticketmaster should not have the power it does.
