And iirc the special counsel for the Biden investigation was appointed by Trump, which in my mind gives Biden even more brownie points, he’s not even being investigated by his own guy.
Then I may have been misinformed, I’d been under the impression that the special council for Biden’s investigation was some sort of holdover from the previous administration.
So as not to appear weak, they try to normalize Trumps behavior by “finding” classified documents in Biden and Pence’s possession.
Trump was clearly intentionally taking papers on purpose, while Biden (or one of the varied people working with him across his eight years as VP, which is when these documents are from) misplaced papers incidentally.
And yet tons of people are acting like the classified documents found in Biden's possession were some sort of UFO driver's manual deliberately pulled from some library of secrets.
They really want to push the narrative that a "classified document" is by definition some sort of really hot state secret or something, presumably checked out of some sort of archive. In reality, the stuff found in Biden and Pence's possession is probably really innocuous, obsolete stuff that was very likely generated on site.
