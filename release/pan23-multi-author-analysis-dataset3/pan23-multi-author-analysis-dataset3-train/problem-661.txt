The ones that know the propaganda is bullshit flee or largely shut up and keep their head down. Support for this war also skews old, so there's a fair number with a rose tinted view of Russian superpower status, but are too old to be sent to the front themselves.
When you look at the history of Russia, going back to the harsh reign Stalin, the Czars, even the constant brutal warfare of the steppes for millenia - and it actually makes a lot of sense. I can certainly respect the trait, as well as fear it.
Personally, I have had pilots who try to fly aircraft that are obviously not safe and have to quite firmly stop them. I have only encountered that rather peculiar attitude with Russians. Same goes for technicians - I've had to be very careful with them, because sometimes they'll go "its fine" when its not.
The most dangerous aspect of Russian psychology, to both their dictators and enemies alike - is that quintessential fatalism.
Most world leaders don't say things like Putin's "the world doesn't need to exist without us, and we all die anyway" when talking about nuclear weapons - not even "normal" dictators talk like that.
