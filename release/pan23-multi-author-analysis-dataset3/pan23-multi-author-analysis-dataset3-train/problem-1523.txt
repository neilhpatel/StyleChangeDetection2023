If you havent already, CASA may be a good organization to reach out to, since they are advocates solely for the children. They may have resources to direct you to lawyers who, at minimum, would be the children's lawyers, if not be specialized in the custody areas you need for your husband.
If so, call the state bar in your state and ask for referrals for family law attorneys. If the first one can’t take the case, call the next one.
Alright so this is different from what I thought you were asking. You’re trying to find a lawyer for your child custody case?
Like the other person that commented said, the attorney you have for the custody case. They would be a good person to give a call. Especially about the concerns you have about the exwife. If she is coaching them, i know CPS won't look too kindly at that.
You start off saying he has custody of the oldest, but towards the end say that the oldest was placed in foster care. I'm a little confused on that part, he does or does not have custody of any of his kids right now?
They are worried about the custody issue, and the fact his nine year old has been removed from the home. I wouldn’t say there is “nothing to do” in this case.
