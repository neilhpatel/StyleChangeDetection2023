My plan of action is to ignore the ticket until The Oregon DMV actually gives me my vehicle registration and plates. I would hope I get it all before the court date on the ticket in August.
I winced super hard when I read your plan of action was to ignore the ticket for the time being until I got to the part you said your court date is in August. That is probably a sage approach, but bear in mind CA administrative process is a bit unique in regard to remediable tickets like that, and you can't usually just present the information to the clerk 20 minutes prior to your hearing and it be dropped. Judges don't have the ability to utilize discretion in CA VC violations in the same was as they do in other states, so just make sure to look up the process of remedy and timeline granted beforehand, rather than just bring everything to the hearing in hopes it will be dismissed. Our court webpages are legit well written and pretty comprehensive in providing that type of information, so it should not be too hard to find via a google search.
You have to get your car registered within 30 days of moving to CA, so the argument you'd been away more often than not for six months is a bit of a stretch at that point.
You were driving in California, not Oregon. This means you needed to ensure your vehicle was registered, even though Oregon was letting them go. The vehicle was not legal to drive in CA without a valid registration.
If you have been a CA resident for more than 20 days you are required to register your car in CA. A ticket for an unregistered car is a lot more than $20 though, so it isn't clear what you were ticketed for. Talk to a traffic attorney if you want to fight the ticket.
