then someone like me will say oh hey nice the dems just passed the republican budget for them and cut back on x, y, and z. and someone on this sub will say "but if notttt the whole economy woulda crashed cutting social security, foodstamps, medicare, Medicaid was the lesser of two evils!" and that means I have to vote Democrat even though they've managed to pass more conservative legislation than republicans did in 4 years or else i'm a fascist.
oddly enough somehow the GOP plan will be the one passed through congress even though they are in the minority and democrats will say "ahhh but maybe if we vote for more democrats we can get the things we want".
The Dems have a bad track record of "pre-negotiating" with the GOP - The Dems will come to the table with an offer they think the GOP will accept, and the GOP then starts from there and pulls the negotiation farther to the right.
The Democrats absolutely should not negotiate - they should start and stay firm with "no cuts anywhere" and make the GOP take the first move.
