1. Return each and every piece of mail (unless it's junk like coupons etc), write "Not at this address" on every piece, use a black sharpie, and cross out the barcode on the bottom as well. Some ex-mailcarriers do not support this, but I can't find any official USPS statement that would lead me to believe this is 'defacing' or 'altering' or 'tampering with the mail', other than forcing a real human to look at the mail, vs being re-routed automatically to your house based on the barcode.
611.3 Mail Delivered to Wrong Person A person receiving mail not intended for him or her must promptly return it to the Post Office, endorsed “Opened by Mistake” with his or her signature if the letter is opened; otherwise, it should be endorsed “Not for..., Not at this address,” or words to the same effect.
2. Then put a note on your mailbox or shared mail 'box' for the postal delivery person to see that says "Only deliver mail for (you, spouse/SO and other residents) and PLEASE return any for (whoever past owner was) as they no longer live here".
In this situation, it appears more like the previous resident is continuing to use the address and doesn't intend to have his mail forwarded to his correct address.
Just understand that if the mail says "or current resident" it will not get forwarded. You're the current resident, it's yours to throw out. Look at the postage, if it says "standard" or "bulk business mail" - basically anything but 1st or 2nd class (magazines) won't get forwarded either.
I still get junk mail with their name on it, I presume because the post office doesn’t bother looking at the name on the junk stuff and it all just makes it through (mostly credit card offers) but it cut down on a LOT of their mail I was getting.
