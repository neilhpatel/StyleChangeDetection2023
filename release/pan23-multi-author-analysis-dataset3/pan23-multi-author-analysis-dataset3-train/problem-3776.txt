The HOA is not your landlord, so they cannot evict you or impose fines on you. If they have R&Rs which prohibit dogs, though, they can probably fine your landlord for being out of compliance with those rules, and can continue doing so for as long as they remain out of compliance (i.e. as long as your dog remains in the unit). Your landlord cannot pass those fines on to you.
Your landlord will terminate the lease. Your remedy will then be to sue for breach of contract. It would be much easier not to move in at all.
You should not do any of this unless you really enjoy hassle and misery. Your first step: find out if the restriction is true or not, direct from the landlord or the HOA. Second step: if it is true, then agree on termination with your landlord so you can walk away, and find a new place.
A "no dogs allowed" side on a particular building may mean that dogs are not allowed to walk/pee there. It's very hard to tell without context. Before anything else, follow up with the landlord, have them check the condo rules and regulations and other documents, or call property management and check before jumping to conclusions.
