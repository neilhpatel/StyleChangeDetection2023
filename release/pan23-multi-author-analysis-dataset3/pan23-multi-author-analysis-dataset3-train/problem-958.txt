“The country and government is giving everything that the army asks for — everything,” Putin told top military officials at the Defense Ministry’s annual meeting in Moscow on Wednesday. “I trust that there will be an appropriate response and the results will be achieved.”.
Putin spoke a day after he conceded in a message to Russia’s spy agencies that the situation in four partly-occupied regions of southeastern Ukraine was “extremely difficult.” A successful Ukrainian counteroffensive is wresting back control of an increasing amount of the territory including the city of Kherson, the only regional capital Russia seized during the war.
In a largely low-key address devoid of forecasts of imminent success, Putin sought to deflect blame for what he called the “shared tragedy” of the war that he began, repeating claims that the conflict was unavoidable even as Ukraine and its US and European allies had repeatedly made clear before the invasion that there was no threat to Russia’s security.
“We are not going to repeat the mistakes of the USSR, instead we will make new ones, like starting a direct war against a country fully backed by the west, re-unifying NATO and helping NATO expand by making historically neutral countries nervous with our war of aggression”.
“We will not repeat the mistakes of the past, when in the interests of increasing defense capability where necessary and where it was not really necessary in fact, we destroyed our economy,” he said. “We simply don’t need this.”.
