Second of all, having your assets in separate bank accounts means nothing when it comes time to divorce. All property that is acquired during the marriage is considered communal property in Washinon. This means that if you save up for 6 months before the divorce, it just goes into the pot to be divvied up. This also includes any debts that were incurred during the marriage. You are also likely entitled to a share of any retirement funds and property such as real estate acquired during the marriage, regardless of who earned the income that paid for it.
Personally I would get a consult with a divorce attorney ASAP, then you can make some plans for how to move forward.
I would call several divorce attorneys and ask lots of questions. You can get a lot of free advice this way. Find one that is patient that you get along with well but seems aggressive enough to go after what you deserve. Ask if there's things you can do to help bring down the cost. If they're not receptive to that, that's a red flag, in my opinion. The attorney I chose is a retired family court judge who from what I can tell, is doing this more for fun than for the money. So he tells me the things I can research or do and my time is cheaper than his so it saves me money.
I just finished a 2 year divorce, it was nasty and drawn out. I'm hoping yours is much quicker and easier....Here's some insight into things I wish I knew ahead of time. Keep in mind I live in Hawaii so the laws in my state may be different from yours.
