Talk to your state representative about repealing or modifying the law, or collect signature up for a vote. Alternately, unionize and ask the union to go against decades of union philosophy to require breaks be optional (or paid). All three are incredible long shots however.
California allows employees to waive their break, but both the employee and the employer have to agree in writing.
If your rest break works for you I believe you can enter into a written agreement with your employer to waive the meal break as long as you don’t work 12 hours at a time. Most employers don’t like to do this because the law does not allow them to promote this option and if they are ever found out of compliance with meal break laws they usually are forced to pay a one hour penalty for each meal period missed.
Q.	Is it permissible if I choose to work through my meal period so that I can leave my job 30 minutes early?
There are conditions that allow you to work through a meal period but it does not allow ending a shift early.
The meal break cannot be waived if it would be the last meal break in the shift and your shift is more than six hours. (If one meal break in the shift, it cannot be waived as it is the last meal break.).
A.	No, working through your meal period does not entitle you to leave work early prior to your scheduled quitting time. In order for an "on duty" meal period to be permitted under the Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders, the nature of the work must actually prevent the employee from being relieved of all duty, and there must be a written agreement that an on-the-job paid meal period is agreed to. Additionally, the written agreement must also state that the employee may, in writing, revoke the agreement at any time.
