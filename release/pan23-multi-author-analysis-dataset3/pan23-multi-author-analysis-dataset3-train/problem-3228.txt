Hopefully they have been getting Social Security survivor benefits from when their dad passed. They remain eligible until 18 or finishing high school, whichever occurs last. Need to talk to SS since their survivor benefit may change. You will need the death cert for this.
Death certificates are issued in the place where death took place. You would get them in Oklahoma, not Missouri. There will be a local clerk in the city or county where she died. A death certificate is public record and anyone can purchase it. It shouldn’t take that long to get it. You might even be able to order on line.
If a coroner signs it would take longer to get a death certificate with a specific cause of death, but in the meantime there is usually one with the cause listed as “pending” that is on file. This is so business and financial issues can start to be addressed. The dc can later be amended to show the official cause. My point was that they would be looking in the wrong state and that they could probably order it on line.
