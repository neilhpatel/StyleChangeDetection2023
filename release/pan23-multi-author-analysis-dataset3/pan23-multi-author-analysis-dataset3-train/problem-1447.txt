I think this is part of the problem though. Everything becomes partisan. It remains to be seen if what Hunter Biden was doing wasn't illegal. As far as I'm aware I think there is actually an ongoing criminal investigation into his activities. His business partner Devon Archer has already been arrested and convicted of fraud. And there are emails from a shady British businessman James Gilliar, who is also tied up with middle eastern leaders, potentially suggesting that deals with China involved a percentage for "the big guy" - a deal that looks to have been negotiated while Biden was VP. That certainly looks questionable.
Kushner absolutely should also be investigated. His deals with Qatar Saudi Arabia and Israel are of course sketchy. There is a deeply embedded culture in Washinon, of connected persons leveraging those connections and then kickbacks come back to the politicians who can exert political power. It's blatantly obvious why Jared Kushner or Hunter Biden can even do these deals - something is expected in return. Democrats that insist on pretending that the Hunter Biden story is a nothingburger are part of the problem, in my view.
Then ask yourself why Biden didn’t probe trump with an investigation and instead sat dormant for 2 years waiting for republicans to start this hogwash.
Democrats should all be for this since they obviously won’t find anything, even after a years long investigation…I mean, you DO think Biden is clean, right?
I hope some Democrats on the committees dupe Republicans by framing a question that seems like it's based around the Bidens but at the end pull out the rug showing it's about the Trumps.
The media loves Trump and doing shit like that will steal any oxygen these brain-dead investigations have with the media.
