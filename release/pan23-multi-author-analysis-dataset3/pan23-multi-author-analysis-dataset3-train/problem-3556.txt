Richard did have a reputation for being cruel among contemporary witnesses, mostly stemming from his time ruling Aquitaine before he became king.
It's important to note that the cruelty in governing Aquitaine, while he most certainly destroyed castles and was a tyrant, the accusations of stealing daughters, rape, and giving them to his soldiers is only really brought up by his rivals in Aquitaine. His conduct during the Crusade actually depicts him treating with the captured wives of his Muslim opponents quite differently. Even releasing a few of them. This does not mean it didn't happen. It only means some doubt is cast. Not helped because i do not believe any specific names are mentioned of who Richard supposedly gave to his soldiers, just vague accounts where it happened.
It is also important to note that in one chronicle of the event (William of Tyre) portrays the event as a response from Richard not from his own maliciousness, but as a means of controlling his troops. The soldiers apparently became enraged after Saladin failed bring the prisoners and return the True Cross on the second (or third depending on which source of the renegotiation process you trust) time and so Richard had the prisoners killed to assuage their grief.
