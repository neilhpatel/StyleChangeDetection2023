Massachusetts. And there are 2 unused rooms which have doors, closets, and unsealed windows. So I believe they could be counted as bedrooms.
In regards to this point you made "The apartment only has 3 bedrooms. (there are multiple extra rooms which could function as a bedroom- have doors/closet)", it's important to note that there are legal definitions in building codes for what constitutes a bedroom. Just because a room looks like it could house a person sleeping there it could be illegal for the landlord to rent that room as a bedroom.
However, just because a room meets these requirements, the landlord is within their rights to NOT designate a room a "bedroom". And they are also likewise free to restrict tenancy on the basis of of bedrooms.
- most places have explicit rules about what can/can't be a "bedroom"; this is more for fire code. A bedroom has to have TWO means of egress in many places, the door and a window. A storage room or a den with only a sealed window or no window would not satisfy this; the landlord would face municipal fines.
Unless you're in a state that restricts when a landlord can choose to not renew, they can put any legal restriction on your renewal including limiting a 3 room apartment to 3 people. Even if you are in one of those states the landlord may still be able to do so.
