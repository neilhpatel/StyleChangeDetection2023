I could be wrong and/or it may vary based on a personâ€™s location, but I believe it is afforded the same level of privilege that is given to doctor and patient and lawyer-client type settings. At least in the sense that it is presumed to be private but may be breached when necessary for specific legal or emergent reasons.
Question on this: in the modern setting, the setting of the confessional is afforded a great deal of sanctity and presumed privacy both socially and in my understanding legally.
But the "seal of confession" in the sense of clergy-penitent privilege, as it were, has pretty much always been fundamental to the sacrament.
The wild efforts of people to avoid time in purgatory--indulgences much?--also point to the importance to them of confession, since that was the thing that would get them into purgatory instead of hell in the first place. (Indulgences do NOT save a person from damnation.).
1. The genuine belief (among clergy as well as laity) that confession and absolution is absolutely necessary--no exceptions--for sinners (read: everyone) to make it to heaven.
In practice, however, the confession-Eucharist connection amounted to a strong focus on both sacraments in religious instruction: the Eucharist, that it was the genuine body and blood of Christ and reception was necessary for salvation; confession, what sins were and what was moral behavior and the necessary contrition-confession-penance triad. Oh, yeah, and that really you needed to confess to a priest and receive sacramental absolution; just shouting at the sky was insufficient for salvation purposes.
