It'd send Turkey, as well as any other nations flirting with authoritarianism a message, as well as reinforcing that NATO stands by its principles - even those that were members won't get off easy if they stray down that path.
They want to join NATO but they made protection deals, and clearly they doesn't want to give Turkey any "power", accepting their terms is basically a humiliation for Sweden/Finland and they are not desperate enough !
but doesn't it put Russia 'on notice' the mere fact both Sweden and Finland had passed NATO's selection criteria and can just wait for the Turkey stance to be sorted?
You do know that Turkey (and Hungary) could simply ratify just Finland's application if Sweden was the only problem for Turkey ?
There are no actual signs of ratification by either Turkey or Hungary. Just your basic bazaar haggling. Always ask for more if you get what you wanted before. The only way to win is not to play. Turkey (and Hungary) have now found out the buyers' limits, and need to decide for themselves.
