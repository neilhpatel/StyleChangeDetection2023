Yes - but what people forget on LA is that winning your case doesn’t mean you’re going to actually be made whole the way you would expect.
Granted an eviction in OH should be a lot easier than many other states - but you’re probably talking another month.
Yup, considering the cost of something like an eviction, it's downright cheap! It's a bit like why I pay $200 or so every year for an umbrella policy.
Possibly but since they had permission to stay for the 30 days, this is most likely to now be considered a landlord tenant situation which will mean going through that legal process.
You are going to have to get a tenant lawyer and 1) start the eviction process, and 2) also failure to perform on the sales agreement by turning over possession of the property. All you have is the sales agreement - but probably nothing covering the sellers not turning over the possession of the property.
What exactly does the contract say about over staying the possession after closing? There should be provisions for this situation outlined in the contract.
This is a major reason why most folks recommend never agreeing to such a clause in the contract. It may seem like just being nice to the prior owner but buying a house is already a crazy-making process and dealing with this is just more of that.
