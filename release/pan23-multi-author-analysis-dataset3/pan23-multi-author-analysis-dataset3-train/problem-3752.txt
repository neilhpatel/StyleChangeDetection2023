You're almost exactly right, of the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust, 3 million were of Polish extraction. Then another 1.5 million Polish gentiles were also murdered on top of that.
Those millions of Slavs died because they were murdered or starved to death as a consequence of Germany's invasion of the USSR. It wasn't a targeted, industrialized process to remove every single individual Slav they could get their hands on. It was intentional, and it was evil, but it was also different from the Holocaust.
There's a big difference between "How many people do you think were killed during the Holocaust?" as an open ended question as opposed to "Do you think the number of holocaust deaths were exaggerated"?
There’s a big difference between publicly stating “the Holocaust was exaggerated” and answering in a survey “I think the Holocaust deaths must have been lower”.
