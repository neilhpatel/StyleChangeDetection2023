The problem is that you are not in a warzone. The justifiable use of lethal force hangs on whether or not someone is presenting an immediate threat of serious injury or death. There are a vanishingly small number of realistic scenarios where touching off a mine would meet the imminence requirement.
Claymores have the option of being initiated by wire, that's why I used them as an example. I understand that you're talking about devices set off by a human rather than a tripwire or pressure switch. You're still going to be in an impossible position of defending that use of force as justified to prevent immediate loss of life.
It's extremely difficult to argue that you are doing anything but assaulting someone when you're triggering your "remote ordinance.".
You're still going to have strict criminal and civil liability for injuries caused, and self defense is an affirmative defense, which means you're still likely to be arrested. Because it's in the public interest to not have ridiculous people setting tripwires or remote guns or whatever other idiocy you have planned.
If you are not in danger it is not a threat. You don't get to execute someone unilaterally because they're on your property and might cause you harm.
