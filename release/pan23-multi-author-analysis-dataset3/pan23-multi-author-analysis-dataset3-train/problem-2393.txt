Maybe I was a bit harsh in my comments but your story is really fishy. And to have eBay side with a seller in any dispute is rare enough to think you're making your side a bit more rose-tinted and naive than it was.
Like I said earlier, if buying an item bidding on it, then why would ebay allow sellers to later cancel orders on their own? Whether or not ebay themselves or the buyer cancelled my order, I have seen people who reported winning an auction and even paying for the item, but the seller isn't happy with the profit afterall and cancels the order before/after the payment.
To have ebay side with a seller is clearly because of how new my account is. That is, to them, an absolute redflag. But like I said earlier, the bidding the system is not fair neither for the buyer nor for the seller.
The thing is, you should look at this more as a buyer and less as a seller. What kind of seller who doesn't care to lose 12-15% (154.8-193.5€ in my case) of the winning bid, just because the buyer exceeded one day of non-payment and wants to see authenticity?
Frankly, considering how much you bitch about it after the fact, I think 200€ was a small price to pay for seller not to deal with your drama.
