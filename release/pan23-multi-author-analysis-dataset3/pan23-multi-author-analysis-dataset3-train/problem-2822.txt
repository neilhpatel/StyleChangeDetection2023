But is that any different than attacking a nuclear silo on actual territory. You're attacking a nuclear shipment. Chances of it going off in the attack, retaliation or something other catastrophic are immense.
Bombing research facilities is not the same as attacking an actual, operational nuclear weapon. And can you guarantee your strike will immediately disable the weapon? What happens if nuclear bombers are carrying live nukes and they're shot down? Or damaged? Or have a dead man's switch to immediately drop the payload on damage or pilot death/ejection?
I'm sure Russia will find some way. Have a conscript sit next to it in a truck holding a dead man's button, escort a flight with nuclear bombers. Nobody is going to attack a nuclear shipment, end of story. It's a literal declaration of nuclear war if that happens.
Giving Iran a couple nukes would be unprecedented. Helping them with their nuclear program would be similar.
The nukes have always been a threat. Something to wave around and claim you have, but in reality never intend to use. I donâ€™t think they have been properly maintained, nothing else they have has been.
