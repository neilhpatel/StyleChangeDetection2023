As per usual, the best legal advice is typically to avoid getting involved the legal system at all (if/when possible).
OP, your strictly legal advice is that it’s likely your neighbor can’t tell you not to park there. The best advice otherwise is to try to the best of your ability to avoid causing a stir with someone who you have to live next to for presumably the next few years atleast. Without knowing more specifics on the situation at hand, I’m curious as to why you can’t park in front of your own lot. To be equally fair it sounds like your neighbors parking needs exceed his means and he’s trying to throw some perceived clout around to prevent his issues.
This isn’t so much about my parking needs since we use our lot, but we do have family over often during the weekends when he wouldn’t need “his spot.” Our other neighbors have parked there on numerous occasions and have had no issues with said neighbor.
So he has to park somewhere and just as there is nothing legally preventing you from parking there, there is nothing legally preventing him from parking in front of your house too. Just something to keep in mind.
