Honestly I dont think geoengineering should be free for any startup to just go and do unilaterally. There are lots of rich idiots with half baked understandings of science and a god complex, and the planet should not be in their hands. Global climate should not be something that is controlled by whoever has the money to fling whatever chemicals they want into the stratosphere.
Here’s the thing, stratospheric aerosol injection is estimated to cost <10 billion annually to fix global warming.
Now I’m sure you’re going to say something about money not being the all important thing, but money is just a medium of exchange. What we are really looking at is opportunity cost. All those power stations and cars and ships and steel plants, what else could we build if we didn’t have to rebuild them? This is going to effect poor countries as well. Maybe if we don’t have to replace all the worlds cars, companies are instead able to manufacture more washing machines (they compete for some of the same resources), and more women are freed from household chores and can have careers.
