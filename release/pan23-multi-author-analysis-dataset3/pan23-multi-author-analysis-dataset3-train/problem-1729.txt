To start with, the Journal of Transformative Works and Cultures is a peer reviewed journal whose focus is transformative works, ie fan created works. They are a wonderful resource for anyone engaging in any type of fan studies.
Finally, and this is where I am sure the librarian will first point you, is JSTOR. Its archive is... immense and will allow you to cast a very wide net across a wide variety of academic journals that have published articles that deal with your subject from a variety of different viewpoints.
There are also a few published collections out like Fandom, Second Edition: Identities and Communities in a Mediated World edited by Jonathan Gray, Cornel Sandvoss, and C. Lee Harrinon, or Productive Fandom: Intermediality and Affective Reception in Fan Cultures by Nicolle Lamerichs whose first chapter "Shared Narratives: Intermediality in Fandom" is a review of the history of the field, a resource I would not dismiss for your purposes, since you can mine its citations for your needs.
I think some explanation would be helpful. Are you required to use sources that are only published in academic journals only focusing on history, then? Or only sources published by historians? Because not everything written by an historian will be published in an historical journal.
Unfortunately since it’s a history and English assignment I need both historical and English sources. I have loads about fandom culture and Star Trek (which is the fandom I’m focusing on) but I need history sources. It’s a bit hard to explain since I don’t think america really has anything like this “project”. But thank you for the recommendations for academic journals that’s very useful.
