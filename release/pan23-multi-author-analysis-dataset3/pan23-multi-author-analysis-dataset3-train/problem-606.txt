This whole subplot is a sideshow to the actual battle of Marathon in our main source, the Histories by Herodotos of Halikarnassos. He only mentions the Spartan march briefly and says nothing about the conditions of the march or the state of the 2000 Spartans at the end of it:
In any case, even if the Spartans had arrived on time, 2000 men did not make a very substantial force. The Athenians themselves are said to have deployed 9000, with tiny Plataiai providing another 1000 which probably amounted to its entire hoplite levy. The Spartans could have sent many more troops; clearly they didn't care enough to do what they could to save Athens from subjection to Persia. The army they sent to Athens may not have been as pathetic a token force as the 1000 men they sent to Thermopylai 10 years later, but it showed a similar reluctance to commit real numbers to any campaign outside the Peloponnese.
2000 men sent (though i dont think herodotus distinguishes whether theyâ€™re all spartans or pereoeci as well) is not an insignificant portion of their population nor is it a militarily insignificant.
Sending just 2,000 men out of a population which could, at the time, still sustain an army of at least 10,000 hoplites, and not even bothering to call up any of the allies in support, was at best an insultingly low effort on the part of the Spartans. At worst it was a sign that Sparta was not terribly concerned if Athens fell to the Persians.
