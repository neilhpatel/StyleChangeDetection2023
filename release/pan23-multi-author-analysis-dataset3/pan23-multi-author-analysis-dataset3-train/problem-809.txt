I mean, last I was in Russia, they celebrated Christmas on the 7th of January, as the orthodox church didnt adjust for the Julian calender, like the catholics back whenâ€¦.
TL:Rd The Russian Orthodox church and some other eastern Orthodox churches still use a "Traditional" calendar that doesn't account for the leap years so it is partially shifted and will become more shifted as time goes on..
It's a fairly standard split that comes from the Russian Orthodox churches not being able to attend the Synod where the calendar was revised due to Soviet influence.
So, you have like 30% of Ukrainians being Catholic and some other percentage of Orthodox also aligning with a "western rite" that uses the Revised calendar since 2014 as a reaction against the Russian Patriarchs support for the Russian invasion. The Orthodox Patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch, the Orthodox Churches of Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Orthodox Church in America all align with Constantinople rather than Russia. The Orthodox Churches of Jerusalem, Serbia, Montenegro, Poland, North Macedonia, Georgia, and the Greek Old Calendarists and others align with Russia.
Russian Orthodox use the 7th of January. But a number of Ukrainian Orthodox churches turned to answer to the Patriarchate of Constantinople since 2014, and they Revised their Julian Calendar in a Synod in 1923 to conform with a December 25th Christmas date.
On October 18, 2022, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine allowed dioceses to hold Christmas services according to the Revised Julian calendar, i.e., December 25.
