The post mentioned that most of the pro-Lincoln votes in slave states were in Missouri. Does that accurately reflect a pro-slavery sentiment in the other slave states, or is there some other reason they disagreed with Missouri in this?
From what I read, most in Missouri voted anti-slavery/Union even though they were marginally pro-slavery, correct? Why (if this is correct), and was this (somewhat of a) paradox similar to how the other slave states were?
Yes, as I said in the post above, the vote to send people to a proposed secession convention resulted in about an 80-20 split for unionist delegates. That tracks fairly well with the percentage of families who were enslavers and/or were able to influence votes in slave counties. And then the placement of the convention in St. Louis and the activities of unionist militia drove the rump legislature/confederate forces out of the state. The slave states that stayed in the union (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware) all had a lower percentage of slave ownership than the seceding states (Delawareâ€™s was about 3% iirc, compared with nearly 50% in South Carolina and Mississippi).
Secession was about preserving slavery, and everyone knew it at the time. This isn't something that's really up for debate unless you're someone who buys into the Lost Cause "states rights" myth. goes into great detail over it; and by /u/freedmenspatrol are particularly instructive.
Thank you for answering. I was wondering if/how some slaves states staying in the Union reflected/affected the perception that the succession/Civil War was about slavery or states rights to people in those slave states at that time.
