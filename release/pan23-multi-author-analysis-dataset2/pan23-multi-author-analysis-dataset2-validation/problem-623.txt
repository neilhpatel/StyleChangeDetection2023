When it comes to Napoleonic Laws, there are two main phases: one is the 1802 Code Napoleon, and the other is the reformed 1815 constitution.
(i) Legislature: Napoleon strenhened the Senate (which was loyal to him) while weakening the Tribunate and Legislative Corps (which weren't). In any case, he had the senatus.
(ii) Worker's Rights: The law allowed freedom of labor, but did not allow unions or even strikes. In practice, it was even worse, as in any trade dispute police took the owner's side and police had the power to arbitrarily settle any wage dispute. It was nothing exceptionally bad compared to the rest of Europe.
In comparison, in Britain, only men could ask for divorce until 1857. But it had to be granted by an expensive Act of Parliament. It does seem that even Code Napoleon was ahead of its time when it came to women's rights.
consultum (which allowed him to pass anything with the approval of the loyal senate, as long as it was "urgent") and the plebiscite (which was another sure way of getting something approved as Napoleon was popular enough and electoral fraud was heavily practiced). The only state with a stronger legislature in Europe was perhaps Britain. Unlike Britain, however, universal male suffrage did exist in Napoleonic France.
(iii) Women's Rights: Women in revolutionary France had the right to receive a divorce by mutual consent. Under the code, both sets of parents had to agree. Also, a man could sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, but a woman only if the husband brought the concubine home.
About women's rights: you're right about the atrocious treatment of women and feminists by the Revolution. As soon as women's rights movements stopped being useful to the goals of the revolutionaries they were scrapped. But since we're taking the late 18th century into account, we're mostly looking for scraps. And the right to an easy divorce is pretty exceptional for that time. As I explained later, even the Code Napoleon was quite progressive for contemporary Europe.
(iv) Slavery: Slavery and slave trade were initially illegal (thanks to Revolutionary France) but Napoleon reinstated it in the Code Napoleon. It is to be noted that Britain abolished slave trade in 1807, thus being the only country more progressive compared to Napoleonic France in this regard.
(v) Equality and Meritocracy: Napoleonic France had a hereditary aristocracy, but anyone could theoretically reach that rank. It did offer equality before the law, which was progressive compared to most of Europe but just a tepid continuation of Revolutionary laws.
The 1815 constitution, drafted by Benjamin Constant (a noted liberal figure) made significant changes, perhaps because of Napoleon's desperation:
(i) All the changes made in the Bourbon restoration (such as the abolition of the Legion of Honor, restoration of the old nobility) were revoked.
Regarding slavery I would like to point out that napoleon did not re-establish slavery as much as he kept it in the colonies returned to France by Britain in the Peace of Amiens. Slavery remained abolished in the french colonies that had not been taken by the British who still held slavery to be legal until 1807 as you pointed out. I think it's an important distinction because napoleon himself was indifferent to slavery and mostly in favor of keeping the status quo of abolition but had a strong slave owner lobby around him through his wide Josephine who was from a plantation owner family. Later on in his exile he admitted how much of a mistake he had made giving in to their demands.
I also agree on the slavery point, it changed little in practice. But as with the women's rights question, I'm mostly arguing on principles.
Regarding women it is also interesting to point out that the revolution itself was fairly hostile to women's right and sent its fair share of feminists and suffragettes to the guillotine or insane asylums. Napol√©ons handling of the status of women was not particularly at odds with the beliefs of the time but many seem to be unaware of how unfriendly the french revolution was to women's rights for the most part. The code napoleon also enshrined the responsibility of the fathers and husbands towards their children or spouses so they weren't completely unprotected. Widows also had the same legal standing as adult men as they had neither a husband or father as legal custodian but would lose that status if remarried.
Unfortunately, I don't know much about Napoleonic rule over Germany and Italy, or specifically how electoral liberties were impacted. But people are unlikely to have benefitted in the short run, given that his client states had heavy burdens of sending soldiers and money for his wars. The worst part for these client states was the partial destruction of some of their industries due to the Continental Blockade.
