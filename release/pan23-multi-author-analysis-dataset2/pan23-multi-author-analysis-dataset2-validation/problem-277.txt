Contact DHR, but also contact your local representative and senator if you can't get a callback from DHR.
There should be alternate verification like pay stubs in the case where an employer is being a pain, but it's possible that the caseworker is overloaded or just terrible at getting back. If you can find out the phone for their supervisor or office director, that can also be an avenue to try.
Most bank statements, apps, etc. will have photos of the checks when deposited. These have worked for me in the last weekend proving income. If you can't find it on your statement go into the bank and see if they have something.
When you can not get that form filled out (for TANF or Medicare at least) they are by law required to accept a sworn statement by the parent who the case is under what the income is. That's who will be held accountable for fraud if it's wrong & they will nail that person's ass to the wall since they couldn't get the form they want. They will probably also do a review in 3 months or 6 months rather than a full year to get a copy of your taxes.
If your handwritten checks do not show how much in FICA taxes, state taxes, and federal income taxes have been taken out each week or each month (whatever the pay period is), then it makes one question whether the W2 forms that are sent out at the beginning of January 2022 will be correct.
If there are any coworkers who have worked there for at least six months of 2020 and were there in January 2021, ask them if they got their W2 forms on time so that they could do their federal income taxes, or were their problems in using the W2 forms.
