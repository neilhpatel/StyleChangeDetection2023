California has some of the most strict laws in favor of employees when it comes to hours worked shifts worked things like that. I would check and see that I believe California has a minimum time between shifts regulation. Regardless if you do receive a write-up my advice would be to contact Human Resources inform them of the situation because more than likely they have a policy in place where the supervisor should have stepped in at that point and because they didn't they are the ones who should truly receive the right up.
Depending on what kind of site you were posted at you actually could possibly be in legal trouble by leaving the site unmanned if there are any monetary damages.
California has no overtime notice requirement, more likely than not your handbook states that you must remain on site until properly relieved or given approval by management. From your post it does not sound like you got either. And supervisors, depending on their policies and regulations, do not have to cover but the company can also remove their supervisor status if they do not.
They do as I used to be a supervisor and this was a requirement. I stepped down recently due to the constant 50-70hr weeks and only making 50cents more than everyone else. As for min time idk it is here and it's 8 hours. If I had stayed with no relief I would have had about 8 hours between the shifts 1 hour of which would be driving. So I'm not sure about that either and if it would count since I have the commute time making it effectively 7 hours(which is really more like 5 hours of sleep and 2 hours of getting ready/getting to the jobsite).
On the other side depending on how true your coworker statement is about contacting someone they would also be at minimum receiving progressive discipline. Our company policy is you have to verbally receive confirmation and a text message is not allowed for a call off. Granted if you’re in the hospital and I get a text from your spouse/family that’s a different story.
Speaking frankly, at minimum he will be written up but if it was me as the supervisor/manager that was presented with this I would be processing your termination. Granted I would also be communicating with you once I was aware of the situation and trying my best to take care of that but at the point there is post abandonment that leads to immediate termination in every company I’ve been part of.
