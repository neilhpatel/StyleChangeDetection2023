The only differences between a tree and a bush are the size and growth pattern. Bushes are shorter with multiple stems and no obvious trunk. Some varieties of mulberry can .
On a tangential note, a lot of domesticated plants are pruned and/or bred to be shorter than their wild relatives, so that they are easier to harvest. Domesticated tea plants (_Camellia sinensis_) rarely grow more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall on plantations. Wild tea trees usually grow to 10-15 feet (3 meters) and can occasionally grow much taller than that.
Similarly, wild Apple trees frequently exceed 40 feet (12 meters), but usually are grown to around 15-25 feet (4.5-7.5 meters) on orchards.
The mulberry tree died during 2017 and was cut down and removed on 7 May 2019. Cuttings were taken during the 1980s and have grown into mature trees. Further cuttings taken from these trees will be replanted at HMP Wakefield to replace the mulberry tree.
Another possible interpretation of the rhyme is that it references Britain's struggles to produce silk, mulberry trees being a key habitat for the cultivation of silkworms. As Bill Bryson explains, Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries tried to emulate the success of the Chinese in silk production but the industry was held back by periodic harsh winters and mulberry trees proved too sensitive to frost to thrive. The traditional lyrics "Here we go round the mulberry bush / On a cold and frosty morning" may therefore be a joke about the problems faced by the industry.
As for 'Pop goes the weasel' that's about pawning (pop) your Sunday best coat (weasel and stoat) mid week to spent the money on food and booze down 'The Eagle Tavern'.
