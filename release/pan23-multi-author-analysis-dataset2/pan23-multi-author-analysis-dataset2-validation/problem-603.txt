What u/history_question98 is fairly accurate. There's a risk that if I testify about the incident the other person used as justification for their protective order, that some of that information may be self incriminating and may be used against me in a potential future criminal case. However, there's very little risk of self incriminating testimony regarding the details in my petition for a protective order against the other person.
It depends on the specific details (that doubt exist because this isn't real). And if you testify on something it is on the record and can be used in another case if it is relevant. But it will be incriminating no matter when you testify to it so.... it is dumb either way.
Pleading the 5th has different implications depending on where the testimony is being given. In a criminal case, it's a constitutional right to not give testimony against yourself (unless you're offered immunity). In a civil case, taking the 5th allows the fact finder to draw an adverse inference against the witness. Thus, the fact finder is allowed to determine that the testimony would be adverse to the party invoking the 5th, and use that determination in deciding the matter. Consequently, it could make sense to invoke the 5th in a criminal case, but to testify in a civil case. For this reason, most criminal attorneys try not their clients testify when there are criminal charges pending. Many civil cases are stayed when there are ancillary criminal cases.
I found a couple sources on this matter. If anyone can provide insight into what's being said in the articles it would be greatly appreciated. The articles seem to indicate that invoking the 5th in a civil matter is different than invoking the 5th in a criminal matter ( u/defence18 says this above) . In a criminal matter, invoking the 5th is "all or nothing" where you are giving up your right to testify at all, but also preventing a prosecutor from asking you questions that would self incriminate. In a civil matter, the 5th seems to be much more nimble, where it can be invoked in response to questions on one event, but that doesn't prevent you providing testimony on other events. The articles indicate that a person doing this has to be careful because "once you disclose a fact, you have waived your rights to remain silent on the details." Said another way, "When a party testifies voluntarily, and therefore controls the extent of disclosure, â€˜\[t\]he privilege is waived for the matters to which the witness testifies." So as long as I don't provide testimony on the facts in the other person's case, I can retain my 5th amendment rights if they ask me questions about that case while still being able to provide testimony on the facts relevant to my case so long as there is no overlap between the two cases. Tricky tricky.
