So Auschwitz-Birkenau has a dual name because it was a dual camp? (Both concentration and extermination?) And if referring to one part or the other, the (respective) name is the correct one?
No, because it was a subcamp in the Auschwitz complex (also known as Auschwitz II). E. g. Auschwitz III was also known as Monowitz or Auschwitz-Monowitz.
Three main ones: Auschwitz I (where the only surviving crematorium can be seen), Auschwitz II Birkenau (where most of extermination took place), Auschwitz III Monowitz aka Buna (the industrial slave labor camp) and more than 40 smaller subcamps.
I have previously answered the question about the German people's knowlege of the Holocaust in general.
Specifically the extermination camps (as opposed to "mere" concentration camps) had the highest degree of camouflage:
Thus, the Red Cross was strictly forbidden to inspect Auschwitz and Auschwitz-Birkenau, this is documented by the Nazis themselves:
Certainly, the information about some of what was going on in various camps was appearing in the Western and Soviet press for years, at least since 1942. Take the Polish Govt-in-Exile's 1942 report "The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland" or the 1944 report of the escaped Auschwitz inmates Wetzler and Vrba. There were thousands of various such articles, naming Treblinka and other camps.
But with all such reports, and the war going on, I speculate (and I say so explicitly) that the public may have become numb to the facts of the reports themselves. So when the reality hit after the liberation of the camps, that was still a shock - not mere theoretical words on paper but the real horrors.
Just as an example, as the Soviets were moving towards Auschwitz, they were liberating its smaller subcamps one by one and we have the liberation reports. You can read some of them here and see the progression and, sometimes, the emotions:
That makes sense. I assume that while it was unlikely that German citizens were completely oblivious to what was happening in the camps, it's not like today where media is everywhere, all the time, showing you what is happening throughout the world. So if nothing else, the populace would potentially be able to at least ignore what they didn't want to acknowledge once Hitler moved the executions to remote camps in order to hide them from the German people, unlike today where the media would make it fairly impossible to ignore.
I had heard an account of how the mayor of a town in which one of the concentration camps resided, and his wife, were forced by Allied commanders to come into the camp to witness firsthand what had happened when the Nazis withdrew (of course they had executed all of the remaining prisoners and stacked their bodies, as well as left dead bodies in fire pits, inside the gas chamber, etc). Both he and his wife, after seeing the what the Nazis had done, promptly went home and committed suicide. Would someone like the mayor have not known the level of depravity within the gates of a camp, or was it more likely the shame of getting caught, instead of ignorance and disgust over the atrocities committed, that lead to their suicidal guilt? I'm speaking in general, not necessarily about this particular couple. As in did the Nazis attempt to conceal the level of absolute atrocities happening inside the camps even to people as close to the situation as the mayor of the town. I apologize that I don't remember the name of the town, but I do remember that I heard about it while watching a documentary on Patton, so I assume he was one of the Allied commanders present.
