I genuninly don't think anything will go wrong. He is a very good person with a job/responsibilities. I don't know anyone to write any legal stuff and he is moving in within a week, so if I could skip that step, it would be good. Will it be much harder down the line if I don't have anything in writing? The house belongs to me and I can keep invoices of rent paid or something.
Rules, expectations, EVERYTHING should be in writing and on a MTM basis. You do NOT know someone until you live with them a few months. Protect yourself, and your friend, by getting things in writing.
There’s not a great reason to suspect you somehow wouldn’t be able to evict him when the time came. Perhaps he could try to claim you have an oral lease for a year and you’re attempting to evict him shy of that, but with no proof whatsoever to bolster this claim it seems unlikely to be upheld. Still, leases preserve relationships. They make the rules clear for both parties, so there’s no room for awkward disagreements. Your lease would include terms like quiet hours, visiting hours/overnights, smoking, not leaving food scraps in bedrooms/cleaning bedrooms and commons areas, pets/pet cleanup, smoking, parking, taking out the trash, and more. You don’t have this lease because you don’t trust the guy, you just have it so everyone knows what’s expected of them. You should also carefully photograph/video the property before your friend moves in and complete a walk through inspection with them present. Google “move in inspection checklists” and fill one out with them. Take and send post move-in photos to your friend’s email address along with a copy of the lease and the move-in checklist so they have it for their record.
It doesn't need to be approved by a lawyer or notary or anything, it's just better to have stuff in writing (rent amount, spaces you do or don't want him to treat as his own, guests and sub-subletters, anything else to make your living together more harmonious).
