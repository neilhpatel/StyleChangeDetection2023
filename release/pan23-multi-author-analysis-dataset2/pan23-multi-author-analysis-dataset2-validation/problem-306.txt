You think tech support for your grandparents sucks. Just wait until every political decision and every meaningful permanent job position is filled into perpetuity by undying conservative ghouls literally making politics for the last century, not understanding (or willing to understand) anything of the modern world they live in. Imagine a supreme court that never gets replaced, not in a hundred years. To imagine it, just figure what a racist homophobic theocratic hellhole we would live it, if we were still covered by our great grandparents today? Reserve your sundays for military parades and sundays for pogrom and book burnings. Satantic panic, ban of videogames and other progressive technology old headed people don't like. All you might see is a great body, but the human mind is net made for eternal life.
Not to mention the rich will be the ones living forever. Imagine a world where Bezos and Rupert Murdoch can pay to keep themselves alive indefinitely.
Look we just need to make a few intelligent people live forever so that they can teach us through history. We'll build them big comfortable mansions and cater to their every need so that they can stay focused on learning about current times and pass on the knowledge. How could that possible become a nightmare?
Of course it would be the perspective from where I'm living today and from my current understanding of the world when speculating about how the future turns out.
Because we are used to care and tend to our intelligent people that much. I am sure you find all those intelligent kids in school having a great time with their peers.
I'm with you but I don't think it would be so dramatic. Like you're saying, it's not like it's a cure all. And how are they going to shift the religious narrative alot of people follow? Guess if we built a new civilization from the rubble of our old one but with anti-aging tech it could be like you're saying.
Wealth is not going to be redistributed. Working conditions will get worth. Prices for Lifeprolonging treatment and medicine and food will continue to skyrocket - and of course, there will still be plenty ageing dependent diseases even if your life is prolonged artifically (cancer, diabetes, alzheimer, parkinson). Ecologically, it will be a disaster, because population would get completely out of control. Wealth is not going to be redistributed ever again. The rich will get ever richer and the poor will face ever worth living conditions. I speak of conditions that lead towards the French revolution.
That's not at all what I'm arguing here. I'm saying that alot of people would have issues following leaders who don't age in a way that is considered natural. I'm not religious but I still don't think it's a good idea. It's the same arguments as with splicing genes. It's good to get rid of genetic diseases but what would the long term consequences be when a couple of generations later have kids?
I don't believe in preventing science and advancement but I don't think advancement in say chemical warfare or making space rats is something we should aspire for. So don't you straw man me, man.
I claimed that we don't know what implications we'd get from splicing in the future. I said this as an example of an other futuristic dystopian senario.
The argument I ment to come across with the space rats was that not all advancements makes sense. But I guess I could've made it in the form of an /s.
I just think you and I communicate in different ways because I imply things that I assume others will pick up. I'm a bit read between the lines and try to pick up what the other person is trying to say in good faith.
I read it - and my comment isn't about gene splicing either. It is about the complexity of biological system and how unpredicable they react when you change something. Anything.
