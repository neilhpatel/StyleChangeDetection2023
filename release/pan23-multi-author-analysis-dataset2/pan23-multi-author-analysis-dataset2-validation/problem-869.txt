Not handling his estate means that eventually his creditors will seek to have a public trustee appointed to manage his estate, or that they'll try to pursue you on the theory that those were marital debts. It also means you have no say over when that happens. Leaving that hanging is probably not a good idea, as stressful as this situation is.
You may also be able to administer his estate . Much of the work really is administrative - sending notices, filling out forms, and adding up sums. I'm not sure that's a good idea, given that you have a specific interest in the settlement of his assets and debts, but if you can't find a lawyer willing to help, it's a fallback.
In most cases, an estate lawyer can be paid out of the estate's funds. If your husband had any substantial assets, then you may be able to find someone willing to work on that basis. If he's deep in debt or had few assets, then unfortunately _someone_ needs to pay the bill.
I know it's expensive, but I would really recommend at least getting a consultation from a lawyer. You may be able to take some of the money from the estate to pay them.
What you want to avoid is a worst-case situation, in which people he owed money to start coming after you for debts owed by his estate. As his wife, you don't necessarily inherit his debts (the person who said you were automatically on the hook is wrong), but if you did anything with money or assets that you weren't supposed to, you might be sued.
As an aside to this - If one of his debtor's comes to you asking you to pay, don't agree to any payment plan or pay anything personally. Once you do, you are taking responsibility for the debt. The debt will have to be settled but settle the estate first.
The estate is liable for his debts, but his debts do not extend beyond what he owned at the time of his death. That means you donâ€™t have to pay them back out of money he earned in the future.
I feel really terrible for you - this is just the last jerk action by a jerk abuser. But I do think that there are things to be concerned about.
A lawyer would be a really good idea considering the circumstances and can help you unwind the state of his finances and figure out where you stand.
