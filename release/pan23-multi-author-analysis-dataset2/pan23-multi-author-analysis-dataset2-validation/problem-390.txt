If you mean sharing nude pictures or videos online, then no, that has nothing to do with the age of consent and is federally illegal until both parties are 18 or older.
If you're just making two World of Warcraft characters hump or whatever, there's probably no legal issue with it. If it involves you making lifelike likenesses of each other simulate sexual acts, then we might be starting the discussion about something potentially different.
Traveling to another state to have sex with a minor is also something you absolutely should not do, and can ALSO result in federal-level charges.
You didnâ€™t provide your specific locations, so all I can tell you is that the large majority of states in the US have some variation of laws against encouraging or facilitating sexual activity of or with a minor, and sexual role play-type activities have been pursued as a violation of these laws.
I would encourage you to refrain from all sexual-related activity (whether virtual or in-person) with a minor child.
