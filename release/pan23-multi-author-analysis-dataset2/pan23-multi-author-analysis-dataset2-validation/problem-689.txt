>The largest nuclear power plant in Europe, which is in Ukraine's partially-occupied southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia, has been operated by Ukrainian technicians throughout the war despite being under Russian control.
There is room for safe ass moves, like pushing the scram button, or much better: injection of large quantities of boron inside the reactors before the Russian leave the plant.
Moving all equipment from the plant aswell. If they do withdraw completely there will be a catch. Another goodwill gesture would sit as well as a slipped disk.
They probably mean the reactors are shut down, but there's still too much decay heat to call the plant safe.
Everything they say is either a lie or a blame game for something they have already/about to or considering (depending on responses from the rest of the world).
Thing is, there are a lot of decay product atoms kicking about in nuclear fuel. Enough, in fact, that those little bits of heat each decay is producing adds up to a significant amount of heat. There's no way to stop this heat from occurring, so instead we have to deal with it.
Decay heat is something unique to nuclear, when you turn off a reactor you stop the chain reaction, but not the heat. The reason for this is pretty simple: some of the uranium from the fuel is now another unstable element, and when one of those atoms split into more stable elements (decay) they let off a little heat.
So yeah, it's less risky now that the plant's turned off, but there is still significant heat being made.
Jackass pukin will go down in history as a total prick, like the other Russian bellends from the past.
Leaving/told to leave/goodwill gesture which ever it is, pukin is up to no good. Maybe a cigarette accident or a blown up dam to stop cooling the power plant. Then blame Ukraine as it would be under russian control IF any Ukrainian staff sign the dodgy contract the twisted little shit has produced.
Normally this is done by putting the spent fuel in large pools of water for a while. Decay heat is at its worst in the first week after shutdown, then gradually Peter's off over the next few years. Most places will keep the rods in a pool for 10-20 years according to Wikipedia, but the minimum time is around a year.
