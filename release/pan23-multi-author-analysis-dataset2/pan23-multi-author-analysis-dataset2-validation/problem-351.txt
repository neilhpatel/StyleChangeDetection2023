As u/Al_Mamluk noted, the story goes that Frederick II visited the Dome of the Rock in 1229, after the sultan of Egypt al-Kamil made a treaty with Frederick and agreed to return Jerusalem to him. According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi:
Ibn al-Jawzi is translated in Gabrieli’s Arab Historians of the Crusades, although as Al\_Mamluk mentioned it’s also in Maalouf’s Crusades Through Arab Eyes. Maalouf notes that Frederick was obviously being sarcastic, and based on this and Frederick’s other statements/actions, Ibn al-Jawzi was suspicious that Frederick was neither Christian nor Muslim, but possibly an atheist. I’m not sure if the inscription is still there or not.
Frederick’s question was ironic, but yours is not, so: why did Muslims think Christians were polytheists? There were still Christian communities in the Near East, but Muslim rulers paid little attention to them and weren’t very interested in the intricacies of Christian doctrine. They were even less interested in the far-away Christians in Europe. I wrote a little bit about this in a previous question last year:
Francesco Gabrieli, Arab Historians of the Crusades, trans. E. J. Costello (University of California Press, 1969).
That's a pretty good question, and maybe worth exploring in a separate post! But as far as I know, the Byzantines were just as polemically anti-Islam as western Christians and were just as uninterested in learning anything about it. Byzantine sources also refer to Muslims as pagans/polytheists, a heretical form of Christianity, or a sign of the antichrist/apocalypse. I'm sure there was some influence between eastern and western Christian ideas about Islam in previous centuries, but I think by the time of the crusades they were already in agreement. The Byzantines didn't introduce anything new to the crusaders.
As far as Muslims could tell, Christians worshipped Jesus, the Holy Spirit, Mary, and innumerable saints alongside God. They were especially offended by the concept of the Trinity, which seemed to imply that Christians believed in three gods. It was as plain as day, Christians were polytheists.
Christians were typically described as “People of the Book” (ahl al-Kitab), since they’re mentioned in the Qur’an and Muslims were supposed to welcome and protect them. The other People of the Book were Jews and Zoroastrians, but all of the ahl al-Kitab were also often simply described as “unbelievers” (kafirun). Christians specifically, but not Jews, were sometimes called “polytheists” (mushrikun). A mushrik is someone who commits shirk, literally “association”, i.e. associating other beings with the one true God.
Of course, this worked both ways, since the native Christians of the Near East and European Christians also had little or no idea what Islam was really all about. I answered a question about this last year as well:
Thanks for this! My favorite answers on this sub are these where the exact question isn't necessarily something I was curious about but the answer includes references to books that, in general, I absolutely want to read.
One key question that I would highlight as a gap in this explanation is: what is the Byzantine role in the development/propagation of this concept? The link between the Crusaders and Byzantines in the early crusading era certainly left lasting influences on Westerners. Since the Byzantines had been fighting/interacting with Islam for centuries, they surely had their own formative and somewhat diverse thoughts on Islam, which I would think would have been somewhat passed on to the Crusaders. How did this shape the beliefs that you talk about here?
Can you show me the source? With the phrase in Arabic or the relevant language (though I'm guessing it would be Arabic). I'm not aware of any such inscription and I'm somewhat familiar with the inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock.
It would be strange but not unheard of for Saladin to call Christians polytheists. More normally, Christians would be some version of Frank, Christian, or Infidel. But there were Muslims who called Christians polytheists due to the doctrine of the Trinity. There was also some confusion about the veneration of Saints, with some Muslims seeing this as a polytheistic practice.
Muslim accounts of the crusades frequently call European crusaders polytheists, but European accounts always call the Muslims polytheists as well. Christians didn’t quite know what to make of Islam; it wasn’t Judaism, so was it a heretical form of Christianity? If it wasn’t Christianity or Judaism, then it must be the only other form of religion they knew about, polytheistic paganism. It’s interesting to note, though, that Muslims concluded that Christians were polytheists based on Christianity’s own doctrines, while Christians believed Muslims were polytheists based on...nothing.
