I can't particularly speak to the religious opposition of continental drift the 1980s and 1990s you experienced beyond more general skepticism of deep time [1], vis-a-vis Young Earth Creationism, but continental drift, along with related fundamental geophysical facts, was generally accepted later than you might anticipate.
That the Earth was ancient was known in the 18th century; several scientists proposed dates over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, most notably Lord Kelvin and Charles Lyell, with Lord Kelvin on the side of the physicists who calculated an age of around 20 million years (though he did propose numbers as high as 100 million) and Lyell for the geologists and paleontologists, who believed that evolution would have taken many tens of millions of years, and possibly even hundreds of millions. At the turn of the century, a younger age in the low tens of millions was generally accepted; by the 1920s, with the discovery of radiometric dating and then its solidification by Arthur Holmes in 1927, it was known that the earth was billions of years old. Finally, Clair Cameron Patterson calculated an age of 4.5 billion years based on the Canyon Diablo meteorite in the mid-1950s.
Against this backdrop came continental drift. While earlier thinkers did contend with the apparent shape continuity of continents, most notably Alexander von Humboldt, modern continental drift is attributed to Alfred Wegener. The mechanism that Wegener proposed in the 1910s, Polflucht--that centrifugal forces would draw landmasses toward the equator--was readily rejected by most contemporary geophysicists: the numbers simply didn't make sense. The forces involved are too small, while Wegener's proposed rate of drift too high. The age of the earth itself was in flux, but none of Wegener's early numbers meshed with what was known (either too old or too young). Arthur Holmes embraced a modified version of continental drift in the 1920s, but generally found skepticism throughout the 1920s and 1940s. Only in the late 1950s and early 1960s were the "zebra stripe" ocean floor magnetization patterns discovered in the 1940s connected to continental drift: from the Great Rift, magma that would eventually become landmasses was being churned out, thus creating matching 'stripes' due to geomagnetic reversals. The Vine-Mathews-Morley hypothesis for seafloor spreading was crystallized in 1963, and the theory of plate tectonics was generally accepted by the late 1960s after further refinement.
Scientifically, by 1970 there wasn't much debate over plate tectonics. Culturally, just as we still have public debates over the age of the earth, plate tectonics and continental drift have found opposition. It appears the Institute for Creation Research maintains that plate tectonics is "doubtful"; nonetheless, a recent survey showed that plate tectonics is more accepted than heliocentricity, so it has definitely not drawn the sort of attention that evolution or deep time has.
Students who attended school or university in the 1940s and early 1950s would likely have not been taught plate tectonics or continental drift, and if they were it would be unlikely for it to be presented positively--we might equate it to something like the Solutrean Hypothesis in the 1970s and 1980s.
So it is definitely plausible for a teacher in the 1980s or 1990s to hold doubts or (measured?) opposition to plate tectonics given the science they would have been taught--indeed the finer mechanisms of plate tectonics aren't known even today. But I can't really imagine yelling and shouting over scientific disagreements see that sort of response in this context; instead, the religious valence lends credence to the rejection of continental drift here being YEC-associated skepticism of the deep time required for continental drift, as North America broke off from Eurasia 60 million years ago, and Africa/South America separated over 100 million years ago.
Shifting scientific consensus in science is rather different than in education; neo-Darwinism was broadly accepted by the mid-1940s, for example, but adjudicated in the US for public school instruction in 1987 in response to a law in Louisiana that maintained creationism must be taught alongside neo-Darwinian evolution. A thorough response to scientific consensus change is probably outside the scope of the forum, but I would likely start from Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which holds that paradigms (generally accepted scientific beliefs, e.g. that the tectonic plates themselves are static) buckle under the accumulation of aberrations, leading to a paradigm shift. This isn't a teleological progression toward truth; rather, a paradigm shift simply demarcates a new consensus. The bacterial theory of ulcers is a classic example of adirectional paradigm shifts, where the belief the H. pylori bacteria cause ulcer was proposed, rejected in favor of alternative paradigms, and ultimately accepted; arguably plate tectonics occupies this same role.
I am afraid I can not speak in greater depth on education except to highlight the political lens of public schools as well as the lag between novel scientific research -.
1: The historicity of the earth was recognized over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, in a chronological tradition that arose from the same ecclesiastical scholarship that serves as the basis for YEC. Martin Rudwick's Bursting the Limits of Time and Worlds Before Adam are wonderful books on the recognition of deep time.

For onlookers, Annals of the Former World is a compendium of several pieces, of which Basin and Range constitutes book 1. The full compendium is 4 books and some additional material, written over span of 30 years, starting in the 70s and getting into the 90s by book 4. Later editions have some extra material that goes a little later. For anyone interested in OP's question or who generally appreciates the type of discussion that happens here in /r/AskHistorians it's a must read.
The nonfiction author John McPhee coined the specific phrase deep time in a New Yorker article, and the term has now gained purchase in sociology/history/philosophy of science. It is generally used synonymously with geological time--tens to hundreds to thousands of millions of years. The United States of America, for example, is less than 250 years old; Rome was founded less than 2,800 years ago. Geological time is simply so far removed from the timeline of human history that it is difficult to even comprehend: those magnetic reversals I mentioned earlier took place over tens of thousands of years, itself a remarkably short geological time. The uncertainty surrounding the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (marked by several mass extinctions) is around 400,000 years; longer than Homo sapiens have existed.
That the earth was ancient was recognized over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and Martin JS Rudwick convincingly connects early scientific recognition of geological time and historicity--that the earth itself has a history distinct from human history--to the chronologists who sought to calculate the age of the earth from the Bible.
He's written extensively ( and really, really well) on geologic history of the US this is I guess the capstone.
The macro-details were basically settled in academic circles by the 70s, but the knowledge and study in the field was exploding at the time with all kinds of new research, data and hypothesis about the details, scope and methods of action. By the time book 4 was written, the understanding had grown and changed considerably, with increasing knowledge and ever growing scientific consensus. It's reflected in the compendium, with each new book bringing in details that were discovered or solidified since the previous one along with subjects that were actively being debated in the earlier books narrowing toward consensus.
In each book he accompanies a different geologist while they do field work in different areas of the US they specialize in. Learning about the rocks, but also the person. They're all asked about plate tectonics at some point, and while they all agree its a thing, they all have different ideas that reflect their own areas of study and the rapidly advancing scholarship about it at the time. While the book covers more than plate tectonics, it's a common thread that binds the 4 books together.
Part science, part history, and more. Each book is also a microbiography of the geologist he's traveling with showing their human side and parts of their life story. Mcphee understands Geology enough to talk to these people, but his true mastery is extracting fascinating stuff from experts in other fields, arranging it in prose and writing it down for others to enjoy.
The concept of deep or geologic time to accommodate evolution was not part of Lyell's thinking. Lyell used deep time to explain geologic processes and expound on Uniformitarian concepts first defined at the end of the 18th century by James Hutton based on his observations of erosional rates on his farmland and his epiphany of understanding that came about upon looking at the rock at Soccer Point. The many tilted layers of sedimentary rock that lay beneath a layer of clasts made up of those tilted rocks and then covered by yet further layers of rock. The kicker for him was that all of these rocks were above current sea level. Hutton realized from his calculations of erosion rates how long such rock layers would take to form, let alone be lifted, eroded, pushed back below sea level, form new layers and be lifted again.
