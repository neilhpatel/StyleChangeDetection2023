I’d ask them to move the fence. And if the answer is any but “yes” I’d talk to a lawyer. And I’d hurry. The 5 year mark is important.
My experience was about 10 years ago. I do not believe the laws have changed, nor did my attorney at the time mention any loopholes. "Adverse Possession" is not really a mechanism for taking over a piece of another property, it's more intended to be a way of taking over an abandoned parcel and putting it to productive use. California is not the only state with this requirement.
IANAL: Adverse possession in California requires that the one attempting to adversely possess pay the property taxes on the land in question. Since there is in fact no way to actually do this \[pay taxes on a "piece" of a parcel\], successful adverse possession claims are rare and usually involve complete abandoned parcels. This I discovered when my neighbor tried to make this claim during a boundary dispute.
This having been said, if you try to just take down the fence your neighbor may successfully have the police stop you as the police will view it as a civil issue and refuse to get involved beyond stopping your apparent vandalism. You will need a lawyer, possibly even a judges ruling if the neighbor digs in his heels. Start with a letter from your attorney giving him a deadline to move the fence. Since at one point four years ago he realized he was in the wrong, this may be enough get him to take action.
Thanks for your response - does adverse possession in fact necessitate paying taxes on the property? I'm led to believe that there may be some loopholes here.
Yes, I complained when their contractor showed me the fence and attempted to hide the incursion onto my property by bending the property line string I had pulled. After this, the construction took another 3 years to complete and was told that they would move the fence before anyone moved in. The owner lives 400mi away but his family is nearby and one family member or another is intermittently occupying the house at any given time. They claim ignorance and the owner has stopped responding to my calls. Thanks for you response.
