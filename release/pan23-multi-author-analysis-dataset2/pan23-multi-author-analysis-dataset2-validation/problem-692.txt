I think you’re asking if you’re going to receive a bill for services even though you walked out. Really hard to tell. If they performed services such as a triage assessment, vitals, lab work, yes you may receive a bill. If you only checked in, but received no care, I’d ask for an itemized bill if one arrives. If they performed services, even if you didn’t agree with their recommendations (COVID testing), you are still potentially liable to pay for the services performed.
If you presented with symptoms consistent with COVID and hadn’t been tested at that facility than more than a day or two then they need to prove you don’t have COVID before allowing you into a general population area.
The best thing to do is to proactively call the ER's billing office directly and determine whether anything billable happened from their point of view, and dispute it if so. If you checked in at the front desk attempting to be seen, but were never in fact able to be treated or seen by a provider, then I'm not sure what they could realistically bill either you or your insurance for.

As for billing it depends entirely on the facility. At my hospital the ER has its own COVID area that is not billed any differently than the clean part of the ER outside of the COVID test.

This isn't really a legal question, it's simply a question for the ER's billing office. If the ER bills your insurance you will get a bill for any portion of the visit that your insurance deems you responsible for, such as an ER copay or unmet annual deductible. If they do not bill your insurance, or you directly, then you shouldn't hear about it at all.
