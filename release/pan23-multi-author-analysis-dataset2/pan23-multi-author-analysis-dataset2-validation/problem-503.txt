Right, I would respect that but couldn't he try to get me for trying to find out who he is given that it was probably confidential and all of the other potential loopholes or ways that it may go?
It was just brought up in the other subreddit I asked and I just wanted to see if he could possibly get me with litigious actions because he may not want to be contacted, traced down or anything else because of him or others not knowing what the kids or mother's may do. I just want to have my bases covered just in case it does hit the fan which I hope doesn't. I do not have intentions of doing anything harmful or anything like that.
None of that is illegal as long as you don't do anything illegal (e.g., hacking, misrepresenting yourself to get information, etc.) while you are doing it. It is not illegal to find someone and contact them.
I can't guarantee you he won't be a nutjob who'd file some crazy lawsuit. But I can't see any legitimate cause of action that either he or anyone else would have against you for contacting him one time, and politely taking "no thank you" and going away if that is his response.
I am a bot whose sole purpose is to improve the timeliness and accuracy of responses in this subreddit.
