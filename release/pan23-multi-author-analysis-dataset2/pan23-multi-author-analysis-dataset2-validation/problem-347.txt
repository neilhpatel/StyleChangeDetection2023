The obvious counterexample that occurs to me is the apple, which can yield alcoholic beverages in the 7-13% range, - but I guess that's why we call it _apple cider_ and not _apple wine_...
Winemaking is a tradition that's thousands of years old. Although grape wine is definitely the most popular even today, it's not the only way to make wine. As you've noted, you can make wine out of all sorts of stuff, ranging from to .
So why grapes and not dandelions? It's pretty simple: grapes have a ton of sugar, and when yeast eat the sugar they end up producing alcohol as a byproduct. As the Joy of Home Winemaking notes:
If you try making peach wine the same way you would make grape wine, you'll technically end up with an alcoholic beverage, but the actual amount of alcohol will be so low that it will spoil quickly. If you look up recipes for fruit wines, you'll notice that nearly all of them involve adding large amounts of sugar in order to give the yeast enough food to produce a sufficient amount of alcohol. Many recipes also call for adding some acidity to increase the durability of the wine.
This was important because there wasn't really a great way to preserve wine. Wine bottles started becoming much more feasible with the invention of the coal furnace which allowed the creation of thicker and more durable wine bottles. Until then wine was stored in barrels which were not air-tight and therefore prone to spoilage.
Honey wine (aka Mead) was the big alternative to non-grape wine as it's also sweet enough to naturally produce enough alcohol without any additional sugar. Honey is considerably more difficult to harvest than grapes, so production was never as widespread.
While grape wine and honey wine were the big two varieties of wine, people did experiment with adding other fruits and edibles as adjuncts. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides details a lot of variations on wine in his work . These range all the way from Oinos Roites (Pomegranate Wine) to truly unusual stuff like Strobilites (Pinecone Wine):
As I noted before, trying to ferment pinecones by themselves into wine is not going to work every well, the grape pulp is doing most of the work in terms of converting sugar into alcohol.
Eventually around 1800 a French chemist named Jean-Antoine Chaptal invented a process called "chaptalization" (named after himself) where sugar is added to the wine must before or during fermentation. This allows fruits (as well as grapes that did not ripen well) to still produce viable wine. Not coincidentally, he was also part of a committee tasked with cultivating sugar beets that which allow for a substantial amount of sugar to be extracted. From The Sugar Beet: Including a History of the Beet Sugar Industry in Europe:
Thanks to the work of Chaptal and other chemists, sugar had finally become cheap to produce in such quantities that fruit wines were actually viable. And people did experiment! A good example of this is the Victorian guide for homemakers Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management which was published in 1861. In the book, Beeton details recipes for several non-grape wines. Notably, she makes use of chaptalization which differentiates her recipes from those of Dioscorides: her wines truly don't have grapes at all. For example, :
