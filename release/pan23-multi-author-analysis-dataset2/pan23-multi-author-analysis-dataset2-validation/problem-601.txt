This is a great place to start, because if they cannot help you for some reason, they’ll likely still provide direction/resources to find someone who can.
This is well past the point where non lawyers are going to be able to help- you likely will need some representation to send a few nasty letters at the very least.
Given that you may have been misled or lied to, even if you did sign a release, it may not be valid. Please contact pro choice organizations in your area such as NARAL to see if they have legal resources you can leverage. They may be able to point you to resources even if they cannot help you with legal representation.
Anything they published which is untrue is defamatory libel. IANAL, but I think calling you a murderer without a murder conviction on your record probably makes the cut.
Criminal libel is a thing in many places, but you'd have to take it up with law enforcement to see if it makes the cut for them to go after this magazine.
To sue them in civil court, you generally need damages. Being anxious generally doesn't count as damages. Needing medical treatment, having your property vandalized, being assaulted, losing job prospects, does count as damages. That said, it looks like NC doesn't require actual damages for defamatory libel pertaining to infamous crimes, so you might have an angle already. Call your local BAR and find a lawyer.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or you’ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
BTW, if they simply copied photos from your Facebook, they do not hold the copyright on them. If you took them, you can pursue a DMCA violation to remove them. If your friends took them, they would have to pursue that. If they published the article on a content sharing site like Facebook or reddit, you can use the site's copyright claims functionality to try to get it taken down. If the magazine published it on its own website, then again it's lawyer and/or law enforcement time.
