>Pope Francis has warned Vatican bureaucrats to beware the devil that lurks among them, saying it is an “elegant demon” that works in people who have a rigid, holier-than-thou way of living the Catholic faith.
"Yeah, pope, you mean like they've been doing for 30 900+ years using their religion as a way to get away with everything bad they do as long as they do 10 hail maries after confession on Sunday?" - People who aren't idiots.
The core belief of Christianity is that we are NOT holier than anyone else, but in fact that we are all sinners. Jesus sacrificed himself to redeem us and His righteousness is credited to us.
First of all, Jesus wasn't real. Secondly, neither is heaven or hell. Thirdly, you think you're going to heaven because you're a christian and everyone else is going to hell. That's the core belief I'm talking about and it is completely repulsive. If you didn't believe in these fairy tales, you'd begin to understand that you really aren't any better than anyone else.
Let me introduce you to the magic of "moral licensing"... where doing good or preaching good earns credits to do evil That's just math, jump onboard the Christian train, feel like robbing a bank? You need to be a deacon for 10 years to earn this priviledge <3.
