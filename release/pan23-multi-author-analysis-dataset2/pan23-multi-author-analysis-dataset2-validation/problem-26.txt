The foreign observers had a generally mixed reaction. The United States Army's artillery branch was generally viewed as being very competent and well supplied and utilized. The infantry on both sides were rated as brave and effective. The level of training of the average soldier did vary between individual armies and that was commented upon. General Bragg was rated highly in terms of having the best drilled army in the CSA by British observers. The use of trenches was not appreciated at the time.
In broad terms, the general foreign view was that the Civil War comprised armies of amateurs that improved over the course of the war. The level of staff and planning was lowly rated by foreign observers. The use of railroads and telegraphs was something that was of great interest.
ironclads: The major European powers had already decided to start moving to ironclads prior to the start of the Civil War. However, the speed of transition was greatly accelerated as the US had proved conclusively that it could cheaply, rapidly build, and deploy ironclads that could defeat wooden ships-of-the-line. British naval observers were not just able to see ships after launched, but were able to tour some of the US ironclads during their construction. While they believed that their ships could be competitive against the US ironclads, the fact that they could not state that they could definitely defeat the US ironclads in an engagement was the most disturbing thing. (Essentially, the British Navy was far more concerned with the appearance of invincibility than actually being invincible. They did not want to engage in a war where the outcome was doubtful in terms of affirming naval dominance).
The US Navy's switch to a turret gun system radically changed ship design and gun design with every one of the major powers. The turret design was also pushed by some developers in Britain prior to the Civil War, but the British Admiralty preferred a more traditional gun placement on gundecks, then armored the area around them (called a broadside ironclad). The British government, upon hearing about the Battle of Hampton Roads, immediately approved a test program to test turret designs and stopped ordering broadside ironclads. In the interim, they moved to a central battery design where there were far fewer high powered guns that could pivot over wide ranges, then to a full turret design a few years later. The central battery was better suited for ironclads that used sails for propulsion.
Great Britain is notable for the way that Great Britain avoided wars with the United States. The US and UK had cause for war multiple times. Border disputes were occasionally violent between settlers claiming their land was in either the US or Canada. The governments usually disavowed the claims and negotiated a settlement.
The last question: Foreign military observers were allowed a remarkable amount of access and were treated very well by bother sides in the war. They were often allowed to travel between the two sides as neither side wanted to offend the foreign powers. They were given access to staff and planning meetings and were often given favorable positions to observe the combat. The CSA was very interested in obtaining foreign support during the first couple years of the war, so allowed a great deal of access. The US did not want to offend those foreign powers, so they not only did not complain, but often facilitated the travel of those observers to the south by allowing them to enter through US ports rather than trying to run blockades or travel through Mexico. The US also freely allowed foreign observers in their own operations to show the forces being brought to bear by the US to discourage foreign powers from intervening.
Of critical importance to the US was that it showed the foreign powers that they simply did not have the military capacity to intervene. In this, they succeeded. Britain simply could not win a land war against the US on its own. So, they made it a condition that France would also have to intervene as France would have to handle the land war in North America. France was tied down in Mexico and did not have the manpower or inclination to get into this war. The general consensus of the European powers that was eventually reached was that 1) it would take a firm commitment of all the major European powers - Great Britain, France, Spain, Prussia, Austria, and Russia - to broker a peace and 2) no such commitment was ever going to be reached as Russia was not only supporting the United States, but it would intervene militarily on the US side should Great Britain and France intervene militarily in the US Civil War. It was in Spain's interests for the war to drag out as long as possible as that would keep Cuba safe from US/CSA intervention for a longer period of time.
Ok the last paragraph, I’m getting that the union wanted to scare European powers off from supporting the CSA. In your opinion then, was the belief that they couldn’t beat the Union even if they wanted to the primary reason they didn’t try or was it more ‘we don’t like the confederacy anyway and fighting sound like too much hard work for some cotton’?
Great Britain just simply did not have an army that would have managed any kind of defense against a US invasion into Canada. Between the potential loss of Canada and a loss of a lot of ships, there simply was no winning scenario for Great Britain that would justify a military intervention and the US made it quite plain that any intervention would mean war. Great Britain might have been competitive for a few months in 1861, but the US army in 1862 could have rolled over any defense mustered in Canada. Throw in the very real possibility of US ironclads blocking the St Lawrence waterway and there were no upsides for Great Britain.
If Great Britain could have knocked the US down, they would have. There was certainly support for a war at various points early in the conflict.
Great Britain was also far more dependent on food exports from the United States than cotton from the CSA. Great Britain did not have enough domestic production of food to support their population, so the food imports from the US were about the only thing standing between Great Britain and starvation.
And, as there were areas in the British Empire where they could increase cotton production to cover the loss of cotton importation from North America, they had alternatives. By 1864, cotton imports from India were sufficient to cover the demand.
All of these items were visible, apparent, and predictable in 1861 and the biggest failing of the CSA's diplomatic efforts was its total failure to state a compelling case to any other country on why they should intervene. They never even tried. "You need cotton. This will weaken the US" was not exactly the equal to "You will lose Canada and large parts of your navy and your people will starve". The starvation angle was given more weight due to the proximity to the European rebellions in 1848 and the chartist movement in the UK. There was an outside - though improbable - chance that the starvation would lead to massive civil unrest in the UK.
I’d always heard that the general feeling in Britain was support for the union. Was this the populist view and the anti US feeling more something among the government?
Or in the first paragraph are you more saying that given the time period Britain as a power would have knocked out any competitor if it could in the same way Prussia might have looked to do that with France?
In 1859, there was almost a war between the US and UK over claims in the Pacific Northwest. They negotiated a resolution to defuse tensions, but this was very much in the minds on both sides in 1861. The US Civil War represented the only real chance to settle these disputes in the UK's favor if the US army was completely tied down in a military conflict. This was very specific to the United States. The British Empire had no compunctions in invading Mexico or Nicaragua in the 1850's and 1860's. The United States had far too many ways to hurt the British Empire for this to be easily contemplated.
The business owners and a large portion of the British government supported the CSA. The British public was firmly anti-slavery and so were anti-CSA.
