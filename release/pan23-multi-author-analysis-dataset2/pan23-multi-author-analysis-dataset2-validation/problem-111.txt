Let me give you an example taken from what I've been doing the last two days, working on a new paper. My "research" for this paper has consisted of me locating sources and taking notes on them. As I do this I will come up with an interpretation of how they fit into a historical narrative and what it means about the historical events in question, at both large and small scales of "history." The sources are all from archives of different sorts, and sometimes are pieces from secondary sources as well. Every one of these sources has been looked at by other human beings — at the very least, when they were created, but more recently when they were entered into the archive's holdings or database. But as far as I can tell no other human being has tried to compile a historical narrative out of these disparate sources, which are mixed in with large numbers of other sources on different topics. Looking at any one source, it's essentially impossible to see the larger narrative they represent — my job is to figure that out.
Ultimately, the paper I am writing will turn the hundred or so sources I've been looking at into a written narrative that will tell a story about something that happened (in this case, a US governmental policy decision — sorry for being coy, but I don't want to spoil the details at the moment), and explain both how to understand it in the context of things already known, as well as showing how it gives understanding that was previously unknown. That's the "output" in the end.
Wow! What a read, thank you for answering so clearly. I think I'd be interested in doing something like that, some day, if I end up pursuing a history degree.
In my work, I generally am not trying to apply some brand-new framework to my understanding of the past; I prefer doing work that tells new stories, as opposed to reinterpreting older ones, but that's just a personal preference. I associate people talking about "cutting edge" with applying new theories to old stories to make new stories (this often involves looking at different/new sources, too). But my work is "cutting edge" in that no other historian has tried to tell the story I'm writing, and it will (I think) significantly advance the understanding of the historical community surrounding the broader topic it belongs to. It's definitely "cutting edge" to anyone outside of my academic community; you won't find this story on Wikipedia, or in the newspapers, or in any popular historical sources. It does represent the vanguard of historical scholarship on this particular topic (for better or worse).
It's very rare that historians find truly "new" sources that are not inside archives. We generally rely on archivists to facilitate that sort of thing. It's not unheard of, though. But it's much rarer. Archivists sometimes get annoyed about historians "discovering" sources that an archivist has already cataloged. But the job of the archivist is very different than that of the historian; an archivist is about collecting and preserving primarily, whereas the historian is about interpreting and producing narrative. So when a historian "discovers" something, they are really saying, "I introduced a source into the narrative where it had been previously overlooked or ignored." Or, "I saw the relevance of a particular source to a broader historical argument or conversation that nobody else has published on," to be more specific.
For example, I "discovered" a photograph of something that I don't think anyone else has given much attention to — but I "discovered" it in a report that has been on the internet for a long time. My "discovery" here is less about finding the actual photograph as it is being able to understand the meaning of what is _in_ the photograph, which elevates its importance dramatically. (Once you know what the photograph is of, it would be trivial for you too to "find it" — the difference is that you would never have thought to look for it, or understood it, before I told you what it really was.) This is a form of historical discovery in my mind.
Sometimes historians use new tools and techniques (e.g., data analysis, chemical analysis, etc.) for doing history, and one might call that "cutting edge," but that is also exceedingly rare, at least for historians whose sources are primarily document-based (as opposed to the places where archaeology and history overlap).
Mind if I ask, how does a Historian begin when presenting a narrative? That is, where do you even get a question of inquiry? Is it pure curiousity, or does constructing a narrative of sources serve a purpose in the 'practical' sense?
It's something you learn how to do after doing it a lot (to various degrees of goodness). Sometimes it's pure curiosity. Sometimes it's because you're deeply invested in an aspect of a topic that you think should be better understood (by other historians, or everyone else, what have you). Sometimes it's just luck — you stumble across a great story that hasn't really been looked at very closely.
What I like about doing history is that you have tremendous freedom in what you investigate. You really can go anywhere with it, as long as it happened awhile back. The limiting factor is that to be very good at what you do, you need to spend a _lot_ of time on topic. It's sort of the opposite of journalism — journalists write lots of little stories that are in the end relatively superficial (journalists consider it a HUGE time investment if they spend a year or two on something; historians _routinely_ spend 4-5 years on a single article, ten years on a book, etc.). Historians sort of go in for the deep dig.
One of the things that you get taught, as you become more advanced in a history degree, is how to start constructing narratives and arguments and interpretations. It starts (like all writing) with very structured sorts of exercises (e.g., "what are the causes of World War I?") but by the end of even an undergraduate degree one is usually expected to write some piece of somewhat original work (like a thesis). In graduate school you basically write 4-5 undergraduate theses a semester until you are good at it, and then you write a dissertation, which is basically a book. By the time you have done that (over many years) you sort of pick up the knack for it, but one is always learning. I've been done with my PhD for over a decade now and I'm still always looking for ways to improve. It is one of the reasons that historians (unlike some disciplines) are thought to get better with age (it is not a cult of youth like, say, physics and mathematics can be). Or so we like to tell ourselves!
