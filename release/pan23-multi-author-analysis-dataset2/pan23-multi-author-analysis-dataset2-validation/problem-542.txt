The driving without a license charge may have been an error or typo, as driving unregistered vehicle is one section below driving without a license. Either way you should have gotten written tickets on that day.
As jaymdee has mentioned, lawyer up. Even if it's just to get the warrant stayed or advise you best to it. You could handle the cases by yourself after but keep in mind they have high penalties like license suspension. Turning yourself in before you get arrested in the street one day is better, but turning yourself in without a lawyer can lead to a record of arrest and other bad consequences.
No, you should absolutely not go to the local police department and tell them you have an open warrant because they will arrest you. Contact a local traffic defense lawyer and follow their advice. They can try and get the warrant recalled so you can get a new court date and address the outstanding charges.
Additionally the invalid registration may have been due to a revoked registration if you let your insurance expire. Insurance companies are required to report it and there are consequences.
Also, make sure to ask the lawyer about a serna motion. There is a federal standard, so that should apply across all 5 states. If the government failed to do their due diligence in finding you to notify you of your court date, then the case may be dismissed. Here, it sounds like you were given a ticket which presumably had a court date on it and you forgot to show up. If that's the case, this motion is unlikely to be fruitful. Worth the discussion though with a lawyer.
