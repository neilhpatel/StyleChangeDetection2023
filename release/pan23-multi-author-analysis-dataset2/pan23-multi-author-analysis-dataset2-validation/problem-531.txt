If you've got a license from the person you believe, in good faith, to be the actual rights holder, then you're broadly in the clear. Creating the same design in another material doesn't create a second set of rights that you need to deal with.
I did engage before posting here and the copyright holder said: 'according to my lawyer, it covers all designs that are similar in design to mine within Canada.'.
I wouldn't engage. If you do engage, start by asking what specific work they're alleging you're infringing on. Copyrights are not general, and you cannot copyright the broad category of "dog butt leash holder signs.".
So it's not the shape of the dog that is the issue.. it's the whole thing. But like I said, I found one online from 2014 so she is not the original artist.
That's not how the _Copyright Act_ works. He's talking out his ass and almost certainly has not spoken to a lawyer familiar with the topic.
Keep in mind that Etsy is an American company and will apply American law. I'm assuming your interlocutor made a complaint under the United States' _Digital Millennium Copyright Act_, and that Etsy is following their DMCA process on the presumption that that complaint is valid. I'll come back to this.
Do you mind explaining this a bit further? She reported me to Etsy so my account has been frozen while they investigate and I would like to be prepared.
In both Canada and the United States, copyrights protect specific creative works once they're in a fixed form. When you take a photo, draw a picture, record a song, write a story, or otherwise create a fixed creative work, then you own the rights to _that work_. If someone takes that work and distributes it without your permission, or makes alterations and distributes the altered version, then you have a right to force them to stop, and to compensate you. (Edit: you can see the definitions in action in , for Canadian law.).
Work with Etsy to reinstate your product, and provide them with any information they need. If Etsy opts to take down your product anyways, that sucks; find another marketplace. In principle you can go after the person making a bad faith DMCA complaint, under a couple of theories, but it won't be worth your time.
However, copyrights don't extend to the underlying idea. If you write a story about a child growing up and defeating a dragon, and I write my own story, then you have no rights over my story and I have no rights over yours - unless one of us can show that the other actually used our _text_ in the process somewhere. Even if you can prove I read your story first, and then went off and wrote one deliberately riffing on your themes, that's legal. As it applies to your situation, if you took a specific design from artist A, and licensed it for sale, then your products do not infringe on any rights owned by artist B unless artist B has some interest in the specific design you licensed.
This guy would have been told that had he actually spoken to a lawyer, because this is not a subtle point to copyright law. It's the whole point of it: to protect specific creative works, and thus cultivate a richer creative culture by enabling people to make a living off their creativity. Any lawyer familiar with the topic would spot this issue immediately and would _not_ advise their client that their copyright covers "all designs that are similar.".
