He had done something similar the year before with President Carter, staying three blocks from the White House with two revolvers and.
keeping an eye on Carter's itinerary. One time he made a "test run" where Hinckley got close to Carter in a crowd, but eventually.
He also, in February of 1981, made an attempt at Senator Edward Kennedy (the last Kennedy brother) and visited his office, but.
He changed target again to one he previously considered: President Reagan. This time, on March 30, 1981 at 2:27 PM, he followed through with.
Production on _The Last Temptation of Christ_ started in 1983 and the movie was only released in 1988, which should give you an idea of how much a problem it was. Paramount agreed to funding (original budget: $11 to $12 million).
including the press secretary James Brady (who suffered severe brain damage and died many years later due to it).
Yes, his entire motivation for considering assasinating Carter, then Kennedy, and then finally shooting Reagan: he wanted to.
Columbia made constant suggestions on saving money, enough to the point Scorsese threatened to quit the project. It did end up going a bit over budget, to 1.9 million.
It ended up a success, with both acclaim from critics and a healthy $28 million gross at the box office.
The level of violence led to the film being booed at Cannes, and it nearly got an X rating (Scorsese edited the color of the blood to be less red in order to make the ratings board happy).
This led to Scorsese being able to make the musical _New York, New York_ (a film technically started before _Taxi Driver_) which became the opposite -- a critical and commercial failure. The production was famously cocaine-fueled and the filming ballooned in both cost and lenh; Scorsese famously kept trying to search for personal scenes with improvisation and scenes kept getting added in ways the sets didn't support.
In the usual way one might consider a "blacklist", one might nominate _New York, New York_ as trouble, but despite its crash, it didn't have notable long-term effect. It sure had immediate effect: Scorsese considered moving to Italy and making exclusively documentaries, and eventually his health -- and excessive drug problems -- landed him in a hospital, and his career was essentially "rescued" by DeNiro who had been keen on a movie (_Raging Bull_) based on the autobiography of the boxer Jake La Motta.
It includes some of the most intense boxing scenes put to film, and a moment where De Niro and Pesci are sparring and De Niro breaks one of Pesci's ribs; this actually happened and was what made it to camera.
_Raging Bull_ put Scorsese back in the spotlight, and was a giant success, with 8 Oscar nominations.
impress Jodie Foster. He had watched her in _Taxi Driver_ and had become obsessed (and did some stalking with repeated phone calls.
_Taxi Driver_ was hard to get made. The producers, Michael Phillips and Julia Phillips, had had success with _The Sting_, but the extreme violence (and the pornography, and the child prostitute) made investors skittish, and Columbia eventually helped get to a budget of 1.3 million, only possible via the leads being accepting of low salaries, especially De Niro (fresh off an Oscar win of _Godfather II_).
So: a wildly successful director, but where unsavory associations wore on him. It perhaps didn't help he followed with _The King of Comedy_ (1982) about an obsessive stand-up comedian and stalker who comes up with a kidnapping plot.
Deranged reactions didn't help. Hinkley's was one (Scorsese briefly considered quitting filmmaking altogether after the event happened). _Raging Bull_ provoked another incident, as the actress Teresa Saldana (who played Lenore La Motta) was attacked by a fan. The fan thought she was an angel who needed to be killed in order to go back to heaven.
It was of course still controversial on its 1988 release, the end scene where Jesus dreams of being married to Mary Magdalene in particular. Scorsese received death threats. A Catholic group set fire to a cinema in Paris while the film was being shown. While the subject matter was undoubtedly part of the issue, it still hung overhead that Scorsese was known as the violence-and-mafia-movie guy, a reputation he perhaps never quite shook, since the 1990 movie _Goodfellas_ ("As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster") was considered his "return to form".
The movies _After Hours_ and _The Color of Money_ ended up happening first, while Scorsese's agent kept working to make _The Last Temptation_ happen; finally, with some wrangling at a filming location and lower budget point, Universal and Cineplex Odeon became interested. Shooting started in Tunisia and Morocco on October 12, 1987.
Scorsese was insistent on location shooting in Israel. This ended up causing logistical trouble (they lost their producer who couldn't come) and by November 1983 while pre-production was still being developed Scorsese became known as "anti-Christian". A letter writing campaign was arranged by The Evangelical Sisterhood, and letters started to roll in to Gulf + Western (parent company of Paramount). 500 a day. Paramount held a religious summit. Theologians raised direct concerns, and pressure reached the point that while the production had sets, costumes, and a cast, there was nobody willing to fund it and nobody willing to distribute it.
So Scorsese went from somewhat blacklisted to getting funding, distribution, etc for Raging Bull. Was it easy to achieve those things just because De Niro did great in God Father 2 (1974) and Taxi Driver (1976)?
