I'm pretty sure those animals are shooting at clearly civilian transport for fun at this point. Like in that video some time ago where they positioned themselves next to a road and just started shooting at every passing civilian car.
The Ukrainian General Staff gave no explanation for Moscow's actions. Destroying civilian vessels would prevent Ukrainian forces from using them should they decide to cross to the eastern side in the event of any Russian withdrawal.
KYIV, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Ukraine's army accused Russia on Sunday of the large-scale destruction of civilian vessels moored on the banks of the Dnipro River in the occupied southern region of Kherson that Kyiv's forces are trying to capture.
Ukrainian forces have been piling pressure on Russian troops on the western bank of the Dnipro that bisects Ukraine, fuelling speculation that Moscow's troops are preparing to retreat to the other side.
The Ukrainian General Staff's spokesperson said in a statement that the fuel from the destroyed vessels had leaked into the river's delta and also accused Moscow's forces of appropriating the vessels' engines and other equipment.
The statement fitted into a pattern of mounting tension in the region where Russian-installed occupation  on Sunday that an act of sabotage had knocked out power and water supply in the city of Kherson and a number of settlements.
This sounds awfully familiar to the international seizure and sale of "Russian Oligarch's" boats. I wonder if the two are related. Almost like a tit for tat.
But Russia holds the biggest stick. Otherwise Moscow and Russian land would be hit just as hard as Ukrainian infrastructure.
These rules are arbitrary lines drawn in the sand by western values. And yes, I recognize that our western values of "lives have value" shapes these rules.
I'm pretty tired that "war crimes" is a tangible thing when it isn't collectively enforced. It's just a concept and talking point until the world acts upon that redline.
But at the end of the day, might makes right. Russia has nukes, so nobody is holding them accountable.
