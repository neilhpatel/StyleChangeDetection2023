It is just a phrase. He could say 'insanely happy lawyer" and it would not be diverging that is defined. It is just how he sees himself. He goes hard. But there is no step by step scorched earth guide book.
I’ll give a bit more context, this would be dealing with family law in California. He’s trying to gain physical custody of his children from the mother who doesn’t have the kids best interest in mind and the more time goes on, the more detriment we see going on in regards to long-term mental health and schooling. (There’s /so/ much more to this but that’s the shortest and most important points).
It's a phrase that is not very commonly used to describe when a lawyer is doing things to waste time/money of the other party (presumably with the approval of their client). For example, to delay until the other party goes bankrupt or dies. They do this by filing every appeal, objecting to everything possible, raising legal questions that shouldnt be in contention, asking for extensions, responding at the last minute, etc.
The specific tactics will vary and can range from in the best interest of their client to highly unethical. The phrase means the case is no longer about winning but about scorching the earth... making everyone suffer.
ETA: the 300sqft is NOT where we live, that’s where biological mom, her boyfriend and the two kids live when with her. Realized that needed clarification after I posted.
