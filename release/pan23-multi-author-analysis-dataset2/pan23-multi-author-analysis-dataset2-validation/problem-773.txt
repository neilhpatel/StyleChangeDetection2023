If not, then it's likely better to not engage with them and their threats. Those threats don't sound particularly credible to me.
What's the difference (assuming the threats were legitimate)? They threaten to end you and they have people that will do it vs they threaten to end you and they have people that will do it while they're in jail?
Do you have any practical or legal reason to continue being in contact with your former landlord, like an eviction suit or dispute over security deposit or excess damages ?
That's sort of the end of the legal advice you can expect. If you're unwilling to involve police in a criminal matter like death threats, then you can't reasonably use civil courts or other legal mechanisms to protect yourself from violent crime.
