The linked answer and discussion is great but here I'll try and answer your question directly. There's a few questions you're asking so first let's break them apart and clarify these myths.
4) Are these shared stories due to dispersal (they're related) or independent invention (it's coincidence)?
An old saying, the Babylonian scribal philosopher-poet author is certainly right about that. Societies around the world share a slew of fundamental cosmological concepts and narratives which are simply long-lasting stories. The cosmos is divided into at least three "worlds": the upper world, our world, and the lower world. Connecting the three worlds is a cosmic tree, the axis mundi, which is said to be at the center of the cosmos. This cosmos is circular as if it were made of two bowls (the upper world and the lower world). The upper world is ruled by a bird-deity who is generally helpful, the lower world by a composite (usually horned) serpent deity who is generally dangerous. These two world rulers are often in conflict, and as a model this is based on the common real-life conflict between birds and snakes.
This background helps us understand question 1...thunder was the loudest noise anyone would've heard (signalling its creator's supreme power), and this is coming from clouds i.e. the sky world and thus ultimately from its supreme bird deity. This is why so many societies have henotheistic thunder-sky-bird deities. This is not only the well-known thunderbird in the Americas, but back in Eurasia Zeus was , and other Indo-European variations on the theme are found in Ireland in the early medieval Voyage of Mael Duin. In chapter 30, the plucky adventurers see a giant bird formed out of a cloud who is picked clean by two bird helpers, in doing so it is physically 'renewed' and returns to its juvenile form (as in the story of the phoenix although without fire or lighting references). You can read this wonderful story here, part and .
I can answer the fourth question quickly. It is not coincidence but these stories are similar, but in fact the slow change of mythology shows seemingly unrelated and disparate cultures' inter-relationships into deep time. We share mythology because , and when we share stories through the generations some stories have striking characters or such powerful morals that they don't change much at all. Bronze age Semitic speakers in the Near East, Eurasian Proto-Indo-European speaking pastoralists, and peoples in the Americas all shared stories about how after one's death, one's soul was taken by spirit guides to a river which must be crossed so that one's soul could come at rest in the Good Other World. How long had people been re-telling that story so that it was shared in the Americas and in Eurasia? Many many thousands of years. In fact, some ancient people realized this story was different, that it wasn't simply a recent invention. This is mentioned only briefly in the Babylonian Theodicy of the mid-late bronze age (Ancient Near East Vol. II, ed. Pritchard).
Question 2...Why do storm gods overthrow primordial gods? This was likely a Proto-Indo-European story which was brought into the Near East by PIE speakers in the early bronze age. Sometime after that in the Old Babylonian period (middle bronze age) we see the city god Marduk of Babylon doing a similar coup to the Annunaki. Perhaps this motif was borrowed from neighboring Indo-European speakers, or perhaps it was an independent invention by Babylonian scribes based on Mesopotamian mythology. While other lingustic groups did not share this precise story, there is a variation on the theme which is found cross-culturally: that of the flood myth. In this myth, a great storm is sent by the creator which destroys the world, a world soon after creation which was populated by flawed beings which were created before humans. Sometimes there is only one world-wide destruction (such as in the Torah) but other times there are multiple destructions (such as in the Popol Vuh) in that the flood becomes one of the multiple historical apocalypses. .
Question 3...Why does a hero defeat a giant serpent? This is found cross-culturally, and so the answer is dispersal in the paleolithic period. I've followed the work of Julien d'Huy, Jean-Loic Le Quellec, and Yuri Berezkin who have used mathematics to analyse a huge database of myths from around the world. In doing so, they've discovered that there are certain shared traits in stories over huge distances which suggest a shared heritage (i.e. in the paleolithic period). For example, the mythical serpent's association with rainbows. Since this motif is seen in Australia, Africa, and Europe independently, then it likely started in Africa and was spread through paleolithic migrations.
So when all these "dragon" characters are compared we have d'Huy's reconstruction of the paleolithic African ur-dragon:^1.
And since there are enough European variants, his reconstruction of the paleolithic European ur-dragon:^1, ^2.
The last bit about decapitation can help us interpret ancient rituals, as there are two decapitated snakes found at two ancient Magdalenian cave sites (Montespan and Tuc d'Audoubert).^1 D'Huy also notes that a Magdalenian pierced baton from Montgaudier has two snakes on one side and on the other features two seals and a fish. Since seals live in salt water perhaps the double snakes do as well, yet this would make them "mythological" since European snakes do not live in salt water.^2.
The serpent's characteristics about conflict fit into a parallel story of a hero's victory against this giant serpent. This other corpus of myths has also been analysed by d'Huy, and so let's see his reconstruction of the European paleolithic form: A male hero uses his favorite weapon and shoots down the enemy, the fight is difficult and the enemy formidable but the hero is helped by an ally (his sister, wife, or mother). The monster is killed and the hero is celebrated by everyone, human and divine, in great celebrations.^3.
There are enough Indo-European variants that the PIE ur-form can be reconstructed as well: The monster is the son of two primordial deities (sometimes related to chaos). He lives in the sea, a lake, or a river, is gigantic and has no human form. The monster is wind, storm, flood, drought, plague, famine. He steals, kills, makes war, destroys the country, is greedy and eats whole herds of animals. He also has a penchant for eating humans, but ultimately he wants to rule the world.^3 As we can see, this PIE serpent-monster has many of the characteristics of the European and African ur-form.
But the fighting part...The god of climate/sky fights him using his favorite weapon, the hero is helped by another hero or deity and they defeat the monster. This is the god's first combat test which brings him out of childhood into adulthood. The monster is beaten after a hard fight and is (sometimes) imprisoned in the underworld or under a mountain. Or his body is mutilated and/or shown to people. Humans and divinities celebrate the hero and he establishes a cult, ritual, and/or feast, and erects a temple.^3 This has many characteristics of the European hero's combat ur-form. Although we can see that this combat is now done by the god of the sky, and so this story has become quite similar to those other PIE stories in which that sky god overthrows a collective of primordial gods and then imprisons them in the underworld. Perhaps now we can see where those PIE 'Zeus vs. Cronus' stories came from: an elaboration on the PIE hero's combat versus a serpent monster.
And just as a fun aside...ancient motifs appear in stories around the world in places you might not expect, as the 19th century ethnographer Francois-Marie Luzel says:
It may surprise you that this story is not being told by someone in Africa, Asia, or Australia; but was a "widespread popular belief" in the Cotes-du-Nord Department of Brittany as Luzel wrote in the 1870's. The story that rainbows drink at rivers and then rain is from Lower Brittany in general.^4.
The answer for these questions has been that shared stories have shared histories, but this doesn't exactly tell us why serpents loomed so large in world mythology. D'Huy's explanation for this partially mechanistic: he notes that studies show humans can detect snakes more quickly than other animals such as spiders, and that 'untrained' children can do this too. Additionally, when we're seeing a snake it's harder for us to focus on something else. And psychologically, phobic people also tend to overestimate the size of the animal in question; so perhaps this is why giant serpents are found in world-wide mythology.^1 While these are interesting points, I'm more partial to its comparison to nature. The mythological conflict between supernatural birds and serpents mirrors the ever-present conflict between birds and snakes. While many animals compete, this particular pairing has taken on greater significance in cosmology and has been a dominant narrative for tens of thousands of years.
If you're wondering how d'Huy/Quellec/Berezkin's phylogenetic method works there's an overview by Jay Coskey and a great summary (in French) by Jean-Loic Le Quellec.
by /u/alkibiades415 gives a good little primer on the shared heritage of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) myth. Most European mythologies and the mythologies of Iran and much of India all share this common ancestry. has a good discussion between a number of users about storm gods in PIE and Middle Eastern myth.
