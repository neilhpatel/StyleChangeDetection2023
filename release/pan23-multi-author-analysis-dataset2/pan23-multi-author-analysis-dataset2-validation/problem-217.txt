Thank you so much, I really, really appreciate your thorough response. so he said the registration is good until september, and there's a sticker showing that on the plate, without the title in his name though that must be bs then right? He runs a scrap removal business, so he mustve just took it off some random car or something? And if I do end up having to go the legal route, and can't do it in small claims court, do you know how I should go about it since title jumping is considered a felony?
One of the downsides of doing business of this kind with people far from home is that you can't easily use small claims court to resolve your disputes.
Presumably the owner didn't provide you with a passing smog certificate from within the past 90 days, which he's required to do. That would make a very strong argument to cancel the sale and refund your money.
They have no reason to participate in the seller's tax fraud. You can ask, but don't be surprised if you can't even find someone in charge of the motor pool who remembers that truck.
The guy owes taxes, title fees, and on that truck, which may be one reason why he sold it to a novice buyer from hundreds of miles away.
Start by demanding a refund based on the fact that he didn't deliver a smog certificate or a transferrable title.
To complete the "title jump" you would have to falsely report yourself as the 2012 buyer (presuming there's no name written in there now). I think DMV would want 9 years of delinquent registration fees from you, and of course you would have to get a passing smog certificate if this sort of truck requires one (I'm more familiar with ordinary cars, not commercial vehicles).
I presume you paid less than $10,000 for the truck, so this is a small claims dispute. Any tax or perjury crimes the seller might have committed or tried to commit aren't relevant to your right to get your money back.
Edit: I can't vouch for the company but there are services that say they can determine or estimate if there are back registration fees owed on California vehicles:
I don't want to discourage you from standing up for yourself, but remember that if he refunds your money during the (encouraged and maybe mandatory) mediation session before small claims court, you have to give him the truck back right away.
Scrappers are generally, in my experience, very resourceful people but seldom strict followers of regulations.
