What’s the disability situation like? Is she right that it’s likely going to require a lawyer just to get approved? Considering she’s 3 years from Medicare age, is it worth that fight?
If she is ambulatory enough that she only uses the canes on bad days then she isn't disabled enough to get disability. She can still work, she is just refusing any reasonable accommodation for her conditions. Which is her right to do. Unfortunately disability isn't for anyone who is disabled or my ass wouldn't be at work anymore. It's for anyone too disabled to hold the majority of jobs.
The use of walkers, scooters, wheelchairs, or other mobility aids at work ARE accommodations. You said she refuses to use them out of pride. She could easily keep working by using a mobility aid other than a cane. She would be able to get her students where they need to go and still move around her classroom. She could even switch between walking and riding since arthritis pain gets WORSE if you let the joint get stiff. She has other avenues she doesn't want to take and that's her decision to make. But because she is still in "working condition" and simply refuses to use what will actually keep her working she won't get disability.
I won't get disability because I refuse to wear my glasses even though without them I am beyond legally blind.
As others have said, the mere fact that she currently has a job means she is unlikely to qualify for that program.
If working at the school is causing her more pain and injury, she needs to either ask for an accommodation, or look for other work.
