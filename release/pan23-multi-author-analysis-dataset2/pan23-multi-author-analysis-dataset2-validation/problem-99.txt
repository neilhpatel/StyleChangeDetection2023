Give him notice to end his tenancy in your condo. If he doesn't move at the end of the state required notice period you'll have to evict him. Depending on location that eviction may be forestalled by the moratorium.
I was under the understanding that someone who is not paying rent and does not have a tenancy agreement is not a tenant. He is neither renting nor leasing.
I want to avoid a huge legal bill. Would small claims court be a better move for me to get him out? Or to at least pay the money he owes?
Are you in Ontario? In that case his not paying rent is important, though I'm not sure your "this is not rent" is going to fly.
You cannot remove someone from the property in small claims court. You're dealing with the Landlord Tenant Board.
Taking him to small claims court would mainly be to recover the money he owes without incurring high legal fees.
Just because you say the $200/mo is for something else doesn't mean it's not rent. Saying it's to help cover expenses means it's likely going to be considered rent.
Both are illegal evictions, the latter a "constructive eviction". In a tiny number of places that's a crime, but it would definitely open you up to a slam-dunk unlawful eviction lawsuit and you would be paying for his living expenses elsewhere.
You could sue him for the $200 per month in expenses sharing that you agreed upon verbally. Because the statute of limitations on verbal agreements is one or two years in many places you will not be able to claim the full five years of unpaid contributions.
Stop looking for loopholes or exceptions. He is unquestionably your tenant and you MUST follow the Ontario eviction process through the Landlord Tenant Board.
What would be more effective is to treat him as a tenant who is delinquent on rent, and go through the ordinary termination and eviction process for your country/state/province. The details vary widely, but in general you must give advance written notice, then obtain a court order to remove your tenant if they don't move. You can make a claim for the unpaid money as part of that "unlawful detainer" eviction lawsuit.
Please note that my mentioning the lump sums he received was to show that he is financially able to pay the monthly $200. There is no envy on my part for him receiving these funds. I was the one who executed the disability appeal for him and I also received the identical will and land dispute sums.
