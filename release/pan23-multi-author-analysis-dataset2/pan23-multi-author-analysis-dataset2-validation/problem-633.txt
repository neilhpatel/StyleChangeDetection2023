So, from my understanding, having been notifying this LL verbally, via text, via writing, via calls for the past month plus means nothing if it is not sent via certified mail? Would that not be immensely silly? I've heard we aren't the best state for renters rights but good lord.
"A tenant's cause of action to enforce a landlord's obligation" is discussed . You need to put your complaints in writing and send them to your landlord via certified mail and give your landlord a reasonable amount of time to address them. If the landlord fails to do so you can take him to court to force him to. According to handbook directed to by your state's bar, Indiana is shit for renter's right (this is almost a direct quote) and you can't repair and deduct or withhold rent without going to court first. You might be able to break lease, though.
Okay thank you, my fried brain can only handle so much lol. I guess it's a good thing covid canceled my law school plans lol. Again though, thank you for the help. It is genuinely deeply appreciated.
