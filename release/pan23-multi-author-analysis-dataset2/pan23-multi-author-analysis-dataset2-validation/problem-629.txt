Mate you were told not to contact her again and your response was to get a burner phone, create multiple fake numbers to text her per you millions of times. While I can appreciate and honestly hope millions of texts is an exaggeration, i think it can be assumed that the number is more than once which is 1 more time than you should've contacted her. This will lead a lot of people to believe there is more to the story than her dropping you for no reason.
Sounds like she had a perfectly good reason to stop talking to you. By what youâ€™ve done you probably she is probably going to get a restraining order against you.
You should definitely continue to seek therapy and if that means with a male therapist that's better than nothing.
It depends son the state, but generally you are describing stalking, which can most definitely get you arrested. In my state, you could be charged individually for every single message you sent her after she told you to stop. So you could be facing dozens upon dozens of criminal charges. The police can track down a tracphone number quite easily. Stop contacting her, and call a lawyer when the police show up looking for you.
