Foucault writes a bit about this type of public display of torture in the opening pages of "Discipline & Punish." The early sections of the book cover a specific account of Robert Francois-Damiens whom attempted to assassinate Louis XV. He was executed and tortured publicly atop a scaffold for this action. Flesh torn from body, horses pulling his limbs from their sockets, muscles ripped with burning tools, etc. Those in power oversee and administer the torturing processes as a public spectacle, allowing for the public observers to watch on as Damiens is tortured alive. Foucault examines this relationship between the tortured body, the administers of torture, and the public as forming a type of 'circuitry' of power that amplifies and forms immediate power relationships during the torture.
Just as Marx was concerned with the extraction of surplus value roughly a century prior to Foucault's work, Foucault appropriates the general theory to examine the extraction of surplus power. The 'circuitry' of the torture is a type of economy of power. These types of torture, both Damiens' case and the general instances you mentioned in your post, are largely dependent on 'generating' power if you will. The torturing class derives their power from public displays of torture. "If it could be Damiens, it could be you." The spectacle of torture serves to send a first message to the onlooking public. The public then amplifies the essence of the torturous display of power by experiencing fear, adoration, or catharsis at watching a so-called physical manifestation of God's punishment enacted on Damiens. Its by this process of the public witnessing the spectacle that they become subject to the torturous process.
In the case of Damiens, the economy of power discussed before can be observed as a relationship by which the surplus-power of the witness is exploited and then appropriated by the torturing classes. However, this process of primitive accumulation of power by using witness against itself was largely ineffective and dependent on a number of uncontrollable (to an extent) variables. Foucault understands the essence of primitive accumulation of power through comparative analysis to what he refers to as surveillance (commonly translated as discipline in English, which I consider to be a worse term to use than surveillance in this context). Surveillance principally involves the act of witnessing an act. This witnessing grants power/knowledge, as Foucault commonly refers to it. The issue with these primitive forms of punishment (torture) is that they involve a sort of dichotomy of power/knowledge from the two parties that comprise the spectacle of torture, i.e., the torturing body and the tortured body.
In the case of Robert Francois-Damiens, the power that is appropriated by the torturing class, the monarchy, is generated solely by threat towards the witnessing public body. The social justification of the torture was dependent on the crowd, as was the degree to which the torture would be effective in any significant manner. Within moments the witnesses could disapprove of the torture, resulting in a failure of the feedback-loop of the torturous process to produce any significant power in the hands of the torturer. This suggests that the witnessing public, rather than the spectacle dichotomy, possess great power in the initial stage of witnessing over the torturing class.
A bit more on the power of the witness over the torturing class - Damiens was tortured in front of the masses by the monarchy in hopes that he would confess his sins for the world to see. By refusing to confess to his sins, Damiens exercised a degree of power over the torturer. This 'break' in the circuitry of power resulted in Damiens become the dictator over the production and exchange of power in the circuitry. He was in complete control of the economy of power, depriving the monarchy of their exploitative process and granting the public all-the-greater power of witness.
The development of modern systems of surveillance attempted to remedy this 'flaw' in the primitive accumulation of power. Surveillance allows for carcerality and economies of power to be independent of the need to torture or engage in public & vulgar displays of power. I'm not sure if this is helpful here, so I won't write too much on the specifics of the economy of power under the carceral/surveillance state unless requested.
TL;DR - Torture was a wildly ineffective but necessary form of expressing the economy of power under monarchal societies. Torture facilitated and allowed for these types of monarchal organizations of society to exist by way of extracting power from the witnesses by way of public torture. The general explanation for 'why torture' can be best explained as a 'necessity' of sorts for the monarchy to secure their power. Those in power derive their power from depriving those not in power of their own power/knowledge. In the cases of pre or early-modern circuitries of power, this relationship was formed through public spectacles of torture. In the case of modern carcerality, this occurs through the internalization of the 'fear of god' that public torture invokes in the witnesses.
Michel Foucault, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977," (New York, Vintage Books, 1977). See specifically 'Prison Talks' for notes on circuitry of power in the spectacle as well as notes on surplus-power and Marx.
Wow this is very interesting. I appreciate the response. I always just viewed torture as a selfish thing as in maybe the torturer in whatever way gets some sort of pleasure out of doing it. This economy of power kind of explains more why it was so widespread during the time. Definitely gonna have to look into this.
