We maintain an exception for historiography - see the Rules Roundtable discussion at for details. As long as the discoveries themselves are not concerned with matters more recent than 1999, all is well.
I should have qualified my question. Yes, I am mainly curious about older history. I am amazed at how we continue to unravel the misteries from previous centuries or milenia.
Sabine Hyland made the first phonetic decipherment of an element of a khipu The khipus were used most famously by the Inka, though their use continued in the Andes until the mid-20th century. They are a writing system using knotted cords to record information. Hyland's decipherment of the names of two moieties at the beginning and end of an epistolary khipu from 18th century Collata is the first khipu decipherment since Leland Locke cracked the decimal code in the 1920s She proved that elements such as ply direction, cord colour, and cord fibre were part of how information was encoded into khipus and has been popularizing the idea that the khipus are a three-dimensional writing system.
