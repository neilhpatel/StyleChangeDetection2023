One thing to note: what makes Ukraine stand out from other former Soviet republics and other Eastern European countries is less that its GDP fell by half in the 1990s, but that it has had relatively anemic growth since then. Russian GDP also fell by roughly half in the 1990s, and didn't regain its 1990 level until around 2006. All former Soviet republics fell, especially in the early 1990s, and while Ukraine fell badly, it didn't fall the furthest (Azerbaijan and Georgia take that dubious honor). Most of the republics hit bottom around 1996 before beginning to regrow. Ukraine, and Moldova, however, are unique in that they haven't yet reached their 1990 GDP levels yet.
So why did these countries' economies implode? Essentially because a Union-wide production and distribution system completely in the late Soviet period, at a time when macroeconomic instability massively increased. To put it succinctly, the republics, asserting their sovereignty even before the 1991 collapse, retained control of products, resources and revenues, preferring to barter with other republics or regions and starving the central government of revenue (a gap which was filled by printing lots of money, causing massive inflation). The Soviet government’s budget deficit in 1991 exceeded 20% of GDP, foreign loans exploded to $56.5 billion, and the economy had declined by 6% in 1990 and would decline by a further 17% in the first nine months of 1991. Inflation was running at 250%. The former Soviet republics didn't even fully disentangle their monetary systems until 1993, when Russia retired Soviet ruble notes and ended its connection with the former Soviet "ruble zone". All republics had major issues of state budgets spending vast amounts on subsidies to largely non-performing industries and having twin issues of inflation and economic decline.
In addition to the Union-wide, centrally planned economy coming apart, there was also an issue of demilitarization. Even in the last Gorbachev years, the size of the Soviet military and its expenditures were drastically reduced (the number of military personnel alone fell from 5.3 million servicemembers in 1985, to about 4 million in 1990, to about 1.7 million in 1994), and in an economy where an estimated 15-20% of GDP was spent on defense, this was a major shock. Yeltsin, coming on the heels of Gorbachev's defense cuts, in turn cut defense procurements by perhaps 90%. The idea (both in Gorbachev's time and Yelstin's) was that rapid demilitarization would allow industries to reorient towards consumer goods, but it's not easy to retool missile factories to produce televisions, especially in a state of political and macroeconomic chaos. Ukraine in particular was saddled with heavy industries that were either "rustbelt" industries (like coal mining or steel production) or heavily geared towards producing for a Soviet-wide defense industry, like naval shipyards.
One final point point - you might be interested in checking out this I wrote comparing the economies of Poland and Russia in the 1990s. All former Eastern Bloc states faced major economic downturns in the early 1990s as they dismantled state-run economies, but former Soviet states like Russia and Ukraine faced additional challenges in building new political and legal structures while also trying to build essentially new market economies from scratch.
Nevertheless, there is a case to be made that the 1990s declines in former Soviet states are somewhat exaggerated. Part of this is because any estimates of the size of the Soviet economy based on value are just that - very disputed estimates, as determining value added or the worth of capital goods didn't really translate to the systems used in market economies. Also, the collapse of the economy in post-Soviet states was as much a collapse of the official economy as anything - it didn't capture a vast black market in the lawless 1990s, nor did it capture well the semi-legal "gray economy", such as shuttle traders buying and selling goods in local bazaars. The Russian government itself estimated that the "shadow economy" was nearly 50% of GDP in 1996.
ETA - I'm sorry that this veered into a Russia-based answer and is less Ukraine-specific, but hopefully it provides some context. One major difference between the two countries of course is that Russia is a major natural gas and oil exporter, and Ukraine mostly relied on natural gas imports at below-market rates.

1. With the break up of the Sovet Union, the Ukrainian economy suffered a sharp fall in demand when existing commercial relations and trade patterns were broken up. This was common to all former Soviet Union (FSU) countries, and all of them saw output drops.
It’s saddening to hear Ukraine hasn’t even recovered to 1990 GDP tho. That seems like a huge tragedy.
On the shadow economy it seems like that’s still a big thing in Ukraine to this day. I was explicitly asked to bribe my doctor after a quick visit to a public hospital there. And I was told by someone else that this was expected and normal since doctors earn 300USD on average. Weirdly I saw a lot of iPhone Xs on the Kiev subway (maybe one in ten people had one) which made me think there’s a very significant shadow economy indeed.
I was a bit confused on how much defence spending could have fallen to account for such a huge amount of GDP But going from 5 million to 1 million service members alone seems like a huge difference to me.
Ok I tried to read a lot of stuff about it and this seems very consistent and more detailed so thank you so much for your answer!
To add to u/Kochevnik81's comment, here's a more Ukraine specific answer I had already drafted, though it covers much of the same ground.
-  Ukraine generally maintained price controls on a large number of goods, with these only being lifted in 1996 (IMF, page 25) (there was a complex series of price adjustments, reforms, etc over 1992-1994, but generally prices were regulated one way or another). So hyperinflation plus price controls means that it was very hard for enterprises or households to find goods to purchase, and enterprises were resorting to barter.  Externally, the trade and payments system was only liberalised in the latter half of 1994 (page 48), so before then Ukrainians were limited in their ability to purchase abroad before that, again, enterprises would barter as part of trade, authorities esimtated that barter was more than 45% of exports in 1994 (IMF, 1997, page 48).
- The Ukranian executive had weak controls on government expenditure, so a Ukrainian ministry could spend money that hadn't been approved. And during Soviet times, enterprises were subject to relatively strict controls in terms of spending, but in the early 1990s these were dropped, and the executives of enterprises regularly lobbied for and got subsidies, tax exemptions, etc. In other words, budget constraints were soft, worsening the budget problems.
It is very uncommon to achieve such a large collapse in GDP, so it may not be that surprising that there were multiple causes of this collapse.
- Ukraine's national government lacked capacity in other ways, e.g. the IMF assessed tax administrators as lacking resources in almost all reas, including the legal system not defining the rights of taxpayers versus the revenue department, accounting methodologies not meeting international standards, etc. As another illustration of the lack of capacity, local authorities often acted in contradiction to the national government, e.g. restricting grain exports.
