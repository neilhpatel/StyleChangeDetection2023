Why has the idea of his employment been a continued conversation? He just expressed the idea that he wants to work for you to assault someone without consequences.
We have no formal probation period, but yes he's only in his second week of working for us. The shift where he showed up with the dog would be his 3rd.
Several of our personnel have... challenges, shall we say?... so we're used to working around issues. It's just that this is a bit more of an issue than we've previously worked with, and we would need the buy-in of our clients to assign him to their businesses.
He needs to make a reasonable accommodation request of the workplace before bringing it. As part of that request, you can ask for information from his doctor confirming that he does has a disability, has been recommended to use the service animal, etc.; however, you are not entitled to know exactly what the disability is (unless he wishes to tell you). Until he has been approved to have the service dog there, you do not have to allow it.
This may be beyond a simple retraining issue. I'd argue that, if it is a legitimate service dog, a guard with a dog will likely only help security (as the general public doesn't need to know that service dogs can't be aggressive), thus my concern is most definitely not with the dog. Perhaps an administrative role would be better suited (basically anything that isn't going to put him in a positionthat sets him up for failure)?
Being disabled myself, I both encourage and applaud businesses that are willing to look past disabilities and instead focus on what people are capable of doing. Genuinely, I thank you for that.
