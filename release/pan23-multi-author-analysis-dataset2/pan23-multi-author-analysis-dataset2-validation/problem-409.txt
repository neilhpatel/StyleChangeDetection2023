Do you know for a fact that this particular food was contaminated? Did you have the food tested in a lab and know exactly which pathogen it's contaminated with? If not, you're going to have a very hard time proving that it was the cause of your food poisoning. Contaminated food usually doesn't cause symptoms until a day or two after ingestion, contrary to popular belief that symptoms present within hours.
You could hire a lab and send the suspected contaminated food and a stool sample to it to see if the same pathogens appear.
The issue is that you would need to prove that it was the product that made you I'll and not another product. As the other commenter said, food poisoning generally develops between 24 and 48 hours so generally you're looking at a lot of food that was consumed.
So, some things that would help your case: was an entire lot contaminated the same way? Test other packages from the same lot of yours. Factory contamination is unlikely to be confined to a single unit. However, given that weeks have passed, you might not be able to find other units from the same lot.
Did you go to the hospital? Do you have any medical bills from this "poisoning"? In order to be successful, you would need to show damages. If you didn't incur any damages that you can prove, you won't be successful.
If you can prove that the food was contaminated, you may be able to sue and recover your medical bills and lost wages from the manufacturer. But this isn't straightforward litigation. It involves expert medical witnesses, experts to testify on lab results, and lots and lots of depositions. If there is sufficiently strong evidence, an attorney would take it on contingency.
