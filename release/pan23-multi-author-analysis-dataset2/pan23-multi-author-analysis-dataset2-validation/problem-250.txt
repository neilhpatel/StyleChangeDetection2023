It's a weird one. they may just be trying to fck with her her because she's disabled or because they dislike her.
Or they may have legitimate business reasons why they don't want to pay her less than other people in the same position. Like Equal Py reasons and whatnot. Maybe they'd rather just pay all the women the same as the men than deal with later being sued and having to explain "But that lady asked not to get a raise.".
Oh, for sure. I'm being half-serious, half-facetious. If it's a ploy for constructive dismissal then it's a moustache twirling semi-genius idea, but yeah, there are plenty of reasons to mandate a raise and your question is the right one.
We had a situation a few years ago where we bumped our starting/minimum wage to $15 -- pretty progressive at the time given our location. We had at least one employee who was in OP's mom's shoes. Of course, we didn't refuse reasonable accommodation requests and we made damn sure our employee understood the reason for the raise and that it was across the board, not targeted, and not something we could vary; we also combined our pay with aggressive health care to minimize the counter-intuitive negative impact caused by giving people a higher wage.
