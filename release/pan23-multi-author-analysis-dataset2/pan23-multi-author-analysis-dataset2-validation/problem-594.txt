There isn't that much that really can be said on this., as he wasn't exactly publishing film reviews late in life, sadly. , and as you can see, the final two entries are from 1977, the same year Star Wars came out. Alien came out in 1979, so of course is mentioned in none of them, and while categorically saying "No" as the answer to a question is tough, I feel it can be said with reasonable confidence we don't have any record of his thoughts in interviews on Alien, assuming he saw it.
But a brief mention of Star Wars comes to us from an interview he gave to Tom Shales which was published in a number of papers. His thoughts though are fairly brief, and also not that enthusiastic, I'm sorry to say. Asked about it, he recognized its success with audiences, but the science-fiction aspects seem not to have resonated with him, noting:
Trawling through for any other remarks he offered turned up nothing further. There are a few interesting connections, such as Charles Lippincott, who was the publicist for Star Wars, and was the publicist for Hitchcock's Family Plot, his final film, in 1976 when he first began working with Lucas & Co. , he at least makes no mention of sharing his next project with Hitchcock, so there is nothing to suggest more than mere coincidence and no further connection.
Aside from the above database, I also relied on Hitchcock on Hitchcock: Selected Writings and Interviews and Alfred Hitchcock: Interviews.
So kind of topic, but completely serious question; how do you provide in-depth responses in an expeditious fashion on a vast array of subjects?
Genuinely interested if you have any tips on how to efficiently research stuff or suggestions on how to retain knowledge.
As , it is often a matter less of knowing things, then knowing where to look for things. Knowing how to read efficiently also matters a ton. Research skills are a huge part of what makes a good historian. For AH specifically, there is also a pretty specific subset of skills as so much of that needs to be done on the fly. You could be an amazing writer but fall flat on your face here just because of the unique constraints, and those are skills you need to hone. I look at what I wrote here 5-6 years ago and sometimes cringe...
As /u/A_Dissident_Is_Here noted below, this kind of question is one that requires less a deep pre-existing knowledge that it does a good sniffer. Finding the interview itself was actually quite easy, and roughly 3/4 of the time I spent on this wasn't finding that one, or writing this, but doing keyword searches in just about every goddamn book I had access to that was about Hitchcock to confirm that there wasn't anything else lurking there, and then I only posted once I felt confident I had done my due diligence there.
Being a student or faculty at a university helps a ton here, as you get access to such a huge mountain of digitized stuff: Books, papers, newspapers, etc. But that is also useless if you don't know where to start, and how to process through that info efficiently. There are so many different ways to search, some better than others. For something like this, the answer presented itself easily enough, "Search for interviews given by Hitchcock from the late '70s", and to be honest, I think that a lot of users here would have been able to crank out what I did above simply with a little time and effort - I consider myself a bit of a film nerd, and like Hitchcock's work, but I could hardly rattle off his biography ad libbed.
I feel like people very much ignore the point you make about searching beyond the basic "answer": that is to say, they underestimate the time it takes to rule out every other avenue by deep diving sources which could conflict with the material they've gathered. I know people like to take umbrage with the humanities and social sciences, but historians have theories which can be (and often are) challenged by existing sources, as well as commentary from the principle actors. Publishing and giving cohesive theoretical answers requires examining literature which very well could rend moot the entire structure or framework of a theory/answer. Honestly I've found that the worst undergraduate papers I've encountered aren't the blatantly WRONG or even the poorly argued ones; those can be corrected. When somebody has made a compelling argument which just seems to work at every single corner, and never addresses any possible challenges, that's when I get suspicious that the answer was arrived at before the research even began.
For other answers though, where there is more to it, it definitely is something you need to have a fairly good underlying base of knowledge. To use on Coffee and the Civil War, going in, what did I know? On the precise topic, soldiers loved their coffee, but that was roughly about it! But I also have a decent understanding of the broader soldier experience (hence why I know they loved coffee) so felt confident in my ability to contextualize the topic, and also an excellent sense of where to be looking, so was able to find some excellent sources based simply of my sense of where to be looking, and what to be looking for. I started by tracking down some memoirs, and then did some searches in my university database which resulted in Norris and Wooster's pieces, which offered a few more sources to look into as well, and from there could all be fleshed out.
A very short works cited page, and sources which seem to never even be in communication with each other - let alone with arguments from different fields or historiograph-ic lenses - tends to be a good predictor of that.
I actually answer questions in a much narrower frame than it might seem. For many, there is actually a lot of important underlying connections, such as how dueling and slavery overlap, . Not that I don't some ducks but even then it comes down at least in part to a level of confidence in underlying knowledge to direct my research (and in that case I spent a long time checking up on things, and consulted with another mod too), and it can take a good bit of time and effort to feel I'm at the point of confidence in what I've researched and written.
Like, for this one, I could have posted almost everything I had there in about 5 minutes, as I found the interview super quick, and obviously there wasn't much to write up, but checking timestamps, it looks like I spent 33 minutes on it just making sure I had all those bases covered, and even then, still am only fairly confident, but would never speak in total absolutes!
The only extra thing I turned up was the Lippincott interview, which to be honest didn't add much, but seemed interesting enough to mention.
In most of these cases though, it really comes down to the same things. Read a shit-ton, and establish a baseline of knowledge. You don't need to know every little detail. What you want to have is grounding in the topic, and an excellent understanding of the broad context. This gives you the jumping off point to go down all those weird little tangents and to be able to contextualize them. Honing those research skills is also vitally important. You need to know how to cut through a document and find the important stuff, but not in a way that is so lackadaisical that you are screwing up. In some cases, that is why that grounding can be so important, as it gives you the sniffer you need for that, although in others it isn't as necessary, although you still need to ensure that you are doing your due diligence and not trusting the first source you find, as even a mundane topic can turn up real BS. I wish I can some hot tips, but there isn't a "ONE TRICK HISTORY PROFESSORS HATE!" to share here, unfortunately. It is just something you need to train at, and overtime you learn and improve on.
First, they're also people too. They have niche personal interests that they own plenty of books on because, hey, reading is sort of their thing. Movies, music, games, art, etc. They all have historical underpinnings and backgrounds which people want to look into.
This is something I'm sure most of your best posters actively police themselves on, especially in subject matter where they are answering a more "rote" question that happens to encompass specifically their work. The most interesting answers always seem to be ones where, even if the commenter has clearly addressed the topic ten million times in their real-world work, it still feels like theyre coming at it fresh from having continually re-evaluated their positions and sources.
I can't speak for Zhukov specifically, but a couple ways historians I know manage to do something similar:
Second, for subjects which are as accessible as a well known entertainment celebrity, people with professional research skills know how to utilize proper sources and locate those sources to answer a question. It's as much a skill as having a depth of knowledge about a particular subject. You're question about efficient researching definitely covers that. For more contemporary sources, especially regarding specific people's feelings on particular issues, looking up interviews or primary quotes is a great place to start.
Speaking for myself, this is certainly true: I have spent the last 35+ years doing research on an almost daily basis and am also an "efficient" reader due to my historical training. As a result I can answer questions on all sorts of things even if I know nothing about them to start out-- that was even true pre-internet, because I was trained in using physical reference works as an undergraduate in the 1980s and it's far easier (and faster) now. Those skills, plus being broadly curious, make many historians extremely fast researchers as well as good trivia team members.
