I don’t live in a forward state/county/city. Police won’t do anything until something really bad happens. They’d be more likely to detain or arrest me for hitting him than they would be to talk to him for touching or talking to people.
Right, that's what the concern is. Revenge/retribution is not self-defense. And it's dangerous. Speak to a local attorney about sending a cease and desist.
My issue is I’m a college student and I’m leaving in a few weeks until Christmas. I don’t really have time for proper legal action, and I’m fairly confident an attorney wouldn’t take this seriously anyway since not even my boss is.
Yes, your boss should do something, although I question whether your boss can do anything here that will be effective.
I would never actually hit or kick him. I would talk big shit but I couldn’t do it. That was more of me letting out my feelings about it than me being serious.
You can file an EEOC complaint or whatever agency handles such complaints in your state. You may consult an attorney if you wish.
Yes, you can be arrested and charged with assault or battery. You'll almost certainly be fired for cause, which means no unemployment. Your claims of sexual harassment will be deemed not credible. It's a gross overreaction. Do not touch him.
You do not need to be familiar with the EEOC. It's a hurdle you have to jump over before you can sue, nothing more. You fill out a form, then you get a right to sue letter. That's it.
All the EEOC does in 99 percent of cases is issue a right-to-sue letter. So you will need to get a lawyer.
You can file an EEOC complaint if your boss is not protecting you from sexual harassment in the workplace.
You sue your own employer. Your relationship with your employer, no matter what happens, will be toxic. They can't fire you for suing them, but your career there will go nowhere, so plan on getting a new job.
I’m not going to sue my employer. I love him and we get along great other than this. I also need him for my future in this field. I guess all this isn’t worth fighting over and I just have to put up with it.
You don't have to put up with it. You can say "stop," "don't touch me," and excuse yourself if he tries to talk to you.
If the worst this man has been subjecting you to are occasional comments and non-sexual touches, you may have difficulty finding a lawyer to take this on because your damages are not very significant. You are free to try. Basically -- you need to decide if this is worth even pursuing legally or not. Is this an annoyance or something that is harming your career and causing you severe emotional upset? Lawsuits, or even the threats of lawsuits, are long, miserable, and emotionally draining, with no guarantee of the outcome.
You can talk to an attorney and see if there's any case you could bring against the guy personally. But again, if it's fleeting and non-sexual, it may be hard to find a lawyer to pursue it.
I’ve told him to stop numerous times. I’m tired of getting slapped on the ass and I’m not one to just let it happen silently. I guess we will see what happens next time.
Make sure you have everything listed for specific in its offenses including dates and times and what was said or done. I'm not an attorney but have a fair bit of experience and a cease-and-desist might be a way to get the attention if the police aren't going to do anything and then you have that as a record if he continues. There may be another better legal term, but having multiple women with multiple incidents listed is going to get someone's attention. People can't be allowed to do these things without consequence.
If he does continue you could get a harassment order against him as well preventing him from coming to the building.
See if you can get the other women on board, and have an attorney provide him with a cease and desist and note that if it continues then legal action will be taken.
Thank you, I’m gonna talk with my coworkers about the best course of action here. I’m the only one big enough to even talk to our boss about it so I’m not sure what all they’d be willing to do.
Nobody has talked to doc because he’s like a grandfather to us all and we don’t know how to tell him without hurting him. We were hoping our boss would, but he doesn’t want to break his heart either. His dad always preaches to us to not let men mess with us, yet it’s his own son that does it.
If the father is that close to you all, maybe setup a lunch with whoever is willing and break the news to him that way to see if he can do anything. Bring things up from a place of concern and "we don't know what to do so we're coming to you as his father." He'll end up finding out one way or another, if you take action or tell him yourselves, so maybe telling him yourselves would be easier on him and hopefully he'll be less likely to be upset if necessary action is taken.
The reality though is his son is an adult and likely only a real consequence will make a difference.
Just remind them that there's strenh in numbers, we need to look out for each other. I'm glad you're being strong in this.
That'll Light a fire under his ass! And make sure you use plural "we" not "I" so he knows it's not just you taking potential action.
It occurred to me that your boss, because this person doesn't have a lot of reason to go in the building can ask him to leave. Let your boss know, in an email that if he doesn't stop this "customer" or however you'd like to put it, from harassing us you'll be a part of the problem and a part of the legal action we choose to take to keep us safe.
