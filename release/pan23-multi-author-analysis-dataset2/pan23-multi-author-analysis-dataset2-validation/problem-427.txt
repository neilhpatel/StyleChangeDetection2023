There's not a ton of mystery in the name here, even if Q. Sosius Priscus' name takes the practice to its extreme. Unusually long names in consular families in the second century is rather well attested epigraphically, though you wouldn't know it at all from reading the actual texts, the authors of whom almost without exception keep the names short, even when they're known to be longer. The imperial family is of course the best example of this practice: compare, already in the mid-first century, Claudius' full name with his usual moniker in Suetonius and Tacitus of just "Claudius" or "Caesar." The strict "tria nomina" that people are taught in Latin class is, epigraphically, rather less common than might be supposed. In the late Republic the use of multiple cognomina was quite common, and for a brief few decades the use of archaic praenomina was revived amid a general devaluation of the praenomen that continued into the Principate, during the course of which it eventually disappeared entirely. By the early second century we see in particular a rise in what's called "binary nomenclature," which is basically people whose names are composed of two full names. So Pliny the Younger's full name is basically two names, C. Plinius L.f. Oufentina Caecilius Secundus, where L.f. and Oufentina are just parental indicators (so his name is typically written C. Plinius Caecilius Secundus, where Plinius and Caecilius are both nomina). A number of factors resulted in these names and names like them. Mommsen found that in the Principate a new practice was added to testimentary adoption, which had been rather poorly regulated in the past (see, for example, the weirdness of Brutus' name), and to maternal inheritance, that the benefactor's name be added to the recipient's. If you break apart Q. Sosius Priscus' name it's pretty easy to understand, actually. The version you print here is not actually his name, as recorded on his epitaph, which includes the filials Q.f. and Quir(ina). Sosius' name, a good chunk of which came from his father, is clearly the result of maternal inheritance and testimentary adoption over the course of at least three generations but it's a very traceable set of names. Morris was able to trace these names back to about a dozen people going back about a century, whose complex web of inheritances had eventually converged on Sosius and his father.
I can't be absolutely sure without digging into Spanish onomastics, but almost unquestionably no. There are two reasons especially why I'm so sure on this even without knowing much about Spanish onomastics. First, this practice of binary nomenclature is a feature of what's sometimes called the "High Empire." It dies out pretty early in the third century, to be replaced by even weirder onomastic practices, as Roman citizenship becomes widespread and the distinction between honestiores and humiliores in law and social practice becomes ever wider. Secondly, this is an aristocratic practice only. Binary nomenclature of this type existed because of maternal inheritance and testimentary adoption. Put plainly that means that in order to get a name like this you'd need to inherit property from your mother or be adopted posthumously in somebody's will. Which means that you need to have a mother with property or be adopted by somebody who's bothered to make a will. Even if formal wills were fairly common (as actually appears may have been the case), nonetheless testimentary adoption is only something that happens among the aristocratic elite, as a means of preserving family estates and the status of a family name when the line would otherwise die out due to childlessness. Vulgate onomastics are also very complicated during this period, especially among provincials, but they do not follow the same pattern, and begin developing very differently quite quickly.
That's intresting, specially because the Spanish naming system is particular on including last names from both father and mother side. I just found that is not a common practice in the last few years, at it seems that the norm is to have usually one last name. Thanks from the answer!
