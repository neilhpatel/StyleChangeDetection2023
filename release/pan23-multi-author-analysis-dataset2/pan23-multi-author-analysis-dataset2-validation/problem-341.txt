TL.R: Although there is no direct modern term or condition relating to "rupturing oneself", an argument can be made for it being used a catch-all diagnosis for sudden death following trauma or intense effort during some lapses of the medieval period.
A cursory search does not provide any contemporary examples of "rupturing oneself" or at least not with those exact words. This may be due to a mistranslation or perhaps it is a popular culture trope.
Before I try to answer your question, we need to address the broadness of the question itself and how this will influence whatever answer we give you.
With this very superficial search (searching for primary sources without a much more detailed timeframe and the location is difficult). It seems that "internal rupture" could mean a variety of pathologies.
However, the medical term "internal rupture" is used in English sources starting around the year 1000. The death of William I "The Conqueror" is attributed to an "internal rupture" he suffered when he fell off his horse (1) in the siege of Mantes. Henry the IV was said to suffer from "rupture of the internal organs" he lived with this condition for several years and died of an apparently unrelated illness (2). In the case of an inquest of the death of "Richard the Brewer" the coroner reports "internal rupture of the bowels and diaphragm" when he fell while drunk and carrying bag of malt(3).
So with that in mind, it's easy to see how medieval physicians or even laypeople would refer to something "rupturing" inside the body after a particularly taxing effort such as laughing too hard or eating too many lampreys or simply falling too hard. Since no wounds could be seen from the outside, it is easy to imaging something must have broken on the inside.
Rupture of the diaphragm sounds awfully close to the . Is this just coincidental, or were medieval coroners actually doing autopsies and examining internal organs?
You must remember that during that timeframe, physicians did not even have a solid anatomical foundation or a detailed understanding of physiology. And I am not referring to the molecular descriptions of modern medicine but more in line with mistakes in the position of kidneys (one above the other not one right and one left) or that there were two different kinds of blood (this was due to the reliance on Galen's anatomical descriptions which were done on animals and not humans).
Autopsies continued sporadically in Europe during the Middle Ages, but there’s no particular reason to believe that this name indicates a continuity with the modern medical condition. According to the source below, the first description of a diaphragmatic rupture was in 1579.
Autopsies are quite old. While the Egyptians regularly dissected the dead there’s no evidence they did it for an explicitly medically diagnostic purpose. However it became a common enough practice in the Mediterranean that by 100 BCE Rome has legal rules for conducting autopsies and in 44 BCE a doctor was brought in to determine which of the 23 stab wounds was the fatal blow to Julius Caesar.
