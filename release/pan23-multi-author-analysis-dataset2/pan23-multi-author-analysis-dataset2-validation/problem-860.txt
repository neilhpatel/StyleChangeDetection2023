Generally speaking you buy a car as-is. Dealerships do often fix things however in order to maintain their reputation. You should go back and ask them to fix it.
It is not unheard of for a clutch to fail at 77k miles. How a manual transmission is driven will greatly effect how long a clutch lasts, it is a wear item that will likely need to be replaced at some point. If it was that far gone, a competent pre purchase inspection should have been able to point that out.
Spark plugs are changed at mileage intervals and probably not done as part of prepping a vehicle for sale on a regular basis.
Any used car you’re interested in purchasing should be taken to a different mechanic and inspected. If the seller doesn’t let you do this - it’s a red flag.
Almost all used car dealers sell cars "As Is" meaning you have no warranty or implied warranty the second you drive off the lot. It's why it is highly recommended you have a reputable shop check a car you're interested in before purchasing.
Secondly some states require a used car is able to pass the state inspection when being sold regardless if it's sold "As Is". NJ is a state like this, when a used car dealer sells a car in NJ they have to guarantee it will pass NJ rigorous emissions inspection within 14 days of being sold. Depending on your state this might be something to look into.
Thirdly try working with the dealership who sold you the car. A lot of times they work with clients to help maintain reputation and for future business opportunities. They may not cover the repairs 100% but might cover a portion of it.
Check to see what the legal dealer requirements are in your location and see if the dealership is in breach of those things. If so, you may have a case, if not, sometimes that's the way it goes.
