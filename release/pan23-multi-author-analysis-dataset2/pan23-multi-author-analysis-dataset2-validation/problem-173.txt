You don’t have a right to indefinitely use your ex’s house for storage, likewise your ex doesn’t have a right to destroy your things. They’ve given you 30 days to pick up your stuff, that seems more than reasonable to me, particularly if you’ve already been broken up for 8 months. Either make arrangements to get it within the 30 days or accept it as a loss.
He’s been withholding my things and refusing to ship even when I offered to pay. He was at first only allowed to hold onto them until he got his own things like a tv and console and it turned into this. He also owes me at least 1,000 for fucking up my car but I already know that’s not going to be paid.
If he won't let you in to get them, call the non-emergency number and ask for a civil standby, which is where an officer will come watch y'all and make sure no one gets out of line. You can do that if he's willing to let you in, if you feel unsafe.
If you are not physically able to get your things you will need to hire movers to go get it or enlist family/friends to help you.
