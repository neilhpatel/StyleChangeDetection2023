The quickest way to do this is for you to get a limited power of attorney from your father. That will allow you to sign papers on his behalf that would otherwise require his signature, for the limited purpose of selling the car. He would not need to be present.
It would be ideal if your father downloaded that form, printed it, signed it in ink, and mailed you two copies for your use.
But it can be scanned, faxed, or photocopied and still be valid. In California, it doesn't even need to be notarized.
To make this go smoothly, accompany the buyer to a license agency office (AAA usually). Remember to have a passing smog certificate from less than 90 days ago to give the buyer, and don't hand over the title and bill of sale for anything but cash or a cashier's check.
In general you print the principal's name, followed by "by [yourname], attorney-in-fact" or "by POA".
You could also just mail the title to him, have him sign his line of the seller's release of interest section (heck, throw in a POA form for good measure) and mail it back to you.
There is a more complex form called a REG 262 for transactions involving lost titles or multiple transfers that has a POA section. It's a "secure form" and needs to be notarized.

Since he will not be physically present you may want to write up a bill of sale and have him sign that too.
Your dad just needs to sign the title. You can mail it to him, have him sign it, and mail it back to you.
