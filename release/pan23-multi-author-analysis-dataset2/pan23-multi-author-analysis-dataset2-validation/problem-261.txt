The clerk can’t excuse you from appearing for a scheduled court date. Your lawyer should have filed something to ask for you to appear telephonically or to excuse your appearance or to continue the hearing - though there’s usually a statutory time limit on when those vpo review hearings can be scheduled.
The VPO can still play into the custody proceedings even though it was dropped - but the defendant has a right to dispute the findings typically within a certain period of time defined by statute. The burden is on the victim to prove they need it (in my experience there’s the initial order which is easier to obtain bc defendant isn’t present and then a second hearing which is more 50/50 on what happens). It sounds like without the girl because present there wasn’t enough evidence to up hold the VPO.
In my experience there would have been something filed prior to the court date asked for her to appear telephonically though.
NAL, have my JD and I’ve been working in the field for a decade but haven’t done criminal cases in more than five years.
No thats great thank you so much will definitely discuss this with the lawyer! The vpo even had a vpo violation charge on it and it just shocked us that the judge would just drop it.
I do mostly probate now but when I was doing criminal law I’d say it was about 50/50. When I was doing family law it almost always got overturned at the review hearing. Though sometimes this is at the victims request, and a lot depends on the judge as well.
The victim should also discuss with her lawyer if the harassment begins again BEFORE trying to get another order as this would irritate some judges (in the jurisdictions I’m in the same judge typically keeps the case for it’s entirety so best not to piss them off).
