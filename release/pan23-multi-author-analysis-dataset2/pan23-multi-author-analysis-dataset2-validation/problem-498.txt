Iâ€™ll take that to mean you were carrying a concealed weapon in a bar. You may want to review tx code section 46.035(b)(1) discussing whether such an action is a criminal offense.
I'll say the way the law it written, it is not very clear what is and is not justifiable as defense of property such as a vehicle. BUT, one would assume you would have ended up with a charge granted your life wasn't in danger. You can't just shoot someone, that's literally the reason they want to take away everyones guns... a car can be fixed. Now lets say you were in the car and in a dead end alley and this event took place, it would be a whole nother story. But you can't make that argument when your just sitting around basically a bystander at that point.
