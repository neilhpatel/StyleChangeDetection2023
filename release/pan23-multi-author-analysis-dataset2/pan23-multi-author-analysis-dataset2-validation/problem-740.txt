That seems to becoming more & more regular. I remember paramedics in the UK pleading with individuals blocking roads, to allow the ambulance to pass but they wouldnâ€™t budge. Eventually they were dragged away by other motorists & pedestrians watching it unfold.
I think the anger is more that it's a misplace "performative justice", kinda like the people who protest a restaurant for serving meat, or vandalizing cars people use to get to work.
Rather than going after real waste, things like the amount of plastic waste companies put out, or going after CEOs who burn an absurd amount of fuel to go to climate conferences in exotic places (to criticize regular people for "not doing enough"), on private jets, only to fly back to their cabin in Wyoming or the French Alps that they keep heated during winter.
When your protest blocks the roads and inconveniences a huge swathe of people who have nothing to do with your cause, that's when you lose support of people.
Funnily enough PETA was one of the first "disruptive" protestors that grew out of this style, but it's been so long that these other protestors don't remember the days when PETA was regarded as a joke.
