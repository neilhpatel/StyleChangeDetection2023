So its not illegal to treat some of the employees different when they all have the same chance of spreading the current Delta variant of the covid virus?
Apparently not far enough if you think vaccinated and unvaccinated people are identically situated in terms of the chance of getting infected themselves and infecting others.
What you need to understand is that while a vaccinated person has roughly the same ability to transmit the virus IF THEY HAVE IT, they have a much lower chance of GETTING the virus in the first place.
Not really, they are both according to the CDC able to transmit the delta variant if they get it. While its true you are less likely to get it if vaccinated. So ironically just like you did here, I simply generalized, didn't realized someone would go out of their way to be rude about it.
Not actually crazy. A vaccinated person is far, far, less likely to get Delta in the first place, and if they do, they're infectious for a much shorter amount of time. It's absolutely a reasonable distinction.
Accommodations must be reasonable. Going around unvaccinated, without a mask, and without regular testing is not reasonable because it puts others at heightened risk.
Think of it this way - a drunk driver and a sober driver have roughly the same likelihood of injury if they are in a car crash, however, a drunk driver is much more likely to get in a crash.
There is no principle of law that I'm aware of that would prevent employers from doing this, unless there is a specific statute in the particular jurisdiction that says so. (If Florida doesn't have this statute yet, be patient.).

In the absence of a disability requiring an exemption, it is both technically and actually completely legal, and indeed it would be following the advice of the CDC.
