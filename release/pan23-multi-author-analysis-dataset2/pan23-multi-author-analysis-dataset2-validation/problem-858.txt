It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
Title: Involved in a hit and run, have full video of the incident but insurance/police are not helping.
On the criminal side, you can't force the police to investigate. You can file complaints about their refusal, but that's about as far as you can practically take the matter. Hopefully the detective will be more interested in your situation.
On the civil side, you can decline to go through your insurance but you're going to wind up in the same place they are - chasing the guy down, then suing him. This isn't a situation of "Get a lawyer, watch money roll in". A lawyer's almost certainly not going to be working on commission for this case, it's not worth their time, so you're going to be paying for them up front. Since you're well below the FL limit for small claims, you don't need a lawyer anyway.
Keeping this off your carfax means that you have to specifically select a bodyshop that doesn't report data - and hope that your police report or insurance report isn't already in their database. Concealing information about a car's history can also come back to bite you in the ass later if you try to sell it; buyers don't like being tricked.
You (or your lawyer) will then have to track the guy down (which is more complicated for you since you only have his tags - maybe you can get the info from your insurance company), contact him somehow, sue him, then enforce a judgement against him. This is a process that can take years if he's uncooperative and won't result in an immediate payout - you may get a payment plan.
Doesn’t matter now, not getting the police to come and make an incident report at the scene is a big deal. You’ll learn first hand how difficult making a claim is now. Good luck!
Either way seems like you know your options. Wait on the detective or snail-mail insurance letter to work or pay a lawyer to get involved.
You've already reported the accident to your insurance, so the cat's out of the bag there. You need to look into your policy to see what you need to do now. Keep in mind that trying to avoid your insurance and keep information from them may see future claims denied.
You drive a giant battery powered car and couldn’t call the cops at the time of the incident because your ‘phone died’? Sounds like a part of this story is missing.
Ya that’s a bit hard to believe honestly. The cables are so cheap to buy and leaving one in the vehicle at all times is a pretty standard habit practiced by everyone I know.
