What state are you in? Non-compete agreements are generally unenforceable in California, for example, so if you're in CA you can sign without worry.
So it significantly limits your career, what are they giving you in return? Five years salary plus stock options? Or an interns wages? Or no wages, just experience?
Beyond that, it's a judgment call. An employment attorney in your jurisdiction might be able to shed more light on how local law would treat it. Personally, it wouldn't necessarily stop me if the prospect was good enough and a resume-builder. on the other hand, the potential for abuse -- trying to turn you in to an office slave by beating you over the had with your noncompete/nda -- would make me wary unless I were sure the management of the company weren't going to pull something shady later.
It's going to depend on what state/country you're in as they may all have separate rules and standards for what's reasonable and enforceable. 5 years form date of separation sounds excessive, "any educational application in any field" sounds overly broad. These are the kinds of things that \can\ result in an NDA being set aside by a judge. Plus it kind of sounds more like a non-compete than a non-disclosure. Many states treat non-competes as unenforceable for anyone not a principal of the company who worked on policy-level decisionmaking.
HOWEVER, the problem is that that you won't know it's not enforceable until you've done something they think is in violation of the NDA and decided to sue you over it. Or they've tried to oppress you and you've sued them for a declaratory judgment (i.e. that the NDA is unenforceable).
