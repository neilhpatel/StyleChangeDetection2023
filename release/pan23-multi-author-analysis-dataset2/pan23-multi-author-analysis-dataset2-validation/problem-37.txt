What kind of air conditioner in Texas requires water to operate? Most operate solely on electricity.
Check to see if there are any reported city/municipality outages or issues in your area. Do you see any kind of construction occurring on surrounding streets that might explain the outage?
It could be some kind of emergency maintenance, or some larger issue that the landlord has no control over.
If none of the above apply and the landlord has simply shut off the water maliciously or negligently, then you may have some legal remedies, including rent abatement or some other form of compensation.
I can literally see a stream of water running across the parking lot like maybe they busted a water pipe but 12 hours have passed already, the air conditioner is still running but because there is no water it’s super stuffy anyways and the temperature inside is about 80 WITH the ac and fans on.
My air conditioner is in the walls of the apartment so I’m guessing no water line to the ac is why it’s not working anymore even though it’s running and making ac noises.
I got this message: “There was a main water line rupture. We are working to resolve the problem, but we anticipate to not have water until tomorrow. Please turn off your a/c unit to avoid burning out water pump. We apologize for the inconvenience and Thank You for your understanding, ______ _______ Apartment Homes”.
I talked to the landlord office they told me it’s maintenance and they don’t have an ETA at all on when it’s gonna be done, I was not given a heads up notice though beforehand I just woke up to this.
