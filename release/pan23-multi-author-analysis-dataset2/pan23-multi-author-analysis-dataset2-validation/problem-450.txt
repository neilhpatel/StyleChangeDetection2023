2: I was appointed public defender at the beginning. Then they switched my defender after about six months. The new public defender treats me like a criminal. Tells me I'm not the only person waiting, it's not only about me, calls me a nuisance and shares no other information with me.
He said to come back with a written timeline of events as soon as I can once the case is dismissed. The same day if possible.
In his words, "Many lawyers will not take cases against the police. Suing the government and winning is hard. Suing police and winning is near impossible. Luckily, you came to one that will and has won several cases in the past.".
That being the case, it will be very difficult to sue successfully. The arresting officer need only point to the warrant and say, “Hey, I relied on this warrant in good faith. I’m no lawyer, and I’m no judge, but a judge decided there was probable cause, and that’s what I relied on.”.
He refused to take the criminal side of the case saying that the public defender office is good at what they do.
He's an older attorney, near retirement age, that has won multiple false arrest cases against the same county. I found him by googling past false arrests cases won against the county.
I don't think he's willing to take the criminal case because he wants more money for the work he does and thinks he'll get it through contingency on the civil case.
If there was a warrant, then some neutral, detached magistrate examined the evidence and agreed it constituted probable cause to arrest you.
If the warrant was valid. However, magistrates do make mistakes. In this case the warrant is very clearly invalid.
That's why the bond judge took one look at it, said something isn't right here and had me pulled aside. Then a officer came in, unlocked me and said he's never seen anything like it before but the judge is letting me go. He said, "four major charges, I wouldn't have believed this if I hadn't seen it, this is your lucky day".
But it's not lucky to go straight to work only to be told by your boss, "we don't need this around here" when you attempt to explain. Then have charges pending for a damn year because no one seems to have the time to notice that there's no damn evidence Ugh.
I want this nightmare to end. There's no amount of money that could be gained through suing that could ever atone for what the police did. What the legal system has allowed. That's why I'm suing. Because something has to change about the way police and the legal system work. No one else should ever be put through this!
