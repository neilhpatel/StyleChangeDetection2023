The right to a speedy trial is a term of art. It could take years for a criminal case to go to trial, especially if the Defendant isn't in jail waiting for trial. COVID has extended the process as well. From a general perspective, the longer it takes for your case to go to trial, the better your chances are because just like you, everyone else forget things too. Witnesses might move away. Prosecutors get pressured to clear away old active dockets.
Delays are a legit tactic, but can cause problem. I’d bet the lawyer waived it every time a delay was proposed for that reason.
I had to apply to university outside of NC specifically because I kept getting the “oh, we’d love to process your application but we need your court issue resolved first”.
Outstanding felony charges do pose unrelated problems when it comes to seeking employment - they’re generally always reportable until dismissed or adjudicated.
Every delay should come with a speedy waiver - you’re acknowledging that the delay is acceptable (via your attorney).
As the other poster indicated - delays are frustrating but are a legitimate tactic for the defense. As you’re experiencing - the longer it drags on the foggier the facts get. You might even delay it so long it gets dropped or plead to a simple citation or something.
Those waivers can be rescinded during a scheduled appearance. You should speak to your attorney about whether to rescind the speedy waiver(s) to try and docket the case earlier is worth it.
It’s better for the criminal case to delay as long as possible, but that’s typically not the best option for the rest of your life like education or housing or employment.
