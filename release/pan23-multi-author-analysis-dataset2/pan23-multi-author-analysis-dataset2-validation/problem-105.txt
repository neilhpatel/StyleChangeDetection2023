I'm not a lawyer so I don't know all the intricacies, but I'd bet that this conviction levelled up the significance of this tweet in terms of its potential use as evidence against Trump himself.
Meggs had a tweet saying “Trump said It’s gonna be wild It’s gonna be wild He wants us to make it WILD that’s what he’s saying. He called us all to the Capitol and wants us to make it wild Sir Yes Sir Gentlemen we are heading to DC pack your s”.
It can't be good for Trump that there's a tweet from a convicted seditionist which strongly implies he interpreted Trump's "wild" as a military command ("sir yes sir") to pack up arms and head to the capitol for violence...
Everything is worded vaguely enough that it's not a slam dunk in a legal sense, but it's another piece in the puzzle demonstrating that Trump's words led directly to the violence. Now that there's a conviction, it could be argued that Trump's words incited the seditious conspiracy.
