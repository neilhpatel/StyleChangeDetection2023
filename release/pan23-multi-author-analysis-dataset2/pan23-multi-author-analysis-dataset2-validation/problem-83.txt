There have been many attempts - but none of them successful - to link local folklore with all sorts of relic human populations. This is often advanced as an explanation of Irish fairies (suggesting that Irish Celts encountered small indigenous people during their arrival in the first millennia BCE). But since the tradition about these supernatural beings has close parallels throughout Northern Europe, we would need to advance the theory that all these people were having a similar reaction to similar relic populations throughout the region, and that is, frankly, absurd. That effort, however. only reaches back a few thousand years to a population preceding the most recent large population arrivals in Ireland.
"Modern" people in Northern Eurasia and Western Europe encountered the last of the Neanderthals more than twenty thousand years ago. Reaching back that far with oral tradition may be possible, but even we could imagine a successful recollection that far back, it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate. Given that the hunter-gatherer groups who had contact with Neanderthals was largely displaced with other, later arrivals, the preservation of such an oral tradition would be less likely. All that said, I have seen absolutely no credible evidence that such an oral tradition lingered long enough to be recorded.
An exciting effort to identify oral tradition with the late Ice Age has occurred with . This stretches oral tradition to recall an event that occurred between ten and twelve thousand years ago. But here we have a stable population living consistently in that location throughout that time. That's an amazing amount of fidelity, preserving an oral recollection under ideal if not unprecedented conditions. Achieving that same thing stretching back more than twice as far into the past with an unstable population is, simply, not something that occurred.
One could find this sort of speculation associated with any number of other people, but speculation is cheap and not necessarily convincing. If we restrict ourselves to what can be proven or what may be regarded as even remotely likely, this and other speculation tends to fail the test.
The problem with these sorts of things - and one encounters them frequently - is that people assert all sorts of patterns: "this group of legends refers to ... ancient hominids, a universal flood, aliens - you name it." Then a folklorist who attempts to take traditions apart carefully and to understand them, how they fit into a culture and what we can possibly know of its history, is asked to react, or worse, is asked to "prove" that this random idea is false.
While I cannot prove these things are false, it is really up to the speculator to prove such speculation is true. If I say the Yggdrasil Tree is a reference to procreation because a phallic tree penetrates a feminine earth, people should pat me on the head and say, "That's nice. Now go take a nap." Or give me some medication. Anyone's random musings may be nice, they may even be insightful, but if they can't be proven, they are just ideas. And ideas are easy to come by. Proof is much more difficult.
How would you prove it though? Unless the oral history is accompanied by a physical artefact like a tool or non-human skeleton passed down, you can only really collect increasing amounts of circumstantial evidence in the form of coinciding oral histories and folklore.
In the case of the Australian tradition, the informants were able to describe the locations of islands that would have existed with lower sea levels. Their information was sufficiently precise and matching the known submerged topography that it is enough of a match to be persuasive. That is by no means proof, but it is persuasive because of the level of detail.
