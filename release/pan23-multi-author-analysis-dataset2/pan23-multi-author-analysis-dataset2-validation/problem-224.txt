Short Answer: Mostly flogging and lashing. Most common offences; petty thievery, "cowardice", plundering and in some rarer cases out right murder. It is falsely reported that the Royal Artillery would be exempt from most harsh punishments however this is simply an outright lie as we will see.
As a follow-up question, Gen. Isaac Brock's second in command Roger Sheaffe was said to be overly zealous with his punishments. If someone could be flogged for taking corn from a horse, do we know what Sheaffe could have done to be considered especially harsh?
Long Answer: So for the other things I can't really help but this is one thing I could certainly have some input on. As a huge nerd for this Era there are actually several books that i've read through that iirc DO in fact go into detail on Martial Punishment in the British army(Early 1800's).
While I’ve heard of Sir Sheaffe I’m actually not too familiar with the mans detailed day to day to leadership. However I’m sure the punishments he would dole out would probably be the same as above albeit a bit more frequent if the mans reputation from what I have read bits and pieces about is to be believed.
Overall in the British army of this time, they don’t seem to really deviate away too much from flogging and or lashing. Flogging actually becomes quite a “British” punishment funnily enough as other armies such as Prussia or Austria(mostly Germans) find the English practice of flogging positively barbaric, I’ll have to find the source that states that however.
