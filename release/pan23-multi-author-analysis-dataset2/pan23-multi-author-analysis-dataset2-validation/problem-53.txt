Minor correction but in the case of the Titanic reciprocating engines were used for the main outer propellers with the turbine only being used for the center propeller.
So, the first thing we need to remember is that Titanic wasn't a cruise ship, she was an ocean liner. When we think of cruise ships today, we think of 24 hour gluttony and leisure, but this was not the case in 1912. Titanic sailed at a time when the post industrial revolution had introduced a true world economy, and which required frequent travel between Europe and North America. It would be simplest to compare to North Atlantic shipping trade to modern airplanes, but it doesn't quite fit. Yes, they transported passengers, cargo, and mail but due to the lenh of a crossing, shipping companies had to lure customers with amenities that made the crossing enjoyable. White Star Line and Cunard Line built their first decade liners in direct response to the Germans, who suddenly entered the race with not only size and speed...but luxury. The British had to compete quickly due to how much shipping effected the overall economy, so much so they even funded Cunard in their buildings of Mauritania and Lusitania, which drew customers with promises of speed. You could cross the Atlantic in 5-6 days on Cunard, with some comfortable accommodations to boot.
This is a great question for a few reasons, and a bit more in depth than you realize . Let me see if I can help! You've inadvertently asked a pretty big question, so this is going to take multiple posts for me to answer.
Side note not real pertinent but interesting: Titanic's fame and prestige was going to be short lived. The Germans were due to launch Imperator later that year which would be bigger, faster, and more luxurious than the Olympic Class- taking the plainer, less inspired, parts critiqued about Titanic and developing them to more impressive design.
It's important to know all this because it sets up the world in which Titanic set out. Sailings were absolutely social events, of course, but they were not parties or vacations that we have now. Sailings were business and necessary travel, and customers chose their ship based on what they prioritized. If they needed to get across the Atlantic fast, they'd chose a Cunarder. If they were able to take a more relaxing trip, say sailing to a vacation, they might take White Star and revel in its comfort and pampering. While Titanic's pantry was generous with both food and liquor, there was no partying, Edwardian raves or anything of the like. It simply wasn't done. There may have been dances. We have a small handful of references to dancing on Titanic, and we know they were held on Olympic, but over a century of testimony hasn't turned up anything really. We would think if there were an organized dance, someone would have mentioned it at some point, but they don't. A few vague references but no anecdotes or stories or testimony. A bit weird actually.
But not to say that White Star didn't offer recreation, of course they did! In First Class, there was gentleman's smoking room, a ladies reading and writing room, the lounge and reception area, a library, a squash court, a barber, a gym, a swimming pool, and a sauna. Meals were social events, but Titanic also offered a la carte restaurants and cafes, including what was colloquially known as "the Ritz". The Ritz wasn't a real Ritz, they had a contract exclusively with the Germans, but White Star simply took the concept and staffed it with a private team of Italian managers and waiters who sailed as passengers, not crew.
White Star had to respond, and since they did not have the governmental support of Cunard, they fitted their liners with older turbine engines. To compensate for the extra day it would take their proposed Olympic Class liners in the bustling, booming, rushing, hurrying early 20th century global economy, they promised unparalleled luxury- and that is what Titanic delivered.
As far as I know, Olympic and Titanic were the first two liners to offer dining options outside of the main dining room, and passengers could eat whenever they liked as the restaurant stayed open from 8am until 11pm. Passengers who chose to dine exclusively in the Ritz were given a refund on their ticket.
First Class passenger R. Norris Williams claims he asked to get his flask filled early on and was refused.
I say all this because, in answer to your question, all of these spaces were supplied by their own bar, as well as various saloons for different crew departments.
Second class offered much the same- a general room, library and smoking room while third offered a smoking room, reading and writing room and a general room- which included a piano. We do know third class would have involved much music, as we have reports of pipes being played on deck and the night activities being so loud they were disrupting the postal workers. Since their saloon was well forward, and they most likely bunked on F-Deck (well below the third class general room), we assume they mean at work- as the third class post office was located just outside the general room. It is possible, if they were staying on F Deck, that they were referring to the noise from the third class dining room which shared their level.
Last call on Titanic could be found at 11:30pm in the first class smoking room (third class was closed down at 10pm each night)- which closed at midnight. At the time of collision, 11:40, last call had passed so there were men drinking their final drinks before heading off to bed. Over in the lounge, a card game with passengers William Sloper and Dorothy Gibson was allowed to finish past closing at their request. The Cafe Parisean had a few stragglers as well, Lucian Smith recalls playing bridge there at the time of the iceberg, well past it's 11pm closing time. Strangely, the surviving members recall feeling the shock of the impact but not noticing the iceberg as it passed right by them - the cafe sat on Starboard side B Deck.
All this to say that, by collision time, aside from a few remaining scattered holdouts, Titanic was down for the night, lights extinguished and almost all passengers in bed.
The reason I say your question is so good, is because alcohol becomes a popular weapon post iceberg- both for safety, blame, and stability. Let's look at some accounts involving it.
And these saloons were well stocked. 15,000 bottles of beer, 1000 bottles of wine, 26 barrels of wine and about 800 bottles of liquor including over 100 cases of brandy, cognac, vermouth etc. Titanic was well and truly loaded in all definitions of the word .
This is a particularly biting comment as Hichens was both a ... err... rough and tumble ... character but was also the man at the wheel when Titanic struck (his decendants have claimed it was Officer Murdoch who was drunk/asleep).
Ms. Richards is circling the truth here, but she's missing enough information and veering wildly into misunderstanding and variation. Firstly Titanic struck closer to midnight. Secondly, Smith was indeed not at the wheel and had left someone else (Hichens) to steer. Of course he was, Captains didn't steer ships and neither did officers Quartermasters did. Smith had official "on duty" hours like everyone else, and while he was always technically on duty, he did sleep, and rest, and eat, and socialize which is where the final accusation that he was, thirdly, drinking in the saloon, probably came from.
This is, admittedly, a very small sampling (we don't have too much to go off here) but if we could make an attempt to track it- we could theorize that post collision, standard laws applied followed by a looser enforcement once the reality started to spread, followed by whatever goes at the end (for those who chose to). Not enough evidence to prop that timeline up, but these accounts may hint at it.
Smith was a celebrity and passengers chose their crossings to sail with him. As such, it was a requirement of his job to socialize, and schmooze, and engage with those paying the tickets that kept the shipping business and going. He even had special and specific uniforms for it. On the evening of the 14th, Smith was at a dinner party hosted by the Wideners before returning to the bridge shortly before 10pm. Yes, there was dining and drinking and socializing- but not Smith. Titanic was a dry ship.
So, where did Emily Richards accusation come from? Obviously, I can’t give you a definite historical source on this but my guess would be simple grief and PTSD. She’s just said goodbye to her younger brother, descending in a boat he refused to enter. She’s watched him die and heard his screams as he froze to death along with 1500 other people. My best is trauma, plain and simple.
We have a few accounts of alcohol post sinking. Quartermaster Oliver threw a bottle of brandy out of his lifeboat. Walter Hurst accepted a flask and a swig from William Lindsay but choked on it as it wasn’t filled with brandy but peppermint essence.
My note: The fine for bringing liquor aboard was 5 shillings, with 10 shillings for every subsequent offense. While crew salaries varied, this was a bit of a hit. Fellow lookout Frederick Fleet testified that he made “Five pounds a month, and five shillings lookout money.” That is, he was paid five pounds as a crew salary and an extra 5 shillings for doing lookout duty- all of which would disappear if he was found to bring alcohol on board. For context, in contemporary dollars, he made about 600 pounds with 5 shillings equalling about 25 pounds. It doesn’t sound like a lot, but in 1912, it was the exact cost of a week of welfare/pension.
Joughin claims he spent his night delivering bread to boats and hauling reluctant women to safety. He threw deckchairs overboard for flotation and refused to enter boat number 10 which he claims he was supposed to be “captain of”. And then-.
