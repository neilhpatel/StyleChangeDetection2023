The executor of his estate must make arrangements for preserving the records. Patients should be notified so they know how to obtain copies of their records. Are you the executor or administrator? Only that person has the right to do anything with the items in his estate. You are not required to be executor, but if you choose to, then you need to follow CA law, and a probate attorney would be helpful here. What's the status of the estate and probate?
Thank you, I assume I am the executor, but that has not been set up in any legal sense. There was no will and his death was unexpected. Can I hire an executor or administrator to take charge of his files? I wouldn’t even know how to go through his files to make a client list and contact everyone, to add to that, I believe he kept some records digitally and I don’t have those passwords. What a mess.
It sounds like a mess. Yes you can have someone administer the estate. (Without a will, an administrator settles the estate instead of an executor but its basically the same.) A probate attorney may be where to start. A court would have to approve whoever it is. Especially because these are medical records it's dangerous if you start to act like the administrator and start doing things outside of the probate process. Good luck.
I’m sorry that my reply did not reply to you directly. His malpractice attorney(s) will try to minimize their (=his) damages with respect to client/patient care. I hope the information helps.
I’m sorry to learn of your loss and the difficulty you are facing as a consequence of his untimely passing.
You should contact his professional board, state licensing board and consult with a malpractice attorney (do you know who provided his malpractice?) regarding the best way to handle these issues/concerns. Unfortunately, people’s lives and livelihoods could be affected sooner as opposed to later...just like yours.
