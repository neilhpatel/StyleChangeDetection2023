Mods I’m sorry if this is a rule breaking comment, I know this doesn’t fit the standard submission format but I am hopeful that the alternative kind of question will allow an alternative kind of answer.
You may want to take this with a grain of salt because I’m not a historian, but I am a researcher and I have a background in math where professors very regularly get contacted by individuals claiming to have solved famous problems which I consider very similar to your situation. If I’m being entirely honest, I’m not sure I believe you are actually on to something purely for the reasons you have laid out, but I am going to extend you the benefit of the doubt and say you’ve discovered something because this does in fact happen.
Step 2) using the documentation you produced in step 1 lay out word by word exactly what you think the translation is, how you got to that translation, and the justifications for your leaps in logic. If you don’t think you’ve made any leaps you are almost certainly wrong as translating something that no one else has done before is almost certain to require some connection no one has made before and these connections better be rock solid.
Step 1) Take a week off from the problem, don’t look at your notes and try not to think about it, then starting from scratch do the translation again without looking at your previous work. Document the entire process extensively. If you get to the same place again (with wiggle room because translation isn’t an exact science) then continue to the next step. If you have two significantly different translations at the end then the chances of this being real plummet.
Step 4) take another week off, walk away from the project as best you can then come back and read the document. If the logic makes sense still then great on to step 5.
Step 7) and this will likely be the hardest one: listen to the experts. If they say “nope, and here is where you went awry” listen to that feedback and don’t be defensive. Don’t get in an email shouting match if they say your translation doesn’t have a leg to stand on. Seriously evaluate what they say, take any criticism/ feedback in and try to address it in the translation methods you used if you believe there is still merit. If after seriously taking their feedback in you are still certain of your work, send it out to the next person on the list.
Step 6) find as many individuals that study this area/time period/ language as you can and send the email to them starting from most relevant to least. Wait until you hear back from one professor/at least 2 weeks before sending it to the next, you don’t want 40 emails pointing out the same error all coming in at once.
Step 3) get your document justifying word choice polished up, check for grammar, spelling mistakes, etc because even a missing comma could make someone see this as the ravings of a mad man (hyperbole but the point stands, the worse the spelling in the emails submitted to my professors the worse the proofs almost without fail).
Step 8) if you’ve gone through everyone with a reasonable connection to this translation and they all say you have it wrong, give up. You are almost certainly wasting your time but at least you gave it your absolute best shot. It’s important to realize that a ‘failure’ like this is not a true failure. There are millions of mistranslations, and only one correct one (give or take ) so you know the professionals have been wrong before and Often dozens of times. What you have done will still have been rigorous work where you flexed your mind and tried to bring a piece of the past back to the world, and that is pretty cool in its own right.
My name is phpceo, and I believe I have in part translated the X inscriptions into Y language. Attached to this document is a PDF of my work. If you are willing please look this over and let me know what you think?
If someone arrives at the same result, does the reading make sense? There are formal standards that can be applied here, but there's also the basic "sniff test" as well - if you hand the translation to someone, does it make sense as a written work? If the translation mostly seems like gibberish, you are going to have a much harder time justifying the work. Next, does the translation make sense within the bounds of the historical narrative? This goes back to the point about local historians thinking it it's a hoax as well - it is unlikely that a known artifact is going to overturn the historical record, but hoaxers were known to embellish objects in such a way.
If a professor says you have something, then they will be much more familiar with the publication process than I am for history work so let them take you through that stuff. If the mods allow it though I’m sure the people of the subreddit would love to have you post the paper here if it ever materializes, I know I would!
Since the Voynich Manuscript is rife with translation attempts over the years, I'm going to draw upon "What Will it Take to Solve the Voynich Manuscript" by Lisa Davis which outlines the following for legitimacy (p. 77):
This is an interesting question since you seem to be aware of the "crackpot detector" that scientists, mathematicians, and historians start to develop over the course of their careers. As such, diligent work by an "amateur" (i.e., lacking a professional affiliation) can get filtered out before someone even checks the work.
In your question you immediately raise a red flag by saying that local historians think that the inscriptions are hoaxes or forgeries. Given the first point by Davis - the translation must be consistent with the realities of the object itself - you must be able to situate the object in the historical record in order for your translation to be accepted. Why do the local historians think it's a hoax? Is there evidence that it is? Is there evidence that it is not? Being able to answer all of these questions is a starting point for demonstrating the validity of your work. However, in the process of answering these questions you might turn up proof supporting the local consensus that it is a hoax.
This leads us to the second criteria - you must have a sound and explicable methodology for the translation! This is where having impeccable notes for your translation process is going to be a requirement. You should be able to detail all of the steps that you took and all of the logical processes that lead from the source to the translation. Mentioning "proto-languages" is also going to raise all sorts of alarm bells for your work (or the source) since now you need to justify that the proto-language is legitimate. Can you link the source to other known examples in the academic literature? Can you write up the process that you used for the translation in such a way that someone else can follow it and arrive at (more or less) the same result?

I'm sorry but I've had to remove your question because it's not a question about history. You could post this in our weekly Friday Free-for-All thread or consider another sub like /r/AskAcademia.
However, don't take this as entirely doom and gloom either. Personally I find the history of hoaxed objects to be very interesting and it takes a good deal of detective work to definitively prove that a probable hoax is a hoax. So an interesting contribution to your local history could be made if you continue to peruse the work and the object is proven a hoax.
This kind of leads to a cautionary bottom line: there are a lot of unusual artifacts scattered around the world (e.g., ) that are largely considered to be hoaxes by the academic community because we know people created hoax artifacts (e.g., ). So there is a high bar that you need to overcome here, it's entirely likely that the object is a hoax and an easier that expected translation could be an indicator of that as well (i.e., if you could perform the translation in a couple evenings with with no background in the language and a couple dictionaries, it's probable that the hoaxer did the same).
