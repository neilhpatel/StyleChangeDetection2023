Unless you spend a lot of time on military bases, at Federal facilities (courthouses, immigration jails, etc) or National Parks, you won't need to worry about the Federal issues.
You are correct that the odor of burnt or unburnt marijuana is no longer "reasonable articulable suspicion" to investigate a driver for possession of marijuana, or to request ID from a passenger, in Washinon State.
The limited question of "is it legal to hotbox my car on private property" is "depends on how private the property is".
is the law that prohibits possession of marijuana outside of its sealed container in the passenger compartment of a car. The classic "there were joints in the center console" situation is a traffic infraction.
But it can give rise to RAS for a DUI investigation. If a cop thinks you've been smoking weed in your car, they can ask if you've been smoking weed, and use observations and answers to continue a DUI investigation.
The legal definition of "highway" isn't the limited-access Interstate or high speed highways between cities. It "a public road". So hotboxing while parked on a quiet residential street is a traffic violation just like having marijuana in the car while driving down the road.
For the purposes of this law, driveways and alleys and parking lots are not a "highway". You can violate other driving laws on private property, but not this one.
This is a nonzero risk. Washinon, like Colorado, wrote a low "per se" limit for THC metabolites into their cannabis legalization law to make it palatable to MADD. Just like the well known 0.08% BAC for alcohol, you are presumed to be impaired by cannabis.
The problem is that many heavy cannabis users have that in their blood all the time. There are no exceptions for medical users.
The answer is yes. You can get a DUI sitting in your driveway. For the purposes of DUI law, private roads that are accessible directly from the public road are also unlawful to drive on while intoxicated, or to be in physical control of a vehicle.
Your question of "is it illegal to hotbox on private property" includes the possibility that you will be intoxicated by marijuana (indeed, that is your goal) while being in actual physical control of the vehicle, leading to a DUI arrest.
Worth noting - there is no location in the United States where marijuana is legal. Regardless of what any individual state has done, it is illegal on a federal level.
While accurate and worth pointing out, it is also worth pointing out that in Washinon State, federal prosecutors there will not prosecute marijuana crimes that are decriminalized under state law.
In terms of your state laws, it is true that you can use for recreation. It's also true that odor alone is not probable cause, under state law, to initiate a search of your vehicle. I would not be insanely worried that traveling around in your vehicle which may still smell like marijuana will get you in trouble on a state level.
If your keys aren't in the car, you have a good defense that you weren't in actual physical control. But if you're running the engine to keep warm, you absolutely can be investigated, cited, and convicted of DUI while hotboxing in your own driveway.
Sure, but you’re not going to get in trouble for weed here. If the federal government is going to target anyone, it’s the shops, which they tried a few years ago to no effect.
I would be more concerned about the hotboxing itself. There's a bit of ambiguity here. Would this constitute OWI? There is a saying in law enforcement circles, "You may beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride". This is, essentially, a tacit admission that while you may eventually craft a defense that ends without a guilty verdict, during your encounter with the police, they can still arrest you despite this potential for an effective defense.
The criteria for making an arrest on scene is that the police have a "probable cause" that you have committed a crime. Until there's more case law regarding your particular scenario, it's likely that a police officer could arrest you for this, even though you might be able to craft an effective defense for the court. Qualified immunity would likely protect the officer from civil action against them for such an arrest on the basis that even if you were to craft a successful defense in court, even if hotboxing a car is not illegal, that fact has not been "clearly established".
Even if ultimately found not guilty, or your charges are eventually dropped, an arrest itself can have consequences for your employment, your finances (paying bail), security clearances (if applicable), your ability to pass future security checks, among others.
