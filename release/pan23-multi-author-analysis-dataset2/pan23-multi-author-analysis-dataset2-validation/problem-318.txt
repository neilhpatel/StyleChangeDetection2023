She doesn't have one yet actually. I have an appointment for her to meet with someone to engage them in service but that was set for Thursday and my brother is now insisting that he needs the doc signed by Wednesday. Hence my plea here for help.
With very limited exception, nothing "needs" to be signed by Wednesday. Nothing you've said here indicates your mother is obligated to immediately sign this document. They would prefer she sign it by Wednesday. They would also prefer she not have lawyer review it first. All great reasons to not sign it Wednesday and bring it to a lawyer.
I wish I could get something in writing that said that! But they've given me such a short time frame that I don't think I could arrange for any kind of agreement between the two of them by tomorrow.
As much as I hate the clich√©, it applies well here: poor planning on their part does not necessitate an emergency on her part.
They should have planned better. Do what is in your mother's best interests, not what is most convenient for your father/brother. If it can't be done correctly and with the help of a lawyer by Wednesday, don't sign anything on Wednesday.
A Quit Claim Deed for a particular property just allows him to buy it as his separate estate while he's a married man. It only divests her of any interest she could claim in that property. It is however not a bad time to use the leverage to ask your dad to put something in writing about how he's not going to go after her remaining money in the divorce.
It would be quick and easy to record a video or scrawl out a note that says "I XXX hereby guarantee that I will not seek additional monetary payment or material items from XXX in the course of our divorce. I have already received half the proceeds from the sale of the family home, therefore any and all rights I have to marital assets has been satisfied in full.".
If she is not of sound mind, she cannot sign a POA. It wouldn't be valid. She may not like it, but either you or your brother need to request guardianship over your mother. A doctor's exam and statement that she is incompetent will be necessary. Your lawyer should be able to give you more details on the process.
Is your mom still even capable of understanding and signing legal papers? She should not sign anything until she meets with an attorney. It sounds like he is trying to divvy up everything to his advantage in a divorce.
If someone is mentally incompetent then any legal document they signed while incompetent is not valid (that includes a Power of Attorney, btw). I would be surprised if they could even get someone to notarize her signature if she's clearly not understanding what she's signing. Why haven't you taken steps to have her adjudicated legally incompetent so you (or a different appointed guardian) can make these decisions for her and protect her from financial predators?
Then someone, and not her husband since there will be conflict of interest during the divorce, needs to apply to the court for guardianship or conservatorship of her. Whomever is appointed will act on her behalf and she would no longer have legal ability to sign contracts or make legal decisions for herself.
I've tried to set it up a few times but my Mom wants me as her POA in full and my brother wants to be her Financial POA & me be medical. Which she doesn't agree with, but she also doesn't want to upset him by going over his head. So she keeps saying she can "convince him" Ergo.
