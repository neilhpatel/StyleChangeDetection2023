You're claiming there are factual problems with their case - they either lack evidence of speeding because of the device, or that they lack evidence the speed limit was actually 55. But a motion to dismiss is not the place to adjudicate factual questions; those are for the judge and jury to decide. The basis for a MTD is "assuming everything stated in the complaint is true, it still would not constitute an offense".
It may be a discovery violation not to provide you the requested material, but it's not the same thing as saying they don't have a case. If the other side is denying discovery, you need to file a motion to compel with the judge. That's who is the final arbiter on what is and is not relevant; not the prosecutor.
[Edit] I'll also note the standards for discovery only requires the prosecutor to hand over documents ".
The prosecutor restated their emphatic position that all of my discovery was not relevant and/or over broad and that I could "just ask the officer" at trial.
The Judge then went on to preamble his ruling by saying that is was absurd that the state does not think providing evidence of reduced speed is relevant and that its absurd the state thinks a defense can be prepared on the spot just by asking the officer.
He then talked about: well, in normal circumstances, he would set out a new date to give the state more time to prepare discovery, but instead is deciding to just dismiss the ticket.
Did you end up requesting a formal discovery process? Did the judge require any showing of your prior request (ie. Did you have to show them your emails? Or did they just go off the comments the prosecutor made about the requests being over broad?).
