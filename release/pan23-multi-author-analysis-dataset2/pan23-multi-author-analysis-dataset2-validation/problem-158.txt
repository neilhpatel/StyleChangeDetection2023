2. "Mechanic shop made me drive without breaks". Technically, you chose to drive without breaks. At the point you realized there was a problem, you should have pulled over. Instead, you chose to not only continue driving it home but back to the shop the next day. Thankfully, you weren't in an accident which you would have been 100% liable for since you were driving it knowing there was a problem with the breaks. I understand the cost and time associated with getting a tow but that's part of vehicle ownership. I'm also assuming the shop would have reimbursed you for the tow fee to make things right, like they did for the labor.
One more time for the people in the back: If you feel your brakes fading or failing, you should drive only as far as it takes to pull over safely. Anything else and you've leaped over the contributory negligence threshold.
You drove a car with defective brakes ON PURPOSE. You absolutely could and should have been 100% liable for any damage you caused.
I am not sure what the question is... they made a mistake, fixed the mistake, and made a reparation, in the form of a partial refund... what else are you trying to get out of it? What they did seems reasonable.
The mistake was resolved and repaired. You were offered and accepted some compensation for your time and trouble (free oil change and inspection) and a substantial discount on the other labor you received.
You could try to sue for lost wages or your time and trouble returning the car for repairs, but I don't think it's practical or that you have a high probability of success.
