LNG is still very high historically and that’s what europe is buying because the pipes are no longer flowing.
As a Canadian, I agree. We have for some reason decided to abandon our allies when they need us most. It is pathetic and makes me embarrassed to be Canadian.
If you're actually embarrassed, you should call or email your local MP to ask them to advocate to be better. Speaking from experience, they tend to care when constituents contact them rather than posting on reddit.
Canada is just as capitalist as everyone else. If Canada didn’t step up, there’s probably a reason behind it. Perhaps inability to ship what’s needed to europe effectively at good prices or its focus and proximity to one of its largest customers (USA)? Europe also has frequently verbally been against some of the energy sources Canada can supply even though they obviously still rely on it. Why invest the time and energy to connect yourself to an economy so far away that’s announced that it doesn’t want your services.
It’s not like they just sat out for no reason, nothing to be ashamed of it’s not in your power as a citizen.
