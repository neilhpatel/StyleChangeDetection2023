I feel like there is something your not telling us. What happened to the door? Why is the carpet “stretched” what ever that means.
Simply the carpet is bubbling up in the middle of the room slightly and they want to pay to get it stretched back out in the bedroom? And as far as the door goes, it's a smallish hole that's been there since I've moved in. The entire door has the same paint job as though the hole was there when it was painted and it was never fixed then.
Lesson...next time you rent a place go through and document all damage no matter how minor, list on paper sign date, preferably get the person walking through to sign, too...
If carpets are presumed to have a 7-year life, at WORST, you’d be responsible for about a fifth of the cost of replacement (17 months out of 84 months), but it sounds like ordinary wear and tear, and restretching sounds like plain old maintenance, and you’re not on the hook for that. Same for painting. Not sure what the door replacement is about. A new door seems like an overreaction when holes can be patched, and if you can show it was there before you moved in, it’s definitely not yours to pay for.
