Does your roommate have any authority to actually play landlord? (Does he own the property and/or has he been granted this authority from the actually landlord?).
If yes, Are you on a lease? If yes, and the lease is month-to-month, he must give you written notice to vacate and your lease end date and you are required to leave. If yes, and it's for a longer term, he is able to not renew you.
If no, are you on a lease with the actual landlord and is it a by-the-bedroom lease or joint-and-several lease with your roommate?
My guess is your roommate has no power, and is simply pretending to be the landlord. My guess is that you also don't have a legal agreement with the actual landlord, which can get you all in trouble (but is your best case scenario, b/c it will spell out your actual rights).
One more thing about occupancy: I don't know about your city, but in my city there is a maximum occupancy of THREE unrelated individuals occupying a rental property, so your whole setup may be illegal anyways. My bigger concern if you are over occupancy or in an illegal sublet, the real landlord can kick all of you to the curb.
He does have permission from the landlord to sublet. It is spelled out in his lease with the owner and my sublease with him.
I have a lease agreement with him that incorporates his lease with the landlord. It is currently month to month.
