- most places have explicit rules about what can/can't be a "bedroom"; this is more for fire code. A bedroom has to have TWO means of egress in many places, the door and a window. A storage room or a den with only a sealed window or no window would not satisfy this; the landlord would face municipal fines.
However, just because a room meets these requirements, the landlord is within their rights to NOT designate a room a "bedroom". And they are also likewise free to restrict tenancy on the basis of of bedrooms.
In most places, the landlord is free to elect not to renew a lease for any cause that doesn't stem from inclusion in a protected class (there are a few other reasons, but what you've described is not one of them).
Unless you're in a state that restricts when a landlord can choose to not renew, they can put any legal restriction on your renewal including limiting a 3 room apartment to 3 people. Even if you are in one of those states the landlord may still be able to do so.
In regards to this point you made "The apartment only has 3 bedrooms. (there are multiple extra rooms which could function as a bedroom- have doors/closet)", it's important to note that there are legal definitions in building codes for what constitutes a bedroom. Just because a room looks like it could house a person sleeping there it could be illegal for the landlord to rent that room as a bedroom.
A common reason why a landlord doesn't want to list with more bedrooms is to avoid applications from people with a crap load of roommates. That may apply with this situation as well. More roommates, usually more problems.
As family of 6 who needs 3-5 bedrooms is most likely going to be less problematic than 6 unrelated people splitting a place. The landlord may just not want the possibility of that headache.
That makes sense, but I don’t get why the landlord was fine with us have 4 people (and a dog, which came with the 4th roommate) for 2/3 of the year, but now refuses to have 4 people next year. Especially 4 people who are all good friends and respectful tenants. Unfortunately it seems there’s no legal recourse for this .
I am in Massachusetts. I just looked up the legal requirements for a bedroom and I am quite confident there are 2 rooms (not currently being used as a bedroom) that could legally qualify as bedrooms. I am not sure why the landlord doesn’t list these as bedrooms already, but I assume it is because she only wants 3 tenants for whatever reason. I am not sure about any restrictions on the landlord’s ability to renew.
