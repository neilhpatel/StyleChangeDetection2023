Right.. but they never arrested me - and if it was extreme dui it's an immediate revokation plus 30 day vehicle impound. None of this happened.. possibly why the case was disposed when the judge saw it was a reach at best. Seems like I'm going to have to argue with the MVD - who work surprisingly fast and efficient with the courts when they can make $ off someone.. but ignore things like a case dismissal otherwise.
Never saw a judge, never signed anything - only paper work I got was the tow ticket. Obviously this is why it was disposed immediately.. even the judge saw the DA was reaching.
I would check with an attorney and make sure that there is not a warrant out there for you. If the address on your license was incorrect that may be why you didnâ€™t hear anything. In my state you can go to jail for driving suspended so you may want you o get that straightened out too.
You can challenge these with an MVD judge appeal. Take your court dismissal. There is a time limit to appeal though, I think it's 90 days from date of suspension.
You may have absolutely no problem driving without a license, but the police might. You'll be arrested. Prepare for that, because your plates and your identity are linked, and these days automated scanners will pick that up without anyone having to call anything in.
I love the italicized "heavy" You've hit it on the head though I think - seems all financial. MVD, courts,insurance all work together real quick and fast when it's against you and they can make $.. when one of them fucks up tho it's all on the individual to make it right all around or else they'll get you once again for more $. So no matter what.. $$?
