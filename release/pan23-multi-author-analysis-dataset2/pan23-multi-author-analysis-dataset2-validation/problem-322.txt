Are you sure you were appointed as the Guardian Ad Litem, it’s usually an independent person who acts on behalf the the person who cannot act for themselves.
I’m sorry, but I’ve never heard of such an appointment. Guardian ad Litem appointment are never family members in my area. Guardians and conservators yes. But never GAL’s.
Yes. I’m honestly not sure why anyone felt they needed a guardian in the first place. I believe it’s possible that the previous GAL manipulated their way into being the GAL originally as they essentially robbed the protected party of everything in a very short period of time. That’s why they were removed. An attorney was temporarily appointed as the GAL after that and reached out to me to be the permanent guardian.
I think you need to speak with a local attorney. I don’t see any means by which you can be added to the deed. It would be a breach of your fiduciary duty.
Yes, I’m clear that Indiana code explicitly states that I have to petition the court. My question was, how do I petition the court, as in how do I get a hearing with the judge in this case. I’ll call the courthouse tomorrow, they should be able to tell me what to do.
I’ve already consulted with an attorney and I’m clear on the law in this situation. That part was never my question. Again, I wasn’t asking about the situation, but how one files a petition with the court. A stupid question, I forgot to ask the attorney when I consulted with him, and I don’t feel inclined to spend another $150 to have another consultation to ask him that.
The courthouse gave me the guidance and forms I need to file my petition. Not legal advice, because that’s not what I was seeking. As I made clear in my initial post and replies to you. I’m not sure why you keep ignoring that part.
