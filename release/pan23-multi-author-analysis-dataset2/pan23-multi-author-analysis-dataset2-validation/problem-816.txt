"First" questions are difficult to answer, because as soon as somebody posts an example, someone else immediately tries to find an earlier example. But let's break this question down a little.
There was never one single "Confederate flag." The Confederate States of America had several national flags, state flags, battle flags, and naval ensigns during its brief run; u/sowser discusses this in.
The first such flags that appeared in Washinon, D.C. were probably those that had been captured in battle and sent back to the War Department. An lists rebel flags captured and returned to the War Department, including numerous battle flags and "national colors." Other rebel flags would have become personal possessions, and some of them became accessions to Washinon, D.C.-based institutions like the Smithsonian. For example, the includes as one entry a battle flag captured in 1861.
After the defeat of the CSA in the American Civil War, public display of the various flags dropped off. The use of the flag (predominantly the version of the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia which we now think of as the "Confederate flag" today) was revived to support the revisionist Lost Cause mythology, at meetings of organizations like the United Confederate Veterans, Sons of Confederate Veterans, and United Daughters of the Confederacy. Units of the United States Army from Southern states sometimes incorporated the flag into their unit insignia, and there were any number of other ways that a "rebel" flag might be displayed, in public or private capacity, in Washinon, D.C. after the war in the early 20th century.
I have not been able to locate a specific instance when an actual captured rebel flag was displayed in the Capitol building, there is one flag which was certainly displayed in the Capitol building for a number of years: the state flag of Mississippi, which in 1895 was changed to incorporate the "Battle flag" into its upper quarter. This was ultimately removed from one tunnel in , although I am not sure how long it has been hanging there.
I wish I could provide a more definitive answer to when the first such flag was displayed at the capital. As a point of law, no flag other than the United States Flag is to be flown at the Capitol building, so no rebel flag has ever been flown at the Capitol, but it is possible that a captured rebel flag may have been displayed as early as the American Civil War (the dome was under construction from 1855 to 1866), or at any time thereafter, and there have certainly been variations on the Confederate flag on display, in the form of various state flags like that of Mississippi that incorporate elements from the Confederate flags, or unit patches from military units that do the same, etc. etc. in the early 20th century.
We actually have a pretty good case for the first to be displayed in government buildings and it's a bit earlier than you say.
The first Confederate flags flown in DC were done so by Confederate supporters in 1861 during the winter when secession happened. DC was generally pro-slavery and so leaned towards the Confederacy, especially at the start of the war. However, none of these people were acting in an official capacity. The first flags that fell into government hands were confiscated from such supporters by the Union Army as it cracked down on Confederate support within DC.
Elmer Ellsworth was famously shot for trying to remove a Confederate flag on May 24th, 1861, just as secession was happening. The Confederate supporter had been flying it as close to the White House as possible as a form of protest. Lincoln and the rest of the Cabinet had repeatedly seen it. When Ellsworth came to remove it, the Confederate supporter shot him and tried to shoot the soldier with him. He hit Ellsworth but missed the private. The private subsequently killed him in a struggle.
Because he was one of the first officers to die and a staunch Unionist, he became a bit of a martyr. The flag became a symbol to the Union cause. It was presented to Lincoln in the White House. Ellsworth laid in state in the East Wing and the flag was displayed during that. It was not, as you rightly say, flown which implies it was treated as a flag. Instead it was displayed to show what Ellsworth died for and to make the connection between his death and the newly forming Confederacy clear. The flag was later displayed in the Capitol Building as well, during which people explicitly noted it was the first time such a flag had been on the grounds.
Of course, none of these people were doing it to honor the symbol. They were honoring Ellsworth who was staunchly anti-Confederate. The flag itself was later torn up and pieces of it given to various Unionists.
But it was still in the process of being organized, and a week after Ellsworth was killed would fall under the command of the already famous PGT Beauregard who would work to form a cohesive command out of the disparate and new forces.
No it was a version of the 1st Confederate National Flag so far as I have seen, the Army of Northern Virginia, or more properly its antecedent, Confederate Army of the Potomac had been formed in April to command the Virginia units and later reinforcements sent to Northern Virginia.
An effort to make it the actual national flag failed in 1861, Miles had chaired the legislative committee in 1861 that adopted the "Stars and Bars" but never gave up on his own preferred design. And here was his chance to get it in use again.
