Having a gun in your house and greeting people at the door with it in hand is not illegal in itself. I don't recommend doing it, but it's not illegal. In fact open/concealed carry is legal in Indiana with a license. He's in/on his property and he has the right to protect it. Again, not the way I would handle the situation, but that's just me.
Well, seems as though the consensus is that although I also would not handle it this way, even being that I also have an indiana permit, seems everyone agrees its a bad way to handle it but it's not illegal.
To my understanding, the definition of assault is giving someone reasonable cause to believe they are in immenent danger of bodily harm.
Devil's advocate: your neighbor heard someone banging on his door and yelling at 11:30 at night, not expecting company, and took precautions to protect himself.
I also understand this circumstance, but I saw about an inch of water in his apartment. It'd be reasonable to believe the man banging on your door is probably related to the issue.
It sounds reasonable to you, a person who wasn't also dealing with waking up to a flooded apartment.
I'm just pointing out that your neighbor's reaction seemed fairly reasonable, and it is also reasonable for his reaction to be different than yours might have been in a similar situation.
