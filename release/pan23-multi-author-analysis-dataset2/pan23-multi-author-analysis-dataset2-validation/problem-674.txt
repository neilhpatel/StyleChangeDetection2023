I do greatly appreciate that, and yes she would be a woman. I'm particularly appreciative of the the novel Perfume that you've referenced. I think that will be a very good reference source for me, though the subject matter I have in mind is not quite as dark as the novel! Thank you again.
[I am going to provide an answer that is specific to France. Much of this information will hold true for other Western European countries, but be aware that there is always a degree of cultural specificity. If you’d like to compare the situation in France to elsewhere, I suggest consulting a book like Holly Dugan’s The Ephemeral History of Perfume: Scent and Sense in Early Modern England, published by The Johns Hopkins University Press in 2011.].
Among these rules were restrictions on who could be a member. The status of women in early modern France is hotly debated, but they were generally excluded from achieving the rank of master with the exception of a few guilds devoted to the production of textiles. Widows, wives, and daughters of guild members did generally retain some rights and were sometimes able to continue operating an enterprise in the case of the death or absence of the master guildsman. This continued to be true in France until after the Revolution of 1789.

This is a fascinating biography of Jean-Louis Fargeon, son of a Montpellier apothecary and maître gantier-parfumeur to the French court. There is a ton of information in here about the early modern perfume trade in France, the training of a perfumer, and the rivalry between apothecaries, distillers, and perfumers.
There is definitely a historical precedent for a distiller of rose oil and water also producing flavored drinks. Before the modern era, there was significant overlap in the use of distillation to produce both spirits and botanical extracts for use alone or together in alchemy, medicine and perfumery. A skilled distiller with an alembic could produce pure alcohol and a variety of botanical extracts. Flowers and aerial parts might be distilled when in season locally, while more exotic materials like roots, musks and resins would be processed once imported from elsewhere. The rest of the year might have been devoted to experimentation in the production of compounded treatments for skin, hair, and body and infused liqueurs with therapeutic benefits.
Distilling in medieval Europe expanded quickly following the introduction of the required technical knowledge from the Muslim world around the 11th century. An alembic is recorded in an inventory of the Palais des papes in Avignon in the year 1348, and there is evidence a guild of distillers was established in Toulouse in southwestern France by the year 1411. Alcohol, or aqua ardens, was first produced as a medicine and a solvent, only later becoming the base for drinks like brandy and whiskey. The distilling of botanical material, such as the petals of the Damask rose, soon followed, leading to the creation of numerous highly-scented medicines, perfumes, foods, and drinks that utilized plant essences.
From the sixteenth to the middle of the eighteenth century, the center of botanical extraction in France was Montpellier (Grasse, the capital of the global perfume industry today, only rose to prominence later after shifting focus from the tanning and scenting of leather). Montpellier was renowned for its school of medicine and the high quality of its rosemary—an essential ingredient in the popular eau de la Reine d’Hongrie, an early alcohol-based perfume and therapeutic cure-all. Products produced in Montpellier through distillation were highly sought throughout Europe, leading to the creation of a robust international trade.
There were a number of professions involved in the sale of alcohol and floral oils and waters, including: apothicaires, who produced medications as well as perfumed products for topical use; distillateurs and liquoristes, who primarily produced alcoholic drinks; gantiers-parfumeurs, who created liquid perfumes, powders, and scented products of all sorts; and barbiers-perruquiers-baigneurs-étuvistes, who produced scented soaps and hair products. All commercial trade in this period was highly regulated by the guild system. The guilds provided a system for training new members, promoting their products, and protecting their reputations through strict regulations.
