No, we have the the leeway to think "we should suffer minor economic hardship to transition to renewables because it will be better for everyone in the long run".
Ethiopia does not have any leeway to think about anything other than "we need to feed and support our population because they're starving and getting massacred" they cannot afford to save the world for the rest of us. The fortunate many of us have to stop using fossil fuels, and until we do, it's total hypocrisy to expect an even poorer country that is suffering to not try to produce the oil that we pay for.
