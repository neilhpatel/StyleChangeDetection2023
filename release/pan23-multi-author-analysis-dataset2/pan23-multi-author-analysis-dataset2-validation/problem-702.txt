You should be aware that the accidental recipient is doing the right thing - Venmo scams are very common, so the advice to people who receive accidental funds is always, "Do nothing, don't touch it, don't return it, let the sender's bank or Venmo figure it out.".
It sounds like you think this person might be guilty of a crime or fraud - stated simply, they aren't. You should not attempt to contact this person outside of the Venmo platform, intimidate them, or harm them in any way - to do so could be interpreted as harassment or worse. It's really not their fault here and they are doing the right thing!
In this case it was a genuine mistake, but the recipient has no way of knowing that, so they must act as if they are the intended victim of a scam.
This advice is given because the "accidentally sent" funds are often stolen or fraudulent, and if the receiver returns them all of a sudden THEY become responsible for the stolen/fraudulent transaction.
I say it all the time wherever I go, venmo, cashapp, and zelle do not have the same consumer protections as paypal and explicitly state in their TOS that they're only for private transactions, not business transactions.
