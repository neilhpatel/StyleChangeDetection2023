Sure, but they could just sue if the debt is valid, and the link you posted even explains why sometimes, it's not a great idea unless it's particularly pervasive.
The FDCPA gives you the right to request (both via phone and in the mail) that the collector stop calling you. Here's an article about it:
Okay. Mispronouncing your name does not erase the validity of the debt, if it is valid. You can request debt validation, but that may be redundant since you know you owe the debt.
Yeah, do you owe money?? There's a scam where it's basically a cold call. They have minimal info to go off of. But what they want is as much info as possible, and they record it, so they can piece it together and use your voice to access accounts or create new ones, open cards and lines of credit. Never talk to them. Never say "yes" or "no" or pronounce your name properly. And NEVER give your ss number out. If they say you owe money, contact the company"business's united States call center/representative and talk to them directly.
