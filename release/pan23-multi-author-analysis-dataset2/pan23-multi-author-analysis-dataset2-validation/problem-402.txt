Yes, it is possible that there could be criminal charges. Kidnapping someone across state lines would be a federal crime, and there is no federal statute of limitations on it. That means the government can bring those charges no matter how many years have passed since the crime.
If you ask will there be charges, that's a different question. That's more complicated, and probably no one can answer it except the federal prosecutor who gets the case.
Yes, there is a chance she will spend the rest of her life in jail. There is also a chance that the trial will reveal some very hard to process facts about your bio parents. Once the process is started you may not be able to end it even if you change your mind so I would look at all the info you can with open eyes before you make a decision.
If that were the case, you would think that they would have stayed in CA and done things legally instead of running off with us and hidden us away like they did. They knew they were wrong and lived in constant fear that they would be found.
I doubt there would be anything that comes to light about my bio mother. She was in a bad spot, yes. Her and my father had split and he was in jail at the time. She thought they were helping her by taking us for a couple of weeks while she found employment and a place to live. I have spoken to over twenty family members on both sides and they all tell me the same story. There has not been one change. Everyone agrees that she was capable and not abusive. My aunt cannot have children of her own and just decided that she wanted us and that was that.
According to both sides of the families, there was nothing. We had always been in the care of our mother and my aunt has lied about the state being involved. Had they been, I think the people closest to this situation would have known.
