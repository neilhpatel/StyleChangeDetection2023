Did it break over his head, was he injured, bleeding? If it were me, I wouldn't contact the police, but if I did, I without do it without a criminal defense attorney at my side. That's just me. I'm not you and not your attorney. What I would tell you is that if the police contact you about it, they may say they just want to hear your side of the story. Which you want to tell, naturally. That would be a big mistake. If they want to talk, it means they want to arrest, but they don't have enough information to arrest. So don't admit you were there, or hit anyone, even if you had a reason. You could tell an hourlong story and the officer could testify, "OP confessed to me that they were in the bathroom and that they hit the victim with a beer bottle" and leave the rest out. If the police want to talk to you, politely decline, and call an attorney.
You'd call the police if you were interested in having this man charged with assault. If you already feel like the situation is handled to your liking, I wouldn't contact the police.
I wouldn't talk with the police without a lawyer regardless. While your actions were legal based on your account, there's always a danger that the police won't see it that way.
What could be easy and helpful for the future would be for all of your friends to write to independently write down their recollection of the event.
