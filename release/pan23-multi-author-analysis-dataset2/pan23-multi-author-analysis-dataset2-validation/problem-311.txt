Are you in the United State? This doesn’t sound like wrongful termination, because in the United States you can be fired for just about any reason.
Absent a union agreement or some sort of contact stating you can only be fired for cause (which are super rare), you are an at will employee. At will means you can be fired or disciplined for any reason (including a bad or inaccurate one) or no reason at all so long as the reason isn’t membership in a protected class or engaging in some protected activities. The federally protected classes are race, color, national origin, sex (which includes sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, religion, pregnancy, veteran status and age (which is 40+). Some states add other categories. The federally protected activities are some protected collective bargaining activities, filing wage claims, filing EEOC claims, filing sexual harassment reports, filing reports with OSHA, and use of protected leave such as FMLA. Again, some states add extra protections (such as protections for use of sick leave which doesn’t qualify for FMLA).
So, this doesn’t sound like wrongful termination, but it may be a bad faith withholding of your bonus, which you could then sue for that. I would recommend talking to an employment law attorney in your state.
Typically it’s sufficient to say “You are fired Yes, you Box. your stuff, out the front door, parking lot, car, goodbye!”.
Thank you. Yes, I’m in Oregon, at-will. However there are very clear procedures for termination. I was not on a corrective action plan or any type of verbal or written warning either.
