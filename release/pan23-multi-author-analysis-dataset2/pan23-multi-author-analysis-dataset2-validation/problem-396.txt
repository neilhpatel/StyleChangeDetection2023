Unless there is a binding arbitration clause, check the max amount you can sue for in small claims. Usually it's 5-10 k.
Thanks for the response. I was hoping I was in the realm of reasonability to stop work if I’m not getting paid. It helps that my supervisor supports me in that. As for small claims I’m just wondering whether a certain amount of time has to pass for me to push for not only what I’m owed, but the time I’ve spent now moving money around and contacting them repeatedly to pay me.
Also you stopping work for non payment is pretty reasonable. I don't think they're gonna go.aftwr you on that. People stop work for that reason all the time.
You aren't being paid through the standard employee payroll because you are listed as a business not an employee.
And I’ll be a damn side more ethical and prudent when I can afford to hire people myself… thus underscoring my longstanding love and support for this sub. Absolutely amazing that I have to figure out creative ways to get paid for professional work.
