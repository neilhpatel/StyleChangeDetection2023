When the Porsche badge (a registered trademark) is the entirety of the picture, you are abusing their IP for financial gain.
Now, in a shot of that same Porsche driving through the woods, the logo itself is incidental to the subject of the picture and is not a trademark infringement.
Okay that makes more sense, so its really more about the branding and logo rather than the product itself. I am still learning what I can and can't do and I don't want to cross any lines but I want to understand where they are and why they are there.
Well I was forced to stop already so I did, but I am trying to find out exactly why and how to proceed in the future. Does this mean ANY photo I take of ANY car can't be sold without explicit permission from the manufacturer?
Copyright laws allow for "fair use" which has 4 stipulations to classify the use of a copyrighted work as legal .
However, trademarked items such as corp. logos do not have the same options. If the logo was small in comparison to the overall size of the piece (ie your photo included the entire vehicle or it was on a sign in the background of a city skyline) you'd be more likely to not have them pursue the issue.
