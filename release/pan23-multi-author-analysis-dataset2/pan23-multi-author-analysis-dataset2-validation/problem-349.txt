I live in germany for 15 years now. If i give up my homeland passport I'm very likely to be barred from entry, i'm not allowed to vote in my homeland because i don't live there i'm not allowed to vote in the germany because i don't have citizenship.
I'm more than fine with citizenship for children born here when the parents actually live here. Literally no argument from me against that. But dual citizenship? Nah, that's fucked up. You either live here or you don't and if you don't, you don't deserve the rights that come with a citizenship, like voting for example, and you don't deserve the additional rights of other countries if you live here and the same is obviously true the other way around.
Edit: apparently (judging by the downvotes) people think they should have the right to vote in countries they don't live in. Entitled, is the word that springs to mind.
And them denying you entrance is a problem of this country how exactly? Even if you have German citizenship, is Germany denying you to leave? No. Is Germany denying you from visiting your homeland specifically? No. Does Germany deny entrance to citizens from your home country? You are in Germany, so I assume that's also a "no". So why you think Germany is responsible for you not being able to visit your family or them visiting you? Its not, the other country is responsible for that. You barking up the wrong tree here.
And I'm not saying you shouldn't have citizenship. From my pov: if you are willed to integrate, learn the language, pay taxes, try to do things for the population of the country (labour, resources, knowledge,...), then you can have citizenship. I'm not saying you can't get in or can't get citizenship. I'm saying you can't pick this from this country, that from that country. Learn the consequences of the options and pick your choice.
Well, you live here, what do you expect? Living tax free in another country? That ain't how it works. You pay the taxes of the country you live in FOR the country you live in. That's universal, worldwide.
