No you should not ignore the landlord. You are both 100% responsible for the full rent amount. There is no your share and his share. If you had separate leases then you would not be responsible. Your landlord doesn't have to remind you to pay, you already agreed to pay when you signed the lease. If you do not pay your credit can be severely damaged and you could be sued and it would be an easy case for them to win. What you should do to protect your credit is pay the rent you owe then look into suing your former roommate.
A guarantor for a rental takes on the financial responsibility of the apartment, but is not entitled to use the apartment, according to Goldberg. A guarantor becomes responsible for paying the rent in the event the tenant or tenants cannot pay.
You and the guarantor are both liable. You promised to pay, they promised to pay. This is known as joint and several liability. Being financially unable to pay a debt has nothing to do with liability for the debt.
Are you certain collection action can be taken against anyone other than the guarantor in that situation? From what I've read the most they can do to a tenant in a situation where the guarantor is unable to pay is evict the tenant.
Yes you can be sued for all monies owed under the lease that's what I've been trying to explain. You signed this lease agreeing to pay all the money owed under the lease. The fact that there is a guarantor doesn't diminish your liability. There is no rule they have to go after the guarantor instead of you.
