Are generators banned? You could talk to your doctor about a note for an accommodation under the ADA, but everyone has an issue with food and phones for emergencies. The practical advice is to get a hand-crank device to charge your phones, or to get backup batteries. A UPS could charge you phone for days. And for walking around, get a flashlight, even one you wear. There are many ways to maneuver safely during a power outage, you just need batteries and basic equipment.
Our power just got restored so there’s some good news but I’m not sure if we’re in the right since we didn’t request or reach out to the HOA first. We were more worried about our safety than what the HOA thought so we didn’t even consider going through them as they are slow and hard to deal with.
Going to the HOA to give them a heads up and to explain the need as it relates to disability is an important first step. I would have this conversation with them now, just in case the power outage happens again. This "modification" to HOA policy is quite common for those that have to keep medications at a certain temperature. The HOA will be concerned with the noise level and carbon monoxide output from the generator, so be prepared to address that.
