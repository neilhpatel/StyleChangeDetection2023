They told you that with the assumption you were covered under the recall. All warranty/ recall work doesn’t come with a guarantee of a rental/ loaner, it’s up to the company and it’s policies.
When you picked up the rental did you agree to pay for it and sign something under the assumption it was just minor paperwork to get the rental?
Because i’m only 18 they wouldn’t let me pick up the rental car so my dad had to do it. He doesn’t really like to talk to me so when i asked him about if they said anything to him he just said no and said i should just be happy i had my rental since he had to go out of his way to get it. I was told on the phone that I was approved for a week with the rental but they’ve had my car over 2 months now so i just don’t understand how I was only approved for one week .
If they only approved 1 week that’s all you get and not uncommon in this scenario. Unlimited rentals are rare. As I said it’s not a requirement they must give you a car while it’s being fixed.
You can argue with dad about not notifying you and through signing for it probably has some responsibility to the dealer. There’s always paperwork with details that it’s on you to read.
Yeah i understand i just wish they wouldn’t have made me feel like i was being taken. care of because i wouldn’t have even brought it to the dealership if i knew about this headache. i could’ve just sold the car or had a friend fix it for me.
Just to be clear, you never took the car in for the recall before it died? And you claim it has no oil? There's no software update that will stop an engine from running out of oil so its unclear if Kia would cover that damage. Maybe they misunderstood the cause and now don't believe they are at fault. Have you looked into your insurance to see if you are covered for rentals? That may help with that cost.
