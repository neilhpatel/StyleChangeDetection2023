I live in Ohio, I am 17M (18 in July). My sad excuse for a father said I wouldnâ€™t be living there (his house) after my birthday which is in like 3 months. I wanted to know how long the process would take for me to live full time at my moms house.
Custody battles would take much longer than three months in almost all cases, but again, we have no possible way of knowing how fast the court system will move at any given time.
Longer than three months. If you are that close to being an adult, why not just move on with your mom. No one (police) are going to force you to go back to your dad when you are spitting distance from making your own decisions in life.
When you turn 18, you can live wherever you want anyway. You'd be much better off just toughing it out for a few more weeks.
Not really. You are literally an adult in a very short time. Unless you are in danger, police are not going to force you back to your dad's where you can legally walk right back out again anyway.
Have you ever just stayed at your moms instead of going back to your dad's? If yes, what does your dad do? Is it okay with your mom for you to stay there full time?
