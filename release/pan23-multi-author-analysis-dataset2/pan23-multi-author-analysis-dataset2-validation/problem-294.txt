He's a subtenant, the leaseholders would have to evict him. If your mother is on the lease and won't agree to that, it's not happening.
If your mother is the one with the lease and she is allowing him to stay there, that's all there is to it. He can live there unless something illegal like domestic violence takes place. You have no ability to evict him; only the landlord can do that.
The adult siblings are free to move out of the home if they don't like the living conditions. Adolescents in the home can report any abuse to CPS (if any occurs), but otherwise will just have to tolerate him until they turn 18 and move out.
IANAL, but I've been through a similar situation with an old roommate. Since your mother is on the lease along with your two adult siblings, the police are correct in that she is allowed guests, however this is where you need to check your lease. Most will have a clause regarding overnight guests. For example, guests might be limited to a two week overnight stay before it becomes a violation. Since your older siblings are all on the lease, there is probably a background screening requirement for all adults living in the unit. Moving in an unscreened adult would likely be a lease violation. If your lease contains anything like this you could use it to your advantage if you don't mind involving your landlords. Keep detailed records of any violent behavior and absolutely call the police again if he becomes abusive. They'll get him out of they can see things like the bruises and bloody mouth.
