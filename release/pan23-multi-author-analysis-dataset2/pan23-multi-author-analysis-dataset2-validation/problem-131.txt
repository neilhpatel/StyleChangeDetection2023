The landlord’s homeowner’s insurance should most definitely cover temporary emergency housing. Contact your local Red Cross as well. Your property should be covered by the other tenant’s policy if they have one, if not, the landlord’s.
Auctualy in most cases the landlords policy explicitly excludes any benefits for tenants (at least here in California). renters insurance is about 20 a month (depending on coverage) and very much worth it.
I would find it almost impossible to imagine that a policy can exclude emergency housing for a tenant who was displaced due to the negligence of another tenant. There are many factors at play here. Was smoking allowed? Did the landlord know the other tenant smoked? Where the smoke alarms working?
It's has to do with insuring things you don't own. My insurance guy explained it to me a few years back. Now there may be coverage that includes lodging for displaced tenants but that is not a standard part of the home owners policy. Remember the goal of the home owners policy is first to protect from liability, second to replace damaged / stolen parts of the property. To cover emergency lodging for a tenant would likely need some other type of business insurance.
The OP should request the contact information for the landlord’s homeowner’s policy right away and determine what coverage is valuable.
