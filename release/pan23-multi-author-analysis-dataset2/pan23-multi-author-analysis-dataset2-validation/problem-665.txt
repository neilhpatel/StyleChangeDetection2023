The short answer to your first question is yes, Americans did volunteer to serve with foreign militaries in the years prior to the US formally entering the First World War.
A number of Americans (estimated to be as high as 35,000) also crossed the border and enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (3). The CEF actually tried to raise at least two battalions specifically for American volunteers in 1915/1916 (97th and 237th Battalions, CEF). The 97th was actually called the American legion, but the name was dropped and the battalion eventually absorbed into other units after the American Government objected over fears it could compromise their neutrality (4). See source (5) below for an example of a recruiting poster for the 237th Battalion CEF held by the Library of Congress.
One example of an American serving with the CEF is that of Irwin Hart. Hart was born in Nebraska, and enlisted in the 97th Battalion CEF mentioned above in 1916 in Windsor, Ontario. After the 97th was disbanded, he was eventually posted to the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, one of the most famous infantry regiments of the Canadian Army. He was killed in action at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917. His Service Record has been digitized and is available for viewing on Library and Archives Canada's website:
Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, saw advantages in allowing American volunteers to go to Canada or England to enlist:
I don't know enough about Americans serving in the British and French Armies to answer that part of your question. Keep in mind that for your average American, the easiest way to get into the fight would've been to do what Private Hart did and cross the border to join the Canadian Military. This saved them from having to make their own way across the Atlantic.
How they served varied a bit. One the most famous examples is the "Lafayette Escadrille", a French fighter squadron composed of American Volunteers led by French Air Service Officers (1). The squadron was active until 1918, so it would seem many of the men chose to remain in French service rather than transfer to the AEF once the US joined the war. American volunteers also served with the British Royal Flying Corps, with a number of them enlisting even after the US formally entered the conflict (2).
As for what happened to them when the US joined the war, I'm also not sure. I couldn't find much on it when researching for this answer, so hopefully someone more knowledgeable can answer it for you.
