The long and the short of it is, though modern scholars have multiple theories about the origin of the taboo (I briefly list some of them), no one knows for sure why this taboo was adopted by the ancient Israelites (and from there, by Muslims and other groups).
Judging based on pig bones, the taboo on pigs as polluting seems to emerge in the Iron Age as the Israelites were emerging as a separate people (see the book Purity and Monotheism, for example). This is likely earlier than, I learned this year, than the kosher taboo on certain kinds emerged or at least become widespread— argues that likely this practice was widely adopted only in the Second Temple period. The pig taboo may be the only food taboo that was novel to the region that emerged in the Iron Age with the rise of Judaism/Israelite cultic practice (the other food taboos besides pig and certain kinds of fish don’t seem to change much how the people in the area were already eating), but we will never know exactly why it was adopted.
I had always assumed there were economic motives in that Leviticus (I think) passage which bans pork, shellfish, homosexuality and adorning oneself with gold. If the shellfish ban was meant to promote the fishing industry, perhaps the pork ban was meant to promote the sheep industry, the ban on gold was to keep it in circulation as currency, and the ban on homosexuality was simply meant to increase the population. These are all just personal theories of mine.
The emphasis is on that these acts are polluting, not that not doing them is beneficial. They are, perhaps, mixing that which should not be mixed—that is, if we take for granted that Mary Douglas is right in assuming that there is a single elemental logic undergirding the vast majority of the Torah laws, I think the one argument that is the strongest is that they are focused on dividing what must be divided. Our God and their gods, the living and the dead, milk and meat, linen and wool garments, etc etc.
One of the most common logics of sacred stories (“myths”) is the logic of “as above so below”. And if you start there, God is constantly dividing: light from darkness, waters above from water below, woman from man, etc. This I think we are see constantly in the logic of Jewish law codes—mixing two (even two good things, like milk and meat or linen and wool in one garment) is bad, and gives uncleanlness/impurity.
But I think Douglas struggles when she tries to connect it specifically to the pork taboo. It’s been a while since I read her, but she argues that fundamental the creatures that don’t fit into neat categories are labeled unclean/taboo. These creatures, by not fitting into meat categories, in their essence mix that which should not be mixed. They have cloven hooves but don’t chew their cud. For me, this specific part of Douglas’s theory, the part applying it to specific animals, is the weakest part. It could easily be some other explanation, one of the many things listed above, but which I don’t think we’ll ever know.
