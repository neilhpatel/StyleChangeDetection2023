Open carrying a pistol anywhere aside the range or your own private property was illegal and high unusual until very recently in many jurisdictions.
They had a giant banner at CPAC that said, "We are all domestic terrorists," and no one batted an eye. I would say that proclamations of being hypocrites is a significant step below that.
The places where I have experienced some of the strictest rules about carrying guns are gun shows. You cannot carry guns at the gun show. The security guards were more attentive and serious than at my local court house.
Well, open carrying a long gun is not as illegal or restricted as it is to open carry a pistol for a period of time. So walking around with a rifle slung across your back or shoulder would not be illegal or out of the ordinary in many jurisdictions.
