Due to the overreach on the initial layoffs, current Twitter employees are in a pretty empowered position right now. Twitter is sinking and Elon removed the majority of the bilge pumps along with most people who know how to run the boat. He needs every hand on deck and canâ€™t afford to fire people giving 80% and telling him to fuck off from his return to the office edict. Curious to see how many return.
I used to be in Pharmacy. Then I did a research project about their markups, especially in the US I was appalled.
So if a medical center has any that are partially used, that vial that retails for hundreds is thrown out. They aren't allowed to donate them a week before either.
Open vials are supposed to be discarded after 30 days. Vitamin B injections, etc are the same because they do not have preservatives. They can have bacteria or fungus on top of a reduced efficacy which can be dangerous especially if its something important like insulin.
It costs about 15-35 cents to make a mL of insulin depending on type. It's sometimes sold for hundreds per vial. Drug companies REQUIRE open vials to be thrown out after 30 days.
The Canadian team who isolated and purified insulin sold the patent on how to do so for $1 to make sure that it was available to everyone..
Medical waste is ridiculous, and definitely happens more in the US bc laws have been altered in favor of the for profit healthcare system.
Tanking 2 of his businesses, costing untold billions, alienating all the liberals in his life, having his newfound political party fumble an important election, having the government look into his ties with Russia. Being a giant laughingstock.
