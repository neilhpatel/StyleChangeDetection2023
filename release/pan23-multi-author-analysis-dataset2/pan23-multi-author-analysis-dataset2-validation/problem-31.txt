Bonus: When a windmill or solar panel is struck down by war, human error, or a natural disaster, it simply stops working.
When a nuclear power plant experiences catastrophic failure due to war, human error, or natural disaster, it can make an entire region uninhabitable.
Yes, and recognizing those vulnerabilities to create new local manufacturing jobs for solar and wind.
Speaking of vulnerabilities, it is also worth noting: In 2021, the USA imported 14 percent of its enriched uranium power plant fuel from Russia.
And when a free Russian people rises from the ashes, maybe a new Marshall plan wins the day for them too. A strong Russia with independent institutions and free people is the best way forward. Will corruption take one or two or three generations to stamp out?
Yes, they are. You can scale up massive amounts of decentralized and locally controlled wind and solar, equivalent to more than the output of a nuclear power plant, in far less than the 15 years it takes to get a corporate controlled centralized nuclear power plant up and running, at a fraction of the cost.
If China becomes the almost unique outlet for Russian hydrocarbons, and the almost unique supplier of Russian technology and manufactured products, Russia will be vassalized de facto, not sure they have gained in the exchange.
