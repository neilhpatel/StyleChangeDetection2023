You can talk to another attorney and get a 'second opinion' on your case. And it's more important to listen to medical advice than legal advice.
If you speak with a medical professional and the medical professional recommends that you try PT before having surgery, then it absolutely "increases the value" of your PI case. I think your lawyer is just saying that the 150k surgery will do so a lot faster and up to a bigger number.
I don’t like how my requests to get PT have been dismissed and the insistence is that it won’t add value. I know surgery or 2 or 3 or 4 epidurals is better for them, but is it better for me? I’ve been w this lawyer for one year and in some things they’ve been really good. But when it’s come to asking about PT, they’ve dismissed it. Ironically, one doctors office I was visiting was going to have my do PT but they were a mess, always changing days and times of appointments on me so I dropped them.
In the most common formulas to calculate the value of a personal injury case, things are setup to create a multiplier based on how you were effected, the process to recover, how lenhy that process is/was, and any and all medical treatments necessary to arrive to this point in time.
If the accident was nothing major, and the doctor is recommending and providing reasonable treatment and you are comfortable with said treatment plan, why do you need an attorney? I am a workers compensation claims adjuster, and I have seen many shifty doctors that are in cahoots with shifty lawyers who will recommend and provide unnecessary treatment and procedures so that the attorney can increase the dollar amount of the case. Once the amount has been increased, so does the attorney’s fees. Obviously not all attorneys act this way, but there are a lot of ambulance chasers who are only looking to line their pockets. Your attorney is not a doctor. You are the one who decides what treatment you receive, and if you are not comfortable, do not proceed. It is your body and you have the right to say no. Go get a second medical opinion from an independent doctor - not one your attorney knows - about your injuries and possible treatments. You have the right to choose which physician provides your care. The attorney will likely drop your case because there’s no money it in for him, so there’s that.
I got an attorney because even tho the accident itself wasn’t anything major, waking up with tingling all over my body wasn’t something I had before. Plus, dealing with the at fault party insurance was getting difficult and things changed when I hired a lawyer. I went 6-7 weeks before hiring one, believing my symptoms would go away.
Edit: one thing that has frustrated me is the many times the case manager has said that chiropractor and PT doesn’t add value to my case.
You are the ultimate decision maker when it comes to your treatment whether your lawyer likes it or not. Having said that, there may be consequences to those decisions. They could affect your case. Your lawyer may no longer think your case is worth the effort to bring. That's a decision you have to make.
Thanks for your response. The case manager has told me from the beginning that I choose my treatment. So this is what I want. I did the facet injections because I was ok with it being a one and done procedure. But talk of additional procedures or even surgery isn’t what I want. I just want my case settled so I can move on. I have a work related injury from three years ago and that’s the side of my back acting up, not coincidentally after loading my ladder into my truck. It’s just really painful right now and I don’t know if it’s related to my accident or that injury or both.
