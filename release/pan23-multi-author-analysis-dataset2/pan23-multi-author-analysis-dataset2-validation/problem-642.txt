Younger generations were shown to be a powerful force in the midterms, enough that the far right immediately began rhetoric about raising the voting age to keep Gen Z out. I suspect a Blue Wave in 2024 and this would only help it grow.

Yup, totally expected once the case got tied up in court. Willing to bet this gets punted for another two years as well and becomes a problem for the next president.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
