"I would like to have this conversation over phone. At this time if you do not voluntarily resign your position we will be terminating your employment effective immediately. Again, please make your decision by end of day today. Thank you".
Like I mention, she was still fine from a lenh of service standpoint. If she meets the other criteria, then she was eligible.
If she never asks why, and she sues them, then they are likely to huddle with a lawyer and try to come up with lawful reason, like poor work performance, etc. She should try to get them to say now if there's a reason and what it is.
She shouldn't resign. If they fire her she has a stronger claim for unemployment insurance and maybe for FMLA interference (if she's eligible) and disability discrimination.
She should ask why they are asking her to resign and why they will terminate her employment if she doesn't. It would be good if she can pin them down to the reason. Or even if they say "There is no reason" that's fine because it's generally a bad and unbelievable answer.
Either way, she should certainly get everything in writing, including the reason they are requesting that she resign.
You can have up to a 7 year break in service before your previous employment history with that company stops counting.
Her employer could argue that the frequency of her seizures (everyday) poses an undue hardship on their ability to conduct business, especially since her doctor has instructed her to call out of work on days she’s having seizures. It sounds like she is being termed because she hasn’t been able to work consistently, not because she needs surgery.
If they knew she needed leave for a medical reason, she was protected and could have filed retroactively.
"You're a liability you could get injured" is not a lawful reason to fire a disabled or sick person. They would have to conclude that she is incapable of performing the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation.
