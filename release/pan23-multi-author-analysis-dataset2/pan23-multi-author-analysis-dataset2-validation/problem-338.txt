You'll want an attorney in your current state. Custody issues belong to the state that the child has live in for at least six months. You'll want a lawyer who handles divorce and family law, but that's a pretty typical combination. Seriously consider getting one who handles cases in which domestic violence is a concern. When you're considering lawyers you can ask about the trust/asset issues. They may be able to handle those issues or direct you to a colleague who can.
You should start by contacting an attorney who's barred in NC, the state that has jurisdiction. Your county's may offer legal services, safety planning and other resources. They may also recommend that you petition for a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO). If the attorney that you choose to represent you doesn't handle trusts, they should be able to refer you to someone who can.
thehotline.org can help you with making an exit plan and finding local resources to assist, including lawyers experienced with helping those escaping domestic violence.
You probably will want to talk to a trusts & estates lawyer and set up a trust for your son in case you die while he is still a child. That way, you can pick a trustee (possibly a lawyer, possibly just someone you trust) to manage your son's assets for his benefit. If you don't do that, and your son inherits your assets, the father may be able to get legal access to those funds, which you don't want. You can also name someone to be a guardian - basically, someone who would have legal custody of your son - but there would be no guarantee that the father couldn't get custody rather than the guardian, as long as he still has some level of parental rights. This can wait a bit, though; worry about the custody issue first.
You should also begin to temper your expectations. I know you said that you don't want a legal battle but most abusers won't let go of those within their control without a fight. Unless your child's father's emotional abuse towards your son is so severe as to make him unfit, he'll be awarded some sort of custody or visitation which may include trips to the home state and overnights.
1: You need to deal with this in the state you live in now, and you need to deal with it before you leave.
2: If he's abusive towards you, you should be able to get a protection order against him. Then if he comes near you or contacts you, he can be arrested. It may or may not be possible for you to avoid disclosing your out of state address in court, that's a question for your lawyer.
3: I assume you aren't married to this guy, is that right? If the house is only yours you don't need to worry - he has no legal claim to your house. You can go through your assets (regular bank accounts, retirement accounts, and your life insurance) and check who the beneficiary of those are and make sure it's not this guy.
In terms of how to get started: The number one thing is to make sure you and your son are safe. Victims of domestic violence are most at risk of being killed when they are trying to get away from their abusers. You should focus on avoiding the worst case scenario, not on making the best case scenario (such as him agreeing to something amicably) better. If you feel safe finding and retaining a lawyer right away, without him finding out, do that first. If not, leave first with your son and then immediately find a lawyer. (It IS legal for you to just take your son wherever without the dad's permission. But you should file something in court first - you don't want him going to court and saying that you ran away with the child and he wants him back.).
Thank you so much! I’m literally about to cry, bc I just am overwhelmed with where to start, and hope this doesn’t turn into a nightmare (more than it already is). I know people that have it way worse, but I also never imagined I’d be here.
