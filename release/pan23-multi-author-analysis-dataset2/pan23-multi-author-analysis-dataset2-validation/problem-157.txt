I'm sorry, no, there is no law against asking someone about their availability. If there was, every corporate goon and working stiff on earth would be in jail for trying to set appointments and meetings. I'd be in jail for asking my plumber when he's free to look at my toilet.
I would think that asking that can be illegal because, for one example, sometimes boyfriends or girlfirends get a little weird after breakups and start stalking and harassing exes. I don't need to know their entire schedule. I just want to see when they'll be in next, but it got me wondering about what exactly the rules are surrounding this situation and that's why I asked.
Just because you want to talk to them doesn't mean they need to talk to you, and if this is a place that has online applications they'll probably tell you to just apply through that.
I'm not quite applying, I'm transferring. In the past it has been easier to call the store itself and just talk to the manager and usually because they're in need of employees they tend to get to me faster. But anyways, thank you. That was what I was looking for.
What? Asking someone when they'll be available to talk isn't illegal. Why would it be illegal? What does this have to do with stalking? Why do you need to know their entire schedule when what you really need to know is if and when they'll be available to talk to you?
