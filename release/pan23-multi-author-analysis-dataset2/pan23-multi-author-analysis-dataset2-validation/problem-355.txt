\ in the YIVO encyclopedia. Ordinarily I wouldn't rely so much on an article from an encyclopedia except that a) Beider is known as a preeminent authority on Jewish surnames, having written literally a dozen dictionaries compiling them, b) there is a really surprising dearth of quality information online or even in print, and c) the YIVO encyclopedia is a fantastic resource in which the articles are generally written by experts in the field.\].
\which yes, does mean cat's elbow, but I have no idea what the etymology originally was, and from what I could see from a quick curious Google, neither do historians with any certainty.
With some exceptions (such as the Jews of the city of Prague), most Jews in Central/Eastern Europe didn't have surnames until 1787. At that point, Joseph II of the Hapsburg Empire enacted a law forcing all Jews in the empire- mostly in now-Polish Galicia, as well as in Hungary- to adopt surnames, and he was followed in this over the next several decades by the Jews of Prussia (in stages) and the Russian Pale of Settlement, until by the mid-19th century, basically all Jews in this region had surnames.
(Also, from what I understand, the last name Dreyfus originally connoted Jews from the German city of Trier, known by the French as Treves. I could be wrong about that, though.).
Generally, these last names were not too bad. In fact, they very often had specifically positive connotations- these names include, for example, Freilich (happy), Ehrlich (honest), and Frisch (fresh). However, as you note, sometimes they could get pretty bad. In fact, they could get FAR worse than the ones you mention- with real actual names including Deliisch (criminal), Geschwür (ulcer), Kaker (crapper), Harn (urine), Niemand (nobody), Affengesicht (monkey’s face), Bleichfrosch (pale frog), Schmutzbank (dirty bench), and Wanzreich (rich in bugs, or realm of bugs). Some names were just strange, like two people named, respectively, Sommerfreund and Sommerfiend (friend of summer and enemy of summer). It's unclear exactly how these names came to be; while historically it was claimed that they were given to the lowest bidders- people who couldn't afford a bribe for a better name with a nicer connotation- that doesn't really stand up to the most recent scholarship (with one major reason why being that until the 20th century Jews rarely used their surnames, and so wouldn't have cared all that much what they were). In all probability, though, they came from the creative minds of the Austrian clerks. There were also not all that many of them- there were plenty of very random names which often made little sense in translation, but not nearly as many truly derogatory names.
The famously bad names were generally from the Hapsburg Empire. Jews could theoretically select any name they wished, but if they didn't choose then the name would be assigned to them. Therefore, many of these names were created via a sort of grab-bag, assembly-line process, in which compound names would be created using two randomly selected words off of different lists. The first part of the name might be (among other things) a metal, food, color, or size. The second part might be (among other things) a type of plant, topography, or place. So, if we were to make one up randomly, we might make Goldberg by combining "gold" (off of list 1) with "berg" (mountain, off of list 2). Or possibly Schwartzblatt ("black leaf"), or Feinstein ("fine stone"). This was a quick and easy way to generate names which would be unique (kind of like how Reddit randomly generates possible usernames when you register). The names weren't always random- sometimes they could be based on actual German/Austrian place names, in a desire by the Empire to give Jews sophisticated and Romanticized names to help them to acculturate (something which was a part of Joseph II's agenda at the time of beginning to emancipate the Jews). But often the Austrian clerks who assigned the names could simply use their imaginations.
So, funny thing about that! Katzenellenbogen is both the longest and one of the most famous Jewish last names and families. It's actually one of the oldest Jewish last names as well- long predating 1787. The origin is actually the German town of Katzenelnbogen\, which allowed a small number of Jews to settle there in the 14th century. A century later, a descendant of some of these Jews, Meir, left Katzenelnbogen and moved to Padua, where he became a well-known rabbi and, we'd say in retrospect, founded the Katzenellenbogen dynasty. His descendants have one of the most elaborate and well-mapped family trees in the Jewish world and can claim , Jewish and non-Jewish. Direct male-line descendants have changed their names over time to Katz, Katzen, Ellenbogen, Elbogen, etc as well as Wohl, Samuel, and possibly others.
In addition to the excellent response from u/hannastohelit, it may be possible that this name was assigned by an Austrian official who knew Russian and was indeed giving the less desirable names to people not able or willing to bribe him. Part of what is now northwestern Ukraine was appropriated by Austrian Empire during the First Partition of Poland in 1772 and this region (Galicia-Volhynia) had a relatively high Jewish population. This also would not be a derogatory name at a time, more likely one indicating a low-born origins, as such names were quite commonplace among the peasants. Also, 'Dreyfus' (it does not mean three legs, which is pronounced differently) is generally accepted as a toponymic surname, (indicating the origin in the city of Trier) much like Shapiro, Warschauer, Krakower, Epstein, Ulman, Dresdner, Halpern, Kronenberg, or Zonser.
1) You're just thinking of Galicia, not Volhynia, which was never part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but rather was part of Russia.
2) The scenario you describe seems a bit far-fetched, as a) German names were not just most frequently given but were specifically ideologically prioritized by Austria (and besides, a name in Ukrainian would make much more sense than one in Russian) and b) as I mentioned the bribery thing is almost certainly a myth. That said, you're right that the name wouldn't necessarily have been meant as derogatory, though I'm not sure whether class would have played into it per se in the Jewish case. Your scenario is possible, but seems kind of odd to me.
Now, I'm not sure about the last name you mention. In the Pale of Settlement (which is where pretty much all Russian Jews were living at the time), Jews were entirely in charge of naming themselves, with the responsibility given to the kahal, or community leadership. Most often they used place names. Sometimes they turned first names into surnames, sometimes they just added -man to the end of a name or word, sometimes they created names in Hebrew, Yiddish, Russian or Ukrainian. But if this is when your family name came to be, then so far as I can tell it would have been a name which was not imposed by a third party but imposed by someone within the community.
