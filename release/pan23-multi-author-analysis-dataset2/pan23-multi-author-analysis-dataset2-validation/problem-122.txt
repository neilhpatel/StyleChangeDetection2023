As an Indian, I can say that many people here see Russian oil as a necessary evil. It has already become very expensive. I just wish we could drill our own oil instead of relying on imports...
India's invested a ridiculous amount in solar -- its installed the amount of solar capacity. But it simply can't make up for what oil can do, such as fuel trucks that transport food. The price of oil thus directly affects the price of food, and that's a big deal for a country that is still trying to give everyone access to enough food (a third of all malnourished people in the world are in India).
You make it sound like the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the only thing saving India's economy from imminent collapse.
India went full Russia not after COVID, but after Russian genocidal and terrorist invasion of Ukraine.
Covid was pretty rough for us and things didn't really get back up to normal before the war started. A lot of people lost all their savings trying to get through the pandemic. I'm sure some of us would be able to divest from cheap oil any other time, but as of right now, we simply cannot afford to. There is very little resiliency in the system and I understand the reasons to buy Russian oil for cheap. I think the official government stance is to get oil where it is cheapest just to make sure our economy doesn't tank.
An opportunity to make a quick buck and score some political points domestication by buying cheaper oil from a terrorist, genocidal regime is well understood.
But I am not buying the "necessity" argument, given that I heard none of that before the war. India was getting by before the war without Russian oil, and I've yet to see a reason why it can't after Russia decided to use terror attacks on a massive scale in its invasion.
Well the western countries are out bidding all the oil in other sources driving up cost and increasing scarcity, opec is cutting production and our primary oil supplier iran is sanctioned which we complied with,so do tell me where we can buy our oil as due to our low income in many families (mainly rural and small towns) we can not spend much without going into a recession and cause death of our own people.
Right now India is in phase of rapid industrialization which cannot miss and that cheap oil from Russia i alleviating a lot of pressure from economy after it took a beating from COVID.
And the west really wanted to they would have cut the taps or reduce it at least right on 2014 Crimean crisis,but i think the west values the economy more than human rights.
Western leadership know what they are doing and has stated they understand developing countries position in buying Russian oil,thats way they are using a pricecap rather than sanctioning oil.
Thank you for acknowledging that India buying Russian oil is simply doing the terrorist state a diplomatic favor, and not some sort of dire need that we've been led to believe.
My stance is simple- india government which I voted for will place indian needs first and only comply with UN LED sanctions like we did with iran.
Duly noted that India's needs include doing, as you said, doing a diplomatic favor to a in Russia buy starting to buy its oil in huge amounts, thus perpetuating the war it wages, destruction, and endless Russian and Ukrainian deaths.
Above all, you are doing a disservice to Russia by propping up Putin's regime to oil money. The Russians won't be thankful for that after he's gone.
You're fucking up ties with both Russia and the West by trading with Russia, but continue saying it's an "Indian need" to do so.
On one hand, the largest conflict in Europe since WW2, about 100K killed on the Russia's side, God knows how many Ukrainians killed, millions displaced, 1000 miles of front line, trench warfare, Russia's nuclear threats, and that's just the past 9 months.
The goal posts were moved from discussing pre-war/now to pre-covid/now, by the person responding to me.
They who? India prides itself on being the largest democracy, and even in authoritarian regimes public opinion matters.
Nobody cares about India's problem with Pakistan, so India shouldn't care about the West's problem with Russia in return.
Selling oil at any price, below price cap or not, benefits the Russian war effort which requires money now.
The cost of pumping oil isn't distributed linearly. There's a lot of upfront investment to get it flowing. So Russia isn't losing money now when they sell oil. They are recouping losses made in the past.
Tell me again about options. And what price India paid before the war vs. what non-Russian oil sells for now.
The global supply is artificially restricted in the first place to keep the prices at the levels they are now. The price is dictated by how much the buyers are willing to pay, the production is limited to produce enough oil to satisfy the demand.
This is a prime time to cut a deal with OPEC, which has capacity to raise production. The problem here is that Indians don't want to. They see alliance with Russia and Iran as a good thing.
In any case, I have yet to see one comment from someone who says they are from India who, in no unclear terms, condemns the war, and says that India should transition away from Russian oil.
I am well aware of reasoning, and I am also very tired of having to debunk the for the umpteenth time among torrents of whataboutism, downvotes and rhetoric like "You just want to strave brown people".
So, please, "you have no idea they are actually Indian" is the weakest objection. Give me an indication that Indians want to shift away from Russian oil, or that they condemn Russian recognized terror and genocide.
India's economy didn't suffer from any majors blows in 2022, and oil prices from non-Russian sources didn't increase. Saying they would increase if India didn't buy Russian oil is hypothetical. The market prices today are facts.
Again, it's not just the 100x increase in oil purchases since pre-war. It's playing "both sides" - include the side of terrorism and genocide - while aspiring to be the world's Vishwaguru.
Given India's otherwise ambiguous stance and doubling overall trade, this makes India a supporter of terrorism and genocide in Ukraine, along with anyone who welcomes this.
The entire western world has been OK with Russian occupation of Crimea and Donbas too. And Germany kept buying Russian gas well into the summer of 2022. It's a very low bar even in this conflict.
