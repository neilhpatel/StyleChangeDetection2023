In general your employer can lower your pay going forward but not backward. We’re paying you manual labor scale starting tomorrow is legal. We’re paying you manual labor scale yesterday is not - if there was some clear agreement to pay you operator scale and that’s what you worked under. In this instance that is likely complicated by your CBA, both with respect to what your expectation should have been and perhaps with respect to their ability to change that.
If you were paid the correct rate for the role you performed, regardless of what others are being paid, then you are likely being paid correctly.
Sounds like you were paid per your union contract, as you are doing manual labor. If you didn't work machine you are most likely not entitled to be paid at the machine rate.
If you have a separate contract that states you'll be paid at the higher rate regardless of role, then you may have something.
It doesn't sound like they are though, they are paying you the wages you agreed to be paid. That you might have gotten a bonus pay over that in the past isn't really relevant, the contract say you are going to be paid X and that's what the agreement is. It almost sounds like you were accidentally overpaid in the past. In any event, this is an issue for your union.
So you negotiated something other than what the union contract allowed? That's almost certainly a violation of the contract and the National Labor Relations Act. You might be entitled to some back pay, but there is no way you will get it going forward, what you have been getting paid could get the company in a world of trouble with the union.
