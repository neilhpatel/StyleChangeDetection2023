This is a loaded and complicated question. Obviously no, having POA doesn’t entitle someone to abuse whomever granted that POA. What you’re describing isn’t so much abuse as it is a breach of fiduciary duty. And that breach can be acted on. Someone else can involve adult protective services or litigate the POA, seek to be appointed in aunt’s stead, and perhaps sue aunt or the other people who received this stolen money to recover it for grandfather.
So no one objected to stealing from grandfather until they decided the distribution of the loot wasn’t fair?
He also can't read due to cataracts, so it's not like if she said, "Sign here, Dad!" he wouldn't do it without reading the document first. He can't see. He just trusts her to not be taking advantage of him, and I'm pretty sure she is.
Okay, I guess that in and of itself isn't the concern. He's done that kind of thing for my cousins for years, but he's also been clear he wanted to do that for my cousins, never my aunt. They're his grandkids, and he loves them, and he raised her, not them, so why shouldn't he spoil them as he sees fit? Fair enough. However, my grandfather can't remember that he ate breakfast, let alone what he's signed/not signed. He knows he has a grandson (my brother), but doesn't remember my brother's name. He doesn't remember that I graduated from his alma mater and place of former employ and that he handed me my diploma this spring. He doesn't remember either of our birthdays, but he just paid for my cousins and my aunt to take a trip for one of their birthdays recently. He would not have done that for them five years ago. A gift of some sort, something practical that they can/will use like a down payment on a house or a car, yes, but a trip? No, he would never. The trick is, he doesn't remember handing over the money for the trip. He doesn't remember getting my cousin anything at all this year, but they clearly went on the trip and clearly thanked my grandfather for paying for it. That's actually the bigger concern, where the elder abuse/fiduciary duty neglect would come in; my grandpa can't remember things, and my aunt is taking advantage of that.
When the POA shift happened, it happened because my aunt was threatening to get the will changed to exclude my brother and I from it. We've address the "unequal distribution of the loot" as much as we honestly care to address it. My brother and I just ask to be remembered and thought about. That's all we want. We can't even get that. My uncle has an issue with that as my cousins routinely get presents and all manner of financial help. He thinks it should be a fair monetary distribution across the board, but my father, brother and I don't really care. As far as we're concerned, a card on our birthdays would be enough for us. I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt to be forgotten about, knowing that my cousins are my grandfather's favorites and have that fact rubbed in my face every day, but I wouldn't give a crap if my grandpa could talk to me. Or would talk to me. He says he loves me, but he can't even pick up the phone or return my calls. Or letters I did that for a long time, too In short, we don't care about money - we just want our grandfather. That is all I want.
Well, and for my aunt to not be taking advantage of her own father. Seems like little to ask, but apparently, not so much.
No one knew that it was being stolen. To be fair, no one is sure that it has been, but we suspect my aunt did steal money from my grandfather. My father and his brother both agreed that the initial assets should go to the church, if that was what my grandfather wanted. They supported it. Now my aunt just bought a $300K home (average home price in the area is $75K, so this is a huge deal) and we know she can't actually afford it herself. She said she used her savings to buy the house outright, on a teacher's salary. That's concerning to us.
Presumably you're also not sure that grandfather didn't say "hey, thanks for helping me so much. Why don't you take $x to help with your house.".
The point isn't to give you a hard time. The point is that context is everything here. When you say "$1mil for church went to grandkids," that comes with the suggestion that you knew it was for church and not for grandkids. And that suggests the take I described - that we were all good with not using grandfather's money as intended until we didn't like how and who benefited.
The more you talk the more obvious it is we can't separate infighting over grandfather's money from the concern about fiduciary duty to grandfather. You should involve APS here. This needs someone who is looking out for grandfather first.
First of all, I NEVER said the million was spent on grandkids. That's not what happened - as far as we know. We were all fine with it going to the church, and if that's where it all went, we're fine with that. That's what Grandpa said he wanted.
We are NOT fine with my aunt taking advantage of her father with memory issues, which it seems has been happening more and more, and taking money from places she oughtn't. The only reason my father and uncle have never started anything in the past is because she's POA and they assumed she wouldn't steal from him. Well, in the last year, things have started to look like it's not all above board, and we have reason to believe she did steal a sizeable amount from him to pay for this house.
Yes, we need to get help - and clearly you are not the person who needs that help. I spent two hours bawling my eyes out to my parents last night over how unloved my aunt and grandfather have made me feel my whole damn life. Have a fucking heart, redditor. If there's infighting, it's not over money - it's over how my brother and I treated, and sadly, money is the only thing our grandfather has ever used to demonstrate his care. I don't know how many different ways I can say this, but all I have ever wanted from my grandfather is a card acknowledging he at least thinks about me. Or a phone call.
1. I'm not trying to discuss the emotional aspect of this experience. I'm sure there's a sub for that but that's not where my knowledge lies and I wouldn't try to participate.
The only reason we care about the money is A) He lives in a home he is paying for himself and B) His memory is shot. Screw you for implying anything other than what I said. Learn a little empathy.
