Aquariums bursting is not a fun time. You might be able to save a single betta fish, but the idea that you could somehow find water with your exact parameters (there is a lot of difference happening at the microscopic level, no two aquariums are the same) and bacteria, as well as big enough to house all the fish…it’s just not gonna happen. I have roughly 300 gallons of aquariums in my home. When we got evacuated during the wildfires in California, I left them. It is unfortunately triage. Save what you can, and unfortunately fish are VERY hard to save without time and planning and a serious amount of excess resources (extra tanks, extra rodi water, dosing equipment).
As much as it’s unfortunate, it is ultimately better that all the fish died than them getting into the local waters. They were invasive species to the local river.
Liters and litres are both English terms. In the United States, there is a preference for "liters" over "litres" (94 to 6). In the United Kingdom, there is a 81 to 19 preference for "litres" over "liters". being I'm originally from the UK, it's Litres lol.
liters is underlined in red for me, the opposite lol must be a geo/country location spell check thing , being in Canada now, it's also spelled litres here , and types that way.
