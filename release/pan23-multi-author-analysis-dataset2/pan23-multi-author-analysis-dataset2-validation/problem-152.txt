Less-educated citizens listening to those politicians might believe it if they hear it repeated enough. That doesn't make the original claim a good faith claim.
They believe elections have the potential to be corrupted. So they will argue we should have as few opportunities as possible to screw with the election, that we should restrict voting to only the most secure of methods.
I’m just putting their argument out there so we can be better equipped to disarm it when we encounter it. Whenever they see the Democratic Party look for ways to expand voting and make registration easier and increase polling locations or voting opportunities they see it as us finding ways to sneak more votes in.
What’s really fitting, statistics show that the more votes we have in an election the more democrats win. This is because we live in a progressive majority country but it also feeds into their delusion. So when more people vote, more democrats get elected and republicans cry foul and say we are cheating.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Now, personally I think this is all bullshit. Prior to the last couple elections this idea of such widespread conspiracy and corruption swaying the vote is a novel concept and unprecedented. We’ve gone almost 250 years, election results used to be handwritten and delivered on horseback but now all of a sudden in the age of cameras and fingerprint scanners someone found a way to cheat the election.
They had 60 chances in court to show one single shred of evidence of voter fraud in 2020 and whiffed on all of them. All they got was Trump’s entire legal team disbarred and disgraced. The intensive, months-long audits they themselves demanded, using audit firms they picked found more votes for Biden multiple times, particularly in Arizona and Wisconsin. No one outside of the craziest Q bubble seriously thinks the dems rigged 2020. Especially since they apparently neglected to rig themselves big majorities in Congress, state legislatures, governor’s races, etc, while they were busy screwing Trump.
No, the Republican politicians claim to believe that US elections can be stolen. They oppose the most secure method available, which is vote by mail. They oppose electronic voting, our next most secure method. They convinced many of my state's smaller offices to remove critical cybersecurity from their equipment.
The ranked choice system that Alaska uses also eliminates the primary election. This saves the state quite a lot of money and time.
The voters understand the system, and it tends to favor moderate candidates more than primaries. With primaries, the most extreme candidates tend to win each primary. That's not every time. It's just the way the method pushes things. That eliminates many people who would otherwise get the most votes.
The most common argument against IRV and other ranking methods is that they confuse voters. That's silly since IRV is straightforward and intuitive. Condorcet would confuse them.
Several news reporters tried sampling voters in Alaska, NPR and NY Times both. The voters understand how it's calculated.
