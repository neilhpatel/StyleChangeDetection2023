You’re going to have to be more specific, because it’s highly inaccurate to suggest that basically any indigenous group in the Americas lived a “caveman” lifestyle prior to the arrival of Europeans.
Yeah as someone who lives in Phoenix it’s always fun to point out that a large portion what is the salt river project canal was built by the tribes that lived here prior to contact.
Lion-man figurine is dated to, from the article you linked, 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. This is thousands of years before the first signs of agriculture developed in the Middle East. In contrast, by 1492 agriculture had been established in the Americas for thousands of years. Much of the eastern and southwestern United States was populated by settled farmers residing in urban centers, not hunter-gatherers. And groups that might fall under “semi-agriculturalists” were hardly small, nomadic tribesmen. Take the Calusa of southern Florida, who may have practiced limited agriculture but not to the extent of their neighbors - using a triad of fishing, hunting, and gathering, the Calusa established large, permanent cities with a complex state structure and hereditary elite, and were praised by the Spanish for this. This is night and day from what a “caveman” would have lived like. It’s comparing apples to oranges.
This is not to disagree with your hypothesis. That far back is not my specialty, and I do hope someone with knowledge there can chime in. I think it’s likely many “cavemen” societies were much more complex than we give them credit for. But I absolutely do not agree that it is comparable to the Americas pre-contact. These are drastically different situations.
