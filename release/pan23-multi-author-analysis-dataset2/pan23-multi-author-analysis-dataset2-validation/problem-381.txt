"Your record" is not a singular thing. They will on your driving record for sure. They would not be on your criminal record, since they are not crimes.
Speeding tickets "can be" misdemeanors in RI. It would depend on what you're charged with specifically -- which code section did you violate.
RI has a dirversion program ("traffic school") for first-time offenders. You should look into whether you qualify. I don't know RI specifially, but if you qualify for it, it's better than "just paying the fine" (which means pleading guilty or no-contest).
If you think you have a defense against the charge, it may be worth talking to an attorney about fighting it.
I don’t know which code section I violated, I got pulled over on Sunday and I am still waiting for my ticket in the mail. I also don’t really know what defense I have since I was speeding.
If I try and qualify for the traffic school though instead of paying do you know how I would go about doing that?
Technically, if you didn't get handed a ticket AND don't hear anything in the mail, then you aren't breaking any rules by not showing up to court. That said, there's always the possibility the mail got lost, so checking up isn't going to hurt.
But seriously, until you do get something in the mail, don't overthink it. There's always a chance the cop didn't/won't charge you.
Ah. OK. Usually if you get handed a ticket, it will have the code section scribbled on it. If you haven't got it yet, then you do not yet have a ticket for speeding. Keep an eye on the mail, and if you don't hear something in a couple of weeks, try calling the court clerk at the county where your ticket was issued and inquire.
Yea that’s true, idk why he didn’t just give it to me right there I think it’s cus I wasn’t from that state. Also I don’t even think I would be able to show up for court either way since I leave for school on Monday, isn’t it possible though for me to not show up by either paying the ticket or hiring an attorney to represent me?
Usually, for an out of state motorist, the police are not going to mail it in if they intend to charge you. They'd want to make certain you were accountable/would show up by handing you a ticket on the spot.
I doubt very much you'll get a ticket. The cop probably wanted it to feel like something more than just a warning, but it was probably just a warning.
I was thinking that but the cop literally told me that he would be mailing me a ticket to my house… do u think he possibly lied then just to scare me?
Probably not malicious\- - but more like "I don't really have enough to justify citing an out-of-state defendant. The speed is low enough that they might beat the charge... but just giving them a warning kinda feels like too little. I know, I'll make it seem more serious by telling them they'll get a ticket in the mail.".
Yes. To me, it is more likely that he lied than actually let an out-of-state driver go without their signature on a notice to appear ("ticket").
Also I just don’t think it would make sense since he told me he will ticket me for going 5 over to try and cut me some slack, so if he was going to lie about the whole thing why wouldn’t he just tell me he will ticket me for going 17 over in the first place?
Your options depending on your area are to either pay the ticket or go to court, pay court fees, and have the ticket hopefully dropped. Many states drop a ticket if you go to court and have no other history.
Ok. I’m just curious say the ticket was actually for 17 over would that be a misdemeanor though? Also, I go to school in a different state this week so would I be able to have an attorney go for me?
This is my first ticket, I am just concerned because I do not want it on my record and do not want it to increase insurance rates. I was considering hiring an attorney just because I have heard countless stories of people getting tickets dismissed even if they were going 30+ over just because they decided to dispute it instead of paying it. I am just concerned however if I do dispute it that I may actually end up having to pay for 17 over instead of what the cop told me he would fine me for which is 5 over.
By “L” I mean just accept the ticket and pay it without going to court and trying to dispute it since you said the cop could bring up me going 17 over instead of 5 if I do take it to court.
