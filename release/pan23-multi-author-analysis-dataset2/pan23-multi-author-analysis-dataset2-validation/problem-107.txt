Your therapy records would be hearsay: they reflect that, at some point, you told your therapist about your ex abusing you, but don't actually reflect the abuse itself. There's a better source for those remarks available: you can testify to it, yourself, if it becomes relevant.

Title: My abusive ex filed for full custody, can my therapy records outlining his abuse be used in court in my favor?
Interpersonal abuse between partners often has little impact on custody. What matters is what would indicate your child is in danger or is being neglected. However, it would be a good idea to have a lawyer represent you.
Your therapist may not be able to testify, depending on the ethical standards of their board certifications. If they are American Psychological Association certified, for example, they probably would not be able to.
It is extremely unlikely you would lose custody (even people currently in prison retain custody of their kids) but he may be asking for residency. Tell the court of the pattern of abuse, and that the current threats fit that pattern.
