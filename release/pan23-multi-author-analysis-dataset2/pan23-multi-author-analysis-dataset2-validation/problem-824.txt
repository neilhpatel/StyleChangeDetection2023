Most of this is political and not legal - your recourse is to advocate, on your own or with your fellow members, and to run for or help elect board members who can effect change.
It is completely routine for any organization's board of directors to delegate day-to-day communications to their staff or agents - in this case, the property management company they hired to handle those responsibilities. You don't have to follow suit, but it's very likely that if you approach the Board directly about an issue they're handling via the property managers, they'll just send you to the PMs.
Generally, board members do not have an obligation to respond to private inquiries, with the exception of inquiries that relate to the board's official duties as representatives and recordkeepers for the co-operative members. If you have a specific item you want to raise, get it onto the agenda for the next members meeting, and address it there so that both your question and the response can be minuted.
I don't entirely view misconduct from the board as political. In a business where the board is derelict in executing it's duties and/or changes policies unilaterally, there must be some legal recourse. I know Robert's Rules of Order is a thing and I think we are far beyond simple unprofessional behavior in this case.
You begin politically by raising your concerns at a board meeting. Or by running for a position or advocating for other board members at the next election.
Most corporate entities, including co-ops, delegate specific powers to the Board to exercise directly. Depending on what policy changes you're referring to, they could well fall within the board's discretion, or they may require notice to the members, or they may require a full vote. What's the scope of the policies you have in mind?
Concerns have been raised at board meetings by myself and others. As I stated above, the board is unresponsive.
Running for a board position is not an option for me and is unreasonable for most people I would imagine. I am specifically asking: what legal recourse do shareholders have to compel an unresponsive board to respond in a timely and professional manner or provide details about changing written policies without shareholder input?
The policies are related to who is responsible for repairs to damage caused by faulty plumbing, credits being offered to shareholders to replace original tubs and shower surrounds, and procedures involved in approving other renovations and architectural changes (i.e. requests are approved according to board meeting minutes, but the required letters of final approval are being withheld without reason and inquires to management and/or the board are simply ignored, going on months now).
