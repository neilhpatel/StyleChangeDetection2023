In 1774, the area of North America that now comprises Canada consisted of (from east to west) the Colony of Newfoundland, the Colony of Nova Scotia, the Province of Quebec (modern-day Labrador, eastern Quebec and southern Ontario), Rupert's Land (modern-day western Quebec, northern Ontario, Manitoba, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, and southern Nunavut), and the North-Western Territory (modern-day Yukon, Northwest Territories, northwestern Nunavut, northwestern Saskatchewan, northern Alberta, and northern British Columbia). In the case of the latter, there was no real definition to the western boundary of the territory, to my knowledge, and no government or permanent European settlement existed west of the western Hudson's Bay shoreline (again, to my knowledge; and I have looked). There was no explicit European claim to what is now southern British Columbia at the time, and it had not been explored, with the first recorded sighting of the Columbia River's mouth by a European (Bruno de Heceta) taking place the following year. The colonies (including the Province of Quebec) were much like the Thirteen colonies, if more sparsely populated than some. The Province of Quebec is estimated to have been more populous in 1774 with 100,000 to 120,000 than were Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Delaware, Georgia, and what would become Maine, Kentucky, Vermont, and Tennessee in 1770. Qu√©bec, Montreal, St. John's, and Halifax had already been established, though all were small, as had numerous other settlements of various sizes throughout the land east of the Hudson's Bay. Each colony / province had a governor and a council, and each had a sizable military contingent in the vicinity of its largest settlement. Compared to the Thirteen Colonies, these northern colonies were heavily fortified and, unlike in the south, the governors were always military officers (with the exception of the Ellis / Belcher government of Nova Scotia, 1760-1763) still active within the local command structure. Rupert's Land was a company-controlled region under the governance of the Hudson's Bay Company, which used the territory, and the then un-governed but definitely British North-Western Territory, for its extensive trapping networks. Trading posts and company stores dotted the area, but there were no permanent European settlements.
Just for the future, when linking old posts, it's considered best practice to also tag the poster, in this /u/oldmanthrowaway12345. That way reddit will send them a notification, so they have the opportunity to respond.
Naturally, while there were some small developments, the landscape was pretty well the same when the Revolution officially broke-out the following year. The overwhelming military dominance in the northern colonies and their small and dispersed civilian population made the possibility of any significant rebellion unrealistic, and, while there were attempts to draw "Canadians" (mostly French-Canadians and First Nations) into the Revolution on the side of the Americans, the weakness and infrequency of these attempts probably indicate that this reality was recognized by the Continental Congress, though I am afraid this is speculation on my part. It is worth mentioning that the Revolution began less than twenty years after the end of the French and Indian War, and there is a good chance that the French Canadians were either tired or wary of fighting the British on a cultural level. After the ultimately disastrous Canadian Campaign, which ended just before the Declaration of Independence was finalized, "Canada" was secured as a British stronghold, and its conquest was considered secondary to the main war from that point on. The 1st (350 men) and 2nd (250 men) Canadian Regiments of the Continental Army were composed primarily of French Canadians, and existed between 1775 and 1781, and 1776 and 1783, respectively, but I am not aware of any attempts to recruit from what is now Ontario and Quebec following the retreat into "American territory" in June of 1776.
The final, and almost universally overlooked, attempt to draw a northern colony to the American side took place in Nova Scotia in 1776 and 1777. In 1776, Colonel Jonathan Eddy (a long-time resident of Nova Scotia prior to the war) led 180 militiamen to invade Nova Scotia with small arms provided by the Massachusetts legislature. To make a long story short, the whole campaign consisted of the unsuccessful Battle of Fort Cumberland (November 10 - 29), after which the local rebels were either driven out of the colony or accepted a blanket pardon in exchange for laying down arms. The following year, Colonel John Allan (a friend and co-conspirator of Eddy's, and, like him, a long-time Nova Scotian) led about 100 militiamen from Massachusetts to the mouth of the St. John River in present-day New Brunswick (then, Nova Scotia) to establish a congressionally-approved Patriot presence in the region, which, along with Cumberland, had been a main pocket of rebellion in Nova Scotia. Again, the campaign was a disaster, lasting only from June 2 to 30, and Allan's men were dispersed within hours (possibly an hour) of being sighted by British troops, who had been called to the region by an escaped prisoner of Allan's. In the case of both campaigns, the desires of two cartoonish buffoons to see their home colony join the Revolution led to abject failure. While, as stated, areas such as Cumberland and the St. John River Valley were hotbeds of rebellion in Nova Scotia, the European population of these regions was in the dozens or low hundreds, including women and children, and not all were Patriots. When push came to shove, those residents who espoused the Patriot cause chose their homes and livelihoods over republican sentiment, and nothing more was made of Nova Scotia's revolutionary potential.
While there were several naval skirmishes and raids in Nova Scotian waters / territory later in the Revolution, these were either the work of privateers, the French, or one-off smash and grabs not meant to sway opinion or capture land. The Americans did attempt to secure the Province of Quebec at the peace talks that led to the Treaty of Paris (1783), but they had no leverage and it is likely that the demand was part of a bargaining strategy. In the end, the Patriots were glad to leave the colonies to the British, and, with the settlement of the Loyalists in those colonies following the aforementioned treaty, quickly became friendly trading partners and neighbors.
To sum up: isolation from the other colonies, proportionally much larger military presence, and majority civilian disinterest kept what is now Canada apart from the Thirteen Colonies in their attempt for independence.
