How was the house held by your sister and your mother? If it was as joint tenants then your sister owns the house entirely and if you want to go forward with this she doesn’t have to give you a dime.
If the house was held as tenants in common and assuming your mother didn’t leave a will, you are entitled to 1/4 of the value of the property.
You haven’t given your state but yes, if the home was held as joint tenants then your sister now owns the home. When you hold a home in this way it passes to the other owner outside of probate. You have no valid claim. You can try to persuade your sister but she doesn’t have to give you any proceeds.
Okay, the house was deeded to her and my mom so mom couldn’t borrow against or lose the house somehow. Mom did not have a will. So, I am entitled to 1/4 of the proceeds? I’m in the state of Alabama.
You will need to check how the house was held. As I said - if it was held as joint tenants, no you aren’t entitled to anything. You will need to check the title to find out how it is held.
It is written as joint tenants. I’m already living in the house and paying bills in my name though. Do I still have no claim? No way to get a foot in the proceeds door?
