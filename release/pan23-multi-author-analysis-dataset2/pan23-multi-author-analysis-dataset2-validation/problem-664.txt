Of course it did. The US federal government may not be perfect by any stretch of the imagination but banning Tic Tock from its employees isn’t stupid. The Chinese government has its hands in every business in the country.
Seriously so much has been revealed about Tik Tok’s sinister spying and ties to China, I can’t believe it hasn’t been banned in Australia yet. I have never loaded that spyware shit on my phone. It was immediately identified in Australian media as an app for China to spy on you. If you’re dumb enough to load that shit on your phone, suffer the consequences. You’ve been repeatedly warned about it and anything else coming from China, like security cameras they can log into. Seriously they are taking over small Pacific countries one by one. They just built a military hospital in PNG. War is coming with these pricks and everyone is still sucking on their titties….
TikTok is a tool for our adversary to discover the worst in us, then take that worst and propagate and promote it in hopes we imagine ourselves as less and become less.
Your psychology is under covert assault. Believe in yourself you are greater than you realize. The proof is that they spend billions to bring you to your knees and you do not bow.
