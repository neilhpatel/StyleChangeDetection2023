...where large companies gradually take over governments with their own police force, army, legislative institution, lobby or rather direct influence that effectively controls politicians, and so on.
What you sometimes get (and let's say there's some debate about where America is on this spectrum), are situations where the government and companies are TRULY separate entities and are pulling away from each other as they compete for power within a society and government finds itself increasingly unable to control a company.
If you want to think about it like an org chart, if Biden woke up today and said, "you know what, screw Apple, I want the CEO gone, I want them to move all their production to America, I want my face to come pre-loaded as the lock screen image" can he pull that off? No, not a chance. If Putin wanted the equivalent from Gazprom? One phone call and every barrel of oil will have his face on the side and the CEO will fall out of a window onto seven bullets that just so happened to have been laying on the cement facing up exactly where he fell.
For a time Pepsi Co had the 3rd large millitary force in the entire world because the ussr payed them with equipment since the rubble was not worth anything back than.
My point was rather, they could decide and dictate something rather radical and unexpected, and they would "make it work", because otherwise you end up in prison or worse.
Yesterday I thought about the advantages that e.g. China and Russia have in terms of one-party systems, censorship, etc. (basically controlling or at least heavily overreaching into personal life and business).
If Russia this seems quite similar, the advantage those systems have is that if for example their leader would be very much into environmental protection or far better nutrition for all their people (I mean healthier people) they would just be able to make this a government priority and everyone's issue by law.
A friend once said: Before you study politics, first understand economics on a government and global level.
In China they said: Young children and teenagers shouldn't have so much screen-time, and then they just make this a law. (And the entertainment industry can say what they want at this point, as their sales go down in China - "What, only 3h per week under 18 years... per WEEK?").
You're not wrong. But as a practical matter Russia is already set up this way (Putin "owns" Gazprom and simply allows it's CEO to act like a minister in his government or a trusted subordinate). You'd never want the official head of a country to also be the official head of a company because running a country takes a huge amount of work and you ultimately will need to delegate every kind of sub-division to someone else. Minister of Education, CEO of State oil company, Minister of Defence, etc. etc. etc. etc.
It always depends on who has the keys. If video game developers are not represented in an autocrats inner circle, they don't have any power.
Putin and Xi have power because they have a couple of key people who are loyal and gaining money and power from Putin and Xi being in power.
If Putin were to try to boost education and healthcare, he would have to pass it by those key people first. If they don't accept it, at best, those powerful key people will stop the leaders from making changes. At worst, they do the same thing by killing the leader and trying to get their bosses old job somehow.
In an autocratic society, the top dog has underlings that have their own desires. They need to be bought off and appeased and made to believe that if they do the top dogs biddings, they will become richer and more powerful. They also have to believe that if they try to fight the top dog, they will lose everything. In almost every case, making the peasants lives better is not good for the underlings, so the underlings will rally around someone who is good for them (that is... Someone who doesn't care about the filthy peasants).
I always thought that at least China's top politicians have a very strong control over pretty much everything. Still, I can see that realities of economy and who is powerful and rich in a country have a strong impact on politics.
Just thinking aloud: Now I an curious if there were no complaints for example from Tencent or other big Chinese developers when politicians proposed a law to restrict screen time for kids/adolescents. Video games are creating such a big revenue for Chinese developers.
But I am not talking about specific autocracies , I just mentioned China and Russia as two modern examples. And I am not an expert... Mostly relying on.
