Ok I just think it's weird. Why would you bother having a contract if terms can change. My loan has been sold several times over the last 19 years and I never received a new fee schedule.
It would be legal to change fees that are established by reference in the contract to things that can change. Late fees, for example, are something that even the original lender can change from time to time and those could be changed to the new servicer's rates.
Does your contract specify amounts for those fees? Or does it say something about fees may be charged for those things at rates that may be amended from time to time?
Mortgages are 30 years long. It wouldn't make sense for the lender to be tied into a $5.95 late fee because the contract was signed in 1981.
They sent a new fee schedule. all kinds of things but for an example late payment fees where there were none prior, recording fee for satisfying the lein to release at payoff. All kinds of things.
Yeah I understand that. I'll have to review it but from recollection it just stated 0 percent late fee, no penalty for prepayment etc. I'll have to double check for clauses. I tried to look up my state laws about it changing but wasn't successful.
