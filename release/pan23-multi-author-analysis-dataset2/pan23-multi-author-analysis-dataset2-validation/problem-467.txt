You've already nailed the two ways this can be taken care of, in your second to last paragraph. The bank is not going to let him out of the loan without it either being paid off or refinanced. He can get a separate private loan and pay it off, and maybe get her to give him the vehicle (this depends on how it's titled, if it's titled in her name only with him as just a cosigner he'll likely never see the vehicle again). Then he can eat the cost over time instead of all at once, or he can find a way to get his ex to refinance the car with another cosigner. This is again a prime example of why cosigning is never a good idea.
That’s what we were all a little afraid of...he was advised against it but, ya know, love and stuff. The first clue was when her own parents said they were done co-signing for her... Worst part is, she’s the type that will make this more difficult than it needs to be in order to try and maintain that tie to continually rope him back in.
If she isn’t very astute legally, he can scare her into believing that since is 50% owner, he has 50% right to have the car in his possession. If she says “No Way” He could tell her he needs to check on his investment (even if in name only) once a week to ensure it’s in marketable condition at all time, etc., just bug her until she takes his name off and thinks it’s HER IDEA He.
That’s a great idea, and definitely a different way to approach it. The only problem here is he is your stereotypical nice guy and she keeps playing the woe-is-me card. The idea/hope is to completely cut the ties between them because she will use anything to keep him tied in where she can manipulate him. Currently she takes her son to his house for her son to catch the bus, despite it being 45 minutes out of the way to her job and it would be easier for her to drive him 20 mins to school. Basically she’s someone who is not above, using her own child as a pawn to gain access to the financial stability and get out of living back at her parents house under their rules....
