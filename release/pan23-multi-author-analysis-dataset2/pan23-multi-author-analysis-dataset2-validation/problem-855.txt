Reagan, at the California level, gave Amnesty to border hoppers and actually called for an open border, Google it if it's hard to believe .. it's true.
Republicans have to do stuff like this though. The ecosystem of republican news has terrified their voters about the border. If any Republican doesn't make a big show out of the border they will get primaried to the right and lose. They have convinced people there is a literal invasion, so now they have to work to pretend to fight the pretend invasion.
Actually this is why it's important to Republicans that it doesn't work. Look at what happened with abortion... The dog caught the car and now they kinda don't know what to do; it cost them, they can't walk it back.
