Double check that they have your birthdate correct. Different plans handle you aging out differently, some kick you off the day you turn 26 others keep you on for the remainder of the month (like if your birthday is April 15th they don't remove you until May 1st).
Hey so fun fact, a very similar situation happened to me more than a year ago, I am now 27. And it was for dental stuff too- I was getting my wisdom teeth removed. You can fight it, they are supposed to cover you until your birthday and some insurance companies cover you afterwards for a month to give you time to switch to a new insurance. Just get ready to get persistent calling these chuckleheads at the insurance company (I want to call worse names but I won't lol). whatever you do, do not pay a dime of that bill until they agree to cover it.

Title: I'm on my parent's insurance plan and set to age out after my 26th birthday, which is in a few days. I saw a dentist on the 19th - several days before my insurance is up - and my insurance is refusing to pay for it saying they consider me aged out a month prior to my 26th birthday.
