Part of this question is a matter of understanding some of the details of Shinto practice in Japan, especially before the Meiji Restoration. Shinto before the Meiji Restoration was a distinctly local religion. Shinto priests were not appointed in any standard fashion, but instead were "independent sacerdotal lineages managed by a small number of the largest shrines.(Hardacre 5)." Basically, different communities practiced local rituals and had different standards for what the duties and requirements for the priesthood were. Shinto holidays were highly variable, celebrating seasonal rites for local kami involved different practices and different dates. You would celebrate the harvest at very different times in Kagoshima vs Iwate.
The practice of Shinto on a local level did not necessarily change that much. Shrines still celebrated local rituals. But there was also now a centralized religion that was dedicated to the glorification of the Emperor as a divine figure. This involved the construction of a centralized Shinto including the creation of Yasukuni Shrine in 1879, which enshrined war dead and was framed as a high national honor. Overall, this bureaucratic structure was devoted to the glorification of a certain ethnic nationalism that was one of the underpinnings of Imperial power until the end of World War 2.
The Tokugawa Shogunate of that preceded the Meiji Restoration was nominally Buddhist, and even major Shinto rites frequently involved Buddhist priests leading pilgrimages or undertaking austerities related to the events.(Hardacre 13). Most important to understand is that the term Shinto wasn't really used in ordinary speech. It became a category for the practices of different shrines during the late Shogunate and the institution of Kokugaku, often translated as National Study or National Learning. The Kokugaku movement sought to create a unified Japanese identity in a way similar to the use of folklore to create a unified German identity in the 19th century(see Cultural Nationalism: The Grimm Brothers' Fairy Tales by Louis L. Snyder). Part of this was a distinction between Buddhist rites that were seen as related to practices in China and Korea, and rites that were distinctive to Japan, which were categorized as Shinto.
During the Meiji Restoration, the Meiji oligarchy(the emperor was a young teenager during the restoration) sought to remake Japanese society to establish the legitimacy of their government. Part of this was overturning class structures that had been the center of Tokugawa power. The Charter Oath of the new government included five provisions. 2 and 4 are key to understanding the process.
2. All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out the administration of the affairs of state.
The "unity" of the classes in the affairs of state shows the efforts at national identity around state practices. The "evil customs of the past" included the influence of the Buddhism on state culture. These were the underpinnings of State Shinto as it developed during the next few decades.
What State Shinto looked like was essentially a creation of a hierarchical bureaucratic structure of Shinto religion, centralized around the Ise Shrines. All Shrines were ranked somewhere in the list and the nation was essentially divided according to local shrines. The people of Japan had to register with their local shrines as ujiko, which became the official census of the government. State Shinto was as much a state bureaucracy as a state religion, though it's important to realize this is not that different than practices in contemporary European nations, where parish registration was a common form of documenting births and deaths. (Hardacre 28-29).
4. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of nature.
As Nitta Hiroshi and Yasumaru Yoshi posit, "State Shinto" is a bit of a burdensome phrase because it implies any historical context that don't fit the mold of "state" or "shinto" ends up distorted. The phrase's origins and popularisation are based out of the American occupational army in 1945, purporting to abolish kokka shinto in order to affirm freedom of religion and eliminate militarism/ulta-nationalism. I think to this day there is debate about the term, with Hardacre prefering to use it while others like Teeuwen choose not to, saying modern shinto history can be covered without its use. This is because, as Hardacre points out, State Shinto is frequentyly coupled with the "Emperor system" (tennosei 天皇制) to the point where there's a perception that the State made shinto its "puppet" which included extension into education and other civil aspects of Japan. To use Yasumaru's words, the word ("State Shinto") came before the meaning.
Ultimately, it's worth recognizing that the existence of "State Shinto" is not an official practice, but a later description used to categorize practices that the US sought to undo as part of the aftermath of World War 2.
I want to expand upon what /u/drydem posted and talk about the formation of State Shinto (kokka shinto 国家神道 or kokutai 国体, the "country's body"). There's a lot of politics involved and plays for power that are pretty interesting. In some ways it begins with the idea of religious freedom. From the late 1800's through the early 1900's there is a bit of back-and-forth between what the State (imperial court) supports and what it does not. Keep in mind this is all a bit complicated because of how "shinto" may be defined. More on that later. For now, let's consider the idea of "State Shinto" itself.
This isn't to say the term kokka shinto didn't exist before 1945. Rather, the meaning behind it was different. From the perspective of what it was perceived as in 1945-.
Compare this to a statement by Oda Kanichi to the Diet committee deliberating government handouts to shrine priests in the early 1900's.
Therein lies a key component to this discussion. Contemporaries at the time were viewing shinto from a religious and non-religious aspect, with the non-religious aspect referred to as "State Shinto." This seems to diverge from the previous quote about a sacrosanct emperor and "heretical" groups.
To find out why we need to go back further to 1872 for that's when the Jingisho (神祇省 Ministry of Shinto Affairs) was abolished after less than a year in favor of a more "encompassing" Kyobusho (教部省 Ministry of Religions). Note the Jingisho was itself a replacement of the Jingikan which goes back to the early days of Japan. The Kyobusho was a program of "edification" spearheaded by shinto, buddhist, and confucian propagandists designed to address failures of earlier shinto-only edification programs. At the same time, anti-Christian notice boards were removed to play nice with Western influences (this was Meiji after all). Both these actions were taken to mean that the debate about religious freedom was being given an opportunity to be hand.
The reality was a little different. By late 1872, the Kyobusho was being increasingly swayed by anti-buddhist influence from Satsuma bureaucrats. This resulted in the Daikyoin 大教院, a privately funding body backed by the government to coordinate messaging and serve as a place for cross-sect discussion on issues, being effectively "hijacked" by the pro-shinto lobby. To those of the Shinshu Buddhist sect, it was a plot to convert buddhist temples into shinto shrines and buddhist clerics into shinto priests. Shimaji Mokurai was a prominent Shinshu Buddhist who took the lead on extricating buddhism from this control. And his path to freedom was the idea that shinto was not a religion. His associate Ouchi Seiran submitted a petition to the the Sain (左院 lit. Department of the Left) that began with-.
The argument is that religion and state combined is a concept from times past, and that the state must distance itself from religion. However, it must not distance itself from ritual. The argument for religious freedom was a matter of benefit; by separating shinto ritual from religion, it created a separation of buddhist and shinto administrative controls. In short, buddhism would be free to proselytize and promote its teachings unhindered.
Meanwhile, shintoists countered with a need to resurrect the Jingikan, unify religion and state, and ensure that religion is Shinto. Tanaka Yoritsune, Chief Priest of Ise Shrine, likened the association of religion and state to the Pope in Rome where-.
The State was caught between both arguments. By 1875, they had shifted alignment towards Shimaji's idea and ended up dissolving the Daikyoin. The Shinshu Buddhists campaign was a success. The State was no longer susceptible to arguments for proximity of state and religion, and the idea of "shinto as non-religion" became a powerful weapon in the hands of those seeking to gain from shinto's split.
One important thing to keep in mind with the Shinshu victory was that they declared their intention to accept Amaterasu (the sun goddess, main kami of the Ise Shrine) as the imperial ancestor while simultaneously making her integral to Shinshu Buddhist teachings. This veneration of the Emperor likely helped the State with the shinto as non-religion problem. You might see where this is headed.
