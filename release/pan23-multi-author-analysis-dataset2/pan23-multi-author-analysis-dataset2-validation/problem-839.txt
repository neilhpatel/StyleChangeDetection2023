The worst case scenario is that you pay the lesser of fair market value for her car or the cost to repair, her costs of medical care, and the costs of her rental car.
There is also the possibility she is making the claim through her insurance and her insurance carrier may run an asset check on you to see if it is worth pursuing a subrogation claim against you for anything they pay related to this claim. If that’s the case, you may get a demand letter from a lawyer or collection agency on behalf of her insurance company asking to be paid back what the insurance company paid. Sometimes they sue people for this amount. I’ve seen this occur more frequently in recent years. Try not to stress too much because there isn’t anything you can really do until it happens.
That’s worse case. From your description though it’s a scrape she doesn’t want to get bothered fixing. Some people would rather live with a scrape than having to take it to a shop, be without their car for awhile and then hopefully collect from you.
Your location matters but she usually in the us has about 2 years to sue you for whatever she’s out. People lie and it’s not unusual for claims of medical to pop up just under the time limit.
You have to just show up if sued and if it’s over the small claims limit hire a lawyer to represent you. She doesn’t automatically win claims, she’d have to prove whatever it was is due to the accident. And there’s something actually to it.
