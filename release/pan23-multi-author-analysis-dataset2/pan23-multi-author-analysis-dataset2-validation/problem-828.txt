Where do you think Mexico is? Mexico as an independent unified criollo-run state did not exist until the 19th century. (Criollos were people of Spanish descent born in the Americas, as opposed to peninsulares, or Spaniards born in Spain living in the colonies).
"Ancient societies" in North America predate the existence of the people called the Mexica and the United States of Mexico by several centuries. Between 1821 and 1848 "north of Mexico" meant something very different than it did after 1853. Density of population is not the only measure of social/cultural/political thriving. On that note, I want to refer you to an answer by /u/RioAbajo about and what /u/Reedstilt wrote to answer .
/u/Yawarpoma, /u/historianLA and others also have answers in the last link of the previous comments.
This submission has been removed because it is or it has the effect of promoting an opinion on contemporary politics or social issues at the expense of historical integrity. There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through differing political lenses. However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.
