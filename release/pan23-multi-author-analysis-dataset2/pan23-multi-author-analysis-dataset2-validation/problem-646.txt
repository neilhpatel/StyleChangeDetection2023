There's probably not a legal issue with it, unless your client works with very sensitive data. It may or may not be something that her employer is willing to accommodate, though, on either a single case or on a more long-term issue. It really sort of depends on what you need to discuss with her supervisor.
They're trying to pressure her into taking a different position within the company. It's rather close to the legal limits of what they're allowed to do, as far as I'm aware, as they were handling it over email until recently when they verified with her that she has difficulty speaking on the phone. Now they insist on phone calls, and have even gone as far as sending an unfilled document to request accomodations, telling her they'll take care of filling it all out after she signs it.
It is unwise to sign blank forms. From what I can determine, there isn't anything concerning about the company having a form discussing accommodations or having the company fill out that form (this advice is given online and there are sample forms to this end available). But from those I found, her signature would be to confirm that everything on the form is accurate (and she obviously can't confirm the accuracy of information that isn't yet included).
