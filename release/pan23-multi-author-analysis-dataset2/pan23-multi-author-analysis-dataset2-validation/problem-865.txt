I'm not actually sure you see I survived covid with drastic effects to my body nd psyche and I feel I deserve compensation. I was mentally ill before but now it's worse and ive been diagnosed with more illnesses I'm sorry I shouldn't have come here I don't even know what to do I'm so lost an angry because I was a lot better before this.
THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERMENT DID TO ME I followed every single fucking guideline during quarantine I only left the house for my fucking doctor appointments and I ENDED UP ALMOST LOSING MY FUCKING LIFE YOU LITTLE SHIT I SUFFER FROM NIGHTMARES OF UNIMAGINABLE TERROR! DO YOU THINK I ASKED FOR THIS? CALL ME A TROLL I DONT GIVE A SHIT BUT WHO ELSE SHOULD I BLAME?
Did the USA inject you with covid whine you were in custody? How the flying fuck do you think the govt owes you for getting sick?
You troll bad. First you want the govt to pay you child support and now you want them to pay because you got sick?
It is a illness. No one did anything to you. The govt didn't do anything to you. There is no one to blame when you catch a cold or the flu or covid. Shit happens. People die and almost die from cancer every day. They don't get to sue anyone for it.
I mean, the govt pays for research grants for the medicine likely used. And may have paid for some of the doctors education.
Do you use govt insurance? Because you may not want to sue the hand that literally feeds you and paid for your treatment.

In another comment you said you survived Covid. Are you sure you want to blame the government for your trauma, not thank the government because you survived? Or maybe a little of both?
