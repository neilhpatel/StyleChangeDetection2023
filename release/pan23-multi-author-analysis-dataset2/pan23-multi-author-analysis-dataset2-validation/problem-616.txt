If your dog damaged the fence, you are liable to replace it to prior condition/function, and we can't know if this means it can be patched in the one spot or if some portion of it needs to be replaced. We'd have no way of knowing.
I don't know why you feel like you should wait until the "last possible minute" if not just to antagonize them. Your dog broke the fence and gets out into their yard. They aren't at all unreasonable in wanting you to repair that, including not wanting to do the labor if you buy the materials. If you're unable to do it yourself, you need to hire someone.
If you and they disagree on what's a reasonable repair upfront, have a few fence repair companies come give you a quote for the repair, and present them to the neighbor as a negotiation point. If you're unable to reach a compromise, you can tell them you'll settle it in court.
Of course you can't sue the neighbors because their tree branch hit a power line and knocked out power. If anyone has recourse against them, it would be the power company, but even that's not by any means a certainty. It depends on what exactly happened. You also can't sue the power company for whatever failure on their part caused it to take a day and a half to restore power.
You just need to just fix the fence and let go of the pettiness. You can them to the postmaster for putting the note in your letterbox or don't; it's over there in the pile with "accidentally caused power outage" in things that aren't relevant to the fence dispute.
It is not lawful to put letters in people's mailboxes, but this is really is not something that people get charged and arrested for, almost ever, and absolutely never on this scale. It's also worth mention that if you try to use it as leverage/a threat to settle your civil dispute over the fence -- you'd be committing extortion, which is a criminal offense. So maybe don't do that?
Okay, fair enough. I did want to be a bit petty and wait to repair it out of spite, but now I guess I’ll just do it. However, by repairing that picket I am restoring the fence to its original condition. I just looked it up and apparently it is a federal crime to put letters into people’s mailboxes if they are not mailed. I think I will talk to them today agreeing to replace the picket, but with the warning that if they harass me again (especially via another nasty letter or with a lawsuit even after fixing the picket) I will report them for the letter.
I ended up sending them a respectful message stating that I would repair any damage caused by my dogs and fortify my fence more on my side so ensure they never get out again. I declined to repair the entire fence as my sole expense. I told them to reach out to me for a deal if they wish for this so we can split the cost in a reasonable way. I also told them to text me in the future instead of sticking a letter in my mailbox since that is illegal. Hopefully that satisfies them.
Let them know what you believe is fair, and go from there. If you and they can't reach an agreement on what fair looks like, just tell them it's clear negotiation isn't going to work, and they're welcome to pursue the matter in civil court. Only you can know what's worth to to avoid being sued.
