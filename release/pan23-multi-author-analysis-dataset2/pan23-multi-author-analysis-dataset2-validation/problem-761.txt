If they did this to all employees it could be for a couple of reasons. Companies are moving to not having PTO or sick pay and then changing company policy to unlimited PTO. This keeps them from having to carry that liability on their books. The company can also play some tax games by paying this out and making it look like they made less money.
NAL but the employer may be okay here. In CA, PTO is considered part of the employees compensation, so that when you leave a company they have to pay you for it.
What it sounds like he is doing is giving his employees the same money as if they left, but this way there is no "banked" time, everyone gets paid for their PTO.
If she is concerned about later having to take a day off where she won't get paid, stick this payout money into a savings account and then take some out when needed if she has a day off without pay. She is still getting her sick/PTO payment, just in a lump instead of per day.
Accrued vacation and sick time is an outstanding liability on the books. Perfectly normal to limit the amount that can be accrued. Without going too far into the weeds, many companies operate almost totally on a revolving line of credit. Lowering liabilities increases shareholder value/dividends.
