Idk why everyone finds it too fantastical that the FBI was doing this on social media. I think it's even more startling that the main topic in the comments is about how bad daily wire is and not the fact that we have zero regulations surrounding major social media platforms to prevent scenarios like this from happening. Whether its true or not is less important than the fact that it could be true.
Also Trump said he used the FBI to help DeSantis win. But the Daily Wire won‚Äôt report on that, because Ye said that DeSansit gave the Daily Liar 100$k.
I mean, people post The NY Times and Washinon Post here. You know, the ‚Äúnews‚Äù organizations that are so corrupt and bias that the French President had to personally call them up and bitch them out for the lies, bias, and politically correct agenda they spewed when France was attacked by terrorists ü§∑.
To be honest, the Post and the NYT go too far to be "unbiased" - to the extent that they refused to call Trump's statements "lies" for years, even when everyone knew that they were.
