The best answer here is that Jefferson was likely being ambiguous on purpose, allowing different groups to read into the declaration what they wished. Although the oft-uttered pronouncement that most of the "Founders" were is somewhat overblown, in Jefferson's own case the label is pretty apt. Jefferson was known to be quite intentional about his word choice, so his insertion of the terms, "Nature's God" and "their Creator" rather than something more explicitly religious like "Our Lord" was without a doubt intentional. And given what else we know about Jefferson, he likely hoped that this sensibility would translate for a general populace and grant a sort of secular air to the Revolution. But he was not insensible to the religious character of many of his countrymen, so using an intentionally vague term like "Creator" could satisfy any Christian, Quaker, Jew, or Deist who read it.
Jefferson himself was fairly irreligious, even among other gentlemen of his Age, who tended to be somewhat more secular than many of their contemporaries. He would always count his Bill for Religious Freedom in his own native Virginia as one of his great accomplishments (a distinction, somewhat puzzlingly, he rarely gave to the Declaration of Independence). The bill, which took nine years to be enshrined in state law, removed all religious tests for office, eliminated church membership as a requirement for residents, allowed absolute freedom of conscience, and disestablished the Anglican church (and separated church and state) in Virginia. In the long run, this would become a model pattern for other states, but it's worth noting that much of New England continued to have established Congregational (Puritan) churches into the early 19th century.
Jefferson's irreligiosity would later be the source of controversy in the 1790s when tensions between his Republican faction and the ruling Federalist Party came to a head. During the election of 1800, , “\[We must\] prevent an Atheist in Religion and a Fanatic in politics from getting possession of the helm of the State.” Though it is also worth noting that despite being a somewhat traditional Episcopalian, Hamilton was hardly of an evangelical mind himself--according to Gordon Wood, when asked by New York constituents why he and the other constitutional authors had omitted God from the Constitution, Hamilton allegedly replied, "we forgot."\[1\].
Follow-up question: The preamble to the OP's quote beings with, "[We] hold these truths to be self-evident: [...]".

Possibly, though I'm less confident in a definitive answer here. The whole document is steeped in the language of the British Enlightenment, so it sort of stands to reason here. I am generally cautious about ascribing a universal "Age of Reason" set of values because there is significant variation in Enlightenment thought by nation and region.
The end of the 18th century was probably as close to the low tide for religiosity as one can imagine in the United States, at least among the educated classes, especially when compared with the evangelical fervor that would erupt in the early 19th century, much to Jefferson's own chagrin. The "contemporary Christian" view you posit does not have solid grounding in historical fact, at least as concerns people like Jefferson. This is in part why it's so puzzling that modern fundamentalists like would focus on Jefferson of all people to try and squeeze into a Christian-America narrative. Jefferson's secularism was hardly a secret to his contemporaries, let alone to 21st century historians.
I read before that "self-evident" was an intentional choice instead of "sacred", in an attempt to imbue the phrase with rationalism, a popular choice in the Age of Reason, and/or distance it from a directly religious association.
To the second part of the question, though, "Is it meant to imply that 'their Creator' can mean their parents, and that the phrase is talking about birthright citizenship?" I would have to consider that explanation unlikely. Though Jefferson was using fairly secular, Deistic language, it seems less plausible he was referring to the biological creation from parents. "Birthright citizenship" did not even become the standard until the 14th Amendment after the Civil War. Precisely who was a citizen was a somewhat controversial notion at the outset of the republic. The 1790 Naturalization Act, for instance, stated that "any free white person" could be considered a citizen, along with free white aliens who resided in the United States for two years (this was lenhened considerably in the infamous Alien Acts of 1798, though that law would lapse and naturalization periods would vary later in the 19th century).
The phrase "self-evident" seems somewhat more common in the British and Anglo-American Enlightenment than it is in continental thought. Hamilton also applies a "self-evident" scheme using slightly different language to various moral propositions in . Hume, as serious a figure in the Scotch-British Enlightenment as any, famously held that it was impossible to construe normative statements from positive ones (the "is-ought" problem), but seemed to consider moral propositions as "self-evident" in the sense they could not be derived by purely rational examination.
However, were there any contemporary philosophers or other thinkers that challenged the use of "self-evident" here? Because it essentially is an unfalsifiable statement, held as an axiom that cannot be challenged, and many thinkers, especially those from a rational school of thought, might have an issue with framing it that way.
Did people see the phrase "self-evident" and construe it to be just be "sacred" or "God-given" by another name? Or did the term have a more specific meaning? Was the phrase uncontroversial because it essentially repeated a Lockean view on rights, which by the time was already held by Anglo-American philosophy as the dominant theory? Or were there still other theories of rights (e.g. Social Contract), that might not be opposed to the specific rights enumerated, but be opposed to framing them as "self-evident"?
I would say the Lockean theory is probably the best explanation here, as most audiences with a modicum of education, and even those without one through popular culture, would have grasped these principles. I would say here that "social contract" thought is not really distinct from Locke, as both Locke and Hobbes are considered part of the "social contract" school of political thought, though their conclusions and language are different from Rousseau's, who is more explicit in his use of the term.
Jefferson, in a , would also claim that he did not believe there was anything particularly novel in the Declaration of Independence, "neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the \[A\]merican mind." The influence of Locke is readily apparent here, though, and Locke is cited as such in the same letter. Much ink has been spilled over trying to explain Jefferson's substitution of "pursuit of happiness" for "property" in the Lockean triad of rights, and I would not pretend to give a definitive answer on that part here.
