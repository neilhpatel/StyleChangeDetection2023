You canâ€™t force the employer to hire you, even with a false positive. You can notify them of the false positive and offer your test results.
Your prospective employer can require you to take the program if you want to work there, unless you have a contract or union agreement otherwise.
Not being forced, but not taking it will stop me from being hired until i take this program and get cleared from disa, my employer will also not accept the other results since im not Disa cleared, i just dont want this to affect me in the future. And im not against the employer im more against DISA since like i said is the one that shares the content with the employers, i tried talking to them but say my only option now is taking the return to duty which costs $500 and gets me suspended for 30 days with the company i was going to work for.
I work for this company most of the time, i work on the plants, and like i said on the post I dont consume any type of drugs, in this case cocaine I had the 2 tests with disa come out positive (same hair sample) and another one with a different clinic different sample that came out negative, the only valid one they say is the sample they have, should i just accept what they tell me and take the program? Even tho i dont consume drugs?
