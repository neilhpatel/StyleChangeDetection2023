But then you realize that in some countries you make $20-50... a month. And it's not like costs of living are so low that $10 buys you an apartment. For instance in Venesuela that aforementioned Big Mac is around $1.5-1.8. Now average wage in the country hovers around $25-30 a month. As in - 160 workhours for 18 Big Macs. Compared to a minimum of 256 in USA. It's hard to find good up to date numbers on Kazakshstan but what YOU think is "barely afford food and rent" means a VERY, VERY different thing in other regions.
Okay, Central Asia is composed of 5 countries. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
Now, in this situation do you think they can do ANYTHING openly against Russia? Remember, we are talking about a country that has to invade something every few years or citizens (and to a larger degree government officials) grow sad that their Glorious Soviet Empire has not conquered any new land.
I don't want to sound overly mean, but "wealthiest" doesn't paint the real image of how poor these countries are. It's like saying "weathiest housing project." It's not an accurate representation.
