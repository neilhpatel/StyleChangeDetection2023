I would trust Glantz on the Red Army performance. If you read a bit of Glantz, many of his works are massively detailed and massively sited in Russian documentation and in German.
Portraying Glantz as a guy who is just out to extol the success of the Red Army is just not a fair assessment of his works. I would say instead that Glantz is making the information within of Soviet sources available to English speaking audiences often in formidable detail. I don't read Russian, but I've never heard of Glantz having been shown to have misused or misunderstood his Soviet source material, (he's probably made some mistakes just because who could write so much without a mistep, but overall he's considered reliable). Also, Glantz doesn't seem to pull punches critiquing the Red Army, just look at his titles and subtitles! "Stumbling Colossus: The Red Army on the Eve of World War", "Kharkov 1942: Anatomy of a Military Disaster", "Zhukov's Greatest Defeat: The Red Army's Epic Disaster in Operation Mars, 1942 ", "Red Storm Over the Balkans: The Failed Soviet Invasion of Romania, Spring 1944 " Do these titles sound like a man who is out to Whitewash the Red Army?
In the video, Kotkin claimed to own a number of Glantz's works, but Glantz is massive and can be a tough read, so I can understand why Kotkin would have difficulty summarizing him.
In any case, Kotkin's critique of Glantz seems wrong to me. I sort of suspect Kotkin is out of his depth on military issues generally. He has not written any specifically military history and so I'm not sure he can claim to be an expert on the military of the Soviet union, his works seem to be more about Soviet politics.
There are two major thrusts to his criticism: one, that the Red Army as a fighting force and particularly its officer corps was more incompetent than the 'revisionist' authors have argued (Glantz at the lead in terms of impact, but not to exclude Richard Simpkin, Chris Bellamy, CJ Dick, John Erickson, Jacob Kipp, Bruce Menning, Shimon Naveh, and many many others); two, that Glantz specifically is overly uncritical of the Red Army's performance. I will address each of these thrusts in turn, because while Kotkin is an outstanding diplomatic historian he is not a military historian and in this lecture it shows.
This is not intended as a slight against Kotkin, but - in this particular case he does not know what he is talking about, or else he is being very intentionally provocative. It is true that Stalin did not allow the manning of the security zone on the border, as he was quite nervous about giving the Wehrmacht even the slightest provocation; this was also the rationale for his refusal to let NKVD border troops conduct serious counter-reconnaissance patrols and his refusal to let the PVO (air defense forces) engage German recce flights.1 As you may note, this does not reflect any particular desire to avoid the mass encirclement and destruction of the so-called Blitzkrieg. Indeed, at the outset of the war, efforts were underway to bring forward the materiel from the defensive belts along the old Soviet border (the so-called "Stalin Line") and construct a new defensive belt along the borders of the territories annexed in 1939-1940 (the so-called "Molotov Line"). Stalin's intent was clearly to defend the new Soviet territory at or near the borders, rather than trade space for time.2 In addition to flying in the face of Kotkin's claim that Zhukov & Timoshenko foolishly requested this only to be rejected by Stalin, this was entirely consistent with the Soviet military doctrine of the time, which called for prompt counteroffensives. Red Army forces in the frontier regions were, as per Defense Plan 41, organized in two strategic echelons. The first strategic echelon consisted of two operational echelons, which were deployed relatively forward towards the border for defensive operations. The second strategic echelon was placed some 700km back from the border, so as to remain safe from enemy air attack, and was intended to counterattack and carry the fight into enemy territory once the invading offensive had been worn down & culminated under the resistance of the first echelon. Again, this was doctrinally consistent with prewar planning (both before and after the general doctrinal turmoil of the Purges and the Winter War with Finland, actually).3 More importantly, though, for our refutation of Kotkin: this was a coherent and militarily reasonable approach for defeating the rapid, mobile and encirclement-focused style of modern warfare which characterized the "Blitzkrieg".
This brings us to - forgive me for a forced metaphor - our own counteroffensive thrust, after having blunted his thrust through the details in the previous paragraph. Kotkin claims that Zhukov and Timoshenko were unprepared for the war because they were incompetents who didn't understand Blitzkrieg. Leaving aside the fact that "Blitzkrieg" is a questionably useful term to describe the German approach to warfare4 the idea that Zhukov or indeed any senior Red Army commander in 1941 didn't understand the ideas behind Blitzkrieg is frankly laughable in the face of the evidence. They may not have been good practitioners of it - the examples of the Winter War and then 1941-1942 certainly indicate that many of them were not ready to fight this way with any proficiency - but the matter of aggressive, mobile, large-scale industrial warfare was the preeminent discussion in Soviet military circles during the decade before the war.5 The notion of the 'deep battle' and subsequently the 'deep operation' was the Soviet response to the problems of modern war highlighted in World War One, just as the "Blitzkrieg" concept was (in essence if not in name) the German response. Many Cold War-era writings describe Soviet doctrine & practice as "Red Blitzkrieg." It is not a terribly accurate name, but it is evocative of the similar emphasis both approaches placed on rapid, bold maneuvers, the use of tanks to pierce the enemy defensive lines and then carry or 'exploit' the attack into his rear areas, and the general necessity of highly mobile, heavily armed combined-arms formations to overcome enemy defensive lines & destroy the enemy's fighting mass. Indeed, the single biggest difference between the German and Soviet conceptions of modern war was that the Germans thought you could win in a couple of decisive battles, while the Soviets concluded that you needed coordinated campaigns of many decisive battles to overcome the resilience of modern armies. In short, Kotkin is dead wrong when he says Zhukov and Timoshenko didn't understand Blitzkrieg, because they'd spent the last decade doing something pretty darned similar themselves.
It is bedtime but I will pick up in the morning and address the broader question of "was the Red Army incompetent in general?" I think /u/white_light-king has already made the other point I was going to make, which is that Glantz is actually quite critical of Red Army failures, and is not at all hesitant to take the Soviet/Russian historiography to task for being itself too lenient on RKKA commanders & heroes like Zhukov. In fact, in some Russian-language amateur-history circles not unlike this subreddit, there is actually some animosity towards Glantz for what they see as typical American chauvinism and Cold War rhetoric.
Isn't Glantz's whole thrust with the 'forgotten battles' angle that the historiography has focused on the Soviet headline successes like Stalingrad, Kursk etc. while ignoring failures like Operation Mars, or am i misinterpreting his argument?
That's part of it, though it is equal part focused on restoring light to all the 'minor' or otherwise forgotten defeats and victories which were simply left out of the major postwar narratives. For instance, a lot of Soviet operational-level counteroffensives & spoiling attacks at the outbreak of Barbarossa simply never got much attention. They were, in the West, subsumed into the Barbarossa narrative of a sweeping victorious advance, and in Soviet historiography they were minimized because they were generally not effective. If you go and read the sort of headline paper for his 'Forgotten Battles' series, he offers a bulleted list of a dozen operations from July-September 1941 which are just not talked about in most books for more than a paragraph. \[Glantz, D.
