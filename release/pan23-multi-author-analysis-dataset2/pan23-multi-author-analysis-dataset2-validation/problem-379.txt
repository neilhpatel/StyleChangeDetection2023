I've been reading William Urban's The Last Years of the Teutonic Knights and overall I'm enjoying it. It's reasonably well written book about a subject I know relatively little, but it's definitely an interesting period of history that Urban manages to mostly succeed at making coherent and understandable to someone with no expertise (no small feat as there are a lot of people with constantly shifting alliances to keep track of).
William Urban is something of a weird figure in the study of history, though, and it definitely impacts my enjoyment of the book. He's a perfectly respectable academic who taught at a small American liberal arts college for decades and has been actively engaged in the study medieval Baltic history and the Teutonic Order specifically since around the time my parents started going to school. In terms of his publication output, it's almost exclusively in popular history (the book I'm reading being no exception), and generall I applaud that. I wish academia took the importance of producing books that can educate the broader public more seriously. My big issue with Urban is that in his published books he doesn't use notes. Not just doesn't use footnotes, he doesn't use notes at all - the only references are a couple of pages of Further Reading at the end of the book and the occasional reference to a specific book or historian in the text.
My problem with Urban's lack of notes isn't that I necessarily believe I am likely to be deceived by him. By all accounts he is a giant in his field (which is, in Englsh anyway, quite a small one in fairness) and I don't doubt that he does his due diligence in terms of research and analysis for his books. My issue is more that while it might in theory make the book more accessible to general audiences (do we actually know how turned off by notes "general audiences" are?) it makes them far less useful for anyone interested in using them for any kind of scholarly work (like me!) Not because I can't verify his sources, but because he gives me no path of where to go next if I find something interesting that I want to know more about. The Further Readings just point me to more big texts, what if I want to know more about something that only appears in one paragraph? Urban gives me nothing. He says in his introduction that he happily receives queries from students and scholars and provides references to help people where he can, which is very generous of him, but he's also like 80 years old (Wikipedia actually only lists a birth year for him, no month, so /shrug?) and he can't be doing that forever.
- Stealing Speed is good for bits but gets quite a few things wrong about surrounding events which makes some it feel off.
I also must confess that just reading a work of history without notes makes me feel uncomfortable, kind of like I'm skydiving without a parachute. Just not a pleasant sensation.
I have great time reading both the Tales Of Bygone Years/ Primary Chronicle "by Nestor" & Chronica Slavorum by Helmond of Bosau. They are so well written it's like you're reading almost a light fantasy novel. And the best thing is, they are both credible sources!
That's a long and possibly needlessly introspective look at a book I've read like 60 pages of, how's that for a random Thursday? The tl;dr is that it's pretty good, maybe check it out if it sounds interesting.
I'm reading Cubism and Its Enemies by Christopher Green, and it's fascinating. It's like...an art history written like a political history. The various art movements of France in the 20s -- late Cubism, Dada, non-objective painting, Surrealism, lingering naturalism -- are like political parties vying for supremacy. Super interesting, I think even if you aren't as into that period as I am.
I really enjoyed Iraq: A History by John Robertson. It's basically a history of Mesopotamia from pre-history to the modern era - I think it ends with Saddam Hussein with very little discussion of the Iraq War at the end. Obviously it doesn't go into tons of detail because it's covering a huge range of time, but as an introductory text to the region I found it fascinating and engaging.
I think part of my struggle with Urban is that in a lot of cases there isn't another work in English that covers many of the subjects he writes on (especially history of the Teutonic Knights) in a more academic way. If Urban's book represented the popular history and I could turn to another book (or books) that did do the more academic (with moderate to heavy usage of notes) thing then I'd applaud the fact that the popular histories of this period are written by an expert on the subject working in an academic environment. As it is, Urban is often all you've got and while that is by no means his fault it does alter the frame through which I view his work.
