Where do you actually live? The state you divorce in is more important than the state you marry in. The reason I ask is because alimony is very state-dependent. Where I live in Texas it's rarely ever awarded.
You mentioned in a different comment having your own attorney review this. Can I assume this means you had your own attorney and did not share one with your husband? The reason I ask is that pre-nups have been thrown out before on the basis of being signed under duress, however, I'm not sure how having an attorney review this would affect your ability to have one thrown out in that case.
If you have a good relationship with your husband, and the marriage is great as you mentioned, then I suggest looking into adding an amendment / addendum to the prenup you signed to restore the 10-year limit you initially agreed to.
You can amend it, or do a post-nuptial agreement with language that supersedes the prenup. I'm not sure on your situation, but the prenup that I ended up doing was to protect both of us.
The situation you described screams "under duress" to me. We both wanted a very smooth process so we started drafting our prenup 6 months before marriage, and tried to ensure we just couldn't go after each other's assets (we're both independently wealthy).
(1) where do you live - different states take into account different things as far what can be enforceable in a prenup.
(2) did both of you have your own independent lawyers review the prenup and advise you on the prenup? If you did not the prenup is weaker.
Thank you so much. We live in NJ. I did not think to consider an addendum, thatâ€™s such a great idea. I did have my own attorney and she did recommend against doing this so quickly but as a stupid, young, inexperienced-with-this-shit bride-to-be I went with it. To say I am furious with myself is an understatement.
I would certainly go to a second attorney if the first one did not explain to you points number 2 and 3.
(3) the time prior to the wedding that your prenup was reviewed and signed is important. Last minute prenups can be interpreted as putting additional pressure to sign the prenup. Again different states may look at this differently.
1) we live in New Jersey. Do you think I should have a NJ lawyer review this? My original was in Philadelphia, PA (where we lived at the time).
3) That's exactly what I felt, pressure. Sign this by Friday or your wedding is canceled! I met with my lawyer 2x. I was wrapping up work priorities before I took off for 2 weeks, finalizing wedding plans, packing, shipping things.. and had to do this in between. It was so fucked up.
