Best bet is to wear a suit, show up for your court date, be apologetic and contrite and willing to take whatever punishment is offered. You can ask if there is an option for a drivers Ed class (at your expense) to avoid the point against your license, but that’s it. If you act in this way, you have the best chance for the most lenient of punishment available. If you argue it, try to get out of it, any of those shenanigans, I guarantee you the judge will be much, much harder on you.
I don’t believe so, as I was trying to make the yellow light. I would lose 2 days of wages for paying the ticket that’s why I’m considering fighting it if I have a case.
I know it sounds like I am trying to make excuses, but trust me, I am a pretty new driver so I am legitimately afraid of going above the speed limit. I try to drive as safe as I can and I just didn’t want to stop at the intersection.
You should be legitimately afraid of running a red light. Red light runners are more likely to cause injury than in any other type of accident, and fatal car accidents due to red light runners are more likely than Any. Other. Fatal. Car. Accident.
