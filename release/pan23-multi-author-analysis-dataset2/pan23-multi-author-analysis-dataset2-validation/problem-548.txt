Non competes must have a defined scope in terms of lenh and location. While the 1 year is likely fine, the scope of all of the US most certainly does not. Additionally, are you currently employed by the company? If not, were you laid off? What type of telehealth do you do? What areas of Massachusetts are served by the company?
Yes still currently employed. The tricky part is that my company does provide services for all 50 states and covers a broad amount of specialties, so itâ€™s not specifically one specialty like behavioral health only for example.
Actually it's not tricky, it's too expansive since you only work in a single state. Additionally are you licensed in all states that you see clients from?
If that's all it says, go to an employment lawyer and have them read it. You agreeing that terms are "fair" really don't matter if the state seems them unfair.
Well that's good. Anyways as I was saying the region is way to broad especially considering that each state has laws about what a non compete can cover. Does the non compete say anything about what happens if one of the terms is determined to be unenforceable? Generally there will be a clause saying something along the lines of "if any restrictions are too restrict they will default to the state maximum".
