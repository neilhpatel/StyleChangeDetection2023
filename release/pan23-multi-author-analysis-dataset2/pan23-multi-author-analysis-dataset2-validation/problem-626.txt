In general, employers have the right to surveil their business so long as they don’t violate their employee’s rights. California does have stricter personal protections in this regard, but it’s not clear if your right to privacy has been violated.
Your definition of private and how it would be defined in a California court have to align. What you believe to be a private space may not actually be one for the purposes of determining your personal rights. You’ll want to consult with a legal professional familiar with this legal space. They’ll ask questions like:
Is this room lockable? Are you the key holder for that room? Is the space used for other business purposes?
In addition, you’ll want to look at your employee handbook. It may detail how your employer surveils employees. If so, that may constitute as having given notice.
Your reaction to finding the camera is valid, but you’ll need to secure professional assistance outside of the scope of what this subreddit can provide to qualify a legal response.
There is a lot of gray area when navigating a business’s right to protect its interests vs infringing on employee’s rights, and it would come down to specifics that will need a legal professional to help you sort through.
It is also worth noting that the California Privacy Rights Act, passed in late 2020, modifies the timeline for protection standards granted to data derived from employees in a business setting in California. Think of CPRA as sort of a publicly-voted amendment to the protections initially granted in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
And US-based employers generally have broad powers to collect and monitor data from workers in a workplace environment. California included. CCPA, interestingly, doesn't put immediate limitations on the actual initial collection of consumer or employee data. Its strongest consumer control mechanisms involve limitation of the sale of that data to downstream third-party buyers.
Now, organizations in CA are allowed to push back their privacy compliance for employee-derived data back to 2023. Generously speaking, this is likely to accommodate necessary changes in IT architecture and systems as employers gear up for more robust data privacy compliance in accordance with CCPA. But in reality, it leaves sort of a functional blind spot in data protection law, since protections for employee-generated or derived data are sort of stranded in an ambiguous grey zone until 2023.
That seems legal because you wouldn't expect any decent privacy in the area, and workplaces do have the right to install cameras in areas that not like the bathroom where you would expect privacy.
Because of the lack of privacy in public i would assume so that it is legal, but if it's that big of a deal you can talk to an attorney or a law firm that is good with work place environments.
> California makes it a crime to record or eavesdrop on any confidential communication, including a private conversation or telephone call, without the consent of all parties to the conversation. See Cal. Penal Code § 632. A California appellate court has ruled that this statute applies to the use of hidden video cameras to record conversations as well. See California v. Gibbons, 215 Cal. App. 3d 1204 (Cal Ct. App. 1989).
