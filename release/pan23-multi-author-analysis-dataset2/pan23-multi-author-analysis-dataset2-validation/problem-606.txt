Adverse action is required when not hiring based off the result of the consumer report. That is for the hiring company to initiate as the background check company doesn’t make hiring decisions.
FCRA “no requirement or prohibition may be imposed under the laws of any state...with respect to any subject matter regulated under... section 15 USC 1681c...relating to information contained in consumer reports, except that this subparagraph shall not apply to any state law in effect on September 30, 1996” 15 USC 1681t(b)(1)(E).
Texas law is preempted by the FCRA since it wasn’t enacted until 1997. Because of that, this law is generally ignored in the industry.
The pre/adverse action notices would be the claim. You could file a complaint with the FTC over the lack of notice, or hire a private attorney.
Yea the adverse action is definitely an issue. You have a right to dispute the report before the decision is made and the letter should specifically indicate the charges they are considering. It may be a hurdle since they never stated it was the background check, but all signs point that way.
Thanks for the response. Yeah it was my understanding that under Section 604 of FCRA I was also supposed to be issued a pre-adverse action letter detailing the potential adverse action and the information that led to that decision. Also, under Texas law (and a few other states) employers are limited to a seven-year criminal background check regardless of convictions. If the employer discovers older information, it can not be used in hiring decisions. The most recent item on my background check is from 2013, older than seven years.
Thanks again. I may have to sue in state court under a violation of Texas Business and Commerce code instead. I may have to set my sights on the employer rather than the background check contractor since they chose not to hire me based on information older than seven years in violation of Tx state law. Gonna keep doing my homework over here snd see what I find. I’d like to send them a notice of intent to sue with settlement demand first. Is this generally a good idea? Also what would be an appropriate amount to demand as a settlement? A years wages? 10 years wages?
You’re right up on that Texas line for 7+ years for a job with a $75k budget. You might file a complaint with TWC - but I wouldn’t expect that to hold.
You could file a complaint with the EEOC over the use of old/irrelevant criminal history in an employment decision.
The “problem” with the FCRA is that there’s no defined enforcement agency. So complaints could be handled by the FTC, the CFPB, or the state AG if you’re not filing a lawsuit.
If no attorneys will take the case on contingency, it’s either not a slam dunk or the 25% of $10k isn’t worth the paperwork.
You can make complaints to public agencies without an attorney, but suing without one would be a challenge.
