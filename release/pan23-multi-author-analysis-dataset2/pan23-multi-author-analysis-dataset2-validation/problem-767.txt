How often did he request it? Did he try calling the water company to find out how much it was? Did he ever negotiate with the landlord and say something like, "I still haven't gotten a bill for the water so I'm going to start adding $45.00 to my rent check every month, is that okay?".
Definitely asked for water bills at least a couple times. The landlord says that "he's on it". Honestly pretty shoddy landlord when it comes to getting stuff done. The dryer was broken for at least 4 months of being there and it took forever to fix it. Also no actual water bills have been received.
Landlord always just says "he's getting to it". He said months ago that he's getting the water bills to us as he was getting the other side of the duplex ready to rent out. He's extremely frustrating. We end up having to text his wife since we can never get ahold of him.
