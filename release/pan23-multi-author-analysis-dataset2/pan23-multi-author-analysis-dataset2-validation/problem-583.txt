someone can probably sue you for the injury. If the injured party was an employee of the kennel, then the party suing might be the worker's comp commission recovering the benefits they paid out to the injured worker. An owner might also be an employee and might be covered by WC (that would be situation-dependent and state-law dependent most likely).
But whether the cost is borne by the injured party or an insurance policy, ultimately the cost can be passed on to you. Worker's comp typically doesn't allow claims based on pain and suffering -- eliminating those claims is part of the value proposition WC offers employers and the state.
The general rule is that a pet owner is liable for harms caused by their pet -- unless there is clear evidence of provocation or mishandling of the animal. This would also be governed at least in part by your agreement with the kennel -- like whether or not the staff accepted responsibility for animals that would need to be muzzled, or something like that.
It probably doesn't matter why they felt the need to find out why the dog was bleeding. Imagine if the dog had been injured and the kennel did nothing despite seeing that the dog was bleeding. Would you be questioning why they did NOT intervene?
There are a lot of people who will read "did not want to let go" and leap to a conclusion about the dog just based on that. The fact that some breeds are bred to do exactly that doesn't make the injury not your responsibility.
I'd hope that a professional kennel would want to find an outcome that doesn't jeopardize the dog's future, but that possibility is something you might want to keep in mind when talking to them about what to do next.
Your best first step might be to find out what the injured person and/or the kennel wants to do about this.
Would you recommend trying to settle with the kennel proactively? I would be happy to give them money for presumed expenses, but what I am really scared of is this becoming something that costs 10s of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. That will destroy us.
I would not have been frustrated that they did not want to engage with an animal they presumed to be injured. I've been very clear with my worries about my dog's anxieties and that I can be contacted at any time for any reason if they feel the need.
Also, I am wondering if there is any "assumption of risk" applied to people who work with animals in NY state. I've read about this online (in my frantic googling), but only for other states. I did not see anything specific to my own state. I'm just wondering if that would alleviate some of the liability.
In the agreement that I signed with the kennel, they clearly state that if an animal is injured, the owner will be notified and the dog taken to a vet at the owner's expense. It also requires the owner (me) to acknowledge that "nicks, cuts, and scrapes are a normal part of dog boarding.".
Also, my statement "did not want to let go" was not meant to imply that I'd be less liable as the owner. I was including it because it is shocking and upsetting information to me, and in fact, I was worried that it would somehow be an even bigger problem for me.
Because of both of these statements, I had assumed I would have at least been called if they saw blood in his kennel, and that a kennel staffer would not be providing any care without me being made aware.
Also, for background, I spoke with the owner/handler who was bit last night after she left the hospital. She said there were punctures and bruising but no broken bones. I apologized profusely and said I was so upset over this. She told me "don't worry, we've been doing this for many years and it comes with the territory." She ended the call by saying "see you soon" (we have a reservation with them for over Thanksgiving, but we will be canceling it since we don't feel that it is in anyone's best interest for him to be boarded again at any facility so soon and without other behavioral evaluation/intervention).
I honestly did not have the presence of mind last night to ask additional questions about what happens next. I did leave a message today, but they haven't called me back yet.
It sounds like the injured party isn't going to come gunning for you, so there is probably nothing to worry about. If they asked me in a situation like this to cover the cost of a doctor's visit and stitches or whatever, I'd generally agree without hesitation. That's not legal advice as such -- you always have the right say no and their recourse would be a lawsuit.
Well, the person would have to have suffered tens of thousands of dollars to sue you for tens of thousands of dollars. You generally don't' get life-changing money in a lawsuit for personal injury unless you got life-changing injuries.
Assumption of risk most likely would not enter into it. Assumption of risk is usually an issue relevant to a negligence claim. This isn't negligence, it's what's called "strict liability" -- your dog bit someone, so you can be held liable. It's the same thing with questioning why they examined your dog to see if he was injured -- that's something I think a boarding kennel would be expected to do, unless there was already prior indication that the dog was dangerous.
There was no prior indication that the dog was dangerous, but I did indicate to them many times (and in writing) that he was anxious and becomes stressed easily, and so needs to be handled with care and caution.
I emphasized it to the point where I got the impression they thought I was a little nuts (I realize these posts are doing nothing to indicate otherwise...).
I also am wondering, because I don't know anything about this, if strict liability applies when he had never bitten or shown vicious propensities before. As I live in NY state, I am aware there is a "one bite rule" for dogs, but I don't fully understand it.
Once again, thank you - I really appreciate this. I would be willing to cover medical bills if they asked. I'm not interested in a legal battle.
Regarding negligence, can you also explain to me what would constitute negligence? For example, my veterinarian knows my dog is highly anxious and always ensures he is muzzled and has an additional tech (2 total) restrain him before he is examined in a way that would cause discomfort or pain (receiving vaccines, for example).
If an experienced animal care professional knew a dog was anxious/nervous and stressed and did not take proper precautions, would this be negligence? I assume not, but I just wonder why. I trusted these people to take care of my dog and was as transparent about his issues as I could be.
Now his nails are clipped down to the quick and he pulls his paws away when I try to examine them (which he did not used to do). I only mention this because this kennel does not offer grooming services. If they did, I would have stated explicitly that I didn't want him groomed (because of his anxiety, which was clearly disclosed).
I also noticed yesterday that his nails had been clipped. I clip his nails myself and had noticed they were long and meant to clip them before I brought him in, but became very busy with work. My vet has told me that long-ish nails are not a health hazard as long as they're not growing into the paw pad (not even remotely close), so I wasn't concerned.
I know this isn't a legal issue, and I could not prove this in court anyway, but it bothers me because I now suspect that they clipped his nails, cut one of them too short (causing the "injury" and bleeding - which by the way is very painful to dogs) and then sprayed him with the "wound spray.".
But this might have been your one "Mulligan". I have no idea if this would now mean you should keep the dog muzzled. In many states, a dog considered to have a reputation for viciousness can be a liability even if a trespasser on your property gets bit.
This situation would be stressful to any animal but especially to an anxious one, and like I said, I would not have consented to it for my dog, and would have explicitly told them to do no grooming procedures at all if I had known it was even in the realm of possibility.
They also never asked if they could/should clip his nails (my vet clips my other dogs nails for me because she's a nightmare about it, and they always ask first), and they never told me that it had been done. This feels dishonest somehow, since the "injury" in question is one of his nails.
I also reread my homeowners policy and called my insurance agent, because I may have been mistaken about assuming pit bulls were excluded. It looks like there are no breed exclusions listed in my liability policy. I am still waiting for my agent to confirm, though. This would alleviate concerns about a law suit. Though I am still really worried about my dog.
OK apparently NY follows the "one bite rule" -- meaning that an owner isn't liable for injury if the dog has never bitten anyone before. I guess that works out to your benefit here. IDK if this incident will count as the "one bite" going forward, but I would imagine it does. It wouldn't be tied to there being a record of a prior attack -- it would be the owner being asked in court "has your dog ever bitten anyone in the past".
I did a search for "new york state dog bite liability" and got a few legal blog articles on the subject. These are often a reasonable source of information but are disfavored here becuase they're almost always marketing information for a law firm.
Apparently a NY jury can award damages or ignore the one-bite rule if the nature of the attack was particularly vicious, presumably on a theory that an owner of such a dog is at best willfully ignorant of the dog's character. It doesn't seem to fit what you've described happened, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.
I didn't see anything about mandatory euthanasia, and given NY is a one-bite jurisdiction it seems unlikely that it would be mandatory for a dog that has not bitten anyone before.
