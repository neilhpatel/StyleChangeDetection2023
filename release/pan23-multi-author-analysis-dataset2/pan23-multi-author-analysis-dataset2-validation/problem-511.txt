Just recently read more about pol pot and his regime. That man was actually out of his mind. I didnt feel right for a while after reading about the shit those people were doing. Sick bastards.
I was alive back when the Cambodian genocide was going on. I remember when I heard they were killing people just for wearing glasses because they felt those people looked smart so might be a threat to their revolution I was absolutely dumbfounded that the world wasn’t stepping in. The next time I heard the phrase “Never Again” I said right then “Bullshit” A 15 year old kid shouldn’t be that jaded by international politics but welcome to this world.
You'll note that by and large it's conservatives that compare relatively benign things to the Holocaust. This is to dilute the phrase and lessen the impact of the comparison, so when they do things that are actually like the Holocaust, people just shrug and say "everything is like the Holocaust nowadays".
removing children from their legal asylum seeking parents with no plans to ever reunite them, and performing forced hysterectomies on women = kinda like the Holocaust.
I do wish these people would stop being so fucking neurotic about things that aren't nearly a big a deal as they claim.
Removal of children and a populations' ability to have children is one of the literal definitions of genocide.
You're right, the southern border policies in the US are not the exact same as the Holocaust. But they are similar in intent, i.e. genocide. Vaccinations are not.
