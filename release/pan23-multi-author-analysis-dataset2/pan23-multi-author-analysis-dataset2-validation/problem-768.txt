Newly elected LA county Sheriff Robert Luna had made campaign promises to cleanup the criminal gangs that have infiltrated the LASD. So far his promises have rung hollow, but it's still early in his term.
We do this every election. We vote for a Sheriff who promises to clean up the department, only to find out that heâ€™s just as dirty as the last guy. I am not hopeful Luna will be any different.
Luna successfully ran against former Sheriff Villeneuva and promised to address the agency's gang crisis.
