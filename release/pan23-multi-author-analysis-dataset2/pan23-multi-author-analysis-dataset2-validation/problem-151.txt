China's got that inside info from their spys that the USA/NATO will be focused on Russia for the next 2-5 years....this is the perfect opportunity for them to focus on retaking Taiwan.
Little do they know the USA is feigning the Russia response to bait China into taking a foolish action. This will allow the USA mainstream media to paint China as an aggressor/evil bad actors against the poor, defenseless, democratic Taiwan. It's easy to get western minded folks to be against the 'evil Communist China' . Unfortunately for China the military response against them will be severe and cripple them for the next 100 years or more.
They could expand their borders but they would have to do so by conqueroring North Korea, Mongolia or Kazakhstan. The world powers have said 'No, not going to happen' when it comes to Taiwan.
China has and continues to build long range nuclear weapons. The u.s. is working on brining chip production home. Taiwan will receive the same support ukraine received, maybe a bit more as the navy will want to flex.
I would of said this 100%, After what we saw happen in the house No telling what this cockamania bullcuck government can or will/not do... honestly this could of been what China was waiting for...
