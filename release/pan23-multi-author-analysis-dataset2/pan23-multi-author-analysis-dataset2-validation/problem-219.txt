e.g. During the Battle of the Marne, did d'Espérey know that he's fighting the German First Army, led by someone named Alexander von Kluck? (although the question isn't necessarily just for this specific engagement).
There are occasional weapons which are heavier for which we can't easily tell the purpose. That is, we don't know if they were battlefield weapons or ceremonial weapons. One such mystery is this 5.8kg pike:
Peter Brown's World can also be recommended for 1. Being very short, 2. Basically inventing the concept of "late antiquity" in the first place, 3. Pace the original question, making clear in developing the concept of late antiquity that it wasn't actually a European phenomenon and that you have to look at what was happening in the East where Islam would eventually predominate as a connected enterprise.
I'm thinking of the end of the Western Roman Empire, but also how the kingdoms that followed operated, North Africa under the Vandals, the early Byzantines, the early Church, etc.
What is the best book you would recommend to learn about European history in Late Antiquity / Early Middle Ages?
Minor M. Markle, III, "The Macedonian Sarissa, Spear, and Related Armor", American Journal of Archaeology 81(3), 323-339 (1977).
The heaviest regular practical battlefield hand-to-hand weapons usually weighed between 2kg and 3kg, with some a little heavier. This is the weight range for Zweihänders, excluding ceremonial/parade non-fighting ones. Similar large swords, 2-3kg, total lenh about 150-180cm (5-6'), were used outside Germany, e.g., in Scotland (usually with German-made blades), Italy, Spain, Denmark (with some in a unique Danish style), and elsewhere in Europe. Also used outside Europe, e.g., in China (changdao) and Japan (odachi), with both of these being single-edged.
Even longer are pikes. Long pikes (say, about 5.5m long) would weigh about 2.5-3kg, about the same as big two-handed swords. Not only were these practical weapons, they were also sometimes very common, dominating the battlefield (unlike big two-handed swords, which were rare). The pike has to be the winner for big-and-practical.
There are estimates of the weight of pikes, notably the Macedonian sarissa, that are much heavier than 3kg. Markle (1977) estimates about 5.5kg. However, heavy estimates like this are based on the heavy Vergina spearhead which is very unlikely to be a sarissa head because it's too heavy (Sekunda, 2001) and/or reconstructions with thick untapered hafts.
