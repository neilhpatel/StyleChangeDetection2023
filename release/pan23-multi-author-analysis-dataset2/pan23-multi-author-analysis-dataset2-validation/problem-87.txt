Also, why would this have affected Aurel-ian, but not Aurel-ius, especially given that Marcus Aurelius was adopted by Antoninus Pius?
Just to point out, the examples you give (Aurelian, Domitian, Octavian) are the anglicised versions of the Latin names. Romans would not have used these names, but would have said Aurelianus, Domitianus and Octavianus. Is this maybe the source of your confusion?
This link has a description of the name changes that occurred upon adoption as they were generally practiced in the 1st century BC. As I mentioned before, the fairly strict rules originally governing this had started to break down by the 2nd century, and while there was still the idea in place that adding -ianus denoted a name changed by adoption, not all adoptees apparently did it.
The “-ian” suffix that you see in a lot of these names indicates adoption into another family. The original nomen or cognomen would have “-anus” or “-inus” added and then be appended as an additional name to the adoptee’s new name. The classic example is the adoption of Gaius Octavius by Julius Caesar; he became Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, or Octavian (to distinguish him from his adoptive father. (He then, of course, later became Augustus, or (to use the full official name, Imperator Caesar divii filius Augustus.).
Oh wow, thank you! I’ve never seen this explanation given before. Do you happen to have a source I can follow?
You know, this may be confusing but it is reassuring that it ought to be so. So often I find that I assume a sort of consistency throughout a period of culture that just isn’t realistic in practice- such as naming customs. Knowing that this can be irregular will quell any confusion I have in my future readings. Thank you!
