Popular Science had 350,000 subscribers in 1928. The German magazine Kosmos was selling 200,000 copies a month through the 1920s. The Science of Life (1929 by H. G. Wells, Julian Huxley and G. P. Wells) sold hundreds of thousands. (For comparison, Time by 1927 was considered influential and had roughly half the subscriber base of Popular Science.) The public in 1920s had a hunger for science -- they had, after all, seen the rise of the automobile, the airplane, and the terrible weapons of WW1, and wanted to know more -- but trying to gauge the public reaction to this specific scientific discovery is still a tough ask, as.
The German documentary Our Heavenly Bodies from 1925 (originally titled Wunder der Schöpfung, Wonder of the Creation) was a follow-up to the 1922 smash hit Die Grundlagen der Einsteinschen Relativitäts-Theorie explaining Einstein's theory of relativity. The 1925 film was also a major success and did at least some international touring (a reconstructed copy exists because part of the film was found in Helsinki and merged with another portion of the film found in Berlin). It is a tour-de-force of 1920s special effects including stop motion animation and forced perspective.
Near the end it features a series where space explorers move further and further away from earth, and because light takes time to travel, the explorers see going progressively back further in time. It isn't quite clear how the explorers are outrunning light, but they seem to be using a fantasy ship much like Carl Sagan's in Cosmos, which is appropriate given the movie is essentially the 1920s version of Cosmos. (The film makers had, of course, just made a science film on relativity, so it is unlikely this was a "mistake".).
Curtis (and another astronomer, George Richey) had found novae on nebula. Novae require rather specific conditions that mean they ought to be rare -- they need to be a white dwarf that gathers material from a paired stair in a binary star system causing an explosion -- and the fact that multiples were discovered in a short time could be explained by, as Curtis wrote: "were these spirals in fact congeries of vast numbers of stars, like our own Galaxy". In other words, the number of novae could be explained by reviving the island universe theory.
What the movie does _not_ include is the idea that leaving the Milky Way leads to other, entirely different galaxies. Even though 1925 is after Hubble's observation (where he found a variable star in a nebulae and was able to reckon the distance, verifying.
that the "island universe" theory was true) it hadn't quite filtered down yet to mass communication in a general way -- also note that the film took over 2 years to make! This was in the period where the island universe was considered a viable theory and nobody had quite proved it yet. By 1927, though, Popular Science :
c.) this is one of many discoveries at this time, science was fast moving, even if we just focus on astronomy, so it isn't like one particular moment would be thought of as epoch-making at the time.
d.) there was enough lag time in the idea being popularized that it would be difficult to mark the moment when a particular person in "the public" knew about it.
e.) the idea of island universes had been around for quite a long time already, and it was a subject of recent debate so _confirmation_ of what was already considered in the 18th century doesn't represent a sudden shift in reality that might get a reaction, even from astronomers who were close to the knowledge.
There _was_ a sudden shift in reality from Hubble's discovery, but it wasn't from the confirmation of island universes. Before we get to that, let's step back in our time machine of the mind to the 18th century--.
He used the specific term "island universe" quite a few times, apparently for the first time (Von Humboldt used the term "Weltinseln" in 1850 which could have been translated that way, but it was translated instead as "world islands".) Even if the concept was restricted more to musings of philosophers in the 1700s, the mid-1800s had the idea brought to the public.
Emanuel Swedenborg's ornately titled The Principia Or, The First Principles of Natural Things, Being New Attempts Toward a Philosophical Explanation of the Elementary World from 1734 is perhaps the first attempt at something like a "island universe" theory, although not in those terms.
This was essentially pure philosophizing, imagining the visible heavens as a "single sphere" in the sea of the infinite, akin to medieval cosmologists having arguments about "is it possible for void to exist" based on pure argument. (Nicole Oresme from the 14th century: "...if two worlds existed, one outside the other, there would have to be a vacuum between them ... it is impossible that anything be void...").
Thomas Wright in 1750 independently came up with the same concept, with more reference to evidence: "...is in some Degree made evident by the many cloudy Spots, just perceivable by us, as far without our starry Regions, in which tho' visibly luminous Spaces, no one Star or particular constituent Body can possibly be distinguished; those in all likelihood may be external Creation, bordering upon the known one, too remote for even our Telescopes to reach." He theorized the center to the universe has "the Divine Presence or some corporeal agent full of all virtues".
This was picked up by the philosopher Kant not long after (who directly referred to Wright, and while taking the general idea discarded the "corporeal agent full of all virtues" concept) and then finally the great astronomer Herschel, looking specifically at nebulae. Herschel did eventually (after some attempts to measure distance) settle on nebulae being within the Milky Way.
It wasn't until the mid-19th century another attempt at reviving the idea was tried, with from the Earl of Rosse of Messier 33, leading to speculation from Alexander Stephen in that the “Milky Way and the stars within it together constitute a spiral with several (it may be four) branches"; this was shot down again with some misunderstandings of size.
More or less simultaneous to this the actual full term "island universe" was coined by astronomy popularizer Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel at Cincinnati College. Mitchel started a "citizen science" group in 1842 by offering for contributing (minimum $25) to building an observatory to be a founding member of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society and be able to use the telescope. Unfortunately, Cincinnati College burned down only a few days after the telescope came, so Mitchel switched gears to become a traveling popular lecturer; he founded an astronomy publication he called The Sidereal Messenger that was, according to the first issue:
Despite these slight outbursts of interest, the idea wasn't treated seriously by astronomers; Agnes Clerk in 1905: "The question whether nebulae are external galaxies hardly any longer need discussion. It has been answered by the progress of research." However, the 20th century soon after (especially post-WW1) had a focus on nebulae again, but this time with newer spectral methods of observation.

>And what incomparable wonders lie beyond? Countless other universes -- billions of them, we are told -- what inconceivable distances yet to be surveyed!
The astronomer Keeler at Lick observatory had -- by improving a reflector telescope that nobody had wanted to work with, including a spectrograph -- had spectacular success in May 1899 with photos of the Whirlpool nebula, M55 (I don't have the original, but ). This led him to realize the sky was chock-full of spiral nebulae that were not otherwise visible with other tools. Unfortunately, he died not long after, but his work was continued by the astronomer Curtis.
(Mitchel unfortunately did not outlive the Civil War -- he was called up as a Union General and while stationed in South Carolina he died of yellow fever.).
The odd thing about the debate is that essentially both participants were right and wrong at the same time. Shapley argued that the Milky Way was simply larger than projected but nebulae were still part of it. (As the Boston Sunday Advertiser noted a year later on May 29: "Universe Thousand Times Bigger, Harvard Astronomer Discovers".) Curtis -- with the novae argument I just outlined -- brought forth the need for island universes. Shapley contended, essentially, that the island universe argument would make the scale extraordinarily and impossibly large. Curtis essentially agreed that the scaling would not make sense, just that Shapley was otherwise wrong.
