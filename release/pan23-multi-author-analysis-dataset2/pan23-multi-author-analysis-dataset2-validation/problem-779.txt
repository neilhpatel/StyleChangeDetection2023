I get what this author is trying to say, and I appreciate the sentiment. There is more to this story, though. The US is part of a much larger problem, the problem of the human condition. It is a symptom of a more lethal disease, and that disease exists in everyone, regardless of what nation they reside in. Humans are relentless in their pursuit of comfort and pleasure. Where there exists the means, humans will exploit every resource they can, without consideration for externalities or consequences. Unless humans can learn to live with less and consciously reject comfort or material improvements, the species is doomed.
