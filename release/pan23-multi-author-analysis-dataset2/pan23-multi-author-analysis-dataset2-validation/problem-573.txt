If you created it on behalf of your former employer, at their direction and as part of your job duties, it belongs to them and you should turn it over to them. If you delete that work, which they paid you for (willingly or not), they could sue you for its value. It's impossible to say what value that would be (presumably, at least the amount it would cost to pay an employee to recreate the deleted account and content), or whether they would bother to do so. If you want to avoid the risk of legal action, you should transfer control of the account to them.
Edited to add: I did use the company logo that I downloaded from the website. Occasionally staff would wear a shirt provided by the owner in a photo (though the shirts themselves were nigh impossible to get).
Were you paid hourly, and did you work on this account during work hours? When and where were the photos taken, and by whom?
Yes and no. I opted to do it, to increase business because part of my job was tipped. I was never given any tools or anything to create any of it, though I do believe I attached it to my work email. I was not instructed to make any social media accounts, I just chose to do so because many of my customers were.
Ultimately, you might be able to successfully argue that if you created this account on your own time, and on your own initiative, it belongs to you and not your employer. However, the only way to find out if this argument would be a successful one would be to wait to get sued by your former employer, and hire a lawyer to make this argument for you in court. Personally, I would hand over the account as-is rather than taking that risk, but you may decide to do otherwise.
Generally, the subject of a photo does not have any particular right to it removed, if they initially consented to having the photo taken and used for a certain purpose.

I was hourly, much of the work was done on property, but NOT while I was clocked in. It was often when I would stop in to conduct my own personal business, or when a specific employee would be working. Often I would say to myself, "Oh, it's just 5 minutes, I don't need to clock in for five minutes. That'll make payroll more annoying." So I would just go in, take 5 or 10 shots, leave and post the photo or video later. There were definitely some images and videos taken while I was on the clock.
