To be clear, you're wondering if you can get out of the notice requirement? No. And it's possible that you'd owe more than a month of rent. Exactly when you terminate matters. It's something like, 'the termination takes effect the last day of the month after the month in which the landlord is notified.' If you gave notice today, you'd owe rent for this pay period and for November.
They also said that the space was not occupied by a service Member but that link has a section that clearly states an apartment paid monthly that is occupied by a service member or dependent.
It's an interesting situation, because it sounds like you were living separately from your sponsor. Still, if you're on their orders, I believe you are afforded the same privileges. Pretty much what happens next is that you can decline to pay all but what you rightfully owe and they can report against your credit, (which you should dispute with evidence that you invoked the SCRA), or sue you. If they sue you, you'd raise the SCRA as a defense. might be able to give you more effective advice about how to convey your rights under the SCRA to your former landlord. As might the legal office where your sponsor is stationed.

Title: Am I covered from paying $4500 in legal fees for terminating my lease early with military orders?
I was trying and was told verbally (unfortunately didn't get it in writing) that i was all good and taken care of but was later sent an email overruling that decision.
