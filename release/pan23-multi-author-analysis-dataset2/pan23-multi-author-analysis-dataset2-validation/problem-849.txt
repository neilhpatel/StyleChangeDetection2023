The day that I found that she had lied to the adjuster, I began my search for one. I guess all the time wasted and stressed caused can be a lesson to prevent it in the future. Doesn't make me feel any better, but I guess it is what it is.
No you won't get any compensation for finding proof that the other driver was at fault. They had a statement from their insured they are required to treat that as 100% the truth until there is evidence to prove otherwise.
Let's say the roles were reversed, would you want the adjuster for your insurance company tracking down information to put you at fault?
As for the returned calls and such you said it happened 2 weeks ago so that right there wouldn't warrant 15 calls and multiple emails to the adjuster. Nevermind thst happening over a few days. They have no duty to you and calling them that much has the potential for them to drag their feet. For you it is your only claim, for the adjuster they probably have 100 or more.
I think I wrapped up all attempts into this. These 15 or so calls were to the adjuster, his supervisor his supervisor's supervisor and the resolutions department. In all I probably only called the actual adjuster 3 times a day for 3 days and emailed him and his supervis√≥ twice which i don't think is too crazy. Once in the morning, once at around 1400 then once at around 1700.
3 calls a day plus emails is excessive. As I said they have probably 100 or more claims on the go, nevermind those claims they have ther obligations like queue calls, meetings, lunch, breaks etc.
If you were busy with other things I'm sure you'd understand 3 calls and emails a day is frustrating.
Yeah, I was busy with other things before their insured came crashing into my and my pregnant wife's life.
I've had a job where people called me constantly. Hundreds a day - and that was on top of the physical labor that went along with that job. I made sure that I spoke to all of them. And my job was far less important than deciding who's fault a vehicle accident was in order to determine who gets the bill. Nevermind not coming home to my own family until they're in bed, and not spending the entire day in a kush office.
Perhaps they should hire more more adjusters, or replace the ones that can't handle it, because that's what would've happened to me.
Even the customer service reps that tried to put me in contact with them thought it was insane that they literally couldn't get ANYONE from their office on the line or to answer company chat.
10 seconds to acknowledge via email in a day and age when you have the ability to do that at all times, there's no excuse not to.
Bring the downvotes, but you're not going to make me feel sorry for them for not answering me for 4 days by saying "what if you," because their worst is still better than my best. They wasted more of my time, and caused me more stress than I did to them with my 3 phone calls. Give me a break.
