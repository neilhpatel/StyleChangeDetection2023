You don't have to talk to the police, and this sub will 100% tell you not to, unless you have an attorney. Ignore them unless you are arrested, and if you are, then don't talk to them until you've hired an attorney and been advised by them what to do.
You may have performed an illegal eviction if you put her stuff on the curb. So that's another good reason to not to talk to cops.
If yout get a court notice do not ignore it. If you get mail or certified mail do not refuse it. This is small claims court stuff. Get a consult with an attorney only when you get notice from an actual court. In many states attorneys are not allowed in these courts. Don't worry.
The value of used clothing is quite small. She'd have to use ebay, craigslist, and goodwill to prove how much damage was caused. She'd have to find the closest used item for value. It would likely be misdemeanor territory, and I don't know if cops would even bother charging a case like that, especially if they know you aren't going to talk to them. I will say if you talk to them and they can get you to admit any illegal actions (such as the illegal eviction) then they will 100% charge you because you admitted it. So keep your mouth shut. Block the ex and have no contact of any kind. If anyone knocks on your door ignore them, whether it's your ex or cops.
You don't talk. If the police have enough to arrest you, they won't need to talk, they'll arrest you. If they are not yet arresting you, it's because they need you to say something--anything--that gives them just enough of a crack of light to make an arrest. So yes, you don't talk, and if arrested, plead not guilty, continue to not talk other than that, and ask for a court appointed attorney.
