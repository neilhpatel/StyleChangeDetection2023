Yes. The police in the county you reside in could do that, if they were so inclined. This may not be a priority for them though.
Turn yourself in (preferably not on a Friday or weekend), bond out, get a lawyer appointed, enter a plea. Or just hire a lawyer now and see if it can be resolved without you turning yourself in or if you can arrange to surrender and just be booked and immediately released.
All evidence will be handled at your trial. The warrant is already issued so right now that is what you need to deal with.
They can show up at any time, at 4 a.m. at your house, at 2 p.m. at your place of work. Or they can just wait until you get pulled over for speeding or have some other interaction with police and then arrest you on the spot for the outstanding warrant and have you picked up by officers from the other county, if the other county wants to bother to send officers to collect you.
It's likely that your accomplices or associates identified you, especially since the alleged theft occurred a few months ago and was apparently significant enough to justify assigning a detective.
Such a theft might even have been significant enough to justify the collection of fingerprints. If you've been arrested before, or have a gun permit, or worked in education or healthcare... lots of reasons for your prints to be available to an automated ID system.
Warrants are valid until they're satisfied by you being detained or appearing in court. An attorney might be able to get the warrant "quashed", have you pay bail, and schedule your court appearance to be arraigned and plead not guilty all without you having to appear in person at all, or appear via Zoom.
But on a very low budget, you might have to do the more mechanical process: travel to that county, surrender voluntarily, get booked/printed/photographed, and wait for a bail hearing (and of course pay the cash bail or buy a bail bond). It's common in my jdx for a person accused of a misdemeanor to be released "on their own recognizance" if they surrender voluntarily, where they might otherwise be required to post bail.
Once you have your arraignment hearing (often at the same time or same day as the bail hearing) you can apply for the services of the public defender. Put together a summary of your financial condition, because most places you have to be indigent or otherwise financially qualify.
As noted by others, surrendering early in the week is ideal; most bail hearings happen the same day in busy courts, but you could sit in jail for 3 days before seeing a judge if you're unlucky enough to get arrested on a Friday.
Most minor property crimes don't justify police coordinating with neighboring jurisdictions to execute arrest warrants at a suspect's home, but this also isn't something you can avoid easily by just staying out of the town where the Hobby Lobby is. You can be arrested and held for transport by any police agency in the state if you happen to encounter them for a different reason.
And as always: DO NOT try to explain, excuse, or lie to police about a crime, whether your are guilty or innocent. You simply tell them "I will not answer any questions and wish to speak with my attorney".
You can contact the public defenders office in the area you hand your warrant and see what they suggest.
But right now you need to focus on not ending up with spending a significant amount of time behind bars.
It isn't going to 'go away.' You can certainly turn yourself in and sit in jail and wait to see if you can bond out. But then you still have criminal court.
We don't know. How many times did you steal from them, what did you steal, how did you steal it, who else knew about it, how did you get to the store (did you drive a car registered to you and park it in their parking lot), and what did you do with the stolen item?
Yes I know it won't go away, but what are the steps to take to make sure I won't have a warrant, like paying a ticket what do I do here in order to get rid of the warrant?
