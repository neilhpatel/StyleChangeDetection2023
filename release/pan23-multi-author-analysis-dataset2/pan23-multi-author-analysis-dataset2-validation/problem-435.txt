No one broke any laws here. Your dog acted aggressively when it shouldn't. The human acted aggressively in response.
But,there is a very clear paragraph in regards to harassing neighbors which includes use of inappropriate language, and it mentions it breaking the contract.
He (my dog) did not break any noise ordinance rules,nor did he attack. He barked and as I kept walking he stopped. On the other hand what this person did could be considered harassment.
Hopefully it is a case where the person may have some type of handicapped,and then I can let it go.
But,I won't live here with someone around whom thinks it is ok to harass me when I am walking my dog in the designated area.
You should train your dog. There is nothing to do now or if this happens again. People can say not nice things. Not a legal issue.
Nothing in regards to that. And seeing as he was on the second floor and my 25pound dog was outside on a leash and quickly stopped barking,I don't see how he would qualify as an aggressive dog.
