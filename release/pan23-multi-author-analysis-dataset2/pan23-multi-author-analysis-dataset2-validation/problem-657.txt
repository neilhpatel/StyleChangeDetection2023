You did it. You admitted to the officer under questioning that you did it. You were charged with a lessor offense than the one you actually did. What is your defense to the charges you wish to plead not guilty to?
Show up, plead no contest, hope for a reduced fine for it being a first time, ask for traffic school. You will need to pay the ticket plus an extra fee for traffic school. CA gives you a list of traffic schools to choose from. Pick one, there will be an additional fee for that. Do it online if possible. Complete it. Call the court in a few days to make sure everything went through.
That's a good question. I wasn't sure if I could admit to the bad day that I was having and agree to paying the fine and doing a defensive driving course to try to get reduced points.
No contest means you admit you did something wrong but don’t agree with the ticket. Like guilty of something but not what I’m being accused of and I don’t want to fight it.
I’m in CA so I’m not sure if it’s the same. But never go please not guilty if you know darn well you are guilty, and worse he cut you a break. Unless you must have a lot of extra time, money, and a lawyer.
Breathe, it’s honestly not a big deal. Minor traffic tickets aren’t harmful on you if you don’t get them often.
Most non driving jobs don’t care and you only get penalized on insurance if you have points. And it’s not that big of a difference.
Edit: shout out to whoever downvoted me for trying to help. I did open with the disclaimer that I was in ca and it may be different. Have a good day though. I will leave this info for whoever it may help.
