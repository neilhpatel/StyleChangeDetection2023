While you're a minor your parents have very wide discretion over where you go, what you do, and what to do with "your" possessions. So the answer is... maybe.
If you bought the car yourself? Presumably you could do whatever you want with your own car. If a parent buys it for you, and your name only is on the title, then again, presumably you could do whatever you wanted with it but realistically you would need permission from your parent(s). If your mother purchases the car and itâ€™s in her name, and she lets you use it, then you would of course need her permission to drive anywhere, much less to store it at another house.
If your parents have a custody order then legally you can't just go and live with your dad unless you want him to be at risk of being in trouble with the family court system. That trouble can include fines, something your father might not be able to afford. If they don't have one, then you'll probably be okay, but whose name is actually on the car will matter here.
Okay skipping back to what appears to be your actual question. Yes if you buy a car and it is registered bin your name and you have a valid driver's license, you can go back and forth wherever you want.
This isn't a custody issue. You do have to work out living arrangements with your parents but that has nothing to do with you being able to drive to see your friends.
The only other concern would be if your father is in a different State than your mother. Then the car should be registered and insured in the State where you are living.
