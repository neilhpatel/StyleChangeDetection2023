Read as many history books as you can. Find the particular era you like if there is one. Dive into it.
Yhea i was thinking about that. Maybe after I am done. I will look in to a 2nd subject to study, but since last time i went to school is over a year ago i dont want to drown in school work.
Find history people! Lost of places have a local history society, or you can look online and see if there are people you can geek out with stuff about. I have a friend who’s doing a masters in philosophy, we regularly talk about how OTP Socrates and Alcibiades were.
Practice writing essays (that is a huge part of history degrees, at least where I am) even if you don’t have anyone who knows about history, a big part of essays is how they are structured, so try and get people to read them for you and give you feedback on that.
See if you can do some volunteering at a local museum or dig site or something similar, even if there’s no historical opportunities about see if you can get some experience working with kids of a similar age you want to teach (Scouts, Brownies/Guides, Holiday Clubs, that sort of thing.).
Do you have any tips on how to just start writing an essays? Because i have no clue where to begin. I will have to look in people to meet/finding places to volunteer. But i will.
