I will definitely be avoiding this guy’s yard from now on. I hadn’t really considered that the 911 call itself would be documentation—I’m still kinda rattled by all this. It was just the strangest thing to get this worked up over and even moreso that he followed me after I left. Thanks for your reply!
Fair enough. I wouldn’t have guessed that dog urine could damage lawns. Frankly, I’ve never seen this happen myself, anywhere.
Dog urine can damage lawns and it's not unusual for people not liking random dogs peeing on their lawn. Just note those lawns and avoid them.
It's seriously doubtful that this is going to progress further as long as you stay away from that house.
I obviously would have avoided his yard to begin with had I known this would be an issue, but I assumed it was just a standard “pick up your dog’s poop” sort of thing, which again, I already do. Heck, the sign even has a silhouette of someone picking up dog poop on it.
More than anything, I was just terrified by it all and it would be nice if there were some sort of penalty on him for having done this. That’s easily the closest I’ve ever felt to getting punched.
Of course, just wasn’t sure where the line between jerk and something illegal would be on this. I think my greatest concern was that he followed me in his car for this and only took off once he realized that I really was calling 911, but if that’s not anything more than being a jerk (legally speaking), then so be it.
