The translation here is idiomatically incorrect. He didn't say Putin is a "nobody" as if he was a loser. He suggested that Putin doesn't exist, being either dead or incapacitated, and therefore cannot possibly meet to discuss terms with Ukraine.
This is the second or third time in the last week that he has alleged Putin is dead or at the very least, not making decisions in Russia anymore.
I'm not sure what intelligence this is being based on, but more than likely comments like this are just for public media consumption.
To me its more likely that either Zelensky is genuinely pointing out Putins absence or he wants to provoke Putin for whatever reason.
Mr Zelensky said: “Right now I don’t understand who to talk to. I am not sure whether the president of Russia is still alive. I don’t understand that he’s still alive or that it is him particularly making decisions.”.
Ever hear the story about the politician who told his campaign manager ti accuse his opponent of screwing pigs? When the manager said he couldn’t do that it wasn’t true the politician said “I know it’s not true I just want to make him deny it”. Could be the same thing say Putin is out and it will sow doubt and in a situation like they have in Russia where if Putin goes there will be a scramble to take his job, doubt in Russia is good if you are Ukrainian.If nothing else the more Putins media guys deny Putin is dead the more likely it’s going to sound like a cover up since their credibility is shit. Sure Putin can make an appearance but if he doesn’t look 100% the rumors will only get worse.
The problem with this is that Putin can easily put an end to it. So relying on it as propaganda strategy is strange.
Putin could simply make an appearance for something mundane and completely unrelated to the war. Presenting a medal to someone or attending the ceremonial opening of a new building. Stuff like that. Have his speech include a remark on some recent event to counter any claims of it being a prerecorded appearance and you're done.
Claiming that he's dead or otherwise incapacitated isn't really that big of a deal if he's neither of those two things. He could easily refute such claims without making it appear that he cares about the claims.
It could be, but in this other interviews this week he more directly said that Putin is possibly using a body double to hide the fact that he's dead or dying.
