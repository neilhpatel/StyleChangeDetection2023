Your company can require you to get a COVID test before returning to work. Likely, you’re going to be off for quite a few days, because there’s still going to be a self-quarantine period whether or not you come back positive.
That’s what I figure but it’s moreso the issue of it not being a requirement until they realized they couldn’t require me to get a doctors note confirming I have a fever. It seems very... retaliatory? I guess. It wasn’t something I was required to do until I pointed out she was lying about the laws and now she’s finding another way to create a hoop for me to jump through. I guess if it’s legal I’ll get tested anyways (planned on doing so) but it’s kinda shitty she can just up and decide that she requires that now immediately after I told her she can’t require a doctor’s note.
>An employer may generally request a doctor's note as part of its sick leave or attendance policy. However, such a practice must be uniformly applied. The required note should not seek a diagnosis/medical condition; rather, the note should verify that the employee was seen by the health care provider and stipulate any period of incapacity or job-related restrictions. Requesting more information could run afoul of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In addition, federal contractors required by contract to provide paid sick leave may require a doctor's note/certification only for absences of three or more consecutive full days, and the employer must notify the employee of the requirement to provide a doctor's note/certification before the employee returns to work. Employers must also be familiar with any restrictions under state and local paid-sick-leave laws.
(a) An employer may not require medical or other verification in connection with sick leave that lasts less than three consecutive previously scheduled workdays or shifts.".
This is in regards to laws that have been passed last year. Your source is a resource for labor laws but doesn't take into account the new laws passed in NYS, the quote above is from the link above that is from the NYS government website specifying the actual laws.
