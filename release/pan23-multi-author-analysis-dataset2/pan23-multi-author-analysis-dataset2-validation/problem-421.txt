You can file a police report. If this individual is prosecuted you can potentially get restitution. Scams like these are rarely successfully prosecuted however, and you are likely not getting your money back.
Your PayPal dispute failed because you used Friends and Family, which a) is not to be used for commercial transactions and b) does not offer buyer protections... because of a).
Your Wells Fargo dispute failed because their transaction is between them and PayPal. The PayPal transaction was a valid transaction that you authorized, so Wells has not reason to offer you fraud protection, because their part of the transaction (transferring funds from your account at Wells to PayPal) was not fraudulent.
Your complaint with the CFPB did not end with any help because none of the parties that are subject to the CFPB's oversight did anything wrong and the CFPB has no purview over the scammer.
You don't list a location, but almost everywhere $480 would be below the small claims limit, meaning that you would not need a lawyer if you decided to sue.
You are out this money and should take this as an expensive lesson. If you can find the scammer, you could attempt to sue them, but that is going to be a whole lot of effort for very little chance of payoff.
That account may not be real, or you may have the wrong account. And if those accounts don't have real names and locations attached to them, then you have no person to actually sue at all.
The person who you would sue may be in another state or country, making a suit more difficult (or practically impossible).
