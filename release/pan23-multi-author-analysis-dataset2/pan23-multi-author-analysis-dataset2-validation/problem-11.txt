ye he's basically used our money to pay it off so he's then allowed to transfer the title. it does seem fishy.
Run. This sounds like a scam. The seller hasn't got the title in hand, there may be a lien outstanding, and you have zero protection as a buyer if you send over cash. Nothing guarantees he will put this towards the camper.
I am fine with risking it unless there is zero chance we would get our money back, I talked to him for quite some time in person.
Imo walk away - ask yourself why they need the money TODAY when they’re selling this large piece of equipment. It could wait another day. Another week even. Until you have the title in hand I’d be cautious.
Take a cashiers check and go to a branch of his lien holder’s bank. If the agreed upon price is more than the payoff you might use two to pay the lender and the seller, but the lender can then release the title once paid off. Write up a purchase agreement, both parties sign.
Oh if the lender doesn’t have the title on-hand you’ll get a lien release. Take this to the dmv and spend a few bucks to get a title printed and the seller will sign the back.
