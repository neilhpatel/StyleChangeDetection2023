Just saw the film nazi concentration camps on prime. That film gave me nightmares. Yes, there have been dictators who have killed more people but the holocaust was different. It wasnt just mowing people down with bullets or randomly invading villages and raping and killing (not saying that isn’t as bad) but the Nazis built a system to efficiently and systematically murder millions of people.
