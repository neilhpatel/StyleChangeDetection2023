Essentially, yes, even with the necessary modifications due to Obelix being a well wrapped person, compared to others Gauls and their pants.
Obelix's colourful clothing also echoes an historical reality : while official tunics (as in the rest of the Mediterranean world) were rather purposefully simple and/or white (at least for the Druids, quite possibly for magistrates and delegates in assemblies), Gauls famously loved coloured clothing and varied patterns, as evidenced by the , but as well by ancient authors such as Diodorus Siculus1. Probably not all were coloured or with sophisticated patterns, however, and could look more like this.
They bore these outfits as well in everyday life as battle, sometimes (if uncommon) with an armor or the equivalent to roman sagum, a leather apron, but sometimes, as Obelix, without protection and with a naked chest.
These pants were called bracatae by Romans (from Gaulish \braccas or \bragicas), and while they weren't really particular to Gauls (Medes, Persians, even Hebrews had similar trousers), they considered them specific enough of transalpine people that they nicknamed their province in southern Gaul "Gallia Bracata", the "Gaul in pants", something that both Greek and Romans found unfashionable, barbaric (being s) and silly-looking, which didn't prevent their adoption by servile and military forces of the Empire in Late Antiquity (altough still frowned upon by Italian upper classes as far as the Carolingian era).
I must admit I'm not that sure that the effeminate aspect of braccatus is that strong : there's certainly a derogatory aspect in it, but Latin authors () tends to associate them with, disordered, virile aspects, very litterally .
That said, braccatae could, as in AstÃ©rix, float and cover the whole lenh of legs but as well being tight to the knee and float from there, or being tightened to the ankle. That's about the big difference one could spot in what remains a comic device rather than a strict historical restitution.
No, sorry - I didn't mean to give the impression that I'm knowledgable on that subject. I only know basic Latin, so I went to the dictionary out of curiosity after you posted your answer. Here's the one I used, though two of its quotes are unavailable, and it was published in the late 19th century:
>Their garments are very strange; for they wear party coloured coats, interwoven here and there with divers sorts of flowers; and hose which they call Bracae. They make likewise cassocks of basket-work joined together with laces on the inside, and checquered with many pieces of work like flowers; those they wear in winter are thicker, those in summer more slender.
Do not worry, I don't pretend myself having an excellent knowledge of Latin either and my question was genuinely interested.
Breeches are important because they immediatly characterize the Barbarian, or the non-citizen, in an ancient context where appearances can immediatly mark an ethnic and social belonging1 where the non-citizen is standing as puerile and minor. But, from the top of my head, I don't remember it to be associated with women (, of course, but if there's a unnatural disorder for Greeks there, it's that Amazons aren't effeminate).
However, I can't find occurences in texts (including Cicero, Persius, Ovidius, etc.) of braccatus for anything else than referring to trousers and the implication of foreignness; so I'm a bit puzzled on how it's associated with effeminate (unfortunately, a quick search mostly links towards the same source than yours).
That being said, long sleeved clothes were associated with feminine clothing, so maybe in association with overall Gaulish clothing, you might have something there : I'm just not sure it was an obvious implication in Latin however.
