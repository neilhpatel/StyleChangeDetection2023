These are all holding actions at best, and not very effective ones in the long run. The best things you can do for yourself are to move out - as soon as you can, today if you can swing it - and to get a lawyer to help you sort out the warrant and the underlying charges. I know your feelings for your girlfriend are complicated, but you cannot be safe in an environment where someone you're supposed to trust is actively trying to get you jailed, and as complicated as things are, the advice is actually that simple.
However, your ex telling the police who you are is a good reason you might be arrested, as there's a warrant out for you, so I would not count on probable cause-based theories to keep you from getting arrested just because you won't say who you are.
If you're arrested on the outstanding warrant, you will be de facto removed from your ex's home in the process of being arrested and jailed, and if she refuses to let you back in after you make bail or are released on your recognizance, it's a civil dispute (a wrongful self-help eviction) at most. You might not have the time or resources to pursue it at the same time as a criminal defence. I would not count on self-help evictions being illegal, in your shoes.
doesn’t mean that’s true, but then that would force me to prove i’m not that person by then correctly IDing myself.
If your ex tells the police who you are, and you refuse to identify yourself as you're not under arrest, it's a bit of a crapshot. A lot of officers would likely arrest you (if the warrant is worth their time) simply because there's a warrant, and a reasonable chance your girlfriend is being honest, and since you're required to identify yourself once under arrest anyways. If it turns out they have actually arrested the wrong person, they can let you go again pretty easily.
In Texas, if you are not under arrest, you do not have to identify yourself. That doesn't mean she won't tell the police who you are and that you have a warrant, leading your arrest. She should just give you written 30-day "notice to vacate" and then you'd have to be gone in 30 days since you're not on the lease. Perhaps she doesn't know this is an option but it would make her life easier, and decrease the risk to you. Hire a lawyer to get this warrant taken care of so you can get some normalcy back.
that’s what i figured. so assuming she tells the who i am, would still be forced to admit my identity?
hello thank you a lot for your thoughtful reply. i replied this to someone else in this thread but i thinks i should ask you as well.
1. _Mostly_. If you are arrested, you are required to identify yourself, but short of that, you can keep your peace.
doesn’t mean that’s true, but then that would force me to prove i’m not that person by then correctly IDing myself.
And date of birth herself and they will find out u have a warrant therefore police will find an easy fix to the problem. Or you can lie about who you are and hope she doesn’t contradict ur personal information and get away with it. Long story short handle the warrant issue.
2. Any punishment for filing false police reports or wasting police time would come from the police, not from you.
