No. They have been on the lockdown for a while to avoid this exact thing that's happening now. Except people got fed up being stuck at home for three years and started to protest. China CCP had no choice but to open up.
Pardon me but hasn't it been suggested that China's variants are not seen yet in the U.S. or the rest of the world.
The quarantines got lifted due to mass public protest, cause people were being left to burn alive in factories, and general weariness with the quarantine rules.theres nothing intentional going on here.
A functionally unvaccinated population that's lifting quarantine rules that also has some of the oldest citizens on earth? Nah, COVID wouldn't cut through them like a hot knife through butter.
Important to remember Covid is more deadly now so unvaccinated old people are dying at a higher rate now if they don't get proper healthcare, which is hard to get even in the USA.
China has a antivaxers problem in it's older generation who don't trust the government and also even if they are vaccinated the quality of the vaccines are not great and many countries who used Chinese one revaccinated people with western ones.
However I'm yet to see a single source Omnicron isn't more deadly than alpha, which is noted to be significantly more deadly than OG Covid. I've provided sources if you disagree with them provide your own.
Wait is this really a controversial statement I'm under the impression this is pretty basic knowledge. Anyhow in general data on Omnicron and it's sub variants exact harshness is between alpha and Delta which are both worse than the original strain. But in general Covid has gotten consistently worse than with each widespread strain and only Omnicron maybe bucking the trend. Going backwards in time.
The source is a source that has been progressively updated over time and timeline show a clear escalation, with each new strain, with only lastest bucking the trend. Cleanly suggesting Covid is worse now than it was at the start.
