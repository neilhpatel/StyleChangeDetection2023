There are times when I wonder whether the first amendment was intended for press who intentionally mislead the public.
Yes, but when Reagan did it, it was a stroke of genius way to solve a difficult problem. When a democRAT does the exact same thing it's a joke proposal not meant to be taken seriously.

And busting the airline union strike. And dropping funding for mental health, closing hospitals everywhere, oh yeah, let's not forget the Iran Contra affair. But yes, you're definitely correct. He's left of today's GOP or whatever they are..
I don't mean to be argumentative because I think we're on the same side, but the 1st amendment has several parts to it.
Religion is one part. Speech is another. Press is included in speech. The right to assemble and the right of protest are in there as well.
You're right that there's no right to broadcast. In fact the FCC license to do so requires that they broadcast in the public good. But good luck making voters understand that. Millions of people thought President Trump's free speech was being violated when he was kicked off Twitter, a private platform, while he was in office.
The first amendment protects you against government censorship. It doesn't obligate any private entity to give you a platform. And while in office Donald Trump was the government. He didn't have 1st amendment protections at all.
