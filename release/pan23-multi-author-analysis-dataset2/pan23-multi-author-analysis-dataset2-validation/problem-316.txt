Small claims court in Oregon can only award money and/or the recovery of personal property. Pets are property so taking the dog on walks, who the dog likes, that's not legally relevant. You have to approach this like you'd approach a game console like a PS5. How will you convince a judge that this "PS5" belongs to you not him? That he paid for the dog initially is a big factor in his favor. Whose name is the dog chipped in?
No one she’s still chipped to the place we got her from. My biggest fear is I’m going “sue him” for say $3000 dollars (since I have to put a monetary amount), and then he’ll pay it to get out of going to court so then I’ll have 3 grand and no dog.
If he offers to give OP everything she asked for in the complaint, the case is over. It'll never see trial. So, ask for the dog. Or ask for the dog and money.
You can always go to court. He can't "get out of" court by offering to pay you. You sue for money and the return of the dog both. Then the judge decides. You may end up with:
