If the deal is that she is the life tenant with obligations to maintain the property and when she dies you get it, then there isn't much reason to disclaim.
There are calculators online to calculate the value of a life estate. If the life estate holder is 40 years old, then the value of her life estate is about 90% of the value of the house, and your remainder interest is only worth 10%. So if the house is worth $300,000, and she is 40 years old, and she gets a life estate and you get a remainder interest, your remainder interest is worth about $30,000 and you could sell it if you want.
If the deal instead is that you immediately become the owner of the property with all obligations to maintain it, pay tax, pay insurance, pay utilities, etc. but she gets to live there rent free for 20-50 years until she dies, then you might want to disclaim, especially if this is an older property that isn't worth much. You maintenance costs may exceed any value of your right to eventually sell the property when she moves out or passes away.
This is called a "life estate," and it's legal to make such a bequest. However, your parents can't obligate you to accept it. You should talk to a lawyer before you accept the title to understand the situation - the remainder beneficiary of a life estate is, in most senses, a landlord, with all that entails.
"Fair" is not a factor legally speaking, but if you feel this bequest is unreasonable and if your parents are still alive to address it, talk to them and make your wishes clear. If they insist, be blunt that you will disclaim it rather than providing for your sister after they're gone.
It's not a life estate if it ends when the sister moves out. Its a defeasible fee simple. How favorable that is to the OP depends very heavily on the specific language of the grant.
The OP is really going to need to take the specific language of the grant to an attorney to have them review it. If the OP disclaims the inheritance they get nothing. Making a threat that they will disclaim without fully understanding what interest they are entitled to in the land is a great way to turn something that might have some future benefit for the OP into the sister just being given everything.
Even if type of grant just hasn't been communicated clearly to the OP and it is a life estate, the remainderman in a life estate is absolutely not a landlord and they're generally in a better position than someone who just has no interest in the land whatsoever.
As others have explained, life estates are common, but in a life estate, the resident is responsible for the maintenance and property taxes. I’d guess the lawyer will steer your parents in that direction. You have nothing to lose there, as you can always disclaim the house even after your sister passes and won’t bear any responsibility for it beforehand.
As others have explained, you can always disclaim the house. What your parents described sounds like more of a liability than an asset.
However, it sounds like your parents haven’t seen a lawyer about their will yet. When they do, the lawyer will clarify what they can and cannot do in your jurisdiction. My suggestion is to offer to go with them so you can advocate for yourself as they rework their plan or save them the trouble by explaining to the lawyer that you intend to disclaim the house if they do that. That way, you can get the full story before you commit to anything or get into any family drama.
You’re describing a life estate which is absolutely common for the exact reason you described but this is a little different. In a life estate, the resident is responsible for property taxes and maintenance of the home. OP describes a situation where they are liable for the maintenance and taxes. It’s possible OP misunderstood their parents or that the parents misunderstood their lawyer and this really is meant to be a life estate but, if not, this is something a lot less common.
Edit: on rereading the post, it seems her parents haven’t consulted a lawyer yet. It’s possible the lawyer will steer them in a different direction.
Not at all. Remainder beneficiaries have no obligation to do anything. Being a remainder beneficiary entails nothing at all except owning a house free and clear when the life tenant dies.
