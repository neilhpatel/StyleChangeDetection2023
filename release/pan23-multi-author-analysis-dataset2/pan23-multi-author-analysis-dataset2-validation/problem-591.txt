NAL, but it's my understanding (based on my attorney's advice when I inherited money from my grandparents) that inheritance is not a marital property \unless\ it's commingled in joint finances. So in essence, what's mine was mine until I put it in a joint bank account, in which case it became marital assets.
\ I am not a lawyer \ This certainly seems like something you can take action on if your grandmother is ready to divorce him. In the meantime, If your grandfather has left your grandmother alone or is negligent with her care you should make sure someone with her best interests can make medical decisions for her in case something happens.
See if your grandma’s state considers inheritance separate property (meaning grandpa has no claim to it and has stolen it). You likely need a lawyer, but if your grandpa has no claim to the money, that’ll make it easier. I am not a lawyer.
Where is this and can you explain? All whose money? They won't send any of the money to her, who is "her" is it the daughter or the grandma? And if the daughter, how can she not access her own bank account? Is the daughter your sister? Why is grandma entitled to half?
