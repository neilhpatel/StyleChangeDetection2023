Until the child is born, they do not have their own medical appointments. Pregnancy is the mother's medical event, so that means that all pregnancy related appointments are her medical appointments. You have no more right to attend or be notified of them then you would for any other adult's medical appointments. This extends to the birth as well.
AFTER the child is born and once you are established as the father, then you will likely have the right to be involved in the child's medical care and decision making.
Thank you so much, I am trying to find some compromise on time with the baby after its born as well. I have suggested 1 overnight at 4 months and 2 at 5 months. with having 8 hours on sat/sun every other weekend. I have a son already who is almost 5. I went through the same with his mom. I am a super involved dad, have the time and money to take care of both as well. Does that sound fair? I know every case is different...
It's really impossible to say whether or not that plan would be viable because it's not about fairness. Custodial schedules are about the best interest of the child. And while a child who is formula feeding may benefit from overnights with the father to bond early on, overnights may be delayed for a breastfeeding child until they are weaned. So it's all going to depend on what the court sees as the best interest of the child are, and some of that will depend on factors not yet known.
If you want to get ahead of this as much as possible, you can talk to a family law attorney. They can help you set a plan for after the child is born and advise on what local judges generally set for newborn/infant custody.
You've already been provided with an answer, but you should be cautious of whether she's actually pregnant. Particularly if you're giving her money for baby. Do not sign the birth certificate without getting a paternity test first. Once baby is born and paternity is established, don't delay in seeking a court ordered custody agreement.
