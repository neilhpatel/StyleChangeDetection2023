So I’d be willing to believe that Trump has some mixed feelings about Desantis because so many among his base are saying that Desantis is the better-safer option over Trump. History would tell us that his ego is going to take issue with this.
Like, why would you want a fat orange liar, traitor and an overall fucking moron to represent you and your country?
Yale undergrad, Harvard Law, and he's the only Republican getting traction for muscling in on Trump's cult. I'm almost more scared of DeSantis cause he has the discipline to unleash the horrors Trump spitballs and forgets.
However, as long as Desantis doesn’t run against him then I don’t see Trump attacking him in any significant way.
