Nobody can answer that for you. Although I'd ask what you think you are really giving up. What do you think you might be suing Bumble for? Very likely nothing of real value.
And a class action for that would be worth approximately zero. Data breaches are commonplace. And compared to health care or banking information that is lost in other breaches, the value of the loss of Bumble data (to you as a consumer) is just about nil.
But that data is definitely valuable to me and the monetary damage due to such an incident is debatable. Also, it does not have to be a class action.
Agreeing to arbitrate would mean that I am giving up any(most likely) right to participate in any future class action lawsuits. The possible spectrum of damages could range from something as minor as bumble engaging in racial discrimination or something as major as a data breach due to negligence which results in every instance of the user's location data with their pics being sold on the Dark web.
Of course not being on bumble will have the least exposure but that's not the question. Given that I am on Bumble, which of the two is the better option?
Then frankly, you shouldn't share it with Bumble in the first place. Regardless of the style of remedy, it's unlikely that you would see significant money from a breach.
Generally, having the ability to participate in a class action in a situation that would be most likely to happen is most advantageous. However, you have to balance the paltry amount you might get in a class action against what you gain by not giving them your information. And don't forget that very few people will opt out, limiting the practical likelihood of a class action in the event there is something worth suing over.
Which way do you lean between retaining individual capacity to collect damages through a lawsuit and giving up personal info ?
