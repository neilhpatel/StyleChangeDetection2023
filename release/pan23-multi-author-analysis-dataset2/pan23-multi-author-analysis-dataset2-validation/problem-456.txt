I think my mom and her sisters found that paper today while they were going through the house. It does show he was honorable discharge. They said thank you so much r/legaladvice for pointing them in the right direction since no one had any idea where to even start or look. My mom said she called me to ask reddit because she knows it's a great community I use often. She was hopeful we could help get real answers quickly not just guesses. We really appreciate the help!
Thank you so much for this information! We figure that since he only served 1 term that he will get a smaller ceremony. I think what is important to my grandfather is that his service is recognized since he is a Vietnam vet and had many friends die in the war. His strongest memories are from that time of being in Vietnam. He was honorable discharge when he returned, so it sounds like he will get the smaller ceremony. I think the representation is most important i.e. folding of the flag, playing taps, and having a person from the military be there to send him off like he did many of his friends.
When I did Honor guard the funeral director would contact the closest military base Honor Guard and provide the dd214. Different services were probvided depending on if was just a veteran, retiree, or active duty member. For instance, a regular veteran that did 4 years from age 18-22 and died 50 years later would get a 3 person service. Two flag folders would ceremoniously fold a flag and present it to the next of kin, the another member would play Taps on a bugle(usually just a speaker in the horn) then all 3 will do a facing movement and exit the service. Now a retired service member would get a 10 person team. 6 will carry the casket from the hearse and fold the flag together then hand the flag off to the detail NCOIC and then march to prepositioned rifles and do 3 vollys for a 21 gun salute. The ncoic presents the flag to the next of kin. And the bugler plays taps. For an active duty soldier that dies well that’s like 20 people but basically it’s like a retiree but every person does only one job.
My grandmother just passed from covid and my grandfather is in the hospital right now with covid. My grandmother wanted cremation but my grandfather has expressed that he wants casket service with military burial. This would be the first military service burial in our family so we didn't know there were all these awesome resources.
Also contact the local VFW post and see if they can provide additional services or just invite veterans. They most likely have a color guard team or some sort of display they may offer.
I am very thankful for legal advice and giving us this information! It doesn't sound like it costs anything extra to have the military come either which seems like the biggest stress on my mom and her 3 sisters, they were expecting additional costs and are very relieved to know it seems like there won't be. Also knowing how to apply for the military funeral has been a great resource link. It gives us a sense of relief we know a route to take to make sure grandpap gets the recognition he would like during his funeral. Preparing for end of life has been an extremely difficult aspect of him being sick.
