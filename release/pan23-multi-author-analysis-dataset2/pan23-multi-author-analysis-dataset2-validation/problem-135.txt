Your girlfriend is only getting "evicted" if she doesn't leave by the end of the notice period, (which will vary per the exact reason her tenancy is being terminated). Eviction is a legal process. Just having your tenancy terminated is not the same as eviction. She only has to pay rent for the rest of the lease if the landlord is unable to secure a replacement tenant after making reasonable efforts to do so.
So according to her, she talked to the property manager and told her she has to pay for the remaining lease. Her complex has 6 apartments available, so it'll be difficult for them to get a new tenant in her apartment.
She does have to pay her remaining lease. But her landlord has a duty to mitigate their damages by making a reasonable effort to secure a new tenant. I'm more interested in the 'paying a new lease and paying all legal fees incurred by the complex, etc.'.
Since she's getting evicted, she has to find a new place to live. So she'll be paying for the current lease which ends in March and her new lease that she'll be living in.
About securing a new tenant, she can try to work with property management to find a tenant to replace her. She might entice a tenant to replace her by offering incentives, like paying the first month of their rent or using that same amount of money to reduce their monthly rent payments by XXX a month, (basically if rent is $1000 a month, she'd render a payment that would reduce the replacement tenant's rent to $875 a month). Paying a month (or two) of someone else's rent is a lot less than paying rent for the next 7 months. There's no guarantee that her complex would be willing to work with her on this, though she could still direct traffic toward them regardless. If she goes the route of trying to secure a new tenant, with or without their cooperation, she should document her efforts. She should also attempt to keep track of whether the apartment is listed in the usual places. When it comes time for them to collect, this might help her show that they didn't meet their burden. some general advice about this.
