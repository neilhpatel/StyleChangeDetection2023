Did you just get a letter, or did you get some court documents as well? What does the letter say specifically? Does it have a claim number or say when the loss occurred?
It's worth reaching out to ICBC to confirm that you're not actually involved. Use the contact information on the Third Party Notice to hopefully get the office of the lawyer who's handling the case for ICBC (they may or may not be an ICBC lawyer working at a claim center - ICBC frequently farms litigation out to private counsel).
If you weren't named in the original NOCC then ICBC is essentially sending you a letter saying "hey we're entering this action that has nothing to do with you as a third party.".
Thank you very much for your reply. I am named in a notice of civil claim with the supreme Court of BC seal. And yes there is a file number from ICBC on the cover letter. There is a name and address of the third party's lawyer. I will write to them. There's no email but there is a phone number. I will follow your instructions. But I'm still confused as to why I was never contacted to make a statement about the supposed accident. The plaintiff must have contacted ICBC at some point so why didn't ICBC contact me before sending out all of this paperwork that I now have, that is obviously making me feel quite worried. Again thank you very much for your time.
do not reach out to the plaintiff's counsel! You need to reach out to ICBC or its counsel, since they're supposed to be defending you (assuming your insurance coverage is up to snuff).
If it turns out they are actually trying to get money out of you, consult a personal injury lawyer who handles ICBC cases.
It is very odd that this is the first time you're being contacted, yes. When did you receive the Notice of Civil Claim? Were you ever served by a process server or sheriff?
The third party's counsel is an ICBC lawyer; Another lawyer is named as the plaintiff's counsel. That said, I can tell by your answer that I may be in serious trouble here. No I was never served anything by a sheriff. But before Christmas someone did come to my door and give me a sheet of paper from the plaintiff. I just thought it was a scam.
That something you were handed was presumably the Notice of Civil Claim, and you should have mentioned it in your main post.
You mentioned in your other comment that ICBC has denied liability to indemnify you. This is very bad news for you if it's true. I would advise seeking a defense lawyer immediately. This basically means that ICBC doesn't think it should have to defend you regarding this matter, and may even seen to recoup its costs from you. As I said, lawyer. Yesterday.
