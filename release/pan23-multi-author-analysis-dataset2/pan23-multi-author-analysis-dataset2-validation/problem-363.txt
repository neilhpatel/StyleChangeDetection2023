You should ask your attorney these questions like what the likely outcome is if you go to trial, what kind of proof you need of your injuries, they know the most about the case. If you don't trust them get a consult from a personal injury attorney. There could also be issues with the policy limits of the other party, or shared fault.
I believe he is a personal injury attorney. Should I contact a different one and ask for their take? I'm worried since my current one was brought on a week after the collision and I didn't know if it would be too late to get a second opinion. Right now he has all the records I can think of.
Before filing a lawsuit, lawyers will gather medical records, bills, loss of earnings records, evidence of change in your life, etc. Gather them together and send it to the insurance company. It's called a demand letter or demand package.
TBI can be very serious. Make sure you are seen by qualified neurologists or neuropsychologists to document your injury. Your opinion that you suffer from TBI means nothing. You can't testify as to that (I'm assuming you're not a medical professional). You need doctors to offer that opinion if the matter reaches trial.
You don't have to settle. Just say no. Either come up with a number you want or demand policy limits (discuss this phrase with your lawyer) and if they don't meet it, your lawyer can file a lawsuit.
They're also claiming that not enough property damage was done that could cause these physical injuries despite the driver of the car I was in having to replace the entire back end and him hitting us at 80MPH. I'm not sure what else I can provide.
This was the second offer with the first one being $32k. This doesn't even cover my out of pocket cost.
Getting a consultation and review is pretty low cost. But from the info here there isn't anything alarming, these things can take a lot of time, the insurance company can try to force you to accept a lowball settlement.
I would say it is less common but not really unusual to get multiple lowball settlement offers. Most insurance cos when presented with strong evidence of the damages and of fault settle out of court, it is faster and cheaper overall. But some pushback more, sometimes their insured is telling them a different story and they think they can win at trial, sometimes the lowball offers are accepted, or it is a negotiating tactic to make a later offer seem more reasonable. Your attorney would know the most about your situation.
I have undergone extensive testing. They found a lesion on my cerebellum, eye damage, secondary muscular occipital neuralgia, my spine was fractured and my vestibular nerve was damaged. All of this is documented. Right now they're claiming they're not finding referrals to some of the doctors (I don't know how that's possible, everything is documented). I've had everything from cranial MRIs to neuropsyche evals. I had gone directly to the hospital from the collision.
