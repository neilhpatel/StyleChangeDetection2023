You can talk this over with your parents and they can address it with the school if they disagree with this decision.
But what's most relevant is that, if you attend a public grade school in the United States, your First Amendment rights are much more limited than you would think. If you attend a private grade school, they're basically free to punish you as they see fit, as long as it does not significantly deviate from their contractual obligations.
Before anybody here can give you any reasonable advice, we need to know exactly what you said, what state you're in if in the US, and whether your school is public or private.
Clearly something happened here that you are still leaving out if it led to you being accused of racism and expelled to an alternative school.
If you feel you didn't say anything that would warrant your discipline, you and your parents can bring it up with the school.
But clearly there was something specific you said that made her react the way she did, regardless of whether that reaction was justified or unjustified. You're not sharing that specific thing or things, much less the context around them, so any advice beyond "talk to your parents and, with them, the school about it," likely can't be given.
Every time you comment you add a little more to the story. At first it was "one question about his freedom" and then it was "we were discussing policies" and then it was "we were discussing policies and I asserted that freedoms were going to be taken away.".
I don't follow. How did you and your friend discussing presidential candidates lead to you having a confrontation with this school staff member?
"Freedom of speech" doesn't mean "say whatever I want at school without fear of punishment." There are lots of things you can't say at school (much less anywhere), along with certain times you can't say those things, without fear of punishment. Without you divulging the specific words or phrases that this administrator or whoever had a problem with, no one here can possibly guess whether or not your rights were violated as you assert.
