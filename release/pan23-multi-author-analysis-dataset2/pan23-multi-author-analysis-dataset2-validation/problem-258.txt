the sewer backed up and ruined the first floor and the entire kitchen is gutted. The HOA policy is paying for the restoration. The cause was a neighbor's oleander tree roots clogged the pipe.
i have since been informed the restoration company requires a hold harmless. odd that they waited 7 weeks to mention the HH. but i dont want to sign a HH from the board.
You should talk to your insurance company about loss of use coverage even if the HOA master policy is covering the repairs.
If you don't sign the hold harmless the repair co could stop the work until you establish that they/the HOA are legally required to make the repairs even without agreeing. It is hard to say what the best thing to do in this case is.
They have already paid out my max. I have called them 3x including just now again based on your suggestion.
yeah, i have already confirmed i do not have enough coverage from my personal insurance for additional living expenses. They gave me a check for $4500 and called it a day. and that aint enough bc i need all new furniture and stuff.
i have decided to sign the HH from the restoration company but cant figure out if the HH form the HOA is necessary to sign. that's my ultimate question.
