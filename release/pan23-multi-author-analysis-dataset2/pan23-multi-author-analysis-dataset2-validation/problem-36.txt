Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security reported blackouts in Rivne and Khmelnytskyi in the west.
The strikes come just days after Ukrainian troops reclaimed the city of Kherson in the country’s southern region in a major victory for Ukraine.
Like they won’t have enough people left to man a military at this point. Remember, for every person in combat you need to have 6 supporting staff, and then that’s just for the military. You still gotta have a population running the plants, farming, etc.
According to some articles from October, 700,000 men have already fled, with more leaving each day. Which we can probably round up to 1 million by the end now that the government’s cracking down.
Like honestly how much longer can this keep going on? Russia’s gonna have like 100,000 casualties and that just keeps climbing day by day. Yes, for a nation with a population of 144mil that might seem small, but note that you can chop that in half (cause women) and you realize that they’ve realistically ground through over a thousandth of their total male population. Among said population, 5 million of which are boys (after a quick google) and 16% of which are over 65+. So that’s another 11.5 million out of the loop. That means that they very well could be down by almost a 500th of their working-age male population including casualties by the end of this conflict (if it ends within the next four months). Again, all this information is just via googling and ain’t even including the men who are just leaving the country in masse.
They’re gonna run out of able-bodied men at this rate. That’s just how bad that casualty rate is (and honestly it’s probably higher considering how Russia likes to hide statistics).
Let's hit back into Russia give them a taste of there own medicine honestly..give them Long range weapons and a few Nukes just incase they throw one over.
Na it's not..enough is enough I'm sure they would shit if they knew that..they're only doing this as bc of hiding behind their Nukes.
This and shouldn't be 1 way traffic! If that was my country I'd beyond care if this was your country would you just sit back and wait for the next missile to hit your home?
