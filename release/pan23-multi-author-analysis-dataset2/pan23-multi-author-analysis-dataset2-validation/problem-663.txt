Well, Russia IS claiming it's fighting Nazis. So it's only fair that we are considering sending true Nazi descendants (also, this sequence of words sounds weird, especially since it's also positive lol) grade tanks. Russians vs German tanks had a 4:1 loss ratio last time they went head to head, let's see if we can really pump these numbers up.
USA could provision Poland with Abrams, we have 3k+. I did check as well, as many countries are not able to support the higher maintenance etc of the Abrams but and has had the platform for awhile now. Not sure why this isn't done...?
So no, not like "everybody else". You can't completely disarm your own country so it makes sense no Leopards deliveries until there are guaranteed replacements at reduced prices or agreements to send sufficient numbers of western grade tanks to a Polish border "just in case".
Edit: There was an article from that went into greater detail and past (Abrams/Poland) but r/ wouldn't let me post the link.
Poland got guarrantees that the tanks will be replaced, but the ones we already gave werent replaced yet, and Poland is waiting with sending leopards.
Poland has already delivered more tanks to Ukraine than ANY other nation, USA included. As it's several hundreds of them. Sure, they are not "western" tanks but PT-91s are technically speaking newer than some Leopards.
