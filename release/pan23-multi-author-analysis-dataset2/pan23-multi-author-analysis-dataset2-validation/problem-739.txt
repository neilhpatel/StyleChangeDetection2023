No doubt the MAGA faithful give him a bad rating on a survey, but they are never going to vote for someone with a (D) by their name on the ballot, so don't put too much weight on these survey results.
Isn't it fucked that one of the most effective (vile but extremely effective) conservative politicians in our country's history is considered to not be a true member of the conservative party by a significant chunk of its electorate? Proof we've gone absolutely insane.
I’m obviously talking about what polling is more relevant and you’re being deliberately obtuse. It’s immature and obnoxious.
I don’t think you understand how polling works. Approval/disapproval polling is wildly different than general election polling. In McConnell’s last election he did outperform the polls but they all had him pegged as winning with a very comfortable margin, he just turned very comfortable into a blowout. In Manchin’s last election the aggregate polling was within about 3-points of the final results and almost every aggregator projected Manchin would win except Real Clear Politics which rated it as a tossup race. Ron Johnson’s last race the aggregate of the final polls was about 51-48 Johnson over Barnes with an actual result of 50.4-49.4. Collins is the only one out of what you mentioned that was outside of the predicted outcome. And even then most aggregates had it rated as a tossup. Approval/Disapproval is more a measure of how potentially vulnerable someone is if the right opponent comes along. You can make a lot of assumptions based off of a/d numbers and you can make use of them to predict how hard or easy of a campaign someone is going to have but they’re useless without having the same information of an opponent to compare them to. And even then there’s still a lot of supposition that has to be done.
Did anyone even try to primary McConnell the last time? I can see an (R) Congressman losing a primary to a MAGA challenger, as has happened a lot recently, but Senate races are a whole nother level of spending and so on.
Because you’re using approval/disapproval numbers to talk about how those 4 shouldn’t have won re-election when it’s the general election polling that’s most relevant to that.
People can win election despite being unpopular so long as the other major candidate is more unpopular. That shouldn’t be a hard concept to grasp.
