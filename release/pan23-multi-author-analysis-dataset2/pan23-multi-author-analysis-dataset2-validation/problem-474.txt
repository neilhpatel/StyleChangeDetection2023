The solution to this problem proposed by Adrian Goldsworthy, and to the question of how a convex could've prevented a line from breaking (and personally, if it works why didn't everyone else use it) can be seen in the deployment . As you can see, if the Libyans were deployed both between and behind the cavalry and Spanish/Gaellic infantry, then they would be blocked from view of the Romans simply by the bodies of men and horse in front.
In his previous battles with the Romans, Hannibal saw that even when put into a disadvantageous position, the main thrust of the Roman infantry were able to break through the Carthaginian line. He therefore advanced his center first into a convex to deal with this problem. But whereas scholars before Goldsworthy assumed Hannibal's convex also prevented the Carthaginian line from breaking, Goldsworthy's hypothesis is that Hannibal turned this problem to his advantage. The Romans would naturally crowd towards the center where the fighting was, and troops would be committed to where a breakthrough seemed imminent, also the center, as it retreated. The position of the Libyans also served to stablize and reinforce the Carthaginian infantry on the wings to make sure they do not break. Instead of trying to prevent the Romans from breaking through the center, Hannibal counted on the fact that they would. The Carthaginian center breaking is reported by :
You can see Goldsworth's interpretation of what happened . Once the Romans broke though, as they've always done, in their pursuit they would expose themselves to the Libyans on the flanks which were originally blocked from view. The Libyans would then naturally turn inwards and sandwich the Romans, who would be crowded and disorderly from pursuing the Carthagnian center (and as Livy reported, tired). This would also give Hannibal and Mago the opening to rally the Carthaginian center and re-commit them to the fight.
Is it possible that this play was not designed in advance, but instead that Hannibal attempted a central breakthrough and when that failed, successfully seized a new opportunity? It seems rather odd to plan for something that would need to happen after you are no longer in controll of the situation.
This is not really rare for warfare at the time, especially when commanders place themselves with the troops (which is fairly often). Commanders, historical and today, need to trust their subordinates to be able to follow his overall plan and take initiatives to respond to situations. Hannibal also had to trust Hasdrubal to defeat the Roman cavalry and not go off on a wild goose chase but attack the other parts of the Roman line. And remember, one of the brilliance of (this interpretation of) the plan is that the only orders Hannibal need to give to the Libyans is "wait here, and when you see the Romans break through the center, attack them.".
1. It's logical for us. The Romans broke through the Carthaginain line before so no reason to reason to assume they couldn't again.
As for the infantry trap at Cannae, it certainly isn't impossible it was accidental, but I would say it is unlikely that it wasn't planned.
