You are looking for a medical malpractice lawyer, and it is always better to do it sooner rather than later.
The statute of limitations on medical malpractice in NJ is two years, and before you freak out thinking that it has passed, there is also what is called the "discovery rule" which means that the time does not start until you reasonably become aware of the injury that the malpractice caused. Here, it likely wouldn't be until you learned of your cancer diagnosis. But you really shouldn't wait, in my opinion.
You will need a medical malpractice lawyer. Medical malpractice is very fact specific and way beyond what this sub is capable of providing.
And if the medical malpractice lawyer you meet with wants you to pay an hourly rate instead of taking the case on contingency, you should go to a different lawyer.
The only thing I will point out is that misdiagnosis is not automatically grounds for malpractice by the Doctor. Generally it must be proven that they acted in a capacity that was grossly negligent and/or malicious.
You should reach out to a medical malpractice lawyer. There is a time limit on when the case is started. Most malpractice lawyers work on contingency, meaning their pay comes out of your damage award.
