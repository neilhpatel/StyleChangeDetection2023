I’ve been in plenty of car accidents and always felt better going through insurance (esp if I’m not at fault). Just easier IMO because they deal with all of it. You just never know with people and you don’t want to get screwed over. It’s unlikely she will give you the money prior to it being fixed. You could provide her with the estimate that the body shop gives you, but keep in mind, it’s an estimate. If the price changes, then what? Are you going to reach back out and hope she gives you the rest? You also don’t want to pay in full to fix it and then hope to be reimbursed by a complete stranger who can ghost you. And, involving insurance at that point would end up being more of a hassle for you. Just my two cents.
Some people don’t want higher interest rates on their insurance. If she’s willing to pay, let her pay and if she does give you the run around just make a claim.
You may be (likely are) required by your insurance policy to report any accident to them, and there can be consequences if you don't. So you should be aware that if she does give you the run around and you try to make a claim later, you may have caused yourself some problems. On the other hand, you should also be aware that, if she brings up the fact that you leaned on the horn, and therefore obviously saw her and could have avoided the accident by stopping, when your insurance company and hers negotiate to determine fault and coverage, you may be determined to be partially at fault and your insurance will have to cover part of it, and you'll have to pay a deductible.
