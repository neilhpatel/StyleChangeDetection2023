Ultimately, you signed documents without reading them, documents that I'd wager very clearly show you agreeing to their terms, and the warranty. Were they shady? Maybe, but you agreed, in writing.
This is a very expensive lesson. For your own sake, you should consult with an attorney who specializes in loan contracts and see if there is even the slightest chance you can get out of that loan.
I don't want to get out of the loan, just get rid of the warranty. I have them on video telling me that they "canceled" the warranty and I was getting that money refunded.
Your concern over a 3500 warranty is absurd, as you'll likely be paying triple that in interest over the life of loan.
At 20%, you absolutely want out of that loan. If that was the best rate they could finance you at, what makes you think you can refinance at a better rate? I'm not even sure an interest rate that high is even legal for an auto loan.
My bank will refinance it, I already received a pre-approval at 7% after I made my 3rd payment. So I will be paying less interest next month, but I want my money back as there is a very good chance that they just pocketed the money and never even got a warranty at all as I've never received any paperwork from any warranty places.
You can do small claims yourself without a lawyer, but triple damages might be over the limit for small claims court in your state. You would need to check the limit. For a civil trial you would need a lawyer, but the cost of a lawyer would eat up more than the cost of this claim! Your best bet might be small claims even with the limit. Thatâ€™s just my opinion. And keep it brief there. Just the TLDR is all you need in court.
