Also, until your gf clears up her child endangerment case, she may not be allowed to live in the home with the children because she is considered a potential danger to them. Even with another adult in the home. So even if you were to get guardianship, which again is extremely unlikely, you may not be allowed to live with her and the children at the same time.
No matter what your relationship is to the mother, you remain a legal stranger to the children until/unless you adopt them. Grandmother/aunt will still have a better claim for placement, especially as the children are established in their home/have an existing relationship with the children that trumps yours. So it's very unlikely you would prevail in a guardianship case against them.
That video you posted in another thread, that house is a mess. That's nearly hoarder-level filth, and no child should be made to live like that. If you really want to help your GF clean that home.
