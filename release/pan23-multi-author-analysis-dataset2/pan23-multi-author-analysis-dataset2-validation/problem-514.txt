"The board of county commissioners of a county may provide by resolution that any inmate of the county jail who is incarcerated in the county jail pursuant to a sentence for the conviction of a crime in this state shall be required to pay to the county a fee in an amount not exceeding the county's daily cost of housing the inmate to defray the costs of maintaining such inmate in the county jail for each day prior to and after conviction for an offense resulting in a conviction.".
Despite what the other commenters have said, there's a real chance that this is not a scam. Pay-to-stay jails exist in Kansas and charge inmates a set amount for every day they serve. If the bill goes unpaid, it may be sent to a collection agency. Your friend should consult an attorney for advice.
$13,000 seems excessive at first, though for a year that would break down to about $35/day, so it's possible it's legit... definitely worth talking to an attorney. Not sure legal aid would be able to help, but this might fall under debtor relief?
