was an important part of the Gaulish trade network since centuries, trough the "tin roads" using Loire, Seine and critically Rhone as the main tradeway in the region; but since the IIIrd centuries, North-Western Gaulish and Southern British peoples shared a lot of similar cultural features; probably to be tied up with Belgian peoples being present on both sides of the Channel.It's not really clear if it happened trough conquest, migrations, establishment of familial ties or sheer trade links (although outright conquest is not this much considered nowadays due to the lack of strong evidence) but there peoples considered as Belgians in the broadest sense on both banks (between Loire/Somme and Rhine depending who you asked; and in most of southern Britain). It's hard to determine what made a Belgian people (probably not language giving the difference with Gaulish was at most a matter of more conservative speech) but peoples in Britain shared name with continental peoples (Belgae, Atrebates, Parisii), British onomastic looks really close to Gaulish (rather than Goidelic) and druidism was attested in Britain tough (that being said, possibly carried from Gaul).Even the absence of oligarchic regimes, with more systematical presence of royal leadership, or the absence of oppidae until the Ist century AD (maybe as a reaction, both economic and politic, to the Roman conquest of Gaul) can be partially found in some remote Belgian peoples in Gaul.
It doesn't mean that cultural make up of Britain was suddenly changed : in fact, there's more evidence for continuity from the Early Iron Age than not, the "Arras culture" in Yorkshire being an exception, with a regional melting-pot material culture emerging eventually, with influence varying in importance from Belgian Gaulish peoples in Armorica or Belgica; which dominated the area trading with Britain (especially at Hengistbury Head), and the raids recorded by Caesar, if happening, didn't let a great mark. Amusingly, the most import changes were due to Roman conquest of Transalpina, which increased trade trough Gaul and the familiarity of Brittons with Gaulish goods as well as the reverse; hinted at the increase of Belgian coins in Britain.
Altough Suessiones claimed having a strong influence in Britain, it's impossible to really spot real political alliances behind a sense of kinship (Commios fleeing to Britain to join his kind, as recorded by Caesar) and trade partnership. There's only one mention of Brittons joining Gauls in the war; namely Armorici led by Veneti, who are said by Caesar to excel in naval trade with the northern island.
The problem for Caesar was less that Brittons mercenaries were raised by Gauls, that Gauls were able to supply themselves in Britain. Which giving on Caesar relying on requisitioning Gaulish products and grain at his benefit, was a logistical issue.
Now the problem is that we know significantly less about Iron Age Britain than Gaul: less texts, less archeological evidence especially in the South-East... But Brittons don't seem to have considered Gaul their bulkwark against Romans : while political changes (especially tentative to obtain regional hegemonies from Atrebates and Trinovantes) might be tied up with Roman conquest of Gaul, and even if Caesarian campaigns in Britain was partly made due to the supply of Gauls against Caesar, it's more a matter of trade and good neighbourhood.
\- The Ancient Celts; Barry Cunliffe; is rather holding well, and stresses the plurarlity of the Celtic world, even if I'm not sure switching the "Halstattian crib" for the an Atlantic one is necessarily better, it does have the benefit challenging the first tough.
\- The Celts : History, Life and Culture; edited by John T. Koch and Atone Minard; 2012 is a really useful encyclopedia about Celts in their broader sense (as such it includes Ancient but as well Medieval and contemporary references) and it avoids most the trappings of a "Celtisist" point of view. Unfortunately, there is little on Gaul precisely (Insular and Breton celticity being a large part of the book, which is understandable).
The "holy trinity" of Roman-era sources on Gaul. There's always more to say, but these are good departure points as primary sources (all three being more or less inspired by Poseidonios).
Hey man, I've read some of your answers on here and you really seem to know your stuff. Wich books would you recommend for learning more about the Gauls or the Gallic Wars?
\- The Greatness and the Decline of the Celts; Henri Hubert; 1934. Surprisingly for its old age, it doesn't holds that badly in its segmented description of Italy, Gaul, Britain... It should be systematically checked and corrected with current information, but it's arguably one of the only works I know of in English that treats Gaul separately instead of as a vague and ill-defined part of "Celtic Europe".
\- Celtic chiefdom, Celtic state : The Evolution of Complex Social Systems in Prehistoric Europe; edited by B. Arnolds and D.B. Gibson; 1996. A series of articles on the social and political sophistication of Celtic institutions.For instance, Caesar's Perception of Gallic Social structures, by Sean B. Duham on studying and re-evaluating Caesarian conceptions and vocabulary at the light of archaeology (something I think Stefan Fichtl succeeded in; and the thesis of Emmanuel Arbabe on this perspective might prove fructuous).
\- Caesar : Life of a Colossus; Adrian Goldsworthy; 2006 provides with a really fine summary of the Gallic Wars and a quick introduction to late independent Gaul. Maybe a bit too dismissive of Gaulish warfare, but it's really not a big issue.
Unfortunately, I don't have a lot a lot of English-language resources for the period to mention, not that they're unknown (Barry Cunliffe have a very good reputation, as does John Collis) but they don't appear nearly as much in Gaulish studies I've access to, compared to Roman or Merovingian Gaul. Not that the focus given in english-languages sources to Britain and Ireland wouldn't be understandable (would it be only due to the conditions of archaeological work and study), but there might be a tendency to lump elements about Gaul as "generic Cetic". (I must say that, in the historiographic polarization between "Celtisists "and "Gallicists" I'd lean more on the second.)For this reason, I might miss a lot of interesting studies and books on Gaulish history : so don't take this list as anything remotely close to exhaustive.
I don't know if you can read French : if it's the case I could add more books and monographies there or, if you prefer, some introductory or vulgarizing books.
I read "De Oude Belgen" by Ugo Janssens and it really sparked my interest, I'll get started on your recommendations right away. My french is a little rusty, so I'll grab any excuse to get it up and running again. If you have any interesting french works I'd love to hear them. Thanks!
\-Les Celtes. Histoire et dictionnaire, des origines à la romanisation et au christianisme (2001) is a small jewel on this perspective.
Searching a bit, I discovered that a French edition was available since 2008, I'll certainly try to get a look a it.
With your permission, I'll keep on introductory or vulgarizing works there, but if you rather demand monographies or on specific topics, I'll send you in PM.
produced in 2010 a very short introduction on Gaul, which is a limited "who's who" of a current consensus in France.
Similarly, Les Gaulois au delà du mythe video documentary provides with a popular introduction to the topic.
Jean-Louis Brunaux is one of the archaeologists historians of the period most involved into vulgarisation and introductory works at the moment. He's not undisputed in his criticism of a Celtisit approach, and his in interpretation of archaeological data that is sometimes judged...ambitious, assertive if not abusive and provocating. I rather, from my position as an amateur, rather agrees with most of what he advances, but I think it's important to point he doesn't elicits unanimity.
\- Regards sur la Gaule, by Christian Goudineau, who had a lasting influence on the current perception of Gaulish history , is certainly advisable too. Goudineau long argued in disfavour of considering Gaul as really well defined ensemble, rather looking at is as a "colonial" entity whom existence before Caesar is at best debatable (making the comparison with a pre-existence of Congo or Central Africa before French colonisation).
\- Nos ancêtres les Gaulois (2008) is summarizing his view on Gauls, which are the main clichés on them (undiscipined warriors unable for the life of them to fight with discipline and discernment, druids as magical priests gathering in the shadows, primitive institutions, landscape covered with forests, a sole Celtic people from Ireland to Anatolia, etc.).
