From a legal perspective, you are only entitled to access the money in your father's bank accounts if you are a "joint account holder". The most common way this is designated is "JTWROS" on the account name: "Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship". Verbal permission and giving you the PIN number is not the same as a legal form signed and filed with the bank.
But as a practical matter, unless there is a dispute between you and another person with an interest in the estate, nobody is going to notice. My guess is that because you're an only child and you were his caretaker, that he didn't have a surviving spouse and had not designated anyone else as the executor of his will.
Those joint account arrangements are very common for exactly your situation: it entitles you legally to access that money to run his household and pay for funeral expenses without going through the probate process or even providing a death certificate.
I certainly understand how that would add to the temptation to skirt the rules and impersonate your father in various ways both harmless and criminal.
As a legal matter, I do not recommend it. Cashing a social security check made out to your father after he passes away, for example, is a temptation some people would succumb to, but that can put you in prison.
Because you share a name with your father, be particularly vigilant looking out for any debts he might have owed if collectors call. His estate owes debts he incurred, not you personally, but some shady debt collectors will try to collect from John Doe Jr. after John Doe Sr. passes away without getting in line to settle with the estate.
Thank you..no spouse or anyone who would dispute it..and no will..and my name is the same as his and my ID is the same location..but he does have one property that he still had a mortgage on..but I believe the house we lived in is paid for..should I get a probat lawyer..sorry for spelling..
Oh definitely not touching anything that came in after his death like social security..but the money that was in his checking was there before he passed..im not touching anything now.
Any money I used was already there..I will never cash anything after his death..he gets it all directly deposited..this was literally like 3 days after when the funeral home said that I need to pay them before the funeral..I haven't used anything in his name after that.
