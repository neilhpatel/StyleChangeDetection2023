Your best course of action would be to sell this house and get your own place. You might have to see a lawyer and force the sale. The will eat up a lot of the equity, but it may be worth it.
Thank you for the advice. Is it true that he isn't responsible for paying things like the property tax, the home owner's insurance, or for maintenance and repairs that keep the house and property up to code? I know that utilities and things like that wouldn't count. I don't think he would allow the property to fall into disrepair or go into tax sale if it came down to it and we refused to pay 100%.
If taxes aren't paid, the house gets foreclosed. If maintenance isn't done, the house falls apart. If insurance isn't paid and the house burns down, there's no house. Most of these things would have far more impact on you than on him.
However, as you're thinking about who owes what, keep in mind that you are living in the house, which is a significant benefit. If you want to know how much of a benefit, find a similar house in your area that is for rent and find out what the monthly rental is. Compare that to what all of your house related bills are costing you.
You will have to consult with a real estate attorney for advice about how to get out of this situation. Since your husband's name is on the deed, he could force the home to be sold and then be compensated for his equity or ask his father to pay him for/buy out his share of the equity and then you all find another place to live.
We're in uncharted territory with him at this point, so we're (husband and I) both unsure of how far he might go to "punish" us for trying to stand up to him. His behavior in the last few days has been incredibly hostile and abusive, with a myriad of threats. It seems like anything is possible right now.
There aren't any rules about who owes what. If one of thinks the other owes them money you can sue for it.
If I were you I would ask your husband to check at the county courthouse probate court to see if the grandfather had a will that was probated in court. If there is a case file, your husband should visit the courthouse in person to look at the file to see how the estate was handled or if he can't visit the courthouse in person, he should ask for a copy of the file to be mailed to him. He needs to see if your husband and you were mentioned as beneficiaries in the will or if there is any language there that describes how this house was supposed to be handled and who was to be in charge of it.
As you have probably already figured out, it would have been best if father's name had been left off of the deed entirely and if it truly was your husband's grandfather's wish to gift you all this home, then deed should have been in both of your names only.
