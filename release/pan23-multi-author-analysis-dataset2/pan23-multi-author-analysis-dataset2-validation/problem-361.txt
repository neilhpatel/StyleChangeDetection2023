I am not aware of strong evidence of federally-sponsored miscegenation following the Civil War. Whoever told you this, however, may be drawing off of a particularly cynical/ racially prejudiced view of postwar federal Indian policy. Here's what I mean.
Okay, hopefully that made sense. Now to the second part of your question: Afro-Native studies is an emerging field of American History, but so far scholars have chronicled a long and fascinating history of Black and Native relations-- from political alliance to intermarriage. There's a LOT to say about the history of these two heterogenous groups, so I'm happy to answer more specific questions. I'd also recommend Brooks, ed., Confounding the Color Line, as well as Miles and Holland, ed., Crossing Waters, Crossing Worlds for some essays on Afro-Native history. Those are good starting points for the field.
To this day some folks still live on allotments, those parcels of land that fall outside the boundaries of present-day reservations.
In 1887, the U.S. government passed the Dawes Act, which basically provided (along with auxiliary legislation/rule-making) for the privatization of the land of Native nations. Under the Dawes Act, land previously held in common and ruled by Native legal systems was broken up into "allotments," which were distributed to members of the nation. Allotments were privately owned and, if the owner was deemed sufficiently "civilized" by federal agents, could be sold. Predictably, racial thinking played a role here-- federal agents usually used the percentage of Native blood, or "blood quantum," to determine who was ready to sell land. As such, "pure" Native people often held onto land and "mixed-blood" citizens were usually forced to sell due to extreme poverty. The federal agents overseeing these allotments were often corrupt and allied with land-hungry settlers, further accelerating the selling off of Native lands. Thus allotment significantly decreased Native land bases in the United States, with a disproportionate amount of those sold-off lands belonging to "mixed-blood" Native people.
Who was counted as a citizen of allotted nations was judged by the U.S. federal government, which insisted that Black people formerly enslaved by Native nations (most notably the "Five Civilized Tribes" of the South) be included as citizens on the Dawes rolls. As such, some freedmen received allotments as members of Native nations. To this day, this remains a point of contention, as some Native people saw (and others today see) it as a breach of Native sovereignty.
Given these historical facts, a cynic (and anyone familiar with Native issues is justifiably cynical) might conclude that federal agents encouraged miscegenation in order to accelerate the selling-off of Native lands under the Dawes Act. There may even be examples of this on a local level (that is, specific federal agents), but there is no evidence I have encountered to suggest this was a systemic effort on behalf of the U.S.
Presumably these allotments were an attempt at civilizing the natives by acclimating them to private (land) property. Since as you say this was often based off of blood "purity", presumably these allotments passed intergenerationally. Were they allowed to sell them to one another? Or was this more to tie them to the land? Do you know anything about inheritance practices for these allotments?
The history of allotment inheritance is full of fascinating stories of contested inheritance and land deals, many of which are recounted in personal histories like Kendra Fields' Growing up with the Country and the work of Darnella Davis. In short, yes, allotments could be passed on, and though the exact figures escape me, I believe the act provided for allotments for each tribal citizen's children as well. Land, once freed from federal oversight, could be sold to anybody, so Native people did purchase land from one another. White speculators, however, gobbled up the majority of land.
Alternatively, if informed by pretty deep-seated racial stereotypes about sexually deviant/constantly reproducing Black people, somebody may view the inclusion of freedmen on the Dawes rolls as an attempt to encourage miscegenation. I won't really entertain this notion-- while U.S. Indian policy has long been designed around weakening Native nations, the inclusion of freedmen was largely inspired by radical Republicans' desire for postwar reparations. To suggest this was aimed at miscegenation isn't historically sound, and relies on racial stereotypes. (EDIT: to clarify, I'm not implying whoever told you this is racist, but rather pointing out that racial myths are often combined with cynicism towards the U.S. government in a harmful/inaccurate way. Whoever told you this may have been passing on information that, in a game of intergenerational telephone, went from "the U.S. government wants freedmen to be citizens" to "the U.S. government is trying to foster miscegenation").
Exactly, the allotment program was usually cited as part of a broader attempt of assimilation-- though also, consciously or unconsciously, allotment led to a huge loss of Native land, so scholars will often cite it as part of the broader colonization of Native people. As a side note, it also has been () a lonime goal of U.S. policymakers to break up Native land, going back as far as the early 1800s, when architects of the so-called "civilization policy" promoted the ideals of private property and explicitly stated their desires to shrink Native nations. It was tried again, with slightly different attributes, in the 1950s with Termination Policy.
