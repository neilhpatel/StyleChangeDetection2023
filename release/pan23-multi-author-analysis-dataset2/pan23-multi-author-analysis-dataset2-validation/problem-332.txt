Would be great but things have changed, a lot of digging in has occurred. I suppose if they break through the frontline though….away they go to get their land back.
It doesn’t really work like that. You only have a finite amount of guided Arty. So you can hit logistics hubs and command nodes and ammo dumps. Then you would want to hit vehicle parks, enemy artillery batteries, forward airstirps. After all do that if you do have some guided munitions left, let’s say you hit a series of trenches. Then your men take them. Then what? There’s dozens of trenches behind the one you just took. UKR doesn’t have enough to hit vital targets and thousands of spots in trenches.
You're pointing to an interesting (and quite possible) development: Both sides being unable to achieve notable offensive results but for different reasons. The Russians because they don't have the ability to fight a mobile, offensive war for a variety of reasons and Ukraine because they'll have trouble breaking through very heavy layered defenses as you describe.
Yes anything can happen in a war I’m not of the belief that the frontline will stay static and where it is now. I think Ukraine liberates more land back over time. I personally have a hard time seeing them getting anywhere near Crimea though. Like I said, time will tell.
There's a million "but's" to consider, though. Most notably, the Ukrainians have been very good at adapting and we don't know the size and scope of the reserves they've been building through the winter. New long range capabilites may come into play which can seriously impact supplies to the southern front especially. And obviously, the quality of the Russian defense. Might be a Potemkin Village on some parts of the frontline which is still very long.
In Kharkiv the Russians basically ran out of men. The Ukrainians were able to use small fast vehicles to basically drive between towns and cut off supply routes, forcing Russian units to flee or surrender. They didn’t have to attack strongpoints head on. In some area where they did it took awhile to take the area. The best example is Lyman where a BARS (Russian reserve) unit held up the Ukraine forces for many days. In Lyman the defensive works were nothing compared to what the Russians are building all over now. And Lyman had to be abandoned by RU bc it was outflanked. The Russian lines extend far and deep now. So if the UKR struggled to take one smaller city with minimal defensive lines against a very depleted force, that doesn’t exactly make me feel like they’re going to do the same thing against a lot more men with much better defensive positions. If you look at WW2, the Allies often struggled to break German lines (sometimes takings months to do so) despite being better than the Germans in every single aspect of war. Attacking someone in a conventional peer vs peer war is HARD.
You can’t just take one row of trenches - defense in depth will have Russian artillery behind the line zeroed in in the first line of trenches.
You have to break through far enough in first wave to get to the rear and take out this artillery, and then keep pushing as long as your own logistics and men’s morale can keep up (usually 6 days or so for the initial units, after which need to rotate in fresh troops and equipment from reserve).
