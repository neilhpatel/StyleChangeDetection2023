No, the wargames that were undertaken didn't look for the impacts of changing military technology and recent military experience was ignored or misunderstood; at the time military leaders believed that technology had not fundamentally changed the balance of warfare and that offensive action would dominate.
Pre- WW1 wargames were more about operational and logistical issues than simulating the impact of new technology on the battlefield. European military leaders generally believed they were in a military technology regime little changed from 1870, or indeed not much changed from 1815; they saw the modern war as "Napoleon with a railroad and telegraph", meaning armies could move faster with more supplies and headquarters would command far more effectively and quickly. The few that looked at recent military experience and saw that it promised a tougher time for the attack thought of that as an obstacle, but not something so dramatic as to require rethinking war plans.
That is, they all imagined that manoeuvre, mobility and initiative had the advantage leading to an estimation that the offensive would dominate defenses. The "cult of the offensive" was a fixed, unexamined understanding of "how warfare works"; indeed, its that understanding of the advantage that they believe the aggressor had that created the instability that lead to the outbreak of war. Precisely because all parties believed that "defense is hard, offense will dominate", armies had plans to mobilize quickly-- and viewed the mobilization of adversaries as threatening.
These views were held by both military leaders like Schlieffen and Moltke, and political leaders like Bethman-Hollweg. Similar views were particularly strong in France, notably with Joffre. Particularly disastrously, all were convinced that even when on the defensive strategically, a defender should try to go on the offensive. The Allies could have hunkered down in their trenches, but instead thought that warfare required attack or counterattack- resulting in catastrophes like Verdun and the Somme.
If the nations had properly understood the \_true\_ state military technology as it affected the balance between offense and defense, they'd have been on much less of a hair trigger. The exercises that they conducted, wargames and staff studies, never looked qt the issue in a way that would have revealed the impact massive firepower against unprotected men in the field, and how that changed strategy.
The most significant impact of a prewar wargame on planning was likely the five month 1905 British exercise which looked at a war against Germany in Europe. Anticipating the Schlieffen Plan, the game suggested that the British could not convoy troops to the continent quickly enough to prevent the occupation of Belgium. As a consequence, British military planning called for a stepped up deployment in the event of war, but note that this "learning" tended to reinforce the mistaken impression that the offensive will dominate and that it is hard to defend.
In the event, they didn't need to conduct a wargame to see what war was likely to be like: they had recent experience which should have guided them: most recently the Boer War and especially the Russo-Japanese War. Port Arthur was bloody in precisely the same way that Verdun was bloody, men charging into heavily defended positions, resulting in slaughter. Observers chalked it up to the perceived deficiencies of the Russians and Japanese -- and of course, noted that the Japanese did prevail in the end.
Military publications of the day, like the journal of the Royal United Services Institution were filled with articles from observers of these wars-- Port Arthur was a very heavily observed conflict. They noted all kinds of things about changing technology-- the improvisation of grenades by both sides, and their widespread use for the first time in more than a century was noted, for example.
But they didn't carry through these observations about tactics and technology to how it might impact strategy. The British experience in the Boer War \_had\_ given them some idea that the defense was gaining an upper hand; they were better informed than were the French-- but they took that only as "a problem to be solved" for an attacking general, rather than new information that ought inform a new strategy. Very much like the battleship admirals could look at aircraft carriers and still not understand that naval combat had changed, so too with generals and their staffs didn't "get" that firepower now dominated mobility.
Wargaming after WW I continued as it had been before- much more an attempt to work out operational problems than to unearth genuine surises. So, for example, Marshal Foch and the Staff conduct a wargame in 1921 to examine military responses to a hypothetical German remilitarization of the Rhineland; this was all about logistics -- eg "how many men and vehicles can get over the bridges" not about "how do new tactics and equipment change warfare".
American war plans for the Pacific, "War Plan Orange" failed to foresee the value of aircraft carriers, but did get some of the geography right-- the importance of Midway, "island hopping". Black shoe admirals were not about to volunteer -- "Oh, I guess our battleships are obsolete, and I should have learned to fly a plane". Billy Mitchell's dramatic demonstrations did lead to adding more anti-aircraft guns to battleships; that kind of incremental response is the most you get out of a very conservative military establishment, to get real change requires that a lot of blood be spilled first. The German and Allied offensives of 1917-18 look very different from earlier in the war (tanks, "stosstruppen" tactics), but that's not the result of a wargame, that's the result of a million men dead on the Somme.
In general, its too much to ask of a wargame, study or simulation to expect that it will reveal something that will move a deeply entrenched and politically vested military bureaucracy; flag officers and their favorite programs are a Maginot line of bureaucratic immobility.
Very recently we've had much more detailed games where genuinely dramatic outcomes should have reshaped thinking, but these simulations are vastly more involved than any early 20th century kriegspiel. And even in the case of Van Riper and the celebrated Millenium Challenge 2002 (a $250 million exercise entirely different in scope and granularity from any kriegspiel circa 1900), the brass fought back against results they didn't expect or like with the bureaucratic tools at their disposal, far from saying "that's something new, we need to adapt", the response was "we don't want to hear about it, bury it".
\[1914\] - what Kriegspiel looked like at the outbreak of WW I; note the tremendous umpire-dependence, what you really get out of such an exercise is "how to best manage your forces, in the context of current military doctrine and understanding". It was not an exercise that could deliver news of mistaken appreciations of military technology.
\-- Rudyard Kipling's poetic learnings from the Boer War, a novel, perhaps unique format for modern military science. His recipe for the failings of the British Army? More horses!
Moreover, British war-games in 1898 didn't pooh-pooh the power of modern rifles. Frontal assaults and similar "Napoleonic" tactics were dismissed by umpires as unrealistic. General Buller, commanding the "invading" Blue "French" army to the South, repeatedly attacked using such tactics, repeatedly umpires adjudicated that this battalions had been mauled to the bone. The war-games similarly discounted cavalry engagements, giving the times when cavalry charged infantry even over short distances, poor marks. See _Leeson (2008) Playing at war, British military manoeuvres of 1898_. The inability for the British to foresee the lessons of the Boer war was not in the games or even the way they were adjudicated, it was in the seeming inability for people to learn from them.
It seems you buy into the narrative that the cult of the offensive caused strongly offensive war plans, something that Van Evera and Snyder support. But is it not the case that the alliance system heavily incentivises offensive action so to prevent defeat in detail? I'll quote at lenh from Sagan, apologies for the hyphens and footnotes:
Moreover, it was not as if war-games did not predict many of the things that in fact occurred during the First World War. The Russian army was destroyed in detail round the Masurian Lakes in 1914. This is the exact thing which the Germans war gamed – results of which the Russians in fact got their hands on – and Schlieffen did the exact thing the Germans did a decade later. See Snyder (1984) Civil-Military relations and the Cult of the Offensive, 109.
Even more ironically, "Schlieffen directed a war game in which he defeated his own plan with precisely the railway manoeuvre that Joffre employed to prevail on the Marne". _Id_. Sagan argues the Germans knew the limitations of their plan and that they simply believed it was the only way to win. Snyder argues that the selection of these offensive plans was part of an attempt by the military establishment to retain its autonomy and prestige. Either way, there were pre-war games which accurately reflected strategic realities in late 1914.
You'll look a long time in military planning before WW I for someone who thinks "this will be hard". As I noted-- even when they're looking at Port Arthur, the bias is to the Japanese victory; the take home lesson "it will be bloody, but that's what it takes, and morale and guerre à outrance defeats trenches.
The argument is fully explored in Keir Leiber's and Jack Snyder's correspondence in International Security:
But on the most important question-- "will this war condemn a generation and destroy our regimes?" -- nope, no umpire came up with that one.
