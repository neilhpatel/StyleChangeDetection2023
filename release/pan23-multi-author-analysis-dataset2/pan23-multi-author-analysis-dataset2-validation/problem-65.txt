This is confusing, because it doesn't sound like you were ever charged anything and received what you were trying to purchase for free, twice... . What are you trying to get Amazon to do?
You received packages in error that Amazon has no record of and apparently no one has authorized them to reprocess as they’ve cancelled the order? And haven’t been rebilled?
If no money has left your card, then it sounds like part of Amazon’s reserved shrinkage for the quarter, if you ask me. Close the account, thank them for the gifts and move on with life. They seem to want to and will accept that human/technical error are all part of business. So much so that they even put it into their balance sheet as an uncontrollable and expected loss in inventory. You haven’t gone out of your way to steal from them... you tried to remedy it best you could. Believe me when I say: Amazon doesn’t ultimately care about a $2000 package.
If they did bill you, then absolutely dispute the charges. I was accused of being fraudulent by Amazon because I ordered “outside of my usual pattern” in terms of cost... when my orders ranged from $10 to $2000 already. Their algorithm is garbage and coats them money. I also once received a free Xbox one x from them.. they accounted for the item as lost in transit because it was delivered to a neighbour. Even after telling them other I received the package, they still shrugged it off. They’re the most blasé company when it comes to losing money...
Title: Amazon cancelled my 2000$ order to due suspected fraud but still sent the items. Since the order was cancelled, the next day I placed 3 separate orders, which they cancelled and sent anyways, giving me duplicates. Customer Service won't help me after 2 months, multiple managers, and countless calls.
