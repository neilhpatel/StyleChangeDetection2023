Regardless of where you live, the burden of proof is on the state to prove you committed the crime beyond the shadow of a doubt. If you were not driving it, then go to court at the designated date and time and explain that you werenâ€™t driving. You will probably have to throw your boyfriend under the bus at this point or he can come and take ownership of his actions.
Maybe the dealership mis-represented the sale and loan. Maybe you mis-understood the sale and loan. The loan and ownership are very difficult to change at this point.
Is the car properly registered to your I-Pass account ? The tickets are for speeding, not for unpaid tolls, correct ?
You need to figure out for certain whether you, your boyfriend, or both of you are the buyers and borrowers on that car, and which of you are the Registered Owner(s).
If you are ever going to drive the car, you need to be on the insurance. If you are the registered owner, you need to have insurance that covers you, both for practical insurance reasons and to comply with the mandatory auto insurance laws, and to satisfy the lender's need to have the collateral covered by collision and comprehensive insurance.
Most automated traffic enforcement systems can't issue a moving violation, because of the evidentiary issues you are touching on: they can't prove it was you driving. So the law makes the registered owner liable for the fines, regardless of who is driving.
"All I did was sign some stuff and now my boyfriend doesn't have to pay for the car or the tickets" does not sound like honest mistakes to me. You should independently determine exactly who owns that car (the Sec. State's office) and who is obligated to pay for it (the auto lender), rather than trying to infer that information from the absence of paperwork or what your boyfriend tells you.
Also, your username is totally awesome and my wife doesn't understand why "what do you call a fish with no eyes" is just as hilarious as "what is a pirate's favorite letter" ?
