In a scenario where a) I want my future income to remain separate to me, and b) I want her future income to remain separate to her, and c) We're planning on having both separate accounts and a joint account and plan to include some portion of income into the joint account, making it marital property (maybe, idk, 20% of income), would this give her sufficient skin in the game? Because she retains her separate income and is allowed a split of the joint account? Does it make a difference if my income will be higher than hers?
The thing about prenups is that the more one sided you make them, the less incentive the other spouse has to not fight it. If you give them nothing, they have nothing to lose to fight it. You'll end up paying your lawyer and her some settlement amount and have wasted money on making the prenup in the first place. Think about it terms of money. If I got nothing out of a prenup you think I wouldn't pay a few thousand dollars in an effort to get a few hundred thousand dollars?
If you significantly change your income level from the point you made your prenup until the point you get divorced there is a good possibility she can fight it and would get a favorable outcome in court. I'm not saying it will exactly happen that way but I wouldn't be opposed to be the lawyer who made you settle. You shouldn't ever make a prenup based upon something that may never happen and expect that's the way the court should uphold it.. You should make it on your current finances.
