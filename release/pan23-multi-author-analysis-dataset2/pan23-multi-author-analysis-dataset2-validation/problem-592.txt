Life insurance is treated differently than other kinds of inheritance, it basically bypasses probate and only ever goes to the person listed as the beneficiary. Nobody else is entitled to any of it, basically. Just the person who is listed on the policy. So any money you get from it would be completely voluntary on your dad's part, he's not required to give any of it to anyone.
If he is the listed beneficiary, then he is almost certainly entitled to all of the life insurance. Her verbal statements just have no legal weight here. You should appreciate that he gave you $20k. You can see a lawyer if you want.
And there was no will I don't think, I can check around for any papers/info. She had me and my brother on her bank accounts as the benefactors in the event of death so they were just passed onto us. Also she told me and my brother to never tell my dad about this fact our entire lives, and guess what we didn't lmao but he found out. If that tells you anything about the situation how she felt about my dad.
