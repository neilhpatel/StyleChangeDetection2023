There's no question that the prevalence of myopia (nearsightedness) was much lower in the Middle Ages than today. No, we have absolutely nothing even remotely resembling statistics, and just because in the past century or several there's been a noticeable increase in myopia doesn't itself say anything about medieval western Europe (what I'll be talking about here). However, medieval popular Christianity relied on visuality in some pretty basic ways I'm not sure it would have if 50% of some such of people couldn't see their own shoes. "Art is the book of the illiterate" was a basic philosophy of religious instruction. Church sculpture, mosaic, decorated rood screens, stained glass were meant to glorify God but also to instruct (hence the popularity of Last Judgment scenes over the tympanum). And watching the priest consume the Eucharist (bread and wine) could substitute for the person doing it themselves--even in the case of a saint like Nicholas von Flue.
This being the Middle Ages, obviously the first way people tried to cope was by praying for miracles. And indeed, miracle stories attached to saints and shrines offer some really interesting cases of the extreme end of visual impairment that's "not quite blindness," although we should keep in mind that "blind" is a subjective term that means different things in different contexts.
But we also know that some people were indeed nearsighted, and obviously eyesight deteriorated in various ways (presbyopia/farsightedness, AMD, cataracts, etc) with ageing. I want to briefly introduce a distinction that scholars of disability and medicine make between "impairment" and "disability." Impairment in this sense is used as a deviation from the normative (not from the normal! lots of things are normal); disability refers to when an impairment affects someone's functioning in the world. Here, I'm going to talk more on managing visual impairment to minimize (not necessarily eliminate) disability.
Two important themes that arise from miracle stories are the effect on mobility and on ability to work. One of St. Elisabeth of Hungary's miracles concerns a girl who, it's clear, has some vision but only a little; the story emphasizes that she can't even see well enough to find her way on a path. (Medieval "roads" could just be a trampled line through fields). There's a similar miracle concerning a middle-aged man who developed possibly cataracts (macula, stains) and similarly couldn't find his way on a path; he reported being ridiculed for it.
The later Middle Ages did have knowledge of and practice rudimentary cataract surgery, sometimes even successfully. In 1351, aging abbot Gilles le Muisit of St. Martin's in Tournai had his cataracts removed only to find that behind them, he was farsighted:
The first "glasses", which were designed to be held rather than worn, were for reading (i.e. for farsightedness). I took in the Dominican church museum in Eisenach of a 1510 altarpiece relief from Thuringia--the scene is the death of the Virgin Mary, and the man with the book and glasses is probably supposed to be a physician. Glasses were one type of iconographic shorthand for physicians (another being a flask filled with urine. You do you, Middle Ages.).
In these cases, the key was to lean on the support of other people. We read a lot about blind and otherwise visually impaired people being "led" to shrines. That's probably the single most common theme in anecdotes of people with disabilities in the Middle Ages--the ad hoc, case-by-case reliance on friends and family, or in a few cases monastic charity.
Ronald Finucane and Irina Metzler have both pointed out that we are much less likely to read about nobles with disabling conditions. There was then as there is now a stigma attached to disability, even more so because of the stronger link between sin (moral failure) and impairment. So even in miracle stories that do involve knights and other nobles, the recorder will allow the healed to express a sense of shame--even to the point of feeling suicidal, in one case--a consciousness of emotion denied to lower classes.
That was the case with the knight Gilbert, whose story is told in the miracle of St. Foy. Twice in a row he received a head injury in combat--once while, apparently, breaking up a barfight--that caused vision problems. And he was, given the source, miraculously healed in several stages. (Draw your own medical conclusions.).
With respect to work, it seems that in a lot of cases the key was to find a task a person could perform. The miracles of St. Bertin tell of one evidently nearsighted man who couldn't see well enough to perform outdoor manual labor, but up very close could still see well enough to do needlework. So he sat with the women of the duke's household all day, working on embroidery and weaving!
But one of the most interesting cases hops way above the others. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century--the one who looked at the Crusades, said "I got u, fam" and negotiated his way into taking over Jerusalem from Muslim control--actually dealt with developing myopia over the course of his life. This could have been a hardship for him, as his true love was hunting. (He embarked on very few building projects over the course of his reign, but these included several hunting lodges, which is also where he preferred to spend much of his time). What did he do? He still hunted with great enthusiasm, apparently. But then, hunting in the Middle Ages wasn't about food (unless you were desperate and poaching), it was about power and masculinity and status and probably blowing off some steam. So even in the parts where humans didn't rely on their dogs and birds to do the work for them, perhaps there was not as much pressure to perform.
But then, of course, there's the ultimate solution. Can't fight like a knight, can't hunt as well as you want to?
is a link to the article if you want to read more. If you want to find any new work on this I would just look for any papers that cite the one I linked. To even further complicate things different populations have higher levels of this variant so while you can analyze existing populations like you mentioned it would be even more difficult to apply this specific example of gene/environment interaction to a historical society without first understanding the genetic composition of members of that society.
My comment was more to illustrate how difficult it is to look at historical diseases because we still don't understand all the ways in which modern diseases are the product of the environment we live in. Applying our own experiences of common maladies, illnesses and defect to the past is a very tricky topic.
Follow up question, since your answer mostly focused on myopia - are there any sources about more "visible" (excuse the pun) eye conditions such as gluacoma or lazy eye?
The point being that like many diseases Myopia is a combination of internal (genetics) and external (reading young) factors. As such we can't exactly apply our own experiences with vision problems in modern society to those of past societies without first understanding how their environments impacted the expression of these diseases.
Would other types of things like phones and computer screens, things that are generally the same distance from our face as a book might be, have the same effects as reading? I don't see why they wouldn't. Have there been any studies on correlation between the literacy rates of a society or wealth (being able to afford books, computers, phones, and having the free time to use them) and rates of Myopia? I would assume that there are many places in the world today that we could look at and see much lower rates of myopia if this is true.
I wanted to peg on some bonus science since that is my specialty and not history. Myopia has a related gene ALPL2. Carriers with a certain variant are up to 5 times more likely to develop myopia IF they spend an hour or more reading each day during their childhood. Mice with excessive ALPL2 proteins in their eyes experienced elongation of their eyes (myopia) when put in a visual environment that mimics reading during early development.
The gene variant involved only exists in about 1% of the population and it is only one of many genes related to myopia. We don't know all the ways in which these genes can interact with the environment. I'm sure there are teams doing follow up studies but that is not something I've been staying abreast of. The research doesn't actually specify what they mean by "reading", what it is really doing is identifying a connection between this variant, time spent "reading", and myopia in a large data set and then confirming the connection through altered mice that can serve as a stand in for human children with this variant. They exposed the mice to "reading like conditions" so I would guess that the mechanism can extend beyond reading a book and the authors suggest that it is anything that forces focus on near tasks can trigger the action.
