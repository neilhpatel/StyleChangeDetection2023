Thank you for your response. If they are addiment about evicting me for this reason, I will simply buy my son a car and await my day in court for a judge to hear their trivial side and then I will explain how I resolved their issue within a week of our meeting. Case should be thrown out based on that resolution, no?!
You should talk to a tenants rights group or a lawyer. It is possible for an HOA to evict in FL, but only after several steps have been made, and they go through the court for injunctive relief. Generally, if there are no unpaid fines it is not possible.
FL has a number of laws limiting fines, but $1000 for something like leaving your scooter parked where parking is not allowed for multiple days is likely legal.
NAL but the HOA does not have much room to stand on for going immediately from notices to eviction. They are only asking you to move. Trying to scare you into moving. You don't gotta leave until a court says so or you say so.
If you are capable of helping your son get a car and ending the fiasco before they do move onto anything bad, I'd advise on that. I'm sure your son and you can work out an agreement for when the insurance pays out to make you whole again.
