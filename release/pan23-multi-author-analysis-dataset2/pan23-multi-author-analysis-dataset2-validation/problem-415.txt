You need to give them your address. After you receive whatever they have to send you, then you can reassess the situation.
There are multiple issues here, so you really need more information. For example, in North Carolina, they have three years, not 30 days, to go after you for damages. The security deposit is a more complicated matter. They can go after you for damages independent of that. You need to give them your address as the next step.
permitted in G.S. 42-51 or, if not so applied, shall be refunded to the tenant. In either case the landlord in writing shall itemize any damage and mail or deliver same to the tenant, together with the balance of the security deposit, no later than 30 days after termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession of the premises to the landlord.

termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession of the premises to the landlord. If the tenant's address is unknown the landlord shall apply the deposit as permitted in G.S. 42-51 after a period of 30 days and the landlord shall hold the balance of the deposit for collection by the tenant for at.
the security deposit cannot be determined within 30 days, the landlord shall provide the tenant with an interim accounting no later than 30 days after termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession of the premises to the landlord and shall provide a final accounting within 60 days after.
This reads to me that they are required to submit itemized damages within 30 days of termination of tenancy and delivery of possession of the premises over to the landlord.
In my mind, the tenancy would be terminated on the day the premises were vacated. Additionally, the keys were returned that day meaning that possession of the premises definitely would have been returned on October 11th.
The only thing I really see where I could be wrong is whether tenancy was terminated when I vacated the premises or when the lease was terminated.
Do you have an answer to whether tenancy terminates when the apartment is vacated or the lease is terminated?
I'm not sure that the law you referenced is applicable in tenant-landlord disputes. Everything I see specifically about tenant law says in is required within 30 days to provide an itemized bill or the landlord becomes responsible.
I was responsible for rent until the property was released. So, the last date of rent payment was October 1st.
least six months. The landlord may not withhold as damages part of the security deposit for conditions that are due to normal wear and tear nor may the landlord retain an amount from the security deposit which exceeds his actual damages. (1977, c. 914, s. 1; 2009-279, s. 5.).
Based on what? I don't doubt there is a lot I don't know about but, I would atleast like to see the part of the law you are referring to.
