Hmm, this is hard question to answer because of the naturally loaded political nature - but is fairly accepted that Sweden experienced capital flight at least before the 1991 tax reform, and potentially after as well.
During the late post-war period Sweden introduced higher and higher taxes, especially on high net worth individuals. A famous example is the Pomperipossa affair where the beloved Swedish Author Astrid Lindgren shone a light on the fact that she paid a 102 % (!) margin tax. Add to this the on-going debate about l√∂ntagarfonder, a forced mechanic for the companies to be bought up by the employees, and the business climate wasn't necessarily friendly to entrepreneurs. Even though the situation was a lot more complicated than this short summary, the fact is that for a large period of time Sweden almost stopped adding private jobs or founding big companies.
This period thus saw great flight of capital where a large number of companies and rich moved abroad. Despite turning more business friendly in 80's, the flight continued and in 1991 67 % of the fortunes of Sweden's highest net worth individuals was owned by Swedes living abroad.
Founded in 1943 and opening its first store in 1958, IKEA is originally a Swedish company and heavily leans on the Swedish heritage in branding, products etc. to a degree that IKEA is one of the things most heavily associated with Sweden.
However - 1973 Ingvar Kamprad moved to Switzerland and in 1982 the full ownership of IKEA was transferred to a Dutch trust. Strictly speaking, IKEA is not a Swedish company.
Other famous companies like Tetra Laval, MTG, EF, H&M and many more, had the fortunes, or the company in whole, at least temporarily moved abroad in this period.
Sweden has since rather drastically reformed its tax system and today much for of the capital resides in the country - even though a substantial part is still held abroad. There is fairly strong consensus that Swedish tax and inflation policy drove capital abroad.
Did that hurt the Swedish economy? That is a much more complicated question which is harder to answer.
A small follow up question, how would you think these changes affected the quality of life of the average Swede. Even if the country had less capital did this severely affect the people?
That is really hard to answer and you would likely get wildly different answer based on people's ideology - both in what happened but also how to measure quality of life in Sweden.
The truth is that Sweden has fallen in the global wealth league (though in high degree to tax havens and oil states), but that actually mainly happened after the changes in the tax system in the 90's (cause and causality here is really tricky though) and many of the companies here mentioned continued to have the majority of their HQ operations still in Sweden.
The fact is that in 70's Swedish economy started to stagnate - but from an extremely high level. On the other hand, Sweden experienced a level of equality almost unheard of - GINI actually being below 0.2 in the early eighties.
After the crisis in the early 90's, and following changes to taxes and welfare policies, Swedish real salaries started to grow quickly, but so also inequality, with GINI today being at least 50 % higher. This also coincided with Sweden joining the EU which helped the economy greatly. It should also be mentioned that the very dire crisis in the early 90's was likely caused primarily by eased lending laws in the 80's. Also - during this period Sweden experienced high immigration that might have a independent effect on GDP per capita.
That being said - the vast majority of mainstream parties would agree that the taxes in the 70's and 80's most likely was punitive and likely hurt Swedish economy. That is likely the reason why the Social Democrats, the party behind the high tax system, was as active in driving change as the center right parties. On the other hand - society was more equal and a larger part of the of company revenue went to the workers.
So - hard to tell for certain and Sweden still enjoyed one the highest living standards in 70's and 80's, but most economists leans towards that it did have negative impact on growth and real salaries - albeit also allowed for an extremely equal distribution.
EDIT: Originally said that real salaries stood still in 70's and 80's - that is what I have read previously. Found some later research from SCB that seems to go against that - so I have taken that part away.
