What would you seek in litigation? Are they unwilling to refund your install fee and move on? What do they describe as the problem for their no-shows?
If they won't perform the install they should give you your money back. There's seemingly nothing more here to sue for. Surely you don't have to sue Best Buy for that.
Honestly, all I was is for them to install the fucking thing. I'd like if they swapped it out with one that hasn't been sitting for 4 months in a garage during days that got -20 during our freezing/thawing season, but if they can assure it will work I'm find with that.
I'm not some greedy person looking for a payday, I just want them to uphold their initial side of the agreement and I want what I lost by taking days off to wait for people that never showed up (I have several messages from Best Buy confirming they were sending people). The best one, was that on March 7th they DID show up, but I was told EXPRESSLY by the people at best buy that they had moved it to the 14th, so I shifted my day off to the 14th. Imagine my surprise when I got a voicemail at work on the 7th that I had "15 minutes" to get there from the installer after having spoken with someone from Best Buy on the 6th who confirmed they were not coming and would be there on the 14th. Especially since THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP ON THE 14TH.
That really wouldn't seem to be their responsibility. They sold you the dishwasher. They came and tried to install it, and they couldn't because of conditions that were distinctly yours.
But really, I just want the fucking thing installed. We have to run the current dishwasher 2-3 times to get stuff clean and I've have now got 11 service tickets with Best Buy (their service contractor told me). This is starting to affect my mental well being because it's just this big looming thing hovering over my head. I saved for months to get a decent dishwasher and got the one I liked (at around $700) and it's just sitting in my garage rotting away because they can't get someone to stop by. Especially since they keep assuring me "It'll only take about 20 minutes" since I did all the prep work already and had a certified plumber change out the fitting they complained about.
Right now, contractually you're probably entitled to install, not to a refund. But one guesses you could talk them into canceling install and giving a refund.
They specifically said they would be back to install it several times and did not meet their promise. Is that not part of the contract? They told me it was "a computer issue on our side preventing us from making an appointment for an installation.".
1. Swapping out the dishwasher for a new one of the same model (that hasn't sat in my garage where they left it for 4 months during freezes/thaws).
I just want the fucking thing installed. If someone can just tell them "You guys have to just fucking do it already" I would be happy. They just keep telling me "between 7am and 1pm" and I waited so many days and they didn't show up.
I can't install it myself because I live in a second floor townhome. I own my unit, but if it leaks or something I want to make sure it's installed by someone insured.
