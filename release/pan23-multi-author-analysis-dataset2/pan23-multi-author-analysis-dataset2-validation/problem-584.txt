The fact that it's hard to see children getting on and off a stopped bus is the reason they have flashing signs and there are strict laws about passing them. Obviously school buses go places other than school zones.
Many school buses in the Seattle area have video cameras that can be used to enforce the no-passing law; they are often mounted right next to the swing-out STOP signs themselves.
I expected to be shamed on Reddit for the poor driving, so I really do appreciate that you phrased it as a learning explanation. It’s a relief to know most drivers make this mistake once. This lesson is possibly a difficult and expensive one but lesson learned. If I have to go to court, that will be exactly what I’ll say.
There's nothing you can do about it now. If you are cited you can do a "trial by written declaration" and truthfully say you were confused by the presence of a school bus in South Lake Union where there are few residences, or (if true) that the STOP sign was not extended.
There was a case a few years ago when a Seattle attorney got a ticket for speeding through a school zone whose signs said "15 MPH when lights are flashing".
He argued successfully that a signage simplification law requires those signs to say "15 MPH when flashing", therefore all of the signs were invalid and unenforceable.
That was about the time that the state's school-zone and bus-stop laws (and signs) got an overhaul to be sure they were watertight.
What fools me is when I'm on a road with 3+ lanes and there's a bus on the opposite site. In Washinon, on 2-lane roads.
No telling if that particular one had cameras, but a lot do, and there are repercussions. You can say you have learned your lesson, but the court may disagree.
