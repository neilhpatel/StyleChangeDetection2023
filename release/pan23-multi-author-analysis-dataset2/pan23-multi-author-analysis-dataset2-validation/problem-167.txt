I am going to try and take a crack at this, but by no means am I a historian, so mods feel free to strike away if this does not meet standards.
So, there is not a super clear-cut answer for you, because science fiction writers of the time were by no means a monolith. They had a wide range of political philosophies, and many of them do not fit neatly into the categories we would like.
This is not to say Heinlein was perfectly enlightened; Tunnel in the Sky contains some very stereotypical Yellow Peril tropes near the beginning of the novel, but it was more progressive than the US government at the time.
Robert A. Heinlein is perhaps the best example of this. Heinlein was a political conservative, actively campaigning for Barry Goldwater in 1964, though Heinlein tended to describe himself as a libertarian.
Much of this comes from Heinlein's own correspondence, archived by the Heinlein Trust Archive. I am not really quite sure how to cite a primary source such as this.
Rod Walker, the main character of the novel, was intended to be Black. Rod is a smart, resourceful leader of the expedition, who helps the group become a functioning agrarian society. The publisher pushed back against this idea and Heinlein reluctantly took it out, but not before leaving behind his "breadcrumbs.".
Near the end of the novel, Heinlein gives us a twist. Johnny is just a nickname, his legal name is Juan Rico, a Filipino man who speaks Tagalog. No characters mention this at all prior to the end of the novel, as it only comes up in a conversation about the characters' mother tongues. This was Heinlein's vision, a future where race mattered little in society.
In 1955, Heinlein wrote Tunnel in the Sky, a book we would now call a young adult novel. Tunnel in the Sky was about a group of young students traveling to a distant planet, and becoming stranded there. It was a direct response to Lord of the Flies, published a year earlier. Heinlein took umbrage with Golding's dim view of human nature and sought to tell a story wherein the young students not only survive but indeed build a democratic society.
Another important trait about Caroline is that multiple characters assume she and the main character, Rod Walker, have feelings for each other. While in most YA novels this would not get much consideration, Heinlein himself described this as a "breadcrumb." He left a few of these "breadcrumbs" in the novel, to hint to the reader something he was forced to leave out of the published novel.
A few years later, Heinlein would write his breakout hit, Starship Troopers. Though it depicts a highly-militaristic future, Heinlein once more shows his views of racial integration within the novel. The novel follows young Johnny, a highschooler who joins the power-armored Mobile Infantry in order to impress a girl. The novel follows Johnny through basic training, to the battlefield, to officer school. The novel is notable for showing many women serving in the military, though in different roles. Most pilots were women, for instance.
Tunnel in the Sky is notable for having numerous female characters be among these space explorers. Perhaps the most prominent female character in Tunnel in the Sky is a girl named Caroline, who is described as a "tall Zulu." Caroline is not only explicitly Black, but her character is also shown to be one of the most competent members of the expedition, from hunting game to acting as the official historian of the group writing everything down in shorthand.
Starship Troopers was written in response to the Left asking Eisenhower to stop nuclear testing in the late 50s, and published when he was already 52 years old and had been writing about sexually and racially liberated societies, and had worked for Upton Sinclair's (a self-proclaimed socialist) campaign for governor of California. Asimov said his politics were dictated by "the woman he was married to at the time" while Heinlein himself described politics in his works as what circumstances it is moral for a group to do what is immoral for an individual to do, the character who posed the question later rejecting that as shifting blame to society at large and absolving the individual. Comparing that to modern libertarian and Conservative parties could probably be its own paper, much less an AH comment.
Do you know how and why was Heinlein a conservative while writing books with non-white main characters ?
I guess you must be aware of the contradiction given that you mention that he was a conservative, but you also don't elaborate on it or try to link that fact with his personal views on race.
I am not asking you why you called him a conservative ; obviously if he supported Goldwater in 1964 he must indeed have been a conservative, if not in his personal views at least in the way he voted, but why ?
He wouldn't be the first libertarian, who wants a strong government to defend America from communism and at the same time has little time for social conservative views on race and sexuality. Apparently he was pro-Vietnam War in 1968 as well, so his support for a racist presidential candidate could be a matter of priorities. It should be said, though, that the Republican Party presidential candidates weren't explicitly racist/anti-civil rights until 1964, and after their presidential election loss that year, their "Southern Strategy" turned towards so-called "dog-whistle-politics" appealing to racist white voters without being explicitly racist.
Heinlein was a Navy man who hit his stride during the Cold War, so it's not unusual that he would find himself in a pro-war position while also valuing the countercultures he was exposed to during the Great Depression and Civil Rights eras. He did work for the Reagan administration but as a space consultant, and described the Bugs in Starship Troopers as an example of why Communism wouldn't work for humans, who he described as individualistic as opposed to the alien collective he wrote. While his views clearly evolved over the years, I think most of his core thoughts stayed the same; blood will have to be shed to maintain personal freedoms and those who disagree are not worthy of those freedoms. The threat to him wasn't coming from the nebulous other in your neighborhood that didn't look like you, it was coming from those who wanted to take your freedom to enrich themselves. I would be interested to hear his critiques of the Democratic presidents during the Cold War, as from what I already know I get the sense that his disagreements with the GOP were pushed aside due to their being the party most concerned with national defense.
