While International Law is something often disputed, there was an Outer Space Treaty in 1967 that specifically mentions no sovereign nation can claim territory, as all nations should be able to explore freely. China is one of the nations that supported the treaty (accession).
I mean Russia is a signatory to the Budapest Memorandum but they still invaded Ukraine. International treaties mean diddly squat to power hungry Autocrats.
The only two countries that really could do such a thing were the Soviet Union and the United States. Things have changed. We shall see how faithful China is to nearly seventy year old treaties in due time.
This is covered by private corporations being held accountable by their home nation. Should SpaceX for example do something really fucked up, the UN would likely hold the US accountable. This in turn makes nations make sure private interests act up. Obviously things can go south and money lobbyists go brrrrrr, but it isn't as straight forward as it is at first glance.
