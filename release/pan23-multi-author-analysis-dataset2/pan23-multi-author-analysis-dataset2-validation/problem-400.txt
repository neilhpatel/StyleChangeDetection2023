Find out if the hospital in question has an Ombudsman (sometimes people even procure thier own) This is basically a patient advocate. Thier job is to make sure the patient is being taken care of. Good luck, I hope things turn out ok.
Am not a lawyer, am an RN in the state of Georgia. A 1013 is someone who is held in the hospital for possible harm they could do to themselves. They will get a psychological consult while there. If there is no evidence of active self harm or intent to self harm, they should release him, after a minimum of 24 hours but no longer than 72 hours. He should be able to still get every medication as well as his blood sugar checked regularly and insulin coverage when needed. Hospital food does suck for people with diabetes. There will be white bread and juice unfortunately, but diabetics are also put on a carb counted diet. The hospital has the legal obligation to get your friend clear from a psyc standpoint. The pastor may be a mandated reporter and sounds like they were truly concerned for your friends wellbeing.
And to the on patient safety, if the hospital is accredited by them, specifically about him not getting his medications that are needed.
The police are pretty much obligated to ensure someone gets checked out once the possibility of suicide is raised. There's too much at stake for them to just trust that it was "a misunderstanding". They'll let the doctors decide that.
It doesn't sound like any laws have been broken. Best of luck as you support your friend in this hard time, and I'm sorry that he has gone through all this.
A 72 hour hold doesn't mean he's stuck for 3 days. It only means they can hold him a maximum of 72 hours (or must go before a judge and request a longer hold, if they still feel he's still a danger to himself or others). In most states it's required for such patients to be assessed by a psychiatrist within 24 hours of admission; generally much sooner than that. If this was indeed just a misunderstanding he'll be released without fuss at that point. Or if he's in need of further assistance things will branch off from there.
