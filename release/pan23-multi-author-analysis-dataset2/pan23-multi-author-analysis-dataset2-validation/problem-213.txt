We can’t answer without knowing if you’re salary, on commission and what type of work you do. There are OT exempt employees in California who don’t have to be paid overtime but there are specific requirements for that.
If they've just made a mistake and they are reasonable, then bringing it to their attention shouldn't upset anyone, but if they're deliberately committing wage theft, there's really nothing you can do to get them to stop that won't make them upset.
If you do bring it up and they refuse to fix it and pay you the unpaid overtime you're owed, you can . This probably won't make your employer happy, but legally they are not allowed to retaliate against you, and if they do, you can .
I think it is purposeful because I brought it up casually and he said basically “I don’t know” and changed the subject. I’ve also discussed it with coworkers and they’re aware. I think the main problem is nobody wants to upset the manager, including me. The work environment would be too awkward and uncomfortable for me to continue to work there.
I’m honestly not sure what to do because it’d basically mess up my job if I did say something, even if they can’t fire me.
