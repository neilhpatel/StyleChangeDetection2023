It’s amazing to say this given how many they’ve been having, but Israel really needs another election and to see the back of Netanyahu.
I really don’t see Israel fixing them selves anytime soon or at all I think it will end in complete and utter colonization, because of how much they are at odds with their neighbors and how the fascism and xenophobia is literally baked into Zionism at this point. They would need a drastic change and generations of new indoctrination to get rid of it. That change can truly only come if the US stops sending them money. They will then be forced to do it to appease the surrounding countries.
Another way about it would be if Muslim world started to support Palestine properly but their hypocrisy and corruption would never allow it.
Israel is kind of a unique and troubled experiment in that anyone (well, not minorities, really) can become Jewish and immigrate to Israel. That means their immigration tends to be ideological and tends to be a little bit right-ish.
Would you want to immigrate to a country that has institutionalized the suffering of millions of Arabs? Most of us say fuck-no, the people that say fuck yes, are a very particular type of human.
(that's of course a broad brush, people immigrate to Israel for many many many reasons but the self-selective nature of the Israeli populace is a little bit unique).
