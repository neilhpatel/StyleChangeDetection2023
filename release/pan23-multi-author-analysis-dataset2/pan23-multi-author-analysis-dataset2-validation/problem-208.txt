This is going to be something you need to consult an attorney about. While your grandmother meant well, there are zoning ordinances, local laws, the now visible issue with utilities, etc. Subdivided land (from what I read) can be very complicated and an attorney would help navigate that. That being said, it honestly sounds like (on paper) the land is one piece of land, and only subdivided per the will and no new property lines have been established. Your location is also going to help others give you better guidance, as google seems to bode different regulations and statutes per state. You may also need to get the unofficial subdivisions surveyed so there are clear property lines.
Funny story about that, we had our land surveyed and found that the last survey was off by quite a bit. Our land actually ends at our front porch and the next three plots, which are the cousins trailer, her mothers house beside her, and an unrelated fellow who bought his plot from the grandmother decades ago, are all built about a quarter on the next person's land.
