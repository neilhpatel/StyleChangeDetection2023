There are no - to my knowledge at least - professional accreditations related to being a 'historian' so anyone can claim to be one if they want to. How far that claim is taken seriously will depend entirely on the audience. In the case of someone like Dan Carlin, I have no doubt that many of his fans would happily agree with his using the label if he used it, while others might be more sceptical. I personally think Carlin deliberately avoids it, to pre-empt his work getting subjected to serious scrutiny and avoid accusations that he is misleading his audience. Generally speaking, many people who do call themselves historians aren't always hugely impressed with the history underpinning his videos, but don't particularly mind as Carlin explicitly isn't claiming expertise.
Perhaps this is outside of the discussion, but I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with accessible history, and dislike the condescending use of the term, as if it were not real history. I think that popular and narrative retellings of history are important because they provide a starting point from which one can learn more. One example is the podcast Revolutions by Mike Duncan. I listened to his American Revolution and French Revolution series, and though I do have some basic knowledge, I'm no expert and could not identify any important mistakes. However, when I listened to his podcast about Simon Bolivar and Gran Colombia, a topic I'm very interested in, I was able to see many errors, such as his portrayal of Bolivar as a more heroic figure than he really was or his vilification of Santander. He also glosses over the important details of Gran Colombia's inner politics and development, in favor of a narrative focusing on war and political struggle. Nonetheless, he does not make any incorrect claims per se, and listeners can easily access his sources. This will serve as a springboard from which they can learn more, especially because his narrative already did an excellent job teaching them the basics and getting them interested on the topic. Duncan, and others like Carlin, do not claim to be historians, and most definitely are not historians, at least in my opinion, but I still think their work is useful.
If we did want to start defining it more precisely, to my mind there are a few lines you could draw that would make at least some sense.
Carlin isnt trying to avoid anything he is being upfront about his knowledge. He usually makes the comment that he isnt a historian when discussing motives for something that are his opinion because he isnt looking at source material, he is relying on the work of academic historians whom he does cite, and often. Carlin isnt trying to create new knowledge, he is giving a history lesson on what is already out there in a narrative format. Its what historians condescendingly call "accessible".
