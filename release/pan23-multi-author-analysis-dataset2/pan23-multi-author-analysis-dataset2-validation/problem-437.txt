Just speculating. On my commute the other day there was so much water on the freeway I had to go around 45 to keep consistent traction. Saw quite a few people losing control or crashed on the side of the road.
Trees down all over. Half the power poles along 2nd are down, if not straight snapped in half. Four massive trees down right behind my own house. The debris is considerable, but the city's been doing a great job sawing it up and pushing it out of the way.
Weirdly, Davis is relative high ground for the area, so flooding is unlikely. Getting in and out of town from any direction but west is a little tricky this morning.
I live in Sacramento. The park next to the zoo by my house looks like a literal bomb hit it. At some point we had like 400000 people with no power in our local electric municipality, but that was much better than PG&E who people have lost power since NYE. They are getting emails saying power might not return until next week. Lots of pics of crushed cars and houses going around too.
SMUD is doing well getting you guys back online, I hope. The outage map looks vague, it's hard to see what's what. I'm supposed to head in to deliver food to a youth shelter this morning, but I'm not sure it's even open... everyone my wife's office next to City Hall has been told not to bother coming in.
Imagine walking out of a brick and mortar store and discovering they put a gps tracker on your car while you were shopping, hired someone to follow you around to see which products you look at in other stores, who then followed you home and took pictures through your window to see what you ate for dinner and which book you were reading.
