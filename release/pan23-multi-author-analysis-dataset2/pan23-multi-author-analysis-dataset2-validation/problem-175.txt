If you don't have anything court ordered, no you don't have have to turn him over. But you guys need to get together on a formal custody plan. If your kiddo is over 14, Oregon law let's them voice a preference in who they want to live with, which is not the only factor, but a major factor, in child custody.
A plan that allows dad equal time, even if if it's not for the entire time is appropriate. But the child's age is a big factor. You can't physically force a teenager to go. So when dad shows up, it's time for a heart to heart to determine the best course of action. Let dad talk to the kid alone so they know that it's not coerced, then sit down together as parents without the kid and decide what to do.
At the end of the day, it's not about what you or he wants, it's about what's best for the kid and the least traumatic way to achieve that while still being fair to Dad.
If it's a court order plan, then yes, your ultimately going to have to let your son go. But my advice on a private talk between dad and son, along with a heart to heart stands. The Court order stands when you can't come to a mutual agreement.
It could be something as simple as he's concerned he could end up being ordered to pay more support when everything is finalized if he doesn't take all of his court ordered allowed time. The parent who has physical custody more than half the time can request more support to compensate for that. If that's his concern, perhaps you can work on a compromise.
Thank you so much! My son in 7 and we are actually doing summer school in person. This is not a matter of what I want as much as being home is better for him. All his teachers have written recommendations for him and his siblings to attend in person. There is a court ordered temporary plan.
If there is a court ordered visitation schedule in place that trumps any consent he might have implied or given that is different than the order or changing of minds. Anything outside of the four corners of that piece of paper must be changed in the same fashion.
Or maybe he just really wants to see him and don't realize how traumatic ripping him away from routine can be. Particularly if you two separated recently.
