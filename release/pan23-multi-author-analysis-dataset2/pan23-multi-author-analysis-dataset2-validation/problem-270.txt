Stop sending evidence that you don't owe them money. Start by sending them a letter demanding that THEY validate the debt. Until and unless they do, they are not supposed to take any action to collect.
I wouldn’t send them any information at all. They will take your info and use it to try and collect. Simply tell them you don’t owe the debt and then it’s up to them to prove it with what they have.
I did that at first but they have threatened to affect both my credit and my grandmothers (her name was also on the car) and if the decide to take it to court then i cant leave the country like I've planned to do.
Couldn't they go after mine or my grandmas credit? I don't care about mine because I'm moving out of country but I dont want this to affect my grandma at all if I can help it. (her name was also on the car).
It sounds like the person who bought the car from you never bothered to pick it up from the tow yard, which resulted in a large bill for towing and storage. The tow company had a lien against the car for the unpaid balance, and they sold the car at auction to help cover the cost. Evidently, the car didn't sell for much, and there is a deficiency.
Providing false or inaccurate mileage is not a violation of this subdivision unless it is done with the intent to defraud.
Warrants are for criminal cases. They can’t stop you from leaving for a civil matter. Best they can do is file a civil lawsuit against you and try to collect. But there is a process for that. Takes time. Also if you tell them to fuck off and they keep calling you, you may have a claim against them.
In short ignore their threats. It’s bluster and nonsense. They have to prove the debt. Not the other way around. And you don’t have to help them.
No but my Fiance was planning to visit when he got called to go to court for reasons himself. And even though he was innocent, they would have considered him leaving the country as running and I would think it would be the same in this case. It would probably just put a warrant on my name if I tried to leave.
Also, if you ever plan to come back to the US (you never know) you should try to keep your credit as clean as possible.
If you see this debt on your credit open a dispute immediately and demand the debt be validated. If they fail to validate within the allotted time the debt will be removed from your credit record.
It sounds like you may actually be responsible for the deficiency. I don't know enough about CA law to say so definitively, but you failed to comply with the requirements in Section 5900 and tow companies are allowed to pursue deficiency balances in CA.
