There is not a sentient human in the world who doesn't agree that any other human in the story of the USA would have been indicted and in jail pending trial at the very minimum.
Your average Joe Shit the Ragman would have already been arrested, arraigned, tried, found guilty, and either in some dank hole in a Federal prison or on death row. The DOJ has been monumentally “deferential” to the Orange Shitgibbon.
How powerful, or rich, or influential you are should have no bearing. It does, of course. It seems to entirely determine if laws are actually laws for you, or just guidelines.

Man, that's the tip of the iceberg. His NFT scam is set up specifically to be a pipeline for people paying him large sums of money in a way that can't be tracked. Think about it, they're $99 each and one person can only buy $9900 worth. Any deposits over $10,000 are required to have their details reported to the IRS. Skirting that regulation is clearly the only reason that purchase limit exists. And all the money goes directly to Trump, not is campaign. So here we have a way that people inside and outside the country can funnel him large sums of money in $9900 increments with no way the transactions can be tracked. I'm sure there's nothing at all shady going on.
