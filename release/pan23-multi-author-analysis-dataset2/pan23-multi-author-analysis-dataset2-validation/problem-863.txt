Indiana's "" is the sort of thing called an "overdose Good Samaritan" law in some other places. The law that applies to you is specifically about .
If you are in college, your school may have a student legal services clinic that can refer you to local attorneys who do this kind of work.
You should not have been arrested or charged with a crime, since you appear to have fulfilled all of the elements of eligibility: you summoned 911, you identified yourselves, and you cooperated with law enforcement.
The best way to handle this is to hire a criminal defense attorney, tell her the story in detail, and have her move to dismiss the charges during your initial appearance based on that law.
If you posted the full amount of "cash bail", you will get all of your bail money back once you (and anyone else you posted bail for) appear at all of your hearings, regardless of the outcome of those hearings.
Did you buy a "bail bond" from a bail bond company? Those are typically 10% of the bail amount, and that fee is not refundable.
May I ask what agency arrested you ? Most police forces are well aware of the Lifeline Law: it went into effect in the summer of 2012 and was hugely popular, passing the very conservative Indiana Senate 96-0.
Interestingly, Indiana's lifeline law doesn't apply to the actual alcohol overdose victim, just to the people around him or her.
Your attorney asks for a meeting with the prosecutor, explains how the police violated the Lifeline Law, and gets their agreement not to oppose a motion to dismiss. You just have to show up for the judge to rule on that motion and dismiss the charges.
I did post cash bail. I would love to tell you, but since my arrest is now public record and its a small town, I am afraid of accidently releasing my identity. What would you do with said information if I gave it to you?
Thank you for getting back to me. I appreciate it, I have already contacted an attorney. If the charges are dismissed, will I get my bail money back? I only ask because I spent a large savings for college on my friends and I.
Thank you, this is good information to know. Do you think the initial court date is unavoidable either way? If the arrest does in fact turn out to be illegal, then will the officer receive any potential punishment? I don't care that much, but I am curious as to how something like this works behind the scenes as well.
"Small town" is enough. I figure the further you get from Indy, South Bend, Bloominon, or West Lafayette, the less familiar the local PDs are with how to handle young drinkers.
I think that an initial hearing is unavoidable; you need a dismissal order to get your bail money back, after all.
A prosecutor might refuse. Maybe they're from the town where Footloose was set. Maybe one of the defendants kicked their dog. Maybe they're campaigning for a seat in the legislature on a tough-on-teenage-drinking platform. That will make the defense process more costly and complicated.
Good defense attorneys always give the police and prosecutors a chance to save face. Getting the case done with an unopposed motion to dismiss in ten minutes first thing in the morning before the judge's mood is soured by seeing serious criminal defendants is one good way.
