I wrote my undergraduate thesis on Irish folk music and its role in politics, national identity, and violence through the lens of The Troubles. I did not use Danny Boy in my research for a couple of reasons, but I think this frame of reference is useful for the sake of your question.
American folk music has its origins in foreign and diverse musical traditions, yet we, the consumers and performers, broadly call it "American." From :
An Irish folk song does not have to be written by an Irish person in order to be an Irish folk song. "Dirty Old Town," recorded by The Dubliners and The Pogues, is widely considered to be an Irish song, though it was written by Ewan MacColl (an Englishman born to Scottish parents) about an English town. ().
Thank you for both parts of your answer. It sounds like although “Danny Boy” arguably has a less-than-fully-Irish origin, the song so resoundingly checks the boxes of what one would expect an Irish song to be that, in popular imagination, it has become a conspicuous element of the canon of Irish songs.
Despite the salacious headline of the article, Irish songs being less that 100% Irish - as if such a thing could be measured - is not a scandal. "Leaving of Liverpool" is about a journey from England to California, yet listening to an entire audience of Irish concertgoers sings along (2:45). According to my observations in my undergraduate research and in my conversations with Irish folk musicians and enthusiasts, the metric of an Irish folk song has less to do with the origin and more to do with the listener. A few illustrative points:
I have not read about Frederic Weatherly having a relationship with Scotland, but , and many confuse features of the two countries.
The Pogues' recording of "The Band Played Waltzing Matilda" is considered to be an Irish song because they are an Irish band (formed by Hiberno-Brits in England) though it is written by a Scottish man about an Australian service member in Turkey in WWI. It can be found on such sites as and featured on . These are not academic sources, rather the reflection of the opinion of a populace, which is what really designates a song as a local phenomenon or not.
Addressing the Scottish influence in your question directly, music has passed freely across the borders of Ireland and Scotland for many, many years, and enough qualities are shared by both traditions that it can be difficult - and useless - to try to separate the two when they overlap or share a blurred boundary. The following is a block quote of my own work, which I do not know how to cite in this sub, but I will include relevant in-text citations below:

Irish music is incredibly syncretic, with instruments like violins, concertinas, and bouzoukis being considered traditional, or "trad," instruments. The boundaries of what make a song "Irish" are incredibly vague.
Because Irish folk music, like many other musical traditions, is syncretic, and many songs, especially ones that originate nearby, are absorbed into the popular canon.

Danny Boy, whose 1910 lyrics were set to the air in 1913, emerged in a cultural moment in which the Gaelic League was promoting Irish sport, music, art, and language, and Irish groups were militarizing in the lead-up to the 1916 Easter Rising. Its apparently ancient melody and its air of nostalgia are very aligned to the movement to revive ancient Irish culture and a deep cultural grief, having experienced 700 years of colonization and the loss of 1 million countrymen to famine a mere 60 years beforehand.
Despite the Englishness of the lyricist, the song carries the tune "Londonderry Air." (Many would prefer to call it "Derry Air.") "Londonderry Air" was collected by Jane Ross in 1885 and submitted to George Petrie, a titan of Irish musical preservation. The song was billed as truly ancient;.
This history was likely a fiction - , and it is likely not as ancient as some might claim, but the narrative of ancient sorrow is a poignant one. I have not seen polling or research on the sentiment concerning the song in Ireland, but I do observe that many of the Irish musical exports to America maintain this sense of nostalgia and tragedy.
The work of collecting has always been political, however; “ancient” music or “authentic” music are in the eye of the beholder, and especially before Irish independence, creating an image of ancient Irish culture - worthy and sophisticated before British occupation - was a political decision to confer cultural legitimacy to the "backwards" Irish.
This is by no means a scientific study, but to get a vague understanding of what the "popular" Irish folk songs are these days, I opened all the lists on the first page of Google results for "most popular Irish folk songs in America" (I will link them at the bottom) and found a high percentage of the songs to be straight-up bummers. "Molly Malone," a slow and mournful ballad about a poor working woman who dies young was even listed as the top song for 'Your St. Patrick's Day Playlist' twice. Songs like "Molly Malone" (death), "Fields of Athenry" (famine), "Song for Ireland" (immigration), "Sunday, Bloody Sunday (civil war; also, not a folk song, but the lists have spoken), "Raglan Road" (unrequited love), "The Auld Triangle" (unjust imprisonment), and "Green Fields of France" (the horrors of WWI) all inhabit these lists of important Irish songs even when those lists are party- or vacation-themed. "The Parting Glass" (death) was not on these lists in particular, but I would argue that it is behind "Danny Boy" or "Molly Malone" as the most-known Irish folk song in America.
There are many conclusions to be drawn from this trend; I can only give you my own, based in my research on Irish folk music and the American Irish diaspora. There is a certain longing in the characterization of the Irish diaspora; our ancestors were driven out by force and famine, by generational poverty, forced labor, religious discrimination, and the ruthless theft of Irish language, religion, custom, law, dress, government, and land. Queen Ellizabeth I even ordered the summary execution of all bards and the destruction of the harps in 1601 to suppress their music as well.4.
The most intact pre-Norman tradition that survived the long centuries of Britain's longest-running colony was its music. That music carried with it a constant subversive spirit of rebellion and also a deep and persistent sorrow alongside its obvious joy and spirit and humor. Many songs express many of these sentiments at the same time. Music for and by the diaspora celebrates drinking and joking, but as evidenced by the high volume of misery in songs geared toward us are sad, nostalgic, and full of death.
Notably, the three heavy hitters of "Molly Malone," "Danny Boy," and "The Parting Glass" hold within them a tone of hope for life after death. I argue that this is a major contributing factor to their success in the Irish diaspora: a longing for home, and a hope for return.
"Londonderry Air" is a particularly powerful example of the beauty of an Irish lament. Hubert Parry, composer and Oxford professor of music .
