The 10k limit flags it just so they have a record. They don’t raise eyebrows just because. That amount of money is deposited thousands of times a day.
$10k gets the attention of the treasury department in regards to money laundering and terrorism circumstances. And generally it is multiple deposits and withdrawals of just under $10k that raise red flags.
There’s nothing illegal about this at all but I would suggest heading over to /r/PersonalFinance to ask about how best to set your dad up. There’s some very knowledgeable people over there.
You should speak with a financial planner about setting up some sort of living trust to help pay for your dad’s bills with one or both of you as the trustees.
Edit: IANAL but you should probably speak with one of those as well as a financial planner/estate planner. You can probably access one free of charge with the firm you hold your IRA/brokerage account/401k with.
If you have more than $10k cash to deposit from a legitimate source, deposit it all at once and fill out the Currency Transaction Report. It's a 2 page form that basically just wants your identifying information (Name, address, etc.) and the amount of money, no big deal.
Splitting it up to avoid filling out that form is a crime even if the source of the money is entirely legitimate.
That's called structuring, which is less an issue of 'raising red flags' as an issue of being a crime in and of itself.
