I'm not sure why you're singling out Muslim historians here. All (reputable) historians favor more recent scholarship, because scholars build on earlier work to make better and clearer, and sometimes different, arguments.
I did a reading list for my PhD exams on Muslim-Christian interaction in the medieval Mediterranean. The entire idea of a PhD list is to expose you to the most important scholarship in the field.
I am not Muslim and neither was the professor. The earliest book I read was from 1937, and it was paired with two much more recent ones to show how our understanding of that history has changed over time--including from things as basic as "looking at archaeology, too." And in other cases, it's a matter of, "hey, nobody has ever studied this topic.".
Again it's all well and good to say that these people were racists--many of them were. They also wrote damn good dictionaries.
To give an extreme example: The most important modern English-Arabic dictionary, the Hans Wehr dictionary, was written by a literal Nazi. Now there's a whole critique of Said that he ignores German Orientalists because the Germans didn't actually create an Orientalist empire of the kind he describes compared to the British and the French, but putting that aside, surely the reprehensible views of a literal Nazi would taint that scholarship?
You don't need to bring trigger words like "leftist" and "anti-orientalist historians" into the picture. You just need to say historians.
It turns out the philological and historical value of the "Orientalists" who conducted Oriental Studies in the 19th and early 20th century is immense.
Another commenter has mentioned Edward Said, it's worth noting that Edward Said's primary influence is not in Middle Eastern history departments but in literature departments.
Whatever ones views of Bernard Lewis (my own is that he was a talented Turkologist at the start of his career who ended up having wildly divisive political opinions in the latter half of his very long life), his critique of Said's Orientalism that he ignores the value of pure philology rings obviously true in my opinion.
Another Orientalist singled out by Said, Edward William Lane (mostly directed at his ethnographic Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians) is also the author of the most important classical Arabic-English dictionary, Lane's Lexicon, largely drawing on the medieval Arabic dictionary Lisan al-Arab.
Where I think this becomes more complicated, and where the term "Orientalist" gets extremely complicated is in understanding the role of critical history in the history of Islam and the Middle East.
Patricia Crone, one of the most important historians of the second half of the twentieth century, prefaced one of her early books by saying that it was history "by infidels, and for infidels.".
Because, yes, some historians have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. "Orientalist" has become something of a slur among historians, used to discredit others' work. As CptBuck said, some of the classical work is really valuable -- inasmuch as Lane's Manners and Customs is written through his English eye, it's an extremely valuable ethnographic work about life in mid 19th century Egypt.
That, I think, has to be the approach of critical western historians (though there are very important alternative veins of research) particularly to early Islamic history. I also understand fully why devout Muslims would find that to be "altering their history", just as I understand why various forms of evangelical Christians find, say, biblical analysis to be altering their history.
But the fact remains that I don't think the "orientalist" issue, 40+ years after Said's Orientalism is nearly so difficult to tackle today.
To chime in here (and I agree with everything that said), the issue with orientalist scholarship isn't that it alters history, so much as it presents it from an extremely etic viewpoint (an outside-in perspective); the histories and the cultures of the east aren't presented on their own terms, but rather through the perspective of a not-always-sympathetic outsider.
The other hallmark of Orientalism is that non-western societies tend to be presented as "fixed" in time, unchanging, and eternal. The philological origins of area studies are based in the ideas that there are core texts representative of the "Arab mind" or the "Islamic mind" or the "Indian mind" or what have you, and all you needed to do was read a few texts to understand the "essence" of these cultures. (Think, for example, of how sales of the Qur'an spiked after 9/11 because people wanted to figure out why a handful of Muslims attacked the US, so they picked up a 1,400 year old text to look for the answer, while actively rejecting any answers that pointed at the impact of American foreign policy since WWII toward the Islamic world -- no, the answer clearly had to be "there's something wrong with them".).
And, despite the unease with which both emic and etic scholars viewed this challenge ... well, it's kind of worked. The discovery of the so-called Birmingham Qur'an and the San'a manuscripts date the Qur'an to the time it was said to have been authored. Epigraphic studies based on rock inscriptions in the desert are helping us see the text as being written in a distinctly 7th century Hijazi dialect.
To cite but one example, W. Montgomery Watts, who wrote an important biography of the prophet Muhammad (in two volumes, later consolidated into one), was also a clergyman. He ended his book essentially by saying, "There's no denying he's an important historical figure, but let's not forget he was also a false prophet." In modern historical scholarship, that sort of stuff doesn't fly--although it's certainly still produced (as Crone said, "for infidels, by infidels" and, to that, I would add, "to congratulate themselves on being infidels," at least where that type of writing is currently.).
