He needs to file to move the custody order to the current state and then file for contempt if she isn't following it.
Unfortunately he let this go way too long so that the kid is already situated in the new state and no judge is likely to uproot the little one unless there physical/psychological harm.
If no case has ever been filed in old state, then new state is now the kid’s “home state” so a case to establish parentage and a parenting plan (visitation and custody) would have to be filed there. This would open the door to her filing a child support case .
If case has been filed in old state , then terms of any judgment will dictate what he can do. However because he let this go for 6 years, judge is likely to not uproot the child also and find a way for BF to be a parent and have parenting time from 1500 miles away .
The fact that he let this go 6 years is not going to look great. If he can hire an attorney he should.
He doesn’t want to take the kid away, he just wants to be able to see her. She’s in Arizona and we’re in California now so it’s much closer than 1500 miles. They had child support and visitation set up in the old state and she moved without telling him.
So because he didn’t want to take legal action and just wanted to work with her even though she refused to talk to him or give him any information (which we have receipts for), then he’s in the wrong?
He had six months after she moved to file to have the child returned to CA and it would have been granted, but after 6 months the new state becomes the child's "home state" and it becomes a lot more difficult to get the child back into the state. But he will still see his child, he just needs to actually go to court.
Not in the wrong as it seems his intentions were in the right place, probably just too trusting of the CP IMHO. If visitation order/judgment contains language about home state being AZ or AZ having jurisdiction then you should be able to file petition to modify the current order in AZ under same case.
