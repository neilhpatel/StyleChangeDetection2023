There is a court order to not build the turbines. Energy company wants to ignore the court order. Thunberg and court are on the same side in this.
The courts came to the verdict 11th of october 2021. The Støre goverment(Workersparty/Arbeiderpartiet) went into power 14th of october 2021. Doubt the Solberg had time to fix anything in the 3 days before transition of power.
The concession to build the park was given in 2010 by NVE. This was during the Stoltenberg goverment(Workersparty/Arbeiderpartiet). So blaming the whole "mess" on "the last goverment" is incorrect. Under the Solberg goverments(Right/Høyre); Building started in 2015 and the park was fully operational in 2020.
Have the energy corporation pay 150-200M euros to the reindeer folk to buy a nice plot of territory for them and buy some luxury barns as well. The wind farm comes out with half the cost of a worst case and the reindeer are filthy rich. Win-win.
It's okay to be principled on human rights but solving climate emergency is not just about picking who wins. There are people who are going to lose and that has to be accepted.
So the current goverment is stuck cleaning up the mess made by their own political party in 2010. Not "The last goverment".
We can't as a world say we won't do this because it will hurt this group or that group, or Mr Smith...
This is a way of life for the Sami people. They rely on reindeer herding as a matter of survival. The energy company wants to take land from an ethnic minority group to further their own profits.
