In all truth I have no solid proof on just one person, but based on everything I know of, and based on everything my artist told me. It has to be someone out of three possible people.
3) my artist found it first thing the next day, but is lying so he could keep the AirPods to himself.
Either someone snatched it at around 7pm while I was getting tattooed (2 suspects), or I genuinely missed seeing my white AirPods case on a black leather chair which I find highly unlikely. Even if I did do that, since I was the last client in a small room before the shop closed. Therefore no other clients could have stolen it. And my artist said first thing the next day he checked and it wasn’t there.
2) I genuinely forgot it on the chair/room and 1 of three employees who had access to the room after me took it.
Well one thing to note is my AirPods were last seen and out of range at 7:08. I was still in the private room up to 7:25 so my AirPods should have been at least in range right? Idk how Find My works exactly, but if that is the case then 100% my AirPods were not even there on the chair to grab when I left the shop. This means that it was either my artist or the other artist who took it. It should be mentioned that my artist was tattooing me while the other artist was somewhere behind me. I could definitely hear he was close, but I could not see him or the AirPods in my sight, as they were slightly behind me to the left and I was looking at the ceiling or eyes closed. If he used some slight of hand he definitely could of taken my AirPods while my artist was focused on tattooing me, and while I was looking in a completely different direction from him. Tbh I didn’t even see him whatsoever when he was near me at around 7:00pm but I definitely heard his voice a few feet away from me.
I’m basically 100% sure one of the employees is responsible based on the fact that I was the last client in the private room, and my artist claiming that he searched the room the first thing the next day and couldn’t find anything. I have proof in the form of messages from my artist. I also have photo proof that I was still in the private room significantly after 7:08 and that my AirPods were last “seen” at 7:08.
Maybe they fell out of your pocket on the way home. Maybe someone accidentally threw them in the trash. Maybe they are still in the shop under a table. Maybe you're lying and you still have them. Maybe they are somewhere else but stopped updating. Do you think the thief stole them and left them in the shop? If someone has taken them home, wouldn't your tracking info show that?
And no my tracking can’t show that. Only if it’s in a certain range of 800 ft which makes the fact that they were last seen at 7:08 even more suspicious as I was getting tattooed 15-20 minutes past that time. My artist can confirm this.
You know the crazy thing is I just checked the last location due to this comment. and it actually looks a good few hundred feet away from the tattoo parlor I was in. I will run an experiment with a friends AirPod pros, where I walk away from my phone and see what happens. If the parlor has cameras I think I 100% can prove who it is.
I legit have pants with zippers that I always zip because if I don’t the gap is huge. There is photo evidence proving that I wore these pants. While getting tattooed. And I guess technically it is hard to prove that I’m lying, but I guarantee that I’m not. And the find my evidence shows that it was literally last seen in the building of the tattoo parlor at a time when I was getting tattooed.
