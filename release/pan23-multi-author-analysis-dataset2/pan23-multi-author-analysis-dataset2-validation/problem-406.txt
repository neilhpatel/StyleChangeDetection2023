Yes. As long as you aren't a manager or in some very specific industries, you cannot be fired, reprimanded, or retaliated against for discussing wages in that context. You can file a complaint with the NLRB.
However it seems like the specific bit your boss may have been referring to would be spreading false information. That is of course not protected by the NLRB. Someone spreading false information about their or other people's wages could get themselves into trouble.
As others have already noted, discussing your wages is a protected activity under the NLRB, as long as such discussion doesn't interfere with your work.
I thought of that as well but the NLRB is pretty strict, and wherever this potentially incorrect information might have come from, it's likely that it would still be considered a protected, concerted activity to discuss it. Being wrong about someone's salary doesn't negate one's protection.
It's a safe assumption to make that HR is always the wife... Or husband... Or some other person who's interests are in protecting the other party you think is doing wrong.
HR is not there for you as the employee, HR is there to protect the employer. In a situation like this, "HR" might say that is illegal and correct the husband, or they might simply try to find another reason to fire you as the employee. It can be a very difficult process to claim that you or some other employee was fired for discussing wages, because they can legally fire you because they don't like your work ethic. They'd have to specifically tell you that they were firing you because of the discussions on paper or in front of a peer (for it to be a clear cut case). Otherwise, it could be quite difficult to prove.
