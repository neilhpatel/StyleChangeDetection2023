I did not send any written notices but I do have text messages showing I reported it, called, and their responses. I wonder if that would be sufficient.
You may be right. I’ll talk to the legal office tomorrow and see. I also really like my house and don’t want to be retaliated against when it’s time to resign the lease.
You could try talking to them first and ask if they would pay for you to go to a hotel since the law allows for that. Is your landlord a company or an individual?
It’s owned by an individual but I use a property manager. I mentioned a hotel and they asked me if I had renters insurance (which was a ridiculous question because they literally require me to have it.) They told me to ask them, I said that a hotel etc was not covered and they skipped over my statement.
Tell them you know the law: if it's not fixed in a timely manner they are required to do 1 of those 5 things and you choose which, not the landlord. You want them to realize that the cheapest way to remedy the situation is to pay someone to fix your AC.
They came out yesterday and “fixed it” but it broke in 2.5 hours again. They came out an hour and half ago so I’m hopeful. I don’t want to be vengeful and I’m not out for money but I feel the whole situation was ridiculous as they told me it wasn’t an emergency unless it 100° outside even though my house was 92° at the start.
