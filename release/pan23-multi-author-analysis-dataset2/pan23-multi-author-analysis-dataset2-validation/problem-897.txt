I'm honestly surprised, but I don't know much about French culture. I assumed they were more open about it. I've heard of German anecdotes where young relationships are helped or let evolve in a mature, healthy way. But that's also the closest geographical thing I have any reference to. Can you elaborate on the conservative stance in France?
Here in Brazil they've been free for a lot of time, probably a decade+. In some cities free condoms can be found even in metro/bus stations (but these are only a few). Good to see that other countries with robust healthcare systems are evolving to do what's necessary.
I think they should include them, but I guess it could be sending a wrong message that conservatives might have a problem with.
It’ll be interesting to see if stats for pregnancy, stds etc in people aged 14-17 stay the same while 18-25 decreases. They might start including younger people, too.
You know, clerk asks, "Are you 18 to 25"? Weedy, short kid with a squeaky voice goes, "Yep, definitely 18.".
If I was a pharmacist, I’d just give them the condoms. Seems like the most responsible and utilitarian thing to do.
