And the secret service is going to screen anyone online who meets with a former president or president elect before they meet. I really doubt that Trump wasn’t briefed on who he is meeting.
Ya know when folks tell you stuff that you didn't ask about? Not sus at all. Nothing to see here folks.
It's not even believing his word. Trump (or whoever the conservative media machine is playing defense for) just is innocent of whatever. That is presupposed out of the gate. All they need is an ex post facto justification that they can point to. It's not meant to actually convince or persuade; the line they go with is just to quiet that thought that their guy might have done something disagreeable. It's also why when an explanation is disproved you can just slot in a new one. The excuse just needs to exist, regardless of what it is or how true it is or even if it makes any sense.
A good lens to view conservative thought is that people are "good" or "bad" holistically. Good people who do ostensibly bad things must have a reason why it is not bad. Conversely, bad people who do anything ostensibly good or well reasoned must actually be doing something bad. God forbid the "bad" people are pointing out something "bad" a "good" person did, as that is just clear cut lies (as "bad" people are wont to do).
Pro tip: It’s fine to just say “seriously troubled man”. If you add “who happens to be black” as a caveat, it makes people think you are being racist.
