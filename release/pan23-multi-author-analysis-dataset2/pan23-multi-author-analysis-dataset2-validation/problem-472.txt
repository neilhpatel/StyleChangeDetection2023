Please redirect me if the question is better suited elsewhere. I ask on behalf of a 13 year old budding historian:
Is it possible to succeed as a historian with learning differences? High-functioning autism, ADHD, and dysgraphia (specific learning disability in written expression: moderate)?
I have autism and am applying to grad school, and I'm finding that it's the social aspect of academia that I'm struggling with - I need to have one of my profs help me every step of the way because there's so many things that are implied I keep on missing. When I was told to reach out to a potential advisor, I nearly had a panic attack from writing the two-sentence email, and the actual conversation was a minor fiasco because I was stuttering incoherently the entire time.
I must admit that writing is one of my strenhs because of the sheer amount of practice I've put in - I'm talking over a million words in less than two years. I can definitely say that you should encourage him to read more, because it gives you an intuitive understanding of what is good writing and what isn't. Plus, there's all sorts of speech-to-text tools he can use if needed, and they're bound to be much better than they are now by the time he's in university. Writing is definitely very important, but if the problem is the actual typing, there's workarounds for that.
This boy is bright and curious and can discuss complex events with a sophisticated understanding and vocabulary. He wants to be a historian and is trying to make academic choices with that goal in mind. But writing is a struggle. He has 504 accommodations for spelling and can use keyboards in place of handwriting, but it only goes so far.
He's still so young and there is time to strenhen these skills, yet learning specialists say that true learning disabilities never go away.
Have any of you, or your colleagues, found success in this field with similar obstacles? From the outside I assume that writing is so essential to history degrees and careers that it's hard for me to see how this will work out for him. But I want to be supportive.
So, for me, it has not been an easy road. I didn't have any support for my ADHD throughout middle school, high school, and undergraduate. I've always had an interest in history, and that interest usually led me to doing well in those courses. In undergrad I ended up minimizing the amount of non-humanities courses I took, within the confines of what was required for Gen-Eds which also helped.
But there were many days I struggled, where I'd wait until the last minute to write essays, in high school especially I'd miss home work assignments, and often I found myself not doing the most for my classes outside of the classroom (ie, didn't always do the reading!).
Academia is not kind to those with disabilities. There are many within it who are actively hostile to the disabled, and those who are unconsciously ableist. The environment makes it very difficult. It can be done, but there are uphill battles.
So on the graduate school side of things, if he ever decides to pursue that, is also finding a supportive advisor. Academia has, in many ways, a "Master and Apprentice" sort of system. And the right, supportive, advisor can and will make the different for a graduate student - I know it has in my case. I am insanely lucky to be where I am and in the position I am.
I didn't go straight into graduate school, I waited a couple of years before applying, and was accepted into my alma mater. This was part of the reason I decided to go get diagnosed with ADHD, I've known I likely had it for many years, but never had anything official - I needed support in the very different world of grad school and Academia. In some ways, it's like my undergraduate program except hyper-focused on my department and with less scaffolding - you have to really work to keep yourself on track. And with ADHD, it's not easy. I pull many long days where I'm in my office 8am-8pm. I'm working on a billion things at once. Everything feels like its held together with duct tape.
So it's challenging, to say the least. There is a lot of writing involved - and as I don't have issues with dysgraphia I can't really speak towards that. There is certainly a lot of reading and writing involved with a history degree of any kind, and most sort of history work either as an academic or in public facing history jobs.
What helped was that I was in a very close-knit, supportive academic environment - I was part of the state school but at a regional campus with classes that, even for gen-eds, capped at about 30 students at most. You got to know your professors decently.
I also ended up doing a very hands on "Study Abroad" program, although I put that in quotations as I stayed within the continental United States. It was an interdisciplinary program centered on Maritime Studies (my major, I had switched from anthropology to Maritime Studies at the end of my sophomore year). This program was a very good learning environment. Intense at times with the work we had to do, but because it was so driven by our own academic interests as students (for our classes we basically all had personal projects that made up the bulk of our grades) and got to do fun stuff like sail a tall ship, and visit different parts of the country really brought it together - plus all the classes tied into each other!
This was a really long winded way of saying: What will help him the most is a learning environment that supports him and his interests, as I was able to, and has solid support from disability services. That's going to be key.
But Academia also has major issues with the job market right now, and will continue to do so. There are not enough stable, long term jobs available while more and more people graduate with PhDs. It's bleak, and many don't ever end up in a tenure track job. So as he gets older, he may want to take that into consideration when thinking about long term goals.
But a major step is getting that help, different schools have disability services which range in their strenh and support. So even for undergraduate studies I would recommend doing research into that as a factor for which school he'd likely settle on for both undergad and graduate.
So I spend a lot of time doing local archival work, working hands on with the collections, and doing all sorts of other things that aren't necessarily writing heavy but still involve me doing history stuff and reaching a broader audience.
Now, I don't just do "academic" history though! I'm also an involved local historian and right now I don't make any money from it. What I do is on a volunteer basis, but some of the various things I do include: Public interpretation as a reenactor (hands on material culture); local history talks and hikes (I research and design these); design museum exhibiting (crafting a "story" to be told, choosing artifacts, writing up signage); oral history (interviewing people); archival work (preservation + cataloging); and public outreach (newspaper columns and such).
I only have a bachelor's degree, but my university offered many different resources for those with learning disabilities, especially those with high functioning autism and ADHD like myself. I can't speak for dysgraphia but I wouldn't be surprised if there were accommodations for it. I'm aware of some speech to text tools.
So that's a whole gamut of history related things of which there are places to do these as a job. The museum field is competitive, and the pay isn't always great, but it is a potential option he may want to explore as well because there's a lot within it where you're still doing history work.
Writing is indeed a big part of university classes, especially in graduate programs. But perhaps he would be able to make a presentation or speak for a similar lenh.
I wish I could tie this up with something more definitive, but there are a lot of "ifs". It's possible to do well within these environments with various neurodivergencies. Its not easy, Academia in many ways is hostile towards them, but these are the things that I've been doing.
