Your BF needs to ask for a public defender once he is arraigned in the new county. You need to stop asking the internet for help because I am afraid you are going to misunderstand something and give him bad advice you read. This is just not a problem you can solve for him. He needs a lawyer, end of story. He is facing very serious charges here.
He’s marked as released in the first county and has already called from the second county. I just don’t know where he is exactly in that county because he’s not in the system when I try searching for his name. When he called it showed the county as riverside but even after calling every place in riverside they don’t have anyone under his name.
If he was transferred to a different county it is no surprise that he would not remain in the first counties system. You are just going to have to wait for him to either call back or for the transferring counties offices to open to find out where he is now.
In 24 hours or so, you've made about five different posts with a question far outside the scope of free internet help. You need to stop now. We can't help you further about this.
