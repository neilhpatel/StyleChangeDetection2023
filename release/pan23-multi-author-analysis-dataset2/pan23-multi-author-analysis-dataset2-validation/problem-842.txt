No one can cash your check without your signature. And in the case of stimulus checks, they are not eligible for double endorsement. The person whose name is on the stimulus check has to deposit it.
So, you did not get a check. Your mother got a money due to you being one of her dependents. She decided to give that money to your grandmother, according to you, and grandma is holding it for your future. No one stole from you.

Print and fill out Form 3911 ("Taxpayer Statement Regarding Refund") and mail it to the same city and state where you would have sent a Form 1040. They will investigate and get a copy of the cancelled check to see what actually happened and you will be sent a refund check.
