Presumably the fact that there was a four year lease for below market rents would have come up in the divorce. Your mother would have been responsible for providing information on her assets including information like this which might impact the value of the assets.
Generally assets that are accumulated during a marriage are joint assets. Hiding assets is not a way to keep them, it's a way to get a much worse outcome in the divorce settlement.
I'm not sure whether a judge would uphold an unusually long lease like this in these circumstances even if everything was done in good faith.
We signed the lease when my other roommate moved out since we had to adjust the rent. About I year ago. Well before the divorce. Nothing was hidden. My dad is just super absent.
