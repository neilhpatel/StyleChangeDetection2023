There really isn't much to say here. William's eldest son was Robert Curthose, but William didn't think he made a particularly good ruler. Although Robert was recognised as a skilled military leader (which he proved during the First Crusade, after he had been denied the throne of England), his administrative skills were deemed weaker than those of his younger brother William Rufus. Robert was also just lazy. Rufus was always the conqueror's favoured son, and Robert was often bullied by his younger brothers. The choice was pretty obvious: William the Conqueror wanted his son William to succeed him.
So he just told people that this was going to happen. When William the Conqueror realised he was nearing the end of his life, he sent William around England with a letter proclaiming that he was the new king, and if anyone had a problem with that then they could take it up with the dying (but still alive an in charge) William the Conqueror. Robert was made Duke of Normandy as a consolation, but William would become William II. In 1087 when William the Conqueror died, Robert attempted to stage a rebellion in the following months but he failed to show up to his own coup. He tried to take the throne again in 1101 when William Rufus died, but his other brother Henry was way more popular and Rufus' designated successor. Robert lost out on inheriting the throne not once, but twice. Power ultimately rested among the lords of the kingdom, and they would choose the person they liked or feared the most. A bit of diplomacy and effort was all it took to get William Rufus on the throne instead of Robert. The same happened again when Rufus was succeeded by Henry.
So although it could cause instability, it was as easy as writing a letter to lords and bureaucrats saying "this guy is my heir". As long as those lords and bureaucrats supported the claim, either through fear or genuine respect, then it would be fine.
William Rufus decided to hit the rebels where it hurt, and caught the leader of the English barons at Pevensey Castle near the south coast. After a 6 week siege, the rebel leadership had been captured and Robert was still nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he did really did expect that the English barons would do all the work for him.
I always got the impression that the continent was more strict about things like this. Mostly because of child kings - to modern eyes, that makes it look like inheritance rules are overruling practical common sense.
We don't have much contemporary evidence. Most of what we know comes from later writers like Oderic Vitalis. We know that Robert cultivated support among English noblemen who thought it would be better if England and Normandy were ruled by the same person, and those noblemen rose up in rebellion in 1088 with the aim of overthrowing William Rufus and putting Robert Curthose on the throne. The rebels had, quite reasonably, expected that Robert would cross the channel to England and join them. The balance of power was about 50/50 in England, and Robert was expected to tip the balance in the rebels' favour should Rufus and his supporters put up a fight, which they did.
