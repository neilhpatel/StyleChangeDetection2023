If you think thats bad remember the Himalayas are one of earths fastest warming regions and 2 billion asians, especially china and india, depend on them...
I was sitting on a deck of the Kaslo Hotel in SE BC Canada a few years back lamenting that the view that I had been used to seeing for over half a century was now different as Commander Glacier was no longer in existence. The New Denver Glacier is still a thing but a mere shadow of its former self.
I don't think people commonly know this, but glaciers and icecaps play a role in cooling down the climate by reflecting sunlight out of the atmosphere. Climate change is accelerating due to carbon dioxide among other green house gasses being put into the atmosphere by us. But the problems that follow that like wildfires and melting glaciers accelerate it even more. Every glaciers death is faster warming climate. And polar caps? Its beginning to get warm enough for the snow to melt on top. That water is forming vast lakes on top further decreasing earths ability to cool down. People estimated it to take few hundred years for the caps to melt, but they didn't take the cap melting from all sides into the estimate. If greenland melts the sea level can rise 9 meters. If antarctica melts, it can rise 28 meters. Even 10 % of that is going to wipe out hundreds of millions of homes from the face of the earth.
Because they're about 12' thick and in permit only areas of the park. The whole area is a glacial valley.
