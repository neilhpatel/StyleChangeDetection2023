Please do not view Maryam Rajavi's tweet embedded in the article linked to here, as any form of endorsement or acknowledgement. Rajavi and the entire MEK organization are rejected by the freedom seeking Iranian community and regarded as a cult that has no place in Iran's bright and democratic future.
The courage of the Iranian people is as inspiring as the benighted intransigence of the government and the clerics is infuriating. Refusing even the most minor concession of dropping the enforcement of the hijab requirement. Doubling down on this failed policy by asking labor leaders to step up enforcement of the same, closing businesses for perceived violations, and inciting the crowd further with executions.
It all vindicates the conclusion reached by the protesters, that concessions are no longer enough. The regime in Tehran must fall, and fall hard.

But how does one thing lead to the other? How do marching and protesting force the government to change? Will Iran suddenly have free and fair elections? Will the rich, hard liners wake up to the cruelty of their system?
Freedom of speech and expression, right to peaceful protest, freedom of religion, right to a fair trial and justice, prohibition against torture. Instead the government is brutal to them and ignores the needs of people.
