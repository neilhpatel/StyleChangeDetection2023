People ask this periodically on here, and it's an odd question since the entire Stalinist period in the Soviet Union was characterized by a "terror" that was directed at multiple "rightist" groups within the country, including Mensheviks, Trotskyites, kulaks, engineers (!), and a multitude of other miscellaneous groups who were accused of waging "anti-Soviet" acts of sabotage against the nation. Unlike in the American Red Scare, these people didn't just lose their jobs and end up on black lists (which is awful and undemocratic, I agree), they often got sent to labor camps or even just summarily executed.
I think the disconnect is that people imagine that the "Soviet version of the Red Scare" would be Soviets imagining that US agents were undermining their society, or that cultural output was being subtly influenced by pro-democracy forces, but this totally misunderstands the asymmetry of the situation. The fears weren't about foreign agents infiltrating the Soviet Union — in a totalitarian nation with a hard border and massive bureaucracy (to say nothing of agents abroad) this just wasn't a problem. The few times the US tried to send in outsiders, the outsiders just got captured and shot, immediately.
Engineers in general were greeted with some suspicion during the Stalin years, but the main targeting of them was in the 1928 (the Shakhty trial, one of the important show trials). The basic accusation was that engineers saw themselves as a class separate from Soviet citizenry (i.e., they identified as "engineers" first, Soviets second) and that as such they subtly worked to undermine state engineering projects (which they were, of course, crucial for, and whose shortcomings had more to do with the ridiculous expectations of the Five Year Plans than anything like engineering sabotage). Engineers as a targeted class are interesting because the Soviets needed engineers as much as they distrusted them; they were extremely important in managing Gulag technical productions (canals, mining, etc.) and especially important during World War II, where special "engineer prisons" were created to harness their intellectual capabilities (the _sharashkas_) for the good of the state. In a _sharashka_ you were still a prisoner of the Gulag, but it was a much more comfortable imprisonment than, say, being sent to a Siberian mine.
In general one could say a lot about the tricky relationship between the Party and those with technical knowledge in Stalin's time. There was a deep-seated fear that highly-educated people were somehow undermining the state, and had loyalties that were "above" those of the state. Engineers were one facet of this; the attacks on biologists during the Lysenkoist period can be seen as another. The sciences that most succeeded under Stalin were the ones that made themselves absolutely essential to the success of the state (like the physicists), bowed to the state's demands entirely (e.g., allowed themselves to be put away into secret laboratories), and were willing to reinterpret themselves through state ideologies in ways that made their practicality paramount (like chemistry).
The fears of the USSR were of internal subversion, usually _not_ from people thought to advocate an overthrow of the Communist system — that was so obviously subversive that only someone with a death wish was going to do that during the Stalin period — but from the belief that alternative ideologies (many of them, like Trotskyism, were still Communist!) that deviated in core ways from accepted Stalinist dogma would undermine the Soviet "project.".
Can you tell me more about this? Did any of them successfully embed or infiltrate? Do we know much about the people captured, what their mission was, and how they were captured?
