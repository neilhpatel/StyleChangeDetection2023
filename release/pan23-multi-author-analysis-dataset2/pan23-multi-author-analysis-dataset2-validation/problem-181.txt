Heard David Urban a Trump mouthpiece a couple hours ago on CNN taking Biden to task because, according to him, all people in western Ohio want is to see the government show up in East Palestine 'to help them'. Nobody on the panel called him out at the obvious hyprocrisy of him saying that. Dollars to donuts say that he is well aware that Reagan once joked that the most terrifying words in the English language are, "I"m from the Government and I'm here to help." Hypocrisy runs in the Republicans blood.
Translation: If Democrats put anti-slavery on their platform (seemingly irrlevant in the US today right?) Republicans would be pro-slavery in due time.
Letâ€™s not forget that these women are paying thousands of dollars in bullshit birthing charges to provide that labor.
And some of that money makes it to GOP politician pockets in the form of kickbacks from the healthcare lobby in exchange for the GOP continuing to allow major healthcare corporations to skullfuck the American people with $12,000 childbirth bills, $500 charges for a $3 bottle of insulin, $60 charges for a 10 cent bandaid, etc.
