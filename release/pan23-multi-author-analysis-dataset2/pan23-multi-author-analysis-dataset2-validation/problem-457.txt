Basically the same sense and still very funny, but you can see considerable liberty was taken with the more common translation.
There actually is an ancient Greco-Roman joke book called the Philogelos ("Laugh Lover") and I would classify the jokes within as pretty similar to the sort found in modern joke books, and about as (un)funny. taken from a recent translation, this is a good example of one that is basically a Bob Hope joke:
As for humor in general, it kind of runs the gamut. Aristophanes is maybe the most popular ancient writer of comedy today because his works have a nice mix of social and political satire with a lot of poop and dick jokes, and the Greek New Comedy style which followed it has a sort of romcom/sitcom feel to it. I don't think there is any way to generalize it, although I think modern readers tend to find some of it pretty mean spirited.
Graffiti also deserves a mention, I am honestly not sure how reliable that list that goes around the internet is, but there are definitely plenty of well attested . Short scratchings on sling bullets is also a great source of some pretty pitch black humor, says "Catch!".
One of our fellow nationals, a not so bright one, and inexperienced in the matters of love, got married. One night in bed, his wife turned her back on him, who was stunned at the gesture. So stunned he was, that he asked his wife if she had two of those things, and having her said that she did, he answered: "Oh, oh, one is enough for me, the other is too much". Then, the woman, wittily, as her priest was also her lover, said: "we can give the other in alm to the Church, and to our priest, for he'll have great pleasure with it, and you shall not be offended, as one is enough for you". The man agreed, in order to take that weight off his shoulders, and to please the priest, who he liked. And so, having invited him to dinner and told him the case, the three went to bed, the husband on the front, and the priest on the rear so he enjoyed the gift. The priest, hungry for that desired prize, attacked first; seeing that the woman was making some noises, the husband feared the priest would get into his territory: "Oi, friend, stick to your side and leave mine alone". "God help me", said the priest, "I don't care much about yours as long as I can enjoy the Church's goods". With these words the idiot got calm, and invited the priest to freely enjoy his wife on the part she had given to the church".
From the late Middle Ages we have many examples of jokes thanks to Poggio Bracciolini, who compiled a book of them, known as Liber facetiarum, id est Book of funny stories. The jokes therein comprised are really good, although some were funnier in context. I'll translate for you my favourite one, to give you a taste of misser Bracciolini.
To add to these examples from antiquity, Diogenes Laertius gives two versions of the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus' death. One version says that Chrysippus was watching a donkey eat figs and said, "Now give the donkey a drink of pure wine to wash down the figs" and then promptly laughed so hard at his own joke that he died.
EDIT: I should probably clarify about the , all of them (as far as I know) are sourced from actual entries in the Corpus of Latin Inscriptions, however the translations provided can be pretty free. To take the best one from the list, CIL IV 3932:
