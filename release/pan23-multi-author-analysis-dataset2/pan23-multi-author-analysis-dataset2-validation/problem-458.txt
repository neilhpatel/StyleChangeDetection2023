Because they didn't take a report to get you your stuff back, they took a report to find and prosecute the person who broke into your house and took it.
Yeah, that was my first thought, but my buddy is adamant to not include the police from here on out (trust me, this was not the way I wanted all this to happen, as he took it upon himself to retrieve the items) I feel he put me in a tough position now as I don't know how to proceed with the police while keeping his involvement out of it.
They aren't required to stop investigating the crime you reported, and they may be frustrated that whatever investigation they've done so far has been wasted.
Police need to be informed so you dont have issues later if you are caught with said items. It could look like you are filing a false report to commit insurance fraud.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
