Make sure it was an actual security deposit and not some clever sounding word that made you think it's a deposit when it was actually a fee. As long as there is no damage done to the unit you would get that money back but I can tell you everyone will do some damage within their lease term, accidents happen. You should take a video walkthrough of the apartment on move-in and point out any and all existing damage so they can't blame past shit on you to take your deposit on move out but I mean if it came to like a dispute that would be done in civil court (which I highly recommend you do not do as a 1st time renter or ever really) but you would'nt have to worry about that until you move out.
The security deposit should only be used to pay for damage that was done while the tenant was living there, it's impossible for them to assume that you would be losing half your deposit, that would imply they think your going to do $1,000 in damages to the unit lol.
I didn’t do a video walk through but I have probably 50-75 pictures of things plus our damage report that was done on move in day, I plan on doing a video on move out just to cover my ass so they can’t come in and mess something up and blame me.
