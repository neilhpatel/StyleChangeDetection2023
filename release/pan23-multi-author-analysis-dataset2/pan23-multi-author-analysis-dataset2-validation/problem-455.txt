I’ve read what you said and will listen to what you said on stopping this “hobby”. This dude is in my neighborhood and his neighbors to each side have kids the same age as I pretended to be on our text thread and he interacts with them everyday. It’s honestly fucking creepy the way he looks at them my gf agrees. Is it really that bad that I want to tell them?
Please don't play Batman with stuff like this. Your chances of doing anything useful legally/prosecution-wise are basically Nil and chance of messing up investigations in progress is more than Nil.
Also, there's a nonzero chance that the bad guy will be able to track you down and this puts you in danger as well.
The answer that /u/SchalkeSpringer gave you is basically the only right one. You have no training in the law or in investigations, you have no idea how to properly pursue, document, or preserve electronic evidence in a case, and you're likely to either tip the bad guy off so he's able to more effectively hide later, or else actively interfere with an actual investigation being conducted by proper investigators.
