If your mom did not sign the title and a bill of sale for you or anyone else, she's really the only one with a claim to the car.
Has she been declared mentally incompetent from a legal standpoint such that someone has been granted power of attorney over her affairs? If so, they would be able to obtain a duplicate title and sign it over to you if they recognize the validity of your claim.
Possession could end up being a significant factor. If you're able to secure the car so it does not get towed or taken before the title situation is handled, do so.
If signed documents surface that transfer the car to your brother, and you suspect forgeries or that your mother was bamboozled into signing documents that she wasn't capable of understanding due to her condition (which may be elder abuse at worst, simply invalid at best), one of your options would be to involve the police.
Atm he is dealing with her insurance but last I spoke he told me he thought the insurance company would take it and he told me "he would sort things out for me" I just have a feeling he is going to try to screw me out of it. He already took my mother's lockbox which he wasn't supposed to take and claimed the money in it would be used to cover her "medical expenses".
Ah thank you so much, as far as I know no one person has power of attorney since my mother has so many kids. If my brother got power of attorney we feard he was going to make choices none of us agreed to.
You really should get an attorney experienced in this sort of thing ASAP. Deciding who gets power of attorney should be between the whole family, formalized, and include full accounting and accountability. It's even better if a 3rd-party trustee takes over so there's no conflict of interest.
Failing to protect your mom's interests could well result in your brother looting all her assets and leaving her with no finances to cover her long term care. I'm not saying that's what he's doing, but just your doubts about what's happening scream that you all need to do this correctly for the sake of not ripping your family apart with money drama.
