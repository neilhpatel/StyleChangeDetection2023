Edit: took a little closer look. It seems they really are the same thing just packaged differently. Another nothing article with a clickbait headline.
Presumably itâ€™s those cardboard pellet/shaving things. Might be around the right size, but not as dense.
Not many and of those pellet stoves are some of the least popular... But basically that's the reason to not get a pellet stove vs a wood stove.... Because the pellet stove needs a special feel in the wood stove can burn anything wood. That and a heat pump is cheap enough now you can't really save anything once you factor in all the work.
Idk, I have a friend with a pellet stove that can burn pellets or dried corn. It's pretty cool, dried corn is cheap as fuck in the states. And yes, I realize corn is not necessarily abundant around the world. But depending on your access to it. It's a great fuel source in a pellet stove capable of burning it.
Honestly if you need to heat your house witha homemade lamp like that then you should probably go to some type of shelter instead and also your pipes are going to freeze. You really need to have an emergency heater if you own like modern housing because if you let it get that cold and the pipes freeze it can be very expensive.
