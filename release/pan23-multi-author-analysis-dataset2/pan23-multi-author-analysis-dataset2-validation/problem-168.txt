I think the article nailed it, some chilling stats in there about how misogynist Republicans are, they stand for white male supremacy (and manage to still get support from women and minorities).
“What America's news media and mainstream political class need to understand and accept is that modern conservatism is a type of motivated social cognition where sexism, racism, misogyny, social dominance behavior, authoritarianism and other factors play a central role in political decision-making. To deny these facts is to willfully refuse to understand the true nature of America's democracy crisis.“.
We get it, Republicans are undemocratic. That’s not new. What’s new is, that they do it brazenly in the open and there are near to no repercussions for them. They still get elected, because their voters don’t care. They are corrupt because the justice system doesn’t care. They are openly mocking everything and everyone in real service to democracy and the American people, but even then Journalism doesn’t care (enough), especially those on the right wing side.
The only answer is for the Democrats to win “purple” states and then put the GOP on the defensive a bit in “New Dixie”.
Just looking at the first point, it’s pure partisan politics according to 2A scholars from major universities.
The biggest threat the Democrats can make right now is to get out of marginal political game with Republicans, and start winning more than 60 Senate seats by reviving the Blue Dog wing.
