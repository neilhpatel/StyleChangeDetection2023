yes, you can speak to multiple attorneys. but, they don't have to offer you a free consult either. and many divorce attorneys charge for initial consults, as some people try to meet with a bunch in order to prevent the opposing party from hiring that attorney (which i'm sure you aren't trying to do, right?).
Thank you for clarification. No, I would never try to prevent my partner from hiring any attorney. I simply want to compare fees and strategy. I have a child in the mix and want the best for them at the end of this process. There is a criminal case and CPS involvement, and I’m not sure how to navigate the process and how to do what’s best for my child and myself. I also don’t have much money, so comparing fees is important.
If comparing fees is important, when making the appointment ask what type of retainer they need. No sense in wasting yours or their time if you can't afford one you are talking to.
True, fair enough. Could the fees change based on the complexity of the case? I guess from what I understand I would pay a retainer to hire the attorney to represent me in court and handle the legal filings, but can they add fees for extra “work” for the complex nature of the case?
Yes, the more complex your case the more expensive. I don't know why you have work in quotation marks. You will be charged for all work -- research, motions, court hearings, phone calls, text messages, any time the lawyer spends on your case. You will most likely be billed in quarter hour increments, though it could be 1/10 hours increments. You will be billed against the retainer.
So, if you pay a $2500 retainer, that gets you 10 hours of work at @250/hr. Then you will pay more. The more complex the more work the more money. But, most divorces arent nearly as complex as people think. But the more either party wants to fight and not resolve the more it will cost both.
