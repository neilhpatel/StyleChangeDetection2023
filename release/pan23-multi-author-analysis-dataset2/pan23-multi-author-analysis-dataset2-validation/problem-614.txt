Arestovych said 2 or 3 months ago that very conservative numbers were 100 Russians lost there per day. It's a city previously with a population of 70,000 people so it's not small, that's very believable.
But in a few decades Mariupol will be the most futuristic city, just like how Rotterdam is very modern now.
Happy and proud I was able to donate for this (it's not only the Rotterdammers, but yes they are the main bulk), more happy and proud he was able to get such a massive amount of charity together <3 !
And thank you not only for the link, but also for what you're doing for Ukraine. I'm a Ukrainian myself (currently in Odesa), so seeing people all over the world helping us in their own ways, even though they don't have to, really bolsters my spirits <3.
As well as what everyone else said, it also causes issues of potentially numerous multi-km long wires strewn across battlefields that need to be cleaned up.
Expected was 4-5 salvos remaining last time at a rate of 90-100 missiles per salvo at the time. They'll probably have to stop before they use them all to have a "strategic" reserve. The size getting smaller might be indicative of them getting closer to that point.
They haven't been trying really. It's basically impossible to coordinate realistically. There's such a large disparity in speeds between the mopeds and the missiles that you need to know exactly where the air defense is to time it right, and if they knew that they'd be trying to hit the air defense.
