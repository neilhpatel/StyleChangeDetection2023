IANAL but I can speak from personal experience as my father was in a similar situation. You will want to seek out the help of a disability lawyer, the process is long and painful and you need all of the advice and help jumping through hoops you can get.
I'm an Illinois resident if that helps. My mom also mentioned a lawyer but we have no idea where to start with the process.
Thank you for the input. I'm very new this, and like most you never imagine yourself or a family member getting to this point in their life.
It is important to get a lawyer from the start, as that will lower the chances you will be rejected and have to appeal. They will help you fill out all the forms and track down all the records SSA will want from you..
I will stress that even if you do absolutely everything right, you will likely need to appeal. If you are approved outright, you still get back pay for a few months and their fees are taken from that.
If a lawyer takes your case and at the end of it you don't end up getting disability ... you don't have to pay. They only take cases they're 99% sure they'll win.
You can absolutely apply on your father's behalf. The forms have boxes to indicate as much, and you have to provide your information/signature and such.
A light Google search has shown several options in your state (search "disability lawyer Illinois" ), check out the different firms and maybe read some reviews. A disability lawyer will tell you whether or not your dad has a case. Find one that offers a free consultation (most do), and work from there.
Thank you so much for this thoughtful response. I would not have known most of this if it wasn't for you.
This may be a strange question but is it okay for me to reach out to the lawyer without my dad present?
I'm usually the one who handles communication for my father since there is a slight language barrier and even more so now that he's suffering the after effects of the stroke.
I think they'll need to talk to him, or at least he will need to be present with you while you make calls. Depending on the state, the firm may have someone on staff that will be able to communicate with your father in his native language.
I'm in Michigan and the largest disability firm here has folks that speak Spanish, Arabic, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, and more!
It is not a very intuitive process, and it's not very friendly either. The Disability system in this country seems to be intentionally designed to keep people from getting it. I wish you luck and I'm glad I could offer some help!
