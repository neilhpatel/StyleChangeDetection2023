They are right that the beneficiary is the the person entitled to that money. It's not "your own money", it legally belongs to whoever that beneficiary is. If you are not that person, it is not yours, and there is nothing you can do about it.
In any case, it's not up to you, either as your mother's child or as the representative of her estate, where that money goes. It is not, in fact, your money.
Sounds to me like they've confiscated the money for themselves and don't want you to have it. You'll have to get a lawyer involved but what if the account only contains a couple thousand? You'd spend more on the attorney to get them to cough up the money than the account might be holding. At that point I suspect (I am not a lawyer) you'd have to go after them for the legal expenses. So many ways this could go. I wouldn't want to be in this position. If she was an alcoholic what are the chances she saved up a great deal of money?
The bank should be contacting the named beneficiary to disburse the funds. If they aren't able to locate the beneficiary, those funds will go to the state's unclaimed funds office, where the beneficiary can claim them; after a decade or two, they'll be rolled into the state's general revenues and become unclaimable.
