"The revised map uses the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea's definition of what counts as an island. The Convention outlines that an island is ‘a naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide’. This means that the previously dismissed large sandbanks are also considered to be islands now. Whether you’ll actually be able to visit the recently discovered islands remains to be seen.".
Revised definition of what counts as an island. The “new” islands are basically all large sandbanks that are almost completely submerged at high tide. So now they’re technically being considered islands but functionally it doesn’t seem like almost any of them can be used for anything. Maybe if they modify some of the larger ones by adding sand to expand the mass, but even that is just a temporary measure that would need to be shored up on a regular basis as the tides wash sand away, like the artificial islands they’ve made in the UAE.
Yeah my first thought was how many are just small patches of land in the sea that are about the size of Sunday comic strip islands that castaway finds themselves on.
These are nit actual islands as you may imagine them, but mostly just places where there are a few rocks or the water is very shallow.
