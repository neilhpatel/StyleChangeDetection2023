You don't need one. In the bid it just asks who would perform the duties etc what experience you have. They could say they spoken with my employee and she would transfer if bid was awarded.
(She liked the job, developed the program etc.) I'm just arguing ethically that the admin brokering my employee prior to a bid would give them leverage and be unethical. It's also unheard of. In no circumstance would that be considered ethical. I'm just wondering if there is any legal standing.
Well, the loaded rate of the employee might change. Paying the same base salary, your company and your competitor would have different loading: overhead, fringe, and G&A percentages. And of course whatever fee goes on top of those might be different as well.
Which is all beside the point for this specific contract giving it to another vendor just to hire the same employee eliminates 90% of the reason to even award it to someone else. Because technically the only thing changing is who you get the invoice from.
I’m surprised to learn that in this government’s contracting practice, a competitor can propose a key employee by just mentioning a name, without showing a resume or a contingent offer letter.
Before bids were submitted, Agency A was awarded the contract. You were informed that you were no longer being considered because of ethics violations on your company's part.
Agency A, who now have some money and job openings to throw around, poached a few of your employees.
If you disqualified yourself with ethics violations, I don't think you'd really have any standing to complain about your competitor getting the contract. If you had your employees sign a non-compete, you may be able to call them on it.
Obviously they were awarded the contract. My assumption is they even used her in the bid as an experienced employee.
My employee reported it to me and said it felt dirty and she couldn't believe the contract administrator facilitated this behind our back. Secondly if they were going to hire my employee for that position in that region it negates any reason to award the contract to another vendor because my employee is solely responsible for the entire thing. The simple fact the admin would introduce our employee to the competitor prior to bidding pretty much proves there was no intention of keeping the contract with us.
