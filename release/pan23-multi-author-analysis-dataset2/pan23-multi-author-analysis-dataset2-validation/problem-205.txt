They should not have been so confident. In 2000, Alabama held a vote to decide if interracial marriage should be legal, and it passed by a margin of 60/40. People took this as a strong repudiation of racism, but is it really? 40% of Alabama voters literally thought interracial marriage should be outlawed as recently as the year 2000. That is an amazingly high number, and speaks to the ongoing strenh of outright racism as a political force in America.
Of course interracial marriages should be protected the same as any other marriage. Looks like we won't get to see Thomas rule on the validity of his own marriage.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
