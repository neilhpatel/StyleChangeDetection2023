This is an interesting question and has a long history of debate in not only academic circles but also politics. Kate Frieson in an article for Pacific Affairs in the Autumn issue of 1988 said that “The Democratic Kampuchean Regime (1975-1979) has been labelled Marxist-Leninist, Maoist, peasant-populist, national chauvinist and even fascist by various observers of Cambodia.”.
The range here, I think in the ‘early days’ particularly, was sometimes due to different political leanings of the person who was answering the question. Was Democratic Kampuchea representative of the purest communist revolution the world had ever seen? A racist abomination that was the farthest thing from Marxism? A totalitarian state comparable to Stalin’s USSR?
However, I think (in many circles at least) since the end of the Cold War there has been an effort to provide a more nuanced answer, less tinged with biases left or right and I would contend that the Khmer Rouge revolution can, to a large extent, be considered “communist”.
Now, this relies on some caveats and positioning, and no doubt this answer will still attract responses of that aforementioned political divide, so I present this as my own opinion based on the evidence I see fit and historians which I think make the most sense on the topic. I should also add that I believe it is important to take into account the words of the Khmer Rouge themselves as who else would be better positioned to tell you what they were trying to accomplish. I'm also copying and pasting a little from previous answers I have made so I hope this flows...
Here is Khieu Samphan (a senior member of the CPK) explaining the disconnect between ‘orthodox Marxism’ and their movement:
Firstly, I think it is worth saying that the Khmer Rouge revolution was in many ways unique, while also being reminiscent of other periods of turmoil, violence and revolution throughout history. In the same way that it can largely be considered a communist revolution, it can also be thought of as a unique take on that ideological framework. I guess the answer that you or someone else might have can differ depending on how close to an orthodox Marxist revolution something needs to be in order to be considered a communist one. Do the Russian and Chinese revolutions count? Do the ‘gospels’ of Lenin, Stalin or Mao figure into what you still consider to be ‘communist thinking’? If so, then the Khmer Rouge represent another communist revolution which incorporated elements from these previous examples, as well as the French Revolution, into their actions.
Remembering the ideological ‘fermentation’ of the CPK, Pol Pot said that “We applied ourselves to define a direction and then to put it into practise without knowing whether it was right or wrong. There was no model, no blueprint, but rather a mixture of influences, a little of this, a little of that …”.
“Marxism-Leninism,” Sar said later, “resides within the movements forged by the people, and the people’s movement in each country puts together its own Marxism-Leninism’. The inference was that there was no need for Party members to study the Marxist classics and therefore no need to translate them into Khmer. Sar acknowledged that foreign experience could provide useful lessons. But the goal was an authentically Khmer doctrine, rooted in Cambodian identity. (Philip Short, Pol Pot).
“It is true that the Cambodian communist party was based on the poor peasantry rather than the working class . . . But you cannot use that as an argument for saying it was not a Marxist party, or that there was no economic basis for a communist party in Cambodia. In fact, we applied the criterion of ‘material conditions’ quite correctly, because the poor peasants were the most impoverished, the most oppressed class in Cambodian society, and it was this class that was the foundation of the Cambodian Party.”.
These examples from the mouth of the leader of the movement point to the pastiche of influences which, as well as the different cultural influences and context of Cambodia in the 20th century, culminated in a “communist” view of the world, but a “Cambodian” one. Was it an ‘orthodox’ Marxist revolution? No.
“It was about political issues. First it was to smash the enemy spies and it was the class struggle in the liberated zone . . . and the class line, the proletariat class line was introduced, that’s why Khmer killed Khmer blindly, because of that principle” (Alex Hinton, Man or Monster).
But Pol Pot et al hoped that “that Democratic Kampuchea would thereby by forged into an agriculturally self-sufficient and industrialised country that would surpass all other countries in the rapid achievement of communist prosperity and strenh and thus become totally independent from all foreign countries, whether capitalist or ‘socialist’, and impervious to any military threats they might pose to state territory.” (Steve Heder, Racism, Marxism, Labelling and Genocide in Ben Kiernan’s Pol Pot Regime).
If one considers Maoism to be a form of communism, then the huge influence that the Chinese leader had on the Khmer Rouge makes it hard to argue they were anything but communist. “There was much in the Khmer Rouge ideology and practise that was clearly Maoist. The borrowings were first linguistic. Slogans like ‘the super great leap forward’, ‘the wind from the East always vanquishes the wind from the West’, ‘everyone has to rely solely on his own strenh’, ‘if you have a revolutionary consciousness, you can do anything’, and ‘revolution is not a banquet’ were light touch plagiarism of Mao’s words. Then came the Khmer Rouge’s applications: the imposition of slave labour, the ambition to ‘turn the Khmers into rice-producing machines who consume no fuel and not too much rice’, and the abolition of all currency and salary distinctions (an idea that Mao toyed with in the last two years of his life). The evacuation of the cities was an extreme version of the Cultural Revolution-era rustification. The creation of mess halls and the abolition of family dining replicated the collectivisation of the Great Leap Forward. (Julia Lovell, Maoism A Global History).
It is also interesting to note the perhaps contradictory role of Theravada Buddhism in the communist ideology of the KR. The term they used for ‘political consciousness’ is sâtiarâmma, a compound of arâmma, which ‘has the specific Buddhist connotation of “perception” or “object of mind” that is generated when something attracts the senses’, and sâti which translates to ‘mindfulness’; the method which a person uses to understand and control arâmma. Thus, owing to shared origins, the CPK’s creation of political consciousness/sâtiarâmma is inherently linked with the Buddhist concept of mindfulness. The Khmer Rouge’s use of the term as ‘political consciousness’ or ‘revolutionary consciousness’ implies the need to mindfully assess and carry out the CPK ‘line’ which refers to the ideology of the party. This mirrors the Buddhist use of mindfulness which is based on the understanding of the Buddha’s teachings (dhamma), however the spiritual components are replaced with Marxist-Leninism.
As I mentioned, there was a clearer divide in the past between those that considered the regime to be communist and those that sought to deny their socialist credentials (for a number of reasons). For instance, a thought provoking and well-argued book by Michael Vickery Cambodia 1975-1982, challenged many notions that had become entrenched in the history and perception of the period. He called this the ‘standard total view’, and made numerous points to counter these assumptions. Many have been discredited in the years that followed, particularly his claim that the Muslim Cham minority had not been the target of any particular genocidal intent by the regime, or his claim that the total death toll was much lower than the often given 1.7-2 million.
But his claims of the revolution not being ‘Marxist’ are hard to argue with, as he says “Cambodia was even further from the ideal situation for a transition to socialism than Russia, Eastern Europe, or China. There was very little industry or the natural resources to develop it, and the country was just about as complete a peasant society as could be found . . . On the other hand, however, all revolutionary changes which have resulted in regimes termed "Socialist" or "Communist" either by themselves or by their enemies have occurred in societies which were not in the stage of advanced capitalism and show features, particularly in the political instance, which would have shocked the founders of scientific socialism.” (Michael Vickery, Cambodia 1975-1982).
“The US imperialist retreat in panic from Kampuchea was filmed and shown to the whole world.... Never before had there been such an event in the annals of the world's revolutionary wars. In one word, the great victory won by our people and revolutionary army under the leadership of the Communist Party of Kampuchea has become a precious model for the world's people, the world's revolutionary movement and the international communist movement.”.
I would also similarly contend that ‘to a large extent’, many of the terrible excesses of the regime were due to this communist influence. For instance, take what Kang Gek Iev (Duch – pronounced Doik) the former commandant of S-21, said was at the heart of the answer to why ‘Cambodians had killed fellow Cambodians’.
But for me, this is akin to telling a Christian or Islamic fundamentalist that they are not Christian, or Islamic, because of what you deem to be the ‘true’ Christianity or Islam. If they believe in their hearts of hearts that what they are doing serves that aim, then who is to say that you are correct?
Hey, sorry for digging up a slightly old thread, but I've been looking into the Khmer Rouge recently and had a few questions about what is written here.
