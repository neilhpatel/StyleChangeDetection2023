The judge won't force them to settle for less. If you owe $X, they prove you owe $X and the judge agrees then they are entitled to $X. You ability to pay has nothing to do with what you owe.
They do settle when they decide it isn't worth the effort. Your chance to settle was likely months ago before they filed the lawsuit and you were being contacted by their debt collectors. There is no reason to settle now if they have the required proof to win the lawsuit. At this point it would just be leaving money on the table.
Assuming you're positive you'll lose in court, your best bet is to try to set up a payment plan before the court date.
They've spent the money on filing with the court already. They can either accept less money from you AND lose that money, or they can show up in court and get a judgement for the whole amount, sometimes plus their court costs.
I've been sued by a creditor before. I filed a hand written response that said, I don't owe you anything, prove otherwise. 3 weeks later they had filed to dismiss. They usually count on you not responding and them winning a default judgment.
