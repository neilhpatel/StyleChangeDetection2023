Georgia. Sadly, I’ve never hired anyone to do anything for me so I didn’t know to ask if they were bonded and insured. I knew they were licensed, had two locations in state, and had been in business for 22 years.
That is one of the problems with proceeding with a project like this without any plans. One persons "extension" is another persons "I don't want a flat roof screened in porch".
I think you are going to need someone to help you navigate this situation. I suggest that you find a local Architect that does residential projects. A good resource is the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects. They can refer someone locally that can help you.
You can also contact the state contractors licensing board for assistance. I'm not sure how helpful they will be since they don't have any information geared towards homeowners on their website.
You can contact the county planning & building divisions to ask what if any permit submittals are required for the work you want to do. If you are in a very rural area there may not be any requirements but it sounds like you are in a more developed area.
