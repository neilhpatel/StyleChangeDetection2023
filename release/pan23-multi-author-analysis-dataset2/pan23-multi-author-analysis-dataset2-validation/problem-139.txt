That has more to do with the mechanics of combat than anything. Most casualties in pre-gunpowder warfare take place not during the fighting, but during the pursuit after one side breaks and routs. I've got some links on this matter, let me know if you want them.
Yes. That's because a captured noble is worth more alive than dead. Have you encountered the phrase 'a king's ransom'? These following posts expand on ransom:
As always, more input is welcome from anyone with the capability, so if you'd like to type up about ransoms in Medieval European warfare, please don't let this post stop you!
I'd like to hear about this, how people weren't injured/killed in battle. I figure what we see on screen is wildly incorrect? How could people not be injured in battle, or at least not injured to later die, during a time when any kind of injury could kill you from infection?
It's not that people don't die or be injured, it's just that the proportion of such is rather different from what we commonly see on screen. It is legitimately dangerous to be in combat, and there is a greater proportion of that danger if you're in the very front rank - it's just not nearly to the extent that you might see in a film or portrayed in Total War.
While on the one hand, this is also a legitimate worry, the Medievals also have a set of effective solutions. (Of course, how quite accessible some of these are to the common soldier is a different question.) I commend to your attention of my Middle Ages Are Best Ages compilation, which links to multiple excerpts from a 9th Century medical textbook, as well as Henry V's surgery for a case of arrow-to-face.
