It's a travesty we never got a full lenh "Angels with dirty faces" movie while the guy was still alive. The rise of the internet really propelled a lot of side projects to promote movies and stuff that just weren't possible back when Home Alone came out.
There are probably better tacticians at Moscow's local internet cafes than the men Putin assign's to head these military groups. I didn't think these "generals" know how to use the equipment they have, and worse, these guys have no idea the capability of western firepower. Heck, the entire war machine we have given to Ukraine was specifically designed to fight Russia and China specifically.
Without Western assistance and unexpected Ukrainian guts, Russia would have bulldozed through Ukraine like they did in Georgia, Chechnya, etc.
The world military industrial complex has something to sink its fangs into yet again, it would not sit back from this opportunity to make some real money, as well as get to see how NATO technology fares against Warsaw Pact technology. Who knew Russia was a paper tiger.
On russian telegram i noticed a post trying to downplay the amount killed and i saw an interesting disclaimer added there.
shits fucked up if you cant even report on losses without going to prison, no wonder the official numbers are 5k something.
