NAL but I would be concerned that she might avoid potty training the kid to continue doing this. Idk if this is something that could be brought up in court, but that was my immediate concern.
Edit: if the child was pictured or even mentioned in any of the ads or correspondence, that might fall under endangerment or worse.
Is she selling the child's dirty diapers? The legal standard for any judgment or order in a custody case is that it must be in the best interest of the child. I imagine your lawyer can think of a few ways that selling the child's diapers is not in its best interest.
Reselling used (cleaned) cloth diapers is pretty common in the green eco-friendly communities. Used and unclean diapers of any type may fall under biohazard or obscenity laws.
Even if not illegal, the situation might go towards a judgement of character, household situation, or other things that family court judges have leeway to decide.
If business was conducted by USPS mail, there may be a federal law or regulation violated if not properly labeled.
