It was normal in the 19th century for men to be older than the women that they married, but it was still the case that women tended not to marry until they were into their 20s; it was only in the mid-20th century that it became the case that the average woman could expect to marry before her 20th birthday. Men would generally be older on the expectation that they were meant to be providers and heads of household for their spouses and so, accordingly, would need time to establish themselves financially or at least in the security of stable work before they were in a position to take a bride. For the vast majority of people marriage was something that came in their 20s when they had already attained the legal age of adulthood and not before, although some of the age gaps that were socially acceptable might arouse concern in us today - there's an average age gap of around 4 or 5 years between men and women, but 7 or 8 would not have been too odd.
However, there were a significant minority of American men who married women who were below the age of majority - and this was not necessarily the taboo practice we now rightly recognise it to be. The concept of "child marriage" doesn't seem to appear anywhere in American public discourse until the mid to late 1800s - there was no cultural understanding that it represented a distinct phenomenon different to regular marriage. In the 19th century age was something of a ephemeral thing. Many ordinary people may not have known their exact age; whilst people understood there was such a thing as 'childhood' and that children were more vulnerable than adults physically and emotionally, they also understood childhood and adolescence beyond the earliest years of life to be a state of mind or state of being more than a stage of life, and different individuals could mature into adulthood at different times. Additionally, marriage in the 1800s was understood to be an unequal institution in which there was supposed to be a power imbalance heavily skewed in favour of the male partner; the idea of the female partner being younger and more impressionable was not the inherent negative we recognise it to be in our modern gender equal societies today, and a young woman's freedom to choose a marriage partner was largely dependent on the extent to which her parents and any prospective partner cared about her feelings in the matter. Many women had little to no choice, or only a very limited choice, in who they were married to. In the gender unequal world of the 19th century some parents saw arranging marriages for daughters at a young age as a means to 'set them up' for the best possible life in terms of security and stability. Marriage itself was thought to have a morally sanctifying and uplifting impact on the people marrying each other also, which served to alleviate anxieties about one partner being young - the spiritually transformative impact of marriage would strenhen the virtue of the man and 'mature' the woman.
In Joseph Smith Jr's case the objections to the philosophy of marriage that he developed later in his preaching rarely focused on the age of the women involved but rather that there were women involved, plural. For one, polygamy was only ever practised in secret during Joseph's life-time and although rumours of it did escape Illinois and made it as far afield as European newspapers, the exact details of who was involved were not known and the vast majority of rank-and-file Latter Day Saints were able to comfortably reject the idea (the public announcement of polygamy as doctrine under Brigham Young seems to have played a major role in almost destroying the Latter Day Saint movement outside of the United States by disillusioning members; the number of British followers collapses in the 1850s). It was the fact that Joseph and his close associates were marrying multiple women, not that some of them were of quite a young age, that was deeply scandalising to both civil society and internal dissenters within the Mormon church. The way in which Joseph was most remarkable for his time in terms of the age of his partners was the fact he married a number of women older than him, including his first and 'primary' wife, Emma, who was about a year older at the time of their wedding.
Extreme age gaps were rarer but likewise not unheard of - in the 1760s, the 73 year old Governor of Virginia had married a 15 year old girl. Although he was ridiculed by his critics for doing so the criticism was not that the girl he married was too young but rather that the Governor was too old and behaving inappropriately. This was still generally speaking the attitude of the average American in the 1830s: whilst there was discomfort with marriages in which a teenage girl was wed to a significantly older man, the discomfort lay more in what that said about the man's character rather than in his sexual desires or the worry about how young she was. It was unusual, sometimes uncomfortable or frowned upon, but it was not seen as being fundamentally immoral or evident of deviant sexuality. Hangovers of this persist in our popular culture and laws today - in many parts of the United States it remains possible that teenage girls can marry older boys or men with parental consent, and this continues to happen to this day. Likewise in many places the age of sexual consent is set at an age lower than the age of majority for other activities and at a level most of us would be uncomfortable with if a 40 year old were partnered with someone at the age of consent. Consider the UK for example, where a 16 year old can sleep with a 50 year old Member of Parliament legally, but not vote for that MP in a general election for another two years. Moral and cultural attitudes to both the nature of childhood and sexuality have changed radically from the early 1800s.
The law in these cases could be ambiguous but generally speaking, set a low age of consent. A major test case in the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1854 (Parton vs Hervey) ruled that the marriage of a 13 year old girl and a 19 year old man was valid despite the objection of the 13 year old's mother that she did not consent to the ceremony, arguing that legal tradition treated girls as being able to consent to marriage from the age of 12 onwards and boys from the age of 14 onwards. The state court did affirm that it was only legal to marry people without parental consent if they had attained the age of majority but did not invalidate the actual marriage. Tellingly, the concern of the parents in Parton vs Hervey was not that the girl was too young for her own good to be married but that by leaving the parental home early her family were deprived of the benefit to having her work in the household several years earlier than they expected; their concern was economic and social, not moral or sexual. The courts in contrast usually upheld child marriages in these cases for moral reasons - fearful that if they were dissolved, there would be a sudden influx in a number of young women forced to become single mothers, or that it would set a precedent for encouraging men to find ways to escape their marital obligations. For some girls marriage at an early age could also represent an age of agency and resistance to parental control by choosing to elope or secretly marry a partner old enough to provide in them but closer to their age or character compared to someone their parents might intend to pressure them into marrying, or to escape from abusive family. It was only really from the late 1800s onwards, and especially the early 20th century, that marrying a minor began to become something sharply taboo in American culture on the grounds that grown men should not be having sex with teenage girls.
Perhaps the most telling evidence of contemporary attitudes comes from the Reorganised Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or the RLDS Church, which was organised by Joseph Smith III, Joseph Jr and Emma's son. Joseph III and Emma both staunchly denied that the founding Prophet of Latter Day Saintism has ever practised polygamy and insisted it was an innovation of Brigham Young that distorted Joseph Jr's teachings (RLDS historians now overwhelmingly agree Joseph Jr did practice polygamy). The early RLDS Church made rejecting what they perceived as the sexual deviancy and immorality of Brigham Young's theology a core part of how they distinguished themselves from the LDS Church in Utah, along with innovations like the idea of Eternal Progression and the Godhead (the RLDS Church retained a pre-Nauvoo, Trinitarian theology). Despite the fact Brigham Young and others also married teenage girls many years younger than them, this point of critique is absent from Address to the Saints in Utah and California, an 1864 missionary text by the RLDS Church aimed at proving polygamy is morally wrong and that Young cannot be Joseph Jr's successor; Joseph III did not add it in when he revised the text in 1869, and it is absent from other criticisms of plural marriage by Saints who did not follow Brigham Young to Utah.

I'm trying to validate some of your claims here. Can you cite the Colonial governor of Virginia you're referencing as having married a 15 year old in the 1760s?
