The build up of the Franco-Prussian War was about Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern being offered the Spanish Throne. Leo wasn't crazy about it but was willing.
But it's noted that King Wilhelm of Prussia (head of the House Hohenzollern) was against Leo from taking the Spanish throne and pressured Leo to decline it.
Leo's younger brother had already become the Domintor of Romania and would become the full King of Romania in the 1880's.
Was Wilhelm against putting too many Hohenzollerns on thrones and putting a target on Prussia's back? Or was it just avoiding problems with the French?
These two things seem contradictory. Bathing in water 'fouls' it, but boiling someone alive is fine?? Hoping to get some clarification on how that was rationalized.
Simple googling so far had been a bit disappointing, since historical battles involving nations like Egypt don't seem to give military sizes per side. In other cases, a nation like Assyria is well known to have an army of over 100,000 during the Neo-Assyrian Empire, but that is comparatively late (the Iron Age), so I highly doubt Bronze Age Assyria had anything quite that big. Of course, amateur that I am don't have the breadth of knowledge or resources that I would assume you guys have.
I fully recognize that getting detailed information from more than 3,000 years ago can be virtually impossible. That's why I'm trying to phrase this question as broadly as possible. Surely with the information we have from Bronze age civilizations as a whole, in the Ancient Near East, over the course of 2,000 years that the Bronze age existed, we should have enough to come up with some rough answer.
I'm asking if we have some estimate for the size of the military used by the following nations at any point during the Bronze age (3100 - 1200 BC):
There was a construction project around the early 1900s in one of the major cities, (Chicago, Philadelphia, St Louis?). I believe it was to build a new city hall. Basically the construction was so poor and they cut so many corners, that the columns mean to support some of the structure began to fail. It was at that point that the people learned the columns were hollow.

Hi, I started reading a Genghis Khan biography by Leo de Hertog. The book explains that the Mongols had terrible hygiene because their beliefs prevented them from 'fouling water', which included using it to wash themselves or their clothes.
A bit later in the book it mentions that Temujin (Genghis Khan) captures 70 of his rival Jamukha's soldiers and boils them alive. (or Jamukha boiled 70 of Temujin's soldiers, I don't think it is 100% known).
I suppose if I want an answer to my question I would need to understand a lot more about this animism the Mongols believed in, if more is even known.
I figured it would be a decent place to start for someone that basically knows nothing about that part of the world at that time.
