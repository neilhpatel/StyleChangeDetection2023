I sent half of it by transferring it through our banks, and 1k from the stimulus check we gave it to his hand by hand so we aren’t tempted to spend it and the father put it in a safe. I know his father hasn’t done anything suspicious but I have a feeling both lied about the amount that was saved. With me putting in about 2.2k he said we saved around 3k and he works a job with many hours, so I’m guessing about 4K was put away and I was lied to but I’m not 100% sure, only that today after a month of our breakup, I decided to go through my history in my bank, and saw all the payments I gave to my ex and then finally spotted the payments that was put into savings.
We would transfer the money out into cash and give it to his dad to put into savings, since we had a tendency of spending on things we don’t need. His dad is a witness to my ex giving me 700 when I was being kicked out.
My friend is also messaging me that my ex was flashing the money. Before I left he said he spent all of it, but apparently he was flashing with the money after I left.
How did you find out through your bank? Did this account only have your name or were both yours and his name on it?
If you spent money on him as gifts for just for him since he was your boyfriend at the time you have no claim to that money. Unless you both agreed to pay/be paid back or that it was a loan but from what you wrote that doesn't seem to be the case. Your SOL on that money.
Yeah the spending of money I will never gain back, it’s just a realization of how stupid I am. But I went through my account on my bank account, and I was scrolling through my history. I received a message from suspicious activity that I got solved this morning that isn’t related to this situation with my ex, and decided to scroll through my history since I got bored.
Some of the money I did transfer to his account so he can take it out to give to his dad, since I was working a lot and didn’t have time to deposit it. I do know 1k I took out at the bank and gave it to his dad.
So wait, was he an owner or an authorized signer on the account? Because if he was then he legal can empty out the account if he wanted to. Now if the account ONLY has your name one it and he transfered money out of it using your account and routing number that could be considered fraud/theft. But if he is legally on the account there isn't much you can do.
