Note, of course, weight is required for this to work; there were certainly weights at this time, with a general error (just based on tests of archaeological finds) of about 10%.
About 350 years after Nanni's legendary complaint on receiving poor copper from Ea-Nasir, another, perhaps more historically important complaint was sent from King Burraburiash of Babylon, 19th to the Kassite throne, to Akhenaten, Pharaoh of Egypt.
In the case of poor King Burraburiash, only a quarter of the original gold survived the process. In modern terms: the original was 6 karat gold, which isn't even legally considered "gold" in most countries.
What's helpful for us is that it records _why_ it was known to be poor quality. It underwent an ancient process called "fire assaying": for gold, lead is added, and the.
silver and gold; a further process convers the silver to silver chloride so the gold can be recovered.
So, one way to tell the original purity of a substance is to separate out any alloys and compare the weight of what's left with what it started as. This can be done with copper as well as gold (although our records are on gold). Fire assay is still a modern practice (although generally with samples, not taking an entire chunk of a substance).
The exact version of the process involves using a smooth black stone called a "touchstone" to create a streak and look at the colors. These colors are compared again streaks of known purity. This can be much more accurate than it sounds: Theophrastus in his On Stones (probably late 4th century BC) claimed 1-to-144 part accuracy. Pliny in the 1st century CE wrote that touchstones could be accurate for detecting silver or copper "to a difference of a scruple" (probably about 2%). (Note that the general idea is to _not_ want copper infused in one's gold or silver merchandise, but the same process can be used to find copper purity.).
This couldn't have been the test done in Ea-Nasir's situation. Nanni didn't accept the copper at all, so couldn't melt it. This meant he must have used the other form of ancient assaying: rubbing.
Initial contact between the two went well, as a marriage alliance was planned, and an exchange of gifts was arranged (we have all this recorded in the so-called Amarna letters). However, things went sour, as one of the King's messengers was "detained for two years" and, notably for our purposes, a gift of gold was found to be of poor quality.
Unfortunately, archaeological evidence is scant for the use of touchstones in the time period we're referring to; however, it's not out of the question. The earliest confirmed evidence dates to the 8th century BC, although some tools have been speculated to be touchstones.
elsewhere, including the Indus Valley Civilization in the Harappah period (2600-1900 BC) and in the 12th century BC on Egyptian sites.
This is relevant because we do have some evidence that Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) ingot-mongers would occasionally attempt to cheat. For example, we have found ingots that are high-quality copper on the outside, concealing a core full of worthless slag (something that could not have happened by accident). One such ingot has even been found at an ancient copper production site in Bahla, Oman (as noted by Dercksen, The Old Assyrian Copper Trade in Anatolia, p. 41), which is neat because Nanni’s letter mentions that Ea-Nasir does his trading in Telmun, which is another name for Dilmun, which most Mesopotamian historians believe was located in southern Arabia near what archaeology shows us was a significant copper-producing region in the ANE. Now I don’t want to hang too much weight on a lone dodgy ingot we’ve actually dug up near where Ea-Nasir likely sourced his copper, but I do think it’s a cool coincidence.
(The "Archimedes method" involving volume wasn't in use at this time, and the specific gravity of copper makes it not a good candidate for assays; gold's specific gravity, on the other hand, is more than double and easier to differentiate from contaminating metals.).
