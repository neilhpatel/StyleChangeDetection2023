Nothing you have described will get you a restraining order. These people being smug or rude towards you because of a mistake you made in the past is perfectly legal.
Sure, you could hire a lawyer to send them a C&D. It would be nothing but a bluff, though, as they haven't done anything illegal or actionable from what you've described, and would likely do nothing but escalate things as now you're just bringing attention to it.
Yeah, this is far too ridiculous to even consider getting an order of protection. People are allowed to be rude to people that have falsely accused them of shoplifting because they were in their dirty work clothes. Instead of relocating out of town, you should consider counselling.
Well, whatever you're currently doing isn't working and you have no legal remedies available, so counselling is worth a shot. There's obviously a lot going on here and talking to a professional could help you work through it.
The reason you are getting suggestions to consult a therapist is because there are no legal means to remedy the situation. You cannot change their behavior. The only thing you can change is your emotional response to it. A therapist can help you feel differently about the situation.
My Caucasian boyfriend never experienced these types of things until he started dating me 5 years ago (Asian F), and now he experiences judgement, prejudice, and racism all the time.
