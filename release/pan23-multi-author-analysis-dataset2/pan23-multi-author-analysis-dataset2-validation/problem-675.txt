It sounds like your sister didn’t know she would have a reaction to Epinephrine. If she didn’t know or didn’t say anything, how are EMT supposed to know she would have a negative reaction? They have to provide emergency care with standard medications.
I don’t know why you would expect the hospital to pay for your hotel? Even if the EMT were responsible for malpractice that would apply to your sisters care, not your lodging.
Factoring in your sisters history of health problems, I don’t think anyone involved can be accused of malpractice. It’s a frustrating situation, but not one where a lawsuit is going to solve anything.
I'm not saying don't talk to a malpractice lawyer. I'm just saying don't start to conclude yet that just because she had a bad reaction and the doctors expressed a wish to go back and change it that means you've got a case.
You said she already has a weak immune system. If your sister was ill enough to need an ambulance, I don’t think the epinephrine was the sole reason she went to the ICU. Frankly, someone with a weakened immune system should not be on a plane during a pandemic.
