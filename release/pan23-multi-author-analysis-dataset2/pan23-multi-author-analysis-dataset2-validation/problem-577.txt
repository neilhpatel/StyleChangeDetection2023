We do hear it, but what can we do? You want an invasion? Propping up groups like we did in Afghanistan in the 1980â€™s or in Syria now?
This is my suicide video. I will have drown in this river behind me when you see this. But this is not suicide because of personal issues.
My reason for doing this is to draw attention of the European countries and people in the West to what's happening Iran. In reality, I'm no more willing to continue this miserable life outside or inside of Iran.
Even though I have a good income here [in the West], even though I have a worry-free life, even though the whether is clean here, even though the people here are very civilized in their interactions with others, even though the police and politicians are much more rational than the ones in our country... But none of that can make me turn a blind eye to the issues in Iran and the difficulties my people are going through. Therefore, for my country, I'm choosing death over living under these circumstances and I hope my death will bring at least some media attention to this problem. And also I'm hoping this serves as a message to the people of Iran that they don't feel Iranians in diaspora don't share their sorrows, and that they aren't willing to make big sacrifices for them if it comes to it.
I'm ending my life and existence for my people and for Iran. I don't have any mental health issues and I'm only doing this because of the pain I have in my heart for those of my people whose lives were taken, and to commit an act of heroism in the face of a life that's become devoid of meaning, and desecration of those concepts such as love, humanity and human dignity. This is a very important issue for me I'm willing to die for it.
Dear fellow depressed people of the world: please don't do this. Your message won't be internalized by anyone this way; it may even hit the news like this one, but the next day nobody will care except the people you left behind in your personal life. You'll just be one fewer living person spreading that message. Remember, if suicide were an effective way to spread a message, Tibet would be free.
I also understand the heroism imagery intended here, but even if your cause is a good one, please remember the distinction between spending your life fighting for an ideal, vs simply burning it away as a spectacle.
And also remember, even a "blaze of glory" is still suicidal ideation. Maybe those dark thoughts are right and it ultimately won't help, but please first, because what if it does?
