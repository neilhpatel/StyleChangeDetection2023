Wagner's leadership are legitimate, honest to god actual Nazis. Except in Russia that word doesn't mean the same as it does in the west, Nazi is just a word for a "bad, evil person who opposes Russia's greatness". and Russia's greatness is just naked, genocidal imperialism.
If I was ever in the position of Ukrainian soldiers, these mother fuckers would absolutely bring out ingrained, primal instincts of vengeance. The kinds of things we try to hold back on when you're a modern society.
After they've recruited so many people from all walks of life.. Most of Wagner membership aren't really ideological other than being drip fed Russian supremacist propaganda.. theyre just run of the mill Billy badasses who want to go play soldier and dont kbow what they're getting into.
I love that they're being crushed slowly and the country slowly becoming a pariah and no different in standing and isolation than North Korea.
The nazi guys whove been there since the group was first started.. are all either in senior leadership now.. or dead.
