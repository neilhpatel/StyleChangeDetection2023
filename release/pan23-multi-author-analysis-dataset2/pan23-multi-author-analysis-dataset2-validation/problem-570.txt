Your lease will control here. If you have a fixed term lease generally it can't be amended unless you both agree. With 3 years on the lease you don't have to worry about them not renewing for a while. If the lease doesn't prevent you from competing with another tenant, you can. In a commercial lease this would usually be titled "Tenant's exclusive use". If you do have this type of clause, the way it is worded could be important, and really you will need to talk to an attorney to review the specifics.
Unless your lease says "lessee shall not effect the sale of circular dough-based holed food objects on the premises", you're free to effect the sale of circular dough-based holed food objects.
I don’t know why you are even engaging in these discussions and going along with these requests. If you never agreed to limit your products you are under no obligation to do so. Sell bagels and donuts and drip coffee if you want. The only recourse your landlord has is to not renew your lease although presumably they’ll have gotten over it by then. The doughnut guy has no recourse at all because he is nothing to do with this, just ignore.
He keeps throwing in our faces that he has a non compete with the donut so he has to honor that plus he throws in our faces that the donut guy pays for in rent. How am I suppose to know.
