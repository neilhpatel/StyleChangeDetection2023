You're supposed to receive your meal break within the first 5 hours of the workday, as per CA regulations. They might get in some trouble if you reported it, but it doesn't sound like anyone forced or even asked you not to take lunch. (Though I guess they bare some responsibility for not ensuring you took lunch in time.) If you chose to delay lunch, they could discipline or even fire you for that. And that would be warranted. It's akin to working unauthorized overtime.
This might just be a union thing, but when I worked at Vons the bookkeeper told me that the business paid a fine for each "lunch violation" that happened.
Technically, if you didn't take your meal break before the end of your fifth hour and your employer didn't actively take measures to relieve you of duty and ensure you were given a reasonable opportunity to take your break, they'd owe you an additional hour's pay. That premium isn't owed if your employer did relieve you of duty for the appropriate period but you voluntarily chose to continue working through your meal period in spite of being relieved, though, so it's not necessarily a black and white situation.
While your employer's request is technically illegal, you might want to consider whether it's really in your best interest to push back on this particular issue. If it was genuinely entirely your fault that you took a lunch late and your employer didn't pressure you to keep working or skip your break in any way, it might be better for all concerned to just let this one slide. You can definitely be disciplined for not taking your required meal period on time, and that's likely to be the outcome if your time card reflects that late meal period. While you could fight their request and you might win, in the end you'd likely be trading your job (or at least an amicable relationship with your employer) for an hour's pay at best. It's up to you whether that (or the principle of the matter) is worth the potential cost.
This is a California thing. You get paid an extra hour if you don’t take your lunch before the 5th hour. Employees at our place are warned the first time it happens, if it happens a 2nd time, they are assigned a lunch time. If they don’t go to lunch by their assigned time, they get a “corrective action” that goes in their file. No one has had to be reminded more than twice. We are allowed to give up the “lunch bonus” if it is our choice.
