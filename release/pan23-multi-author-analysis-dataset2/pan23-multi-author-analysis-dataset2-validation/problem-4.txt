It would be good if their athletes could still compete (even if they cheat they will eventually be caught) because it gives the international community some kind of structure to promote cooperation.
Russia was allowed to compete in the Olympics for decades and somehow all that potential room for dialogue didn't stop them from becoming the regime they are today. If it couldn't prevent it, why do you think it could stop it?
edit - wow nearly -100 votes. Looks like reddit is becoming more and more extreme everyday. This sub is retarded and reddit users are either morons or bots.
They had a systemic doping problem. They literally built a trap door in the testing site in Russia, and had the KGB swapping out blood on their athletes.
Isolating Russia completely doesn't help with whatever truce will be accomplished. Sanctions should be against big companies because it affects their economy which dampens their ability to wage prolonged war. Banning athletes from competing internationally just closes another potential avenue for dialogue.
