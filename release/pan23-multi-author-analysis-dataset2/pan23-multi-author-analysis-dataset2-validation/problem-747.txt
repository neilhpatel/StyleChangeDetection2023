Heads up, if you applied for a job during the pandemic, the hiring process has begun because most of the agencies are not teleworking full time anymore. My husband and son have both gotten real calls (from related DOJ agencies) to schedule interviews for jobs they applied for a year ago.
I just asked them how they knew to pick up. Hubs got a voice-mail, son did not. We think because my hubs has his voice-mail set up with his name but our son has the generic you reached this number. Son finally answered thinking it was hubs calling from his work phone.
The FBI generally does not call random people to ask them about their recent job searches. If the FBI wants to talk to you they'd send you a letter to call them or come to your doorstep.
