Buried in the 4,155-page omnibus spending bill unveiled in the Senate on Tuesday is a single sentence that’s likely to go unnoticed by almost everyone – except the freshman congresswoman who fought for it with everything she had for the last year and a half.
Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), who represents this district, has made it her number one priority to find money for the school ever since she won a special election in June 2021 to fill the House seat vacated by now-Interior Secretary Deb Haaland.
Stansbury says she spent “every day, all day long,” dogging House and Senate appropriators, Hill leaders and administration officials to include money for the school. She didn’t know until Tuesday morning, when the bill was publicly released and she pored over its text, that her efforts had paid off.
“We’ve been working so hard on this, for so long, I literally woke up … and bawled my eyes out,” Stansbury told HuffPost in an emotional interview on Tuesday.
I was deeply involved in the budgeting of building a new elementary school to house 450 students in my high cost of living city and all in we were at 38m (which our community thought was too high).
“For an additional amount for ‘Education Construction,’ $90,465,000, to remain available until expended for necessary expenses related to the consequences of flooding at the To’Hajiilee Community School.”.
I normally would agree with this, but extracurricular activities and community building is important also. So, if that’s how they use it, it won’t be a total loss.
