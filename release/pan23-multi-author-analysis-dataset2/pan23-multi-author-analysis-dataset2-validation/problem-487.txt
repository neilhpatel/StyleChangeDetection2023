Israel knows better than to attack Iran by itself. My concern is Israel and Saudi Arabia teaming up to find a way to make the United States fight Iran for them.
Republicans already did that by turning it into a religious issue. Democrats have been trying to slowly sever ties because OBVIOUSLY this shit was going to happen. Anyone with a brain could see Israel would drag us into one quagmire or another, sooner or later.
All these assholes have to do is start meowing "BuT mUh JeSuS iN tEh JeRuSaLeM" and the conservative war machine will ramp up just as it did after 9/11. Then we can go _there_ and die until the 2040s.
This x1000. The problem was always nuclear proliferation in the Middle East if Iran ever got the bomb. The Saudis can and will arm themselves and after that it's off to the races for the region.
People here focus on Israel for… reasons… but the nightmare is really that KSA will go nuclear in response to a nuclear Iran. Israel is reliable in their responses, Saudi Arabia is not.
