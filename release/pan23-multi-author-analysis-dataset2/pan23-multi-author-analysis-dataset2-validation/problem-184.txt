The first thing that should be understood is that depictions of Satan or the Devil, and understandings of who and what that name and figure personified and meant have varied considerably over time. So folks in medieval Europe would not have necessarily seen the devil as basically human with red skin, a bifurcated tail, little horns on his head, cloven hoofs instead of feet, a black goatee and mustache, and carrying a pitchfork - but neither would any of those individual attributes necessarily been out of place. One of the very general things that can be said about depictions of the devil in medieval art and literature is that they were generally eclectic, and not always immediately monstrous, at least in folkloric appearances.
The idea of the "Black Man" as Satan, or vice versa, was something that gained popularity in the confessions of the European Witch Trials. Whether this was a reflection of genuine medieval folk beliefs or a construction of the inquisitors that massaged the stories to better conform to the form that they wanted to hear isn't clear. You can see something of this in Margaret Murray's (which should not be taken by itself as history, but it is sometimes convenient a gauge of popular understanding in the early 20th century):
Murray was cherry-picking her sources, so don't take this as an absolute census of accused witches in agreement as to what the devil looked like! But it does show that for folks that wanted to look through the trial records, there could be construed the idea that the devil came dressed in black, or was a "black man" - whether they mean that in the sense of an individual that was Ethiopian or Moorish in appearance or literally "black" as from coal isn't clear...and that goes for more than Murray's selection. Montague Summers in his (who also should be taken with a grain of salt) talks about how witches are sometimes conveyed to Sabbats "mounted on a sticks or a broom, sometimes on a sheep or a goat, sometimes by a tall black man." and that at the Sabbat "The Sorcerers worship the Devil who appears under the form of a tall black man, or as a goat. They offer him candles & kiss his posterior," and here Summers is, like Murray, citing and synthesizing from the witch-trial transcripts in his interpretation. For a more scholarly (but less accessible) discourse, check out by Joyce Miller.
Lovecraft is careful to specify that "black" in this sense doesn't mean "black" in the contemporary sense of "African American." That would have been necessary given the audience at the time. This was not always a distinction that was neatly observed in the medieval period; in Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages, Jeffrey Burton Russell does note that there was a conflation of the image of black Africans with devils in medieval imagery, and David Brake examines the Ethiopian appearance of demons minutely in ...but this is a very different body of literature from the witch-trial records; these are records of supernatural encounters by monks and other theologians, and the specific appearance as "Ethiopians" cited often have to do with trying to seduce people.
> The evilly grinning beldame still clutched him, and beyond the table stood a figure he had never seen before—a tall, lean man of dead black colouration but without the slightest sign of negroid features; wholly devoid of either hair or beard, and wearing as his only garment a shapeless robe of some heavy black fabric. His feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position. The man did not speak, and bore no trace of expression on his small, regular features. He merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the table, while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into Gilman’s right hand. Over everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear, and the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the dreamer’s clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm, finally biting him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff. As the blood spurted from this wound Gilman lapsed into a faint.
Also, in Irish, what we call 'black' people are called 'blue' (gorm) as the 'black man' (Fear Dubh) already meant the devil.
So there is a bit of a weirdness going on here: how much do these two bodies of material represent the same tradition of the devil as "black," versus different bodies of literature that are using "black" imagery in different ways to mean different things? How can we tell the difference between "black" in the racial sense we would understand it in today, versus "black" as the people back in the middle ages would have understood it? How much have they influenced each other? It's often really hard to tell, from our perspective in the 21st century, exactly what was meant in some of these medieval accounts - but for all the ambiguity, it does appear that at least a couple of appearances of the devil in medieval literature takes on the appearance of an Ethiopian - but it's not a uniform or homogenous image throughout time and space. Remember what I said about Murray and cherry-picking? For all of the appearances of a "Black Man" at Sabbats who is assumed to be the devil, there are many other appearances of medieval devils who have red fur, bearded or beardless, various animal components, etc. It is one of those situations where you have to be a bit careful not to read too much into some of these things.
It just struck me reading those quotes, but a third possible meaning for 'black' in some of them would just be a dark-haired or sallow-skinned European: Charles II was described as a 'tall black man'.
I can’t speak to the depiction of Satan as an Ethiopian, but I wouldn’t be surprised in the least. I can say, as an early modernist and early Americanist, that Satan was often depicted as an “other,” a member of a group feared or poorly understood, who was often culturally as well as physically different from the Christian European group being discussed.
More broadly, groups like the Jews and Native Americans were thought by a number of writers in the early modern age to be aligned with Satan. A popular idea in English Protestant theology is a duality in which anything God does has a Satanic antipode. Thus, if God has a chosen people, so does Satan. If God leads his chosen people to a promised land, Satan must do the same. So while any number of European colonizers thought converting the Native Americans was an easy and worthy goal, a large number also saw those people and their land as intrinsically disordered and evil (after all, since they weren’t mentioned in the Bible, perhaps they weren’t in God’s light).
Regarding Satan specifically, the Puritans during the Salem witch craze described him as a “tall black man in a tall hat.” By black, they were not referring to African. The descriptions we have clearly point to Satan as a Native American in their mind. Satan often reflected the fears and prejudices that Europeans possessed, and this case was no different. While the overwhelming majority of the Salem accused were English, the supposed leader of the accused was their physical enemy, at home in a land they did not control.
