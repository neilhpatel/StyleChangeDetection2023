So, I don’t know anything about Old Spanish (sorry) or even if it’s called “Old Spanish” officially, but I do study Old English, and the short answer is you can’t read it because it’s basically a different language than Modern English.
So then the Normans invaded in 1066 and that’s when Old English started to morph into Middle English, which was used from about 1100-1400. BTW, all these dates are rough approximations. Language transitions are long processes that happen at different times in different places. Anyway, now the word “wife” is “wyf” but pronounced the same way as before. During Middle English the Great Vowel Shift happens, so now words are pronounced differently, which leads to them being spelt differently. Middle English has LOTS of variations is spelling (to the point where you can tell where something was written, because the specific regional accent is apparent in the spelling), more so than even Old English, because of the GVS. For a great example of Middle English look at Geoffrey Chaucer‘s Canterbury Tales. A highly literate English speaker can read Middle English without training, but not very well.
Old English was spoken/written from about 800-1100 in Britain. It is similar to Old Norse and Old High German and also borrows some grammar from Latin. For a good example of Old English look up the text of Beowulf. Old English is the progenitor of English though, which is why some stuff is familiar. “Wife” for example, was “wīf” in OE (pronounced “weef”).
This is a fabulous answer, but isn’t quite fair to Shakespeare, as the spelling of the text quoted above has been modernized. For reference, the first published edition of Romeo and Juliet (1597 quarto) begins:
Anyway, eventually language moves toward standardization and by Shakespeare it is officially “Early Modern English.” This is when English really becomes readable to the average modern English speaker. Still difficult, but it’s no longer a different language entirely.
Whether this 1597 edition is actually a good one is a completely different question (spoiler: it’s not), but the textual history of Shakespeare editions is a whole field of study in itself.
Edit 5- it was pointed out in the comments that Shakespeare is not fully standardized, which is 100% correct, and I forgot to mention it. I’m pretty sure there are even variations between the folios. So when you go to the store and buy a copy of Shakespeare (or read the text I copy/pasted below) I should have noted that the spelling is cleaned up by an editor. It’s still Early Modern English, but it’s not fully standard.
I was aware of some of the changes English underwent throughout its history. But my question was more aimed towards why Spanish is "relatively" unchanged compared to french and English. Your comment was still incredibly interesting.
