Some unscrupulous landlords will call something a bedroom when it really isn't according to city or county code, in which case your friend and his roommates might have bigger problems than a door.
What do you base a legal mandate to install a door at landlord expense on? I can't find anything in either TX or Austin residential tenancy codes that states that all interior (bed)rooms are legally required to have a physical door, although admittedly didnt search very long.
The door was ostensibly not there when they toured the apartment, as taking it off permanently between then and they took possession wouldn't make a whole lot of sense.
That's why I followed up with questions about other characteristics of the room. It's either a house in some state of disrepair or it's a sneaky bedroom that isn't a bedroom. Assuming it's a legitimate bedroom and the lack of a door was noted on the move-in inspection, that's a repair item.
Again, where are you finding a law that requires the door to be installed on the part of the landlord?
I'm not doubting it's odd; I have a lifetime of seeing dumb landlord stunts. I am just trying to figure out why you believe there is a requirement that the landlord, at their expense, is going to be required to install a door. I do not see this mandate in Texas, where a couple states do.
Well, you've got me there. I was waiting for more info before I started to dig and now that I have I've turned up the same thing you have. Which is to say, diddly squat, statutorily speaking. There's still plenty we don't know about the existence of this bedroom, but that's irrelevant to your question. Given the absence of a law I went back and removed the "should" business from my original comment in the interest of accuracy.
It's unlikely in almost any case that it's mandatory, unfortunately. It's also not that peculiar, as only a few jurisdictions have requirements this detailed for residential tenancies.
It is, however, really dumb of the landlord to imagine someone wouldn't want a door on the bedroom. It seems people are really fond of doors for some crazy reason...
Yeah, the fourth bedroom was converted from a garage. The lease states the property is four bedrooms, but I guess I don’t know what level of privacy should be guaranteed between four strangers renting a house together or I guess what a legal definition of a bedroom is. The house is nice, it’s clean and otherwise well-maintained, just the fourth bedroom doesn’t have a door.
