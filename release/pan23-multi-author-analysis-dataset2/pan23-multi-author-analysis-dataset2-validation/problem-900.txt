Before that every statement about higher crime rates is what populists use. I could also say that you rape people, but I would have to proove it or else I'm talking BS.
"How/Why would you control for age, and gender and economy in a study about rates in background of rapists?" You cannot do that in the data generating process. You have to do it in the analysis. That's why I found your question stupid and gave you a possible solution for the task at hand. Include the variable so that you can afterwards only look at e.g. the group of males with poor socioeconomic status aged 20-25 and compare there syrian and turkish refugees to the rest. Here you control for gender and socio-economic status, use age as explanatory and rape rate as dependent variable.
If you want to include these characteristics in a study, you just use your data available, e.g. was the rapist a male/female, how old was he, was he living off of a job or social services. For every rape that went in the news you will find this somewhere. I think in Germany you can find so called Anfragen, inquiries from members of the Bundestag to the government about those numbers.
Potentially a rabbi may justify the Holocaust with this logic. Indeed I know personally a rabbi that does but would rather avoid the subject entirely. He refuses to participate in Holocaust Remeberance Day while other congregants have their own ceremony.
