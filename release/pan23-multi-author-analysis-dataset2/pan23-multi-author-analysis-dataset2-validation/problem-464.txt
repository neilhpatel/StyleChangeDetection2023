This being AskHistorians, you will no doubt not be too surprised to hear that the startling Norman success of 1066 was the product of a complex combination of factors.
To the south, meanwhile, Harthacnut's successor, the Saxon king Edward the Confessor, had done much of his growing up as an exile in the Norman court. Edward had a Norman mother and, for part of his reign, a Norman archbishop of Canterbury, and he was often at odds with the most powerful of his earls, Godwin, who had been put in place by Cnut and whose family (which included his son Harold, the king who died at Hastings) was, collectively, very nearly as powerful and as wealthy as the king. All this created a difficult political situation in England for much of England's reign, with a notable flare up that came close to causing civil war in 1052.
To begin with, the English state itself suffered from quite a number of long-term fault-lines. It had fallen once before in the course of the 11th century, in 1016, when it became part of the North Sea empire of Cnut – and his Danish dynasty had ruled the country until the death of the second of his sons, Harthacnut, in 1042. Although Danish victory had not resulted in the large-scale importation of a new ruling class, as happened after 1066, a number of Scandinavian notables did take over positions in the Saxon hierarchy and this period must have reinforced an existing division in the country, which dated back more than a century to Alfred's reign – the existence of a semi-detached northern and eastern portion of the country, the Danelaw, which was settled by Scandinavians (how heavily remains a matter of dispute), ruled according to different customs and laws, and where a different language was widely spoken. Lack of definite information from this area in this period makes it hard to be certain exactly how loyal the Danelaw was, and how different its people felt from those of the south, but it's certainly been argued that the northern half of the kingdom was a less than wholly enthusiastic part of the Saxon state.
Now, this is not to suggest that the king himself lacked power; he didn't, and Stephen Baxter's recent influential writings on his reign have stressed his ability to appoint, and remove, high nobles arbitrarily, leading to a period of considerable instability in landholding in England. By Baxter's count, one county, Oxfordshire, changed hands 17 times in the course of Edward's 24-year reign. All in all, the Saxon state that William encountered was not nearly so united or so stable as it superficially appeared to be.
On the other hand, it had at least been a kingdom that had enjoyed a long period of peace, one that dated all the way back to 1016. This meant that Saxon generals and Saxon troops had very limited experience of actual warfare. Even Harold, whose military prowess (learned in the course of fighting mostly counterinsurgency-style campaigns in Wales) was what earned him the crown on Edward's death, had never fought a pitched battle in his life before 1066.
All this was in stark contrast to the military career of William of Normandy, whose efforts to hold on to his own highly unstable patrimony meant that he had spent the best part of his three decades as duke fighting, besieging and learning how to raise, supply and command troops. The reputation that William earned in the course of these adventures built him a reputation that helped to make up for the weakness you note in your question – that Normandy was many times smaller than England. Once again, we lack the documentation to be certain, but it's typically estimated that up to a third of the army that confronted Harold at Hastings was made up, essentially, of mercenaries, drawn from other parts of what is now France to fight for a man with a considerable reputation as a leader.
Volumes have been written about what happened in 1066 itself – about the military tactics of the two armies (Norman castles and cavalry against Saxon shield walls; Norman discipline against Saxon impetuousness and so on), not to mention about the role of hard fighting and blind luck in determining the outcome of Hastings itself – the battle lasted the best part of a day and was exceptionally evenly contested by the standards of the time, and a considerable part of the eventual outcome of the campaign as a whole was determined simply by the fact that Harold and three of his brothers died in the course of the campaigns of that year, all of which meant that the only viable remaining Saxon candidate for the throne on Harold's death was Edgar Atheling, a boy of only 14. But I want to stress a couple of other things in wrapping up this response.
And in terms of strenh, are you saying that a politically stable Anglo-Saxon England could have taken on anyone else without much problems ?
First, I think that writers on 1066 tend to get blinded by the specifics of the situation and of the campaigns that year, and as a result see the Norman Conquest as the product of very Saxon weakness, and very Norman strenh. Take a step back, though, and it's very arguable that the sort of cataclysm that visited itself on England that year would have done for most of the other states in Europe just as easily. The death of an old king without a nominated heir was in itself enough to bring chaos, conflict and war to many states (Edward is supposed to have named Harold as his successor on his death bed, but we have only Saxon propagandists' word for that, and he certainly did not set out a clear plan for the succession well in advance). On top of that, the Saxon state faced two large-scale, separate invasions that year – a Norwegian one in the north, led by the formidable Harald Hardrada, which Harold defeated, just ahead of the Norman invasion in the south. Not one, but three major battles were fought in England that summer, and the last time so many had been waged in so short a time was 1016, a period which also resulted in regime change. Without the distraction of the northern campaign that he was forced to fight, the numerous serious losses that the Saxons incurred in the first two battles of that year, and the delay of more than a month in confronting the Normans (enough time for William to sort out his supply lines and even build himself a castle base at Pevensey), it's reasonable to assume that Harold would have had a much better chance of defeating the Norman invasion.
Second, and turning now to the historiography of the period, the last few decades have witnessed a comprehensive about-turn in many historians' perspectives on the nature of the late Saxon state. What had once been seen as an ineffectual, exhausted regime is now much more widely perceived as probably the strongest and most sophisticated state in Europe west of the Byzantine Empire. This "maximum view" of the Saxon kingdom, to give it the name conjured up by its best-known proponent, James Campbell, remains controversial to a degree, but there are very few historians who would dial it all the way back to the "weak state" conceived of half a century ago. And in the arguments of its proponents, it was the very strenh of the Saxon kingdom that played the most important part in the state's downfall post-1066 – that is, in explaining why the defeated Saxons were not able to mount effective resistance to the Norman takeover after Hastings. In this view, Saxon England was wealthy – so it attracted predators. And it was singularly well-organised. The shire system that had grown up in the 10th and 11th centuries ensured efficient tax collection, raised, armed and supplied local militias, and dispensed justice. The Saxon mint system, certainly the most sophisticated of its day, guaranteed the quality of the coinage, providing the state with a secure economic foundation and, in its triennial recoinings, probably a regular source of income as well. A long peace and an effective, interventionist central administration meant that England, unlike Normandy and other continental states of the period, was not thickly dotted with castles that could act as centres of resistance. And the geography of England itself – which, in the south at least, lacked significant geographic barriers such as mountains that might slow an invader's progress – was another factor in William's favour (the fact that his advance on London was badly slowed merely by the barrier presented by the Thames, and that the marshy fenlands of East Anglia did indeed provide a base for later Saxon resistance both hint at the problems the Normans might have faced in a more hostile environment). Once the levers of power fell into an invader's hands, in Campbell's view, the very efficiency of the Saxon state, and its favourable geography, became powerful weapons to be wielded by the victor.
You underline that saying strongest and most sophisticated west of the Byzantine Empire might not be exactly true, given that it's probably difficult to assert that a particular state is definitely stronger than all the other except if that difference is gigantic, like the difference between Rome and everyone else in antiquity I guess, but at the same time you don't really seem to disagree with that notion.
If I don't doubt of the sophistication and the strenh of the England of the 11th century, I have a hard time believing that Anglo-Saxon England was stronger than Al-Andalus, Aragon, the HRE or other states west of Constantinople, or more sophisticated than the Italian city states that punched so much above their weight for so long.
I guess you mean sophisticated in term of the effective control asserted by the government over the territory of the kingdom, and the means of taxation etc. like you already alluded to, but was it really that much better than anything else bar the Byzantines ? (and I am not even sure the Byzantine were that good on this aspect in the 11th century).
