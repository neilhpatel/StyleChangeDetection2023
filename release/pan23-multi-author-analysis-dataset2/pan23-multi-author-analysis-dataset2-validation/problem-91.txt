Told by whom, and compensated by whom? If not your own insurance, just go through your own insurance, they will subrogate. But sure, you can sue whoever was responsible.
I do not have renters insurance. President is Jeff Edmonds of Aquire Restoration and Landpride Properties owns the building, both in the small town of Oshkosh. Not sure what to do next.
Okay, but it's not clear who caused the damage. Who did? That's the person you have to go after. If it's the restoration company then you sue them. You need to sue, just need to figure out who to sue. When in doubt, sue all parties.
I was told by Jeff that they were taking over the property while fixing the fire damage. Since the water damage happened under their supervision they were responsible for quoting the damages for my property through whatever insurance they have.
A restoration company isn't going to pay you anything, that's not their responsibility. If you didn't have renters insurance, you need to sue whoever caused the damages to your property.
You can take the offered settlement or sue. You definitely do not need to sue everyone. If you accept the offered money you will likely have to sign something saying you won't sue for the damages the company caused.
