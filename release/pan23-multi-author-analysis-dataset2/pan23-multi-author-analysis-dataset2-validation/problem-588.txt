"The attacks against countries and individuals supporting the Taliban directly and indirectly will increase," Ahmad Saeedi, a political analyst and former diplomat told CBS News. "Afghanistan is struggling with a regional intelligence war in which everyone is trying to pursue their own interest."".
For about 8 years now yes. They're an off shoot of the group from Syria and oppose the Taliban because they feel like they aren't radical enough. They see the Taliban as weak for negotiating with the west and making deals with China. The Taliban are a nationalistic movement while ISIS has international aims.
ISIS-K (K for Khorasan/Afghanistan) was responsible for the bombing during the evacuation efforts that killed several civilians, Taliban and American soldiers.
ISIS have been fighting the Taliban for years now. The thing about these Islamic terror organizations is that if you don't subscribe to nearly the exact brand of Islam you are considered an enemy. I've watched first hand a fight between ISIS, Taliban, and Haqqani fighters and it's some vicious stuff. They tend to get a lot closer to one another than you'd expect.
That's literally the exact opposite logic we used when that decision was made. Was more like 'Meh them ISIS dudes...what's the worst they could do if we give them some M4s?'.
