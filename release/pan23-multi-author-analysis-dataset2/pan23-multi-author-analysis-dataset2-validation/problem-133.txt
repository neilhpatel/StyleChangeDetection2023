That means you must have the disability plates or placard IN ADDITION TO your school parking permit in order to park in a handicap spot.
In a legal document like this does the phrase in addition to link two objects together as mutually inclusive? I feel like it is also reasonable to read it as an and/ or statement, where it could be providing a third item to the two that already let you park in a handicap spot, almost like a caveat of sorts.
When coupled with the unambiguous language (not to mention state law) that "Only vehicles with state- issued disability license plates or placards may park in these spaces," there is nothing at all that's the slightest bit unclear here.
Thank you, it does make sense that even if the language was giving you an and/or that doesn't make it magically erases all the other laws pertaining to handicap parking. At best it could prevent campus parking from writing a ticket for that, but any law enforcement officer would happily write one following actual laws and not just campus policy. I was trying to read in addition as a list of shorts, such as a waiter giving you the specials. As an example today we have the special of beef or pork in addition to our monthly special of pasta, or something along those lines. Which typing out I see would be a weird sentence to say to someone, and applying the same type of sentence to parking permits is flawed.
Feelings are nice and all, but that's not how rules or laws are interpreted. There is no reasonable interpretation of "in addition to" that would mean that if you have a school permit you can park in any handicap space. And even if the rule did say that (and it doesn't), you are still, as a licensed driver, required to follow state law. And it's state law that parking in a handicap space requires a placard or disability license plate.
