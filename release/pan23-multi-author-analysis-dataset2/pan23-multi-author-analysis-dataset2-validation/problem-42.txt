You have the absolute right to breach a contract, but I don't see that you have any defence to doing so, so be prepared to be sued over it unless you work something out with the buyers, and potentially to be forced to close anyways and to pay damages due to the delay if the sellers sue for specific performance.
Sellers usually have few "outs" in real estate contracts, if any, but you'd have to read yours and see if you have any. I'm going to guess you don't. So if you cancel you may open yourself up to being sued for your buyer's expenses including temporary housing and re-arranging their move, as well as perhaps their deposit, inspection and/or appraisal costs. They could also sue you for specific performance which means you'd be ordered to sign the docs to conclude the sale. If the latter happens you will end up spending a lot of money on an attorney.
Sometimes contracts state closing will happen "on or about" a date, and how much leeway you have will vary by state.
If the buyers can have the PODS towed, I'd take that action myself and tow it somewhere safe. It is your responsibility to get your stuff out by the date you agreed. If you need an extension to closing date, negotiate something properly (you will almost certainly have to pay your buyer more than the cost of a tow though.) Your contract may also state something like, any personal property left on the premises at the time of closing becomes property of the new owner. If you need an exception to that, get your realtor to help you draft one.
Seems like a silly thing to tank a house sale over. Can everyone have a cold beverage tonight and work something out in the morning like grown ups?
I agree with everything but the "silly" part. It's not unreasonable to want to ensure the safety of my belongings, is it? We have stuff from when our children were much younger. I don't want to risk losing that stuff because the buyer is not being reasonable and understanding.
It's not silly to want your things to be safe, but you act like this is super hard. It's not hard. Either get the container moved, or, if no one wants to move someone else's container, hire a moving truck to come load stuff from the container onto a moving truck and haul it away. This is an inconvenience and a hassle so I understand you are upset, but to let it escalate to a lawsuit would be ill advised, IMO. It's your responsibility to get your stuff out, and your contract probably doesn't say you can do it when it's most convenient for you or your contractor, or that you have no liability if best laid plans don't work out.
