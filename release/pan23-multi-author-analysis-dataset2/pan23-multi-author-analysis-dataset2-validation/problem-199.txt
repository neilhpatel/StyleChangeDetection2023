The employer can’t reclaim the taxes they payed on your behalf last year, that’s why you need to repay the gross amount. When you file your tax return for 2021 you will be able to claim the repayment as a deduction which will result in a return of your tax overpayment from last year.
Sort of, in the short term, because the employer is no longer able to reclaim what they paid the government. But you also count it as a credit or deduction (depending on the circumstances) for this tax year.
I will suggest /r/personalfinance for advice on this. It is a it more complicated as you will also have other potential costs (tax preparer, differences in tax rates, etc.).
Thank you for the insight! I should have clarified in the post that I am on leave for most of the year and they are not garnishing my wages. I will be having to send them a check every month. Does that change anything?
