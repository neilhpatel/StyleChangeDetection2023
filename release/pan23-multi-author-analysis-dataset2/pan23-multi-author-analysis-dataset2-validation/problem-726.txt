If you haven't read it before, the Washinon Post's account of how Derek Black, the heir apparent to Stormfront and one of the first proponents of the phrase "white genocide", is an incredible read. New College was a special place, and now fucking Christopher Rufo is in charge of it.
New College is an incredible school, my older brother went there and I spent many weekends hanging out with him on campus. I’m not surprised DeSantis wants to destroy this school. It has a liberal curriculum and intelligent students.
And education is Desantis’ enemy 1. I still don’t understand how ignorance is so linked to cultural identity. I have lived in the south for 47 years and it still confounds me.
