Depends. What does your lease say about the dryers? Are they included in your rent or are they available to use (at your own risk) to tenants and not part of the rent? There could very well be a clause stating they're not responsible for you choosing to use them or for what another tenant may have done to damage them.
My apartment has a laundry room consisting of 2 washers and 2 dryers for the building. Stupidly I put a brand new $500 hoodie in the dryer after washing it and it came out with a ton of black marks all over it, ruined. I had this also happen with my comforter too . My manager told me I had to submit a claim with my renters insurance but when I called they were confused why I was filing since it wasn’t my dryer. After speaking to the adjuster the next day I was told that my policy doesn’t even cover accidents like this and to ask the owners to file the claim with their insurance. Well my manager has been dodging me about it for the past week and told me she needs to “do more research first.” I already know they’re trying to find a way to get out of taking responsibility, even though the laundry machines were causing me all sorts of different problems the past couple weeks that they have yet to even fix. The machines clearly aren’t maintained and I have all my texts with her proving that. I looked at my lease and found under insurance it says something along the lines of the renter having adequate amounts of insurance to cover property damage and liability, and to indemnify owner from any claims for same. I really don’t understand what type of renters insurance I would’ve needed to cover a specific incident like this but I feel as if they should be paying for this because of their faulty machines. There’s no liability/caution signs around the laundry room either. What should I expect from here and would it be worth it to pursue in small claims? I’m in California.
