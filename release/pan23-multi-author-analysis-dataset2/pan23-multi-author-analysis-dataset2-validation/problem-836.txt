Sheâ€™s very good at manipulating and lying, so I have to be prepared for when she comes home from jail. She will know that I turned her in, and I will need to protect myself from any repercussions.
I would absolutely tip the police off about her. If she has money, I would get a lawyer and sue for the money she owes you, especially if there is a written agreement.
Does your lease say that you are responsible for her share of the rent? If you and her have separate contracts with the landlord, it's likely that you don't have to pay anything for your roommate. Your only obligation to your landlord is EXACTLY what your contract states.
You may want to consider asking to terminate your tenancy with the landlord, and leave your roommate alone to deal with her mess. Alternatively, you could just wait until your time with her is up and just not renew the lease.
Oof, that's a problem. Unless the lease says otherwise, you're both responsible for each other keeping up on the lease, and thus the rent.
If the beginning of this statement is true, she's still controlling you by inspiring guilt for even considering actions that would result in your preferred conclusion. Sell the furniture she's using to buy time for you to pay the extra rent. Consider the advice in other comments but you need to prioritize your well being over your roommates.
