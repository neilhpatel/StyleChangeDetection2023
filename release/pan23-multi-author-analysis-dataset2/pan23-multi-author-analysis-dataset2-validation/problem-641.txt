In short - while the idea of an "opportunistic" Mussolini used to enjoy a certain popularity back in the day - more recent works (if by recent we mean the 1960s with De Felice's monograph), including those of Gentile, Milza, Griffin (more precise references in the answer linked), have come to the conclusion (which I completely agree with) that: a) Mussolini's ideological change was less stark that it might appear, in so far as it occurred throught a long period of time (indeed since his early socialist frequentations), across a momentous series of events (the Great War, the Russian Revolution, etc.), wasn't exclusive to him (many other intellectual and political figures experiences a similar, if not identical trajectory) and took origin from a position that had always had more in common with a certain "radicalism" and "intransigentism" of activist character, than from an established foundation of "far-left socialism" (while somewhat reductionist if you look at the general picture, Sternhell's discussion of this form of third-stage revisionism of Marxism is quite helpful). And b) Mussolini certainly was discredited among socialists by his lack of conviction. In fact he continued to be subject to the accusation of being a mere opportunist and "bourgeois shill" (at least) as long as this specific accusation remained the worst of his sins from a socialist perspective. But you can't expect the claim that socialism and internationalism had failed, that they had died with the Great War and that Bolshevism was "proof that they were gone for good", to be equally rejected by those anti-Bolshevik groups and activists who would rather find a welcome confirmation in their position being professed by one who used to be a prominent socialist leader.
Unrelated question: if not for the cooperation with the Nazis, would Mussolini's Italy still have had anti-Semitic elements? What about other ethnicities and groups of people?
The treatment of other "races" in Fascist Italy probably deserves its own discussion. I have written , and . See also by /u/quiaudetvincet.
I have written about the issue at some lenght (I have not actually wrapped up everything as I would have liked, but it should address your question).
It is obvious that among those groups, the adoption of a "racism" of German imprint could be seen as a positive change, regardless of whether this alignment found an official and formal sanctioning, due to its perceived ideal purity. It is equally obvious that this same process was resisted by those - including, to an extent, Mussolini - who wished to maintain a precise distinction, and indeed a sense of primacy, of Italian Fascism.
On this aspect, one thing I didn't really cover much in my answers is the fact that the German example had begun to represent a "model" for certain groups of the Italian Fascist elite already during the mid 1930s due to both its perceived novelty and less compromising nature (some of the "older" Italian fascists explcitly lament this attitude, of those who thought spending a few weeks in Germany was a way to become better, or "more pure" fascists). The growing relevance of the NationalSocialist model as an example for the more "radical" fascist forces within the aligning regimes has been examined for instance by A. Kallis, in the context of developing a uniform sentiment of "eliminationism".
