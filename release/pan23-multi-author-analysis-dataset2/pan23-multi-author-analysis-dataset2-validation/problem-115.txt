The use of the tee shirt as you described would not be covered by Fair Use. Its appearance would have to be licensed through Disney/LucasFilms.
The laws governing such a thing are under the umbrella of the DMCA, or Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Thank you, but what is the exact law that would apply here? Would a plaintiff have to make the case that the movie that features a shirt is somehow profiting directly from the cursory appearance of that shirt?
I’m not meaning to be ungrateful, but I know the prevailing thought is simply ‘don’t do it’ but I would like to examine the legal parlance that outlines why I should not.
The plaintiff would not have to make a case you're profiting. They would assert you do not have a license, and when you are unable to prove that you do have one you would lose.
Fair Use would only protect you if the film was made for private enjoyment and was not released into the wild.
The DMCA seems to deal exclusively with digital rights - I think the Copyright Act of 1976 might be the thing.
I still wish to see the exact section of a law, I appreciate your commenting but you are giving me generalities. I was hoping a law pro could say ‘Copyright Act of 1976, section xyz, paragraph 2 ‘ with a quote of that specific law that said something to the effect of ‘copyrighted works may not be featured, however tangentially in another work, including any visually copyrighted imagery’. Like specific.
