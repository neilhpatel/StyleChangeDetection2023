no, of course not. by 'we' I meant my friend, and me supporting him in his effort to recover the money.
The only LEGAL way to convince him to give it back is to sue him. Any attempts at getting the money back in exchange for “not turning him in” for any crimes he is involved in would be extortion/blackmail. Your friend LOANED him the money. Meaning he freely gave it and accepted the risk this friend would default on the loan. Debt collectors are not allowed to dig up dirt on peoples lives to collect a debt. Jesus Christ.
You have no standing here. He doesn't need an attorney to sue in small claims court. You're risking getting jailed with the shenanigans you describe. There is no "legal leverage" it's all extortion/blackmail. What state is this?
