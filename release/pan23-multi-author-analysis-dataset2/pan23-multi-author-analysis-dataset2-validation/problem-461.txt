I give it 5-years before this kid sees his first invasion force and his entire arsenal wiped out before the first boots are on the ground.
I find the most concerning part the fact it is always shrugged off as just nothing when in the past ten years they have obviously had significant improvement.
Even if it's not very threatening now, what does this look like in another ten years of this going unchecked. While always seen as the butt of jokes, how many countries do they already out perform just by not listening and keep testing anyway.
We have ground to air mussels that would destroy anything they send our way, I just don’t think they should be allowed to play this game anymore. Especially with Russia and China both acting a fool right now.
Every other article talks about missiles going off, countries arming themselves, breakouts of battles between warring countries, etc. All this happened before major international wars in the past, and I feel like we’re on an inescapable path towards one right now.
