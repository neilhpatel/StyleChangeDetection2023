You cannot harm a dog because it MIGHT harm your animals. There needs to be an actual, timely threat.
You may not like it but thatâ€™s the truth. Plus the odds are high they live in a county where there are leash or containment laws in Ohio.
And Ohio is pretty liberal with it. If the dog is putting the livestock at risk and appears to be interested in it, yes you can kill it if it is on your property.
OP can do whatever they want, but I would strongly recommend having some documentation demonstrating the dogs actually presenting some type of threat before just shooting an animal not doing anything. Good luck OP.
Good luck to you. We have nearly the same laws here in Michigan. We also have several high profile cases where people who have shot dogs not actually doing anything but being present on someone's property are pursued for animal cruelty, careless discharge or property damage.
My boyfriend and his mom are dead set on shooting them if they hurt our poultry but I just really don't want it to have to come to that. They look like good enough dogs but there's a ton of anxiety involved in the situation.
