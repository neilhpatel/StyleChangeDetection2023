Add in that you're not even sure how the acquired it, are you 100% sure it is your picture? I'm sure you weren't the only one to notice the picture opportunity.
About the only thing you can hope for here is to let people know that you were the photographer and maybe they'll give you some minor recognition, I don't see what legal claim you have.
That said, it'd be tough to claim rights over the picture, given that it was taken on company property, on company time, and prominently features your company's logo.
After some conversations with others, it appears to have been shared by the co-worker B, who I sent it to initially, soon after he got it and then when higher management went looking for pretty pictures co-worker C offered it and mentioned my name. One of the shift managers actually brought it up just a few minutes ago and asked if I saw my picture hanging.
It's kinda fun and I'll see if I might be able to get some credit, even if it's just a tag next to the picture. Thanks for the input!
