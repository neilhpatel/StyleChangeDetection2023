Even now, as the war dragged on and then turned slowly but surely in the Red Army's favor, most refused to leave the country. After all, it was their country, through thick and thin. Though the Bolsheviks and workers and peasants wouldn't have characterized it this way, this mentality could approach a kind of selflessness, if a deluded kind. As Count Sergei Sheremetyev told his son Pavel, "you are not to sell a thing simply to fill your stomach." Their priceless paintings, including Rembrandts, "must all must belong to Russia.".
This question, like so many other questions about motivation, could be answered in a sentence, or in a book. Motivation is a complex issue when you're only talking about one person. Multiply that question across an entire society, or even just a small cross section of it, in the case of the Imperial Russian aristocracy, and it gets even worse. With that disclaimer, though, we can of course give it a shot.
That is not the direction that events took, of course. Conservative hopes were raised and then immediately disappointed by the failure of the Kornilov affair — and yes, I see you asked about that too and will give it a go soon — and then thoroughly dashed by the October Revolution. The Bolshevik-led government that came to power in October was loudly and unmistakably hostile to the aristocracy.
First, you probably know this already, but it bears repeating that the Russian Revolution of 1917 was really two revolutions: the February Revolution and the October Revolution. The first revolution did not guarantee that there would be a second, and it seemed for quite a while that there would be a role for the aristocracy in the new Provisional Government, which claimed parliamentary democracy and liberal constitutionalism as its founding principles. Its leaders, people like Kerensky and Lvov, were not the starving workers who had protested and fought in the streets of Petrograd, or even the soldiers who had ended up siding with them. They didn't necessarily object to aristocratic class privilege, or even to the idea of constitutional monarchy; it was Nicholas II, his ministers, and his brother Grand Duke Michael who had in one way or another decided that the Tsar should abdicate without selecting a successor, ending autocratic rule.
With that in mind, it's not entirely surprising that large parts of the Russian nobility remained in the country after the February Revolution. Peasant and proletarian hostility towards the aristocracy was definitely growing, but it was miles away from becoming policy. Rather, the new government was still largely willing to hear aristocrats' opinions and include them in the process of governance.
Indeed, many members of the nobility considered themselves reformers, if not outright liberal democrats. They had been concerned, if not necessarily unhappy, with Nicholas' earlier unwillingness to cede power to the Duma and his reassertion of control over the late 1910s, and they and hoped to help the new government survive and ensure stability. Even those who had supported or gone along with autocratic rule tended to want to stick things out in the new liberal order, and several nobles held roles in the Provisional Government; Duma chairman Mikhail Rodzianko and Ministers Irakliy Tsereteli, Aleksandr Verkhovsky and Sergei Prokopovich were all born into noble families, to name just a few. Many nobles were optimistic about the chances progress through dialogue between the classes.
Some aristocrats, strangely enough, welcomed this, or at least took it with something approaching benign acceptance. Princess Catherine zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, for example, wrote that she could not blame the peasants and workers for hating the nobility, that she found their anger justified, and even that if she were to be executed, she could understand. Most members of the aristocracy, however, were not so self-critical.
Meanwhile, for the more conservative nobles who did not find a role in the Provisional Government and did not take such a positive view of the Russian people's innate character, there were nonetheless plenty of reasons to stay in the country. for one, it would have been cowardly to flee, to abandon one's native land over such a small change. As they saw it, the only thing to do was, as Aleksandr Davydov wrote, to "take part in the revolution, prevent its excesses [...] and try, even in a minimal role, to preserve the economic strenh of the nation." Many, both conservative and liberal, hoped that the new government would be able to turn the war in Russia's favor and strenhen the land internationally. There were certainly some who even hoped that the revolution might be reverted, as unlikely as it seemed.
Some simply remained for the same reasons they had remained after the February Revolution. It would have been dishonorable to leave when there was even a small chance that they might be able to produce positive change. Mainly, though, they believed that a counterrevolution would soon remove the Bolsheviks from power; such a government could hardly last more than a couple of weeks or months. Even as the Civil War began, though, most noble families simply left the cities for their country estates or for Siberia rather than leave the country, hoping to wait out the unrest.
Even for those with a stronger instinct for self-preservation and a weaker sense of pride, though, the decision was also made difficult because news media had collapsed with the beginning of hostilities, and without information, it became even harder to determine whether it was dangerous enough to warrant leaving. Those with well-known last names were the most likely to leave, both for fear of being recognized in Russia and for hope of being able to establish themselves elsewhere, but many minor noble families remained because they believed — or hoped — they weren't all that important or hated anymore. Those who remained spent the war in what they must have perceived as great privation, but in many ways it was better than the heartbreak of being forced to leave their motherland.
Ironically, once the war began to wind down, things not only improved for the former aristocracy: they became the objects of a strange fetishization. The very recent internment, murder, and otherwise violent dissolution of the nobility was followed by a fashion for claiming noble descent. In most of the Soviet Union in the 1920s, at least outside of the parts where the war dragged on, society was shockingly open and egalitarian, class distinction had largely broken down, and there was an odd prestige to the idea of a former noble now living like the rest of us. Because of that openness, emigration would actually have been possible for much of the 1920s, but still not easy, and in what seemed like a time of post-war egalitarian euphoria, it no longer seemed necessary.
I could probably keep going on talking about the experiences of former aristocrats in the USSR of the 1920s and 1930s, but to be honest, the later we go, the less emigration would have been a realistic or conscionable option.
To circle back to the idea of prestige, there was again prestige to be had by claiming noble heritage. At least, that is, if you could drop the act. Former nobles invariably tried to pass as commoners, abandoning their titles and dressing and living as befit their new professions. It's hard to say how much the erstwhile nobility was motivated to do so by fear, and how much they were motivated by a serious commitment to the new, hopefully egalitarian society. Noble origins don't preclude idealism, and in the USSR of the 1920s, they didn't automatically mean persecution either.
Many aristocrats supported, or at least had mixed feelings about, the February Revolution. They hoped that, by remaining in Russia, they might have help save their country from further war and instability. Though they had a funny way of showing it that had relied on exploitation and oppression, they honestly did believe that they loved their country.
Even after the October Revolution and through their destruction as a class, emigration simply wasn't an option for many former nobles. At first, it was unnecessary; the Bolshevik coup was unstable and couldn't last much longer. Then, when it did, emigration was cowardly; true, morally upright officers went down with the ship of state, as it were. Or perhaps it was because of lack of resources; expropriation both made it hard to pay for the journey and easy to imagine staying without being the target of too much more violence. Or perhaps it was simple emotional connection, whether that was to an interned family member or to the country as a whole.
My main source for this answer is Douglas Smith's Former People: The Final Days of the Russian Aristocracy (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2012). The book is really not perfect — it doesn't really do as much to engage with other literature as academic books ought to, and it treats the characters a bit more adoringly than is really necessary. But considering that the topic of Russian aristocracy in the Soviet Union has, until now, been most popularly treated by Ivan Vasilievich Changes Profession, it's definitely a good thing to have all of these primary sources narrated in one place, even if there's not enough real critical engagement with them.
I'm also using Sheila Fitzpatrick's The Russian Revolution, Second Edition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994) and Russia in the Era of NEP: Explorations in Soviet Society and Culture (Bloominon: Indiana University Press, 1991), edited by Fitzpatrick, Alexander Rabinowitch, and Richard Stites, for some contextual and chronological information.
It could be the movement towards liberalism and the restoration of imperialism among the exiled aristocracy after the end of the Russian Civil War, or the antipathy of the small domestic aristocracy to the Bolsheviks.
