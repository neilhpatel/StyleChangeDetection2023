There was some presser or event at the White House where an aide asked a group of Corp reps how many of their companies planned on reinvesting their windfalls in their workers and on repatriating capital. I don't think any of them raised their hand.
And this was the heyday of "better values" that the right bemoans the loss of. The wealth gap was narrower and average people could buy a forever home based one one earner's salary.
When the last Bush cut taxes, it spurred banks to start issuing derivatives that were sexy with those investors who wanted to make money in the new low-tax environment, but ultimately were nothing more than an elaborate Ponzi Scheme. Destroyed our economy.
Bush 41, back when he was running against Reagan in the '80 primaries, knew that "trickle down" theory was bullshit and coined "voodoo economics"to describe it. But he went along because power.
This is a very simplistic view. Cuts change the incentives for certain hiring credits like the WOTC, which impacts hiring decisions. Cuts also raise the rate of return on new investments and raise the cash flow on those investments. They can also boost long term growth through improving productive capacity.
Team Trump kept saying that big corporations WOULD NOT buy back their stock to artificially inflate it's value with their tax cut windfalls and that they would naturally want to reinvest in the American worker. Big corporations were pretty clear they didn't want to do that, and they bought back their stock like they were clearly going to do.
This started with Ronald Reagan who pushed the idea of “Trickle Down Economics” where “if we give rich people more money, they will take care of all of us.” The Rich do not do that—it’s not in their nature. They are incapable of empathy or sharing without being forced.
There’s no evidence the ban on contraceptives won’t include spermicides. Also, spermicides fail 1 time out of five so, while they might minimize the number of families with more than a dozen kids, it will hardly make a dent in the scenario I just laid out.
The United States was strongest when the top tax rate was 90 percent because the rich and corporations said “fuck it…might as well invest this in employees and research and charities instead of giving it to the government.” Stop the GOP. Vote them out of office.
That last point is huge. If women can’t take contraceptives, how can they have a relationship and a career? They can’t. If they have sex with their partner, they will get pregnant and, since we’re forcing women to carry to term, they will not be able to work. Also businesses will be able to fire women for pregnancy, something the democrats fought against.
Cutting taxes on the rich and on corporations and just HOPING that won't lead to more capital hoarding by the upper crust is either a sign of mental delusion or a bad-faith argument.
Cuts don’t just make it cheaper to take money out of the company, it makes it cheaper to hold onto income for future investments if nothing immediate is available. It also increases foreign investment, which increases productivity.
