It was a lot broader than that. I knew someone with a common first and last name. Both typical anglo names. If I told you the names and asked you to point on a US map where that person was from you would probably point to a cornfield in Iowa. Someone else with the same first and last name was put on the list. Different middle names, but they didn't include the middle name. Must have effectively put tens of thousands of people on the list.

He had to contact his Senators and rep and they had to go through all sorts of shit so he could fly again. It was absurd.
