If you move out, generally speaking, you technically can't be "evicted". Eviction is to make someone leave who refuses to. You have to remove all your personal property, give back the keys and tell the master tenant (the person who sublet to you) that you're not coming back, preferably in writing.
If he had grounds to sue you -- like if you owed rent or caused a lot of damage, etc., this won't prevent that. It just won't be an eviction. Like most states, California uses a "summary calendar" for evictions -- meaning many of the normal rules of evidence and trials are suspended so that the trials go quickly. Per California law, as soon as the person abandons or surrenders the tenancy, any outstanding issues have to be dealt with in regular court (small claims, limited or superior court).
Thanks for answering, So even if I move out prior to my agreement(which ends in January) I wont receive a mark on my record that looks bad to future renters?
Not to say you should try to settle out of court if you did get sued, but it would be one way of preventing even that information from becoming public.
There's a chance he won't sue, and a chance (given what you said about conditions and behaviors) that he wouldn't win, or wouldn't win much if he did sue.
