Emancipation isn't going to happen. The sister doesn't meet the requirements as she's currently living with her parents and isn't financially independent. No judge is going to emancipate a minor who's intending to rely on the kindness of friends and family to make ends meet. It's simply not in her best interests to cut her off from the only two people on earth who are required by law to provide for her.
She should report this to CPS. Keep in mind removal from her parents by the state is unlikely to happen unless there's severe physical abuse, neglect or abandonment. Verbal abuse, though abhorrent, may not rise to level where CPS would intervene. And even if the sister was removed from the household, it would generally be only temporary while her parents are given opportunities to correct their behavior. You and your fiance live clear across the country and almost certainly will not be considered for kinship care.
As an unmarried mother, the sister will automatically have custody of her child. The father will need to establish paternity by the two of them signing a Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity or going to court.
Finally, child marriage (which would require parental consent and court approval) is almost always a bad idea.
We’ve decided to take it one step at a time and start with calling CPS and see if she can stay with either me or another relative. I will be calling CPS to report the what I have heard and if she wants she will call CPS herself to report her experiences and see if she can request to stay with me or someone else of her choice who can start the process of becoming legally responsible to provide for her.
As I mentioned in my earlier comment, I highly doubt that CPS is going to remove her from her parents' custody let alone place her clear across the country. I'm not saying this to dissuade you or her from reporting because you definitely should. But you need to seriously temper your expectations and hers as well. Children, even pregnant children, do not get to decide where they live. It will not be as simple as she calls, requests to go live with you and CPS makes it happen. In fact, the chances of her being able to move in with you without her parents' approval is close to 0.
Yes that’s what I was worried about. I am aware words and kindness do not hold up in court at all. Everyone so far as told me that emancipation will not happen, so I am going to drop the idea of getting her emancipated.
As for the child marriage, I don’t personally think it is a good idea either for them to get married at such a young age. I was surprised she and her fiancé told me they were engaged, even despite them being pregnant and I don’t plan on actively trying to get them married if they reunite down here. I do think it is a good idea for the father of her child to be in in their life.
There is a persistent myth that having a child automatically qualifies you for emancipation. It does not. Marriage does, but she would need parental consent.
In California, she would also need to not only be financially independent, she would need to already be living apart from her parents.
Yes so far it seems unlikely that she will get emancipated. I will be calling CPS to report the allegations. She will be calling to also report them but also to try to get assistance in getting another legal guardian to take responsibility of her.
But I do have a question, if she must already be living on her own could she move out of their house without being emancipated first?
The law says that her parents can determine if she is allowed to live elsewhere. The emancipation thing kicks in when a child moves out and the parents do nothing about it.
She can move out with her parents consent or she can move out and her parents don't make any effort to get her back. The second way requires more proof. here's what one legal aid organizations says:
Is she completely financially independent and able to conduct her affairs without assistance from others?
She’s not allowed to work over a certain amount of hours due to child labor laws and (according to her) they have control over her finances aswell because they have a joint bank account.
She’s willing to work full time and her fiancé would also be willing to support both her and the child, even if she is still in California but as far as I know she, legally, is not able to make enough to be completely and totally financially independent on her own. And I’m not sure if becoming emancipated will change that now that thinking about it.
Perhaps having her removed from the home would be easier than getting her emancipated. I have decided to call CPS myself and report the allegations I’ve heard. I will also attempt to get her to call CPS aswell and request to be removed from their home if possible. I will tell CPS I’m willing to home her and her child but me being in FL and her being in CA might be a little too complex for CPS to handle. But it’s still worth a shot.
Yes everyone has told me emancipation will not happen we’re just going to call CPS and take things from there.
And, while I wasn’t aware having cameras in her bedroom wasn’t illegal, I do know everything else is either legal or at the very least circumstantial. Plus, it’s all based on he said/she said information. They are only allegations. While I do believe just about everything she says and how it affects her, everyone in the thread has taught me that just because we hate the situation, if she’s not hurt and is physically safe, then perhaps not much can be done until she’s old enough.
We definitely don’t want to waste time and money trying to attempt to get her emancipated if it’s certain to end in failure.
Our last resort will be to call CPS and take steps to maybe have me/her brother or another relative be legally responsible for her.
