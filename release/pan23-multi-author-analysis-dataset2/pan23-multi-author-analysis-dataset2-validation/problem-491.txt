There is nothing here that sounds like wrongful termination. In general, in California, you can be fired for any reason or no reason, except being a member of a suspect class, such as race or suffering from a disability. Employers act stupidly all the time, as is the case here. Nevertheless, employer stupidity is not a basis for wrongful termination. There may be claims for unpaid wages, however, and that can eb addressed in the labor board complaint.
Realistically, I know that there's not a law against firing Jewish people (which in itself would be a form of discrimination, I'm sure). Just trying to paint a clear picture.
Makes sense. I said it above, but I'm not 100% sure that R and I were let go because of us being Jewish. I think it was something they wanted to do but were looking for any reason to do it.
In CA they don't need a reason though. They could have done it for a silly reason also. Like "I hate socks, they itch, you're fired." Totally legal, if dumb.
It could also be a gender thing, but I'm not 100% sure that it was an "official" reason for us being let go. I think it was something they wanted to do, but couldn't find a reason to do it, if that makes sense.
This is true. If it matters, neither of them hired us. I was hired by the former sales manager, D (who R replaced). R was hired by a different manager than that, whose name also starts with R.
If they were discriminating against Jewish people (or Catholics, or Whites, or Blacks, or Asians, or men or women) then why would they hire Jewish people in the first place?
Both of us were hired on the spot-- and we were both his by white men who both left for their own reasons later on.
The only two were terminated, me and R. The owners are two Muslim brothers, A and M. Everyone else is Catholic or Christian. Not sure about C, who was the other person let go.
The 401k thing is a contract dispute, probably. She can talk to an attorney but it may not be worth anything. Going to work sick is stupid, but not illegal. Providing proof isn't required if you're using CA protected sick leave, but if you're not, then it is. They needed to give you your check today, you can mention that to the DLSE. But not wrongful termination.
