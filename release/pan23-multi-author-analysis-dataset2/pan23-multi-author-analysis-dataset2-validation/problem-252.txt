NAL. I would contact your local adult protective services. While they typically work with older adults, the fact that he isn't fully literate and that your boss is in a position of power likely makes T vulnerable to financial exploitation.
As someone else said, contact your local adult protective services. This can actually have a result. People go to for similar things to what your boss is considering.
Edit: Wow, thank you for the award! Now that this has blown up, I wish I had said to start with APS. I hope that they will connect you / T with the necessary legal resources. Of course, the effectiveness of governmental resources varies by jurisdiction, so if they aren't helping you should look elsewhere. I'll leave it to the lawyers here to tell you where "elsewhere" might be.
Does T have any family that will help him? Maybe you should suggest T get his own personal lawyer to look over all the paperwork. That's neutral middle ground. This way the lawyer will be the one telling T that this is a bad deal and not you.
I know this guy is your boss but does he own the company? Is there anyone over him that can do anything? I know this deal with the cabin is out of their hands but it sounds like there's more than enough going on to make this guy lose his position. This is just the stuff you know about too. I bet there's way more going on no one even knows about.
Not at all, it sounds very much like something that happens more often than people think. The difficulty is in finding a way for you to help T. without endangering your own livelihood and your family. Of all the provided suggestions, calling APS seems the most reasonable. However, even that provides you with very little guarantee that no one will use your name. If there is an investigation, the first thought on your boss' mind will be "who talked?" ...
I do not think that anyone here, myself included, has an answer. Unless you find a safer method than any presented, I'm afraid you will need to protect yourself and your family.
