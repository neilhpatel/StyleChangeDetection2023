Most non smoking communities have a clause in the lease stating something similar to "the landlord can not guarantee a smoke free environment." This removes liability. Even if you were to get a Doctors note, there is not much to be done. If there is another unit you can be put into that is ideal. It is not a reason that you can break a lease over without penalty.
Management wants to evict them. That’s the problem for me. No one wants them here anymore but we just can’t do anything about it unless I have an actual doctors note saying this is bad for our toddler (so I am told). But it just seems a little ridiculous that a doctor needs to officially say that second hand smoke is not good for a kid...
Is the unwilling exposure of drugs to a toddler not a health concern? I want to make sure that if I try to call people that I would not be laughed at. Get all my ducks in a row. I know that might sound dramatic but I just really don’t understand how someone can be so inconsiderate and disrespectful. They’ve had over 100 complaints since they moved in in August.
