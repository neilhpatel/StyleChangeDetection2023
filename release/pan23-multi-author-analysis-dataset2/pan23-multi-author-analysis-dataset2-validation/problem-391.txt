I think the Repubs are in a much worse situation having won the house especially with such a slim majority. If they keep doubling down on full crazy, and there's no reason to think otherwise, then '24 will make the '22 midterms look like a success for the GoP.
House Republicans will throw everything they can at Biden and nothing at the insurrectionists within their ranks.
That was before the GOP successfully rooted out all those who could experience shame, which requires empathy and self-awareness. Now it's full of sociopaths.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Here's the thing with impeachments: It almost ALWAYS benefits the person/party being impeached. See Bill Clinton 1998. Hell even Trump over performed in 2020 after impeachment.

That's an excellent point. Reminds me of 2012. The Republicans took the House in 2010 midterms and had the wind in their sails. They genuinely believed they would coast to victory in 2012 but then reality hit them hard.
