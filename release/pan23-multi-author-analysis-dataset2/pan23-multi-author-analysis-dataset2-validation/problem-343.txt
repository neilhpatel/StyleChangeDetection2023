Assuming you are an employee who is eligible to unionize (generally this means not a manager with ability to hire/fire or a close admin employee who assists and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine, and effectuate management policies in the field of labor relation) then discussion of wages is protected by the NLRA. So long as the discussion doesn’t actively stop your work it is a violation of the NLRA to have a policy that prohibits discussion of wages or to take/threaten to take an adverse tangible employment action against employees for discussing wages. Complaints of this kind are filed with the NLRB and if the company is found to be in violation will result in a sanction of some kind against the company (generally something like requiring them to post a sign saying they won’t do it again) and potential back pay for any employee who has been improperly terminated or disciplined.
It is unlawful for a company to penalize in anyway or restrict employees from discussing their wages. This is a federal policy, and they cannot get around it. This company is now liable for legal action from the NLRB.
Have your friend save and keep all documentation of them being fired for discussing their wage, and contact the NLRB immediately. This also counts as wrongful termination, even though it's an at-will state.
