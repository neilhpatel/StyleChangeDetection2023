Oh. Republicans are totally coherent to themselves — you don’t resonate with what they want, and you’re hoping Republicans don’t matter, but they do. Republicans have gotten everything: the Supreme Court is now a religious body; we are failing to confront Russia because the Rs want us to BECOME Russia; our global climate is destroyed. You may think it’s not too late, but it is. The Rs have totally destroyed the wall between church and state. It’s just worse and worse after this. Sorry! I have voted against them since 1972, but they have won.
In a way, it may even be appropriate in a representative democracy to have such idiots be represented. One would hope however that the idiots wouldn't be the ones running the show.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
