Yes take it to the shop he probably illegally put a GPS tracking device in the car. The shop probably wonâ€™t even charge you. Also he may have installed find my phone on her cell phone to track her that way.
NAL, but it seems as though there's a camera in the car. There are ways to have it swept for "bugs" and find the camera to remove it. Also, she should block him on all methods of contact - probably best to change her phone number, too. If her ex is that tech savvy, it's likely more than just the car is "bugged.".
It's a spy camera,dash cam or Bluetooth cam. An older car most likely doesn't have an internet connection, so the device is most likely connected through her phone or a hidden phone. Try putting her phone on airplane mode. Forget any unknown Bluetooth devices. The camera itself could have a sim card. Save it, that card can be traced to an owner, so it's evidence. Take screenshots of unknown connected Bluetooth devices for your record, see if Best Buy can locate such a device.
Also change passwords to Gmail, icloud, Facebook etc. Enforce 2 factor or even better, multifactor authentication using authy or google authenticator. Log out of all devices for these accounts too, forcing a new login.
