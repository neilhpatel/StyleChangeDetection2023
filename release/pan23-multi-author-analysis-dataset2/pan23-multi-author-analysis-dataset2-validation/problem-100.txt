What couldn’t necessarily be done is an automatic call; an automatic line in New York was opened in 1963 but it only went to London and Frankfurt. Even as late as the 80s calls to most of the USSR were done the old fashioned way: with a switchboard operator.
Based on the question, I think there is some implication of concern about spy-network communication via phone line being an obstacle. Keep in mind operators could listen to the calls; a phone line would be a very bad way to pass private messages, and while I don’t know any verified cases, it would be very easy for a government agent to be in on the call as well.
The operator (based on the caller’s request) would manually set up a call to a particular place, but it could take (depending on destination) anywhere from 20 minutes to a few days to make a connection. The problems were essentially technical; the number of trunk lines going from the US to the USSR was small (around 30) and the phone network on the USSR’s side was not advanced.
The phone network in the USSR was never given high priority, and a lot of the lines were for institutional purposes (in the 1960s, 90% of households in the US had telephones; I don’t have a 1960s comparison number for the USSR, but in 1980 only 23% of urban and 8% of rural households had a telephone line). This is why contact time took a while; sound quality was allegedly also rather bad.
How did those "day-long" connections work? Would the operator tell you the estimated time and then call you when the connection was made?
It's true that the line was not intended to survive a direct attack, although there was a backup radio link.
This is just an aside, but in 1962 there was no way for the US President to directly call the head of the Soviet Union. All of the communication between the US and the USSR during the Cuban Missile Crisis was done via telegrams between the White House and the Soviet embassy, and the latter then using some form of telegraphy to communicate with Moscow. This caused considerable difficulties; the Soviets were famously worried that the Wester Union boy who communicated between the White House and the embassy might be delayed for one reason or another. The result of these difficulties led to the establishment of the "hot line" between the White House and the Kremlin, which was just a direct civilian phone connection (and not to my knowledge secured against interception or nuclear attack). But a lot better than nothing!
Say we round it to an even 2 hours, 120 minutes x $3/minute is $480 USD in 1965, or $3960 USD in 2020!
I haven’t found a pricing sheet to be sure for this era, but the structure was such it switched to per minute but with same pricing (that is, $4 a minute). The reason for the initial $12 is it would cost that even if the call was under a minute.
When Benny starts the call he says that it is 7 am EST (UTC-5) in New York which is 3 pm MSK (UTC+3), an 8 hour difference.
Considering that we can now call family overseas all the time with Video and sometimes for hours but for free!
