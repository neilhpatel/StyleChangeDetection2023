Yes, but in Catherine’s case, she literally grew up in Prussia as Sophie von Anhalt-Zerbst. She only took up the name “Catherine” after conversion to Russian Orthodoxy for her marriage.
“Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and German emperor Wilhelm II were all first cousins of King George V of the United Kingdom”.
Probably because those 2 and Kaiser Wilhelm were all first cousins, and not only that but King George and Kaiser Wilhelm were both grandchildren of Queen Victoria. All 3 boys grew up together as well.
It is also said that Wilhelm II was Victoria’s favourite grandson. She exchanged many letters with her daughter over his health issues, and had British doctors sent over to Berlin when she thought the German treatments were too backwards.
Nicholas and George were the sons of the Danish sisters, Princess Alexandra (George's mother) and Princess Dagmar (Nicholas' mother), making them 1st cousins.Tsarina Alix was Queen Victoria's granddaughter because the Queen's daughter Alice was Alix's mother. Alix and Wilhelm were first cousins because Wilhelm was the son of Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Vicky. So Wilhelm was cousins with the Tsarina but not the Tsar.
Wilhelm and Nicolas were second and third cousins, as they shared a great grandfather in Fredrick William 3rd, and also separately shared a great great grandfather in Paul the First of Russia (son of Catherine the Great) so while they aren’t ALL first cousins, only Wilhelm and Nicolas weren’t second cousins.
Edward VII's Danish wife hated Wilhelm II mainly because of Germany taking Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark (before Wilhelm's time).
