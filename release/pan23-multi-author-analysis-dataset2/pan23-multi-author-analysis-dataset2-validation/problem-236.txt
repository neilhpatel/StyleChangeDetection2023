We werent home and hadnt been since the night before. There is nobody else on the camera except for the one cop. He used to be a probation officer and we both used to be on probation. You have to have a key to get into our building and our old landlord had one of those realtor lockboxes outside that had keys in it for maintenance. One for the building and one for each apartment. My old landlord gave the code to probation so that they would be able to get into the building. I'm wondering if they made a copy of our apartment key or something. The other really weird thing is that he knows that the cameras in the building are our personal cameras..who would I report him to though? I could report him to the corporal or the chief, but I don't think they'd do anything and I'm honestly like scared now.
The thing to do before you freak out is to call the police station and speak to a supervisor- if there was a legit reason for it to happen, they'll know.
Not only warrantlesa but it also didnt seem like a forced entry. The cop knows my husband and I by name and he has my cell phone number so I'm not sure why he needed to come into our apartment when we wwren home but never contacted us about anything.
