Banker here. When you detected fraudulent activity your first step is to cancel the card and report fraud. If charges have gone through your bank should issue a provisional credit while they investigate. Continue to watch that account for any more pending charges. If the location of the skimming device is known law enforcement should be notified as well as whoever owns the atm so no more accounts can be compromised.
I have never once had to complete or have someone complete paperwork to file fraud claims. You call the number on the back of the card, report fraud, they go over all recent charges verbally, you tell them which ones were not you, they cancel the card and issue a new one, the provisional credit is within 24 hours, they will then do their own investigation and sometimes send you forms. Mostly it’s only to update you on your claim but by then you should already have the charges credited back. 25 years I worked for banks and it irks the hell out of me they pretend they don’t know this shit just because they know YOU DONT KNOW! Fuckin bastards.
This happened to me several years ago. I did have to sign forms and the money was returned fairly quickly.
