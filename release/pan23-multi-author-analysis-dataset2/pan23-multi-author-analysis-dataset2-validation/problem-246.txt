I see that for proof of residence things have to be dated within 1 year, but it doesn't appear like they need to be dated within 1 year for proof of name. I would call and ask if that's the case. If yes, then if you filed taxes or got a W2 at any time in the past you may be able to pull up those records even if they're more than a year old, or you might be able to get a bank statement from when you had an account even if it's more than a year old. Since you only need a point, I would think the easiest one would be pulling your most recent tax return from the IRS.
You will probably be able to reprint bank statements from your online account. Otherwise, your bank should also be able to re-print bank statements for you.
You've never at any time in your life filed taxes? Because if you ever did in the past, you don't need a physical copy of them in your possession today--you can get a new copy from the IRS.
If you have never filed taxes ever, then it would at least be worth walking into a branch of your former bank or calling their customer service and asking if they still have records and could mail them to you even though your account is closed. It's a long shot but you may as well try.
Alright then. The only other option I see is, if possible, have your parents add you to their insurance so you can get an insurance or prescription card. You shouldn't need an existing license to do that. (I assume you don't have insurance yourself or you would have already pulled out your own card to use.).
Just a thought... You can file a federal tax return even if you have 0 income. I would look into whether you can file a 2020 return late right now, if there are no fees for a late return when you don't owe anything anyway. Even if you can't file one now, if you wait until the beginning of the year you can file one for 2021 showing 0 income. Then you'll have a tax record you can use.
Do you need the ID to have the statements mailed in general or just to your new address? If itâ€™s the latter, you could have the bank send it to your old address and forward the mail to your new address.
Otherwise I don't see any way for you to get an ID, since even a supermarket check cashing card is going to require you to show proof that you already have a bank account.
If you are in NY and your taxable income is under (I think) 18k, then you qualify for medicaid under the ACA according to NY's health exchange. Contact the NY State of Health, file a tax form. they will get you a medicaid card quickly.
