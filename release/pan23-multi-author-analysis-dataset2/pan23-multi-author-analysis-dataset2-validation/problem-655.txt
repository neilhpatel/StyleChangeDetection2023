I just gave a skim through of the SF moratorium, and I'm not in your area nor well versed in landlord tenant but it seems like there may be avenue for a traditional eviction.
"no landlord shall recover possession of a residential unit unless necessary due to violence, threats of violence, or health and safety issues".
Once again though I'm not an attorney nor am I working in this area of expertise so my general recomendation would be to speak with one. Since you already have I'm wondering if you spoke exclusively about OMI evictions? or did he tell you there wasn't any other recourse? If the answer is the former then you should go back and talk to the attorney further. If the attorney said there's really nothing you can do then you need to pursue the buyout option.
This isn't exactly a clear cut case, and with COVID laws nothing will be for a while. It seems like you might be able to evict him for health and safety issues regarding the stove, and if there's anything you haven't put here it might fall under one of the other categories.

The attorney would likely have told you if there was a way for you to skirt around the OMI prevention in place.
