Yes, I know, sorry. I’m not the actual fired employee and she hasn’t yet written up the context of the case for me, so I did the best I could with what I know.
If you don't know enough to accurately describe what happened and the context surrounding it, then you don't have enough information to get any useful answers.
This is disjointed. You're jumping to possible legal conclusions without actually telling us what happened. Context matters and you don't have a lot here.
Basically doesn't matter if she's an at-will employee. That's why I keep asking if she has a contract or not.
What kind of protected leave? How long's she worked there, how many employees in a 75 mile radius, etc.
Employee has serious health concerns, should be under protected leave, with trips to the ER, urgent care, and specialists in the last few months to determine cause and treatment.
Trips to medical specialists, doctor appointments, several days and half days missed over last couple months.
Does she believe she was fired because of her medical appointments/absences, or for the various other issues mentioned above (HR complaint regarding work, chats, etc).
I think the medical plays a large role here and they’re using blanket misconduct as a way to not have to deal with her.
If the two other people in the chat were also fired, that's going to be a tough sell. Especially without some clearer evidence (email, memo, etc).
Thanks for weighing in regardless. Yes, no formal contract. Sigh. And there were separate chats between the other two employees that may have caused grounds for termination, these would be a different set of chats with one of the fired employees. Still, she wasn’t able to print them out prior to firing to dispute the grounds. Sigh.
