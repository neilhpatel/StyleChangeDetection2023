This is a little difficult to answer without more information like state, type of claim, are you plaintiff or defendant, etc--and even then, lots of other issues to be considered. Generally, there is a retainer agreement which states out your rights and obligations between you and the lawyer. Your state ethics committee also has certain professional rules and code that the lawyer must follow, including on withdrawal. The administrative judge for your jurisdiction has promulgated regulations regarding withdrawal from a case. In most jurisdictions, an application usually by order to show cause would be brought in front of the assigned judge who would review the facts against the professional rules/code, regulations, and other decisional law.
If this dispute is really important to you, you want to be on the same page with your lawyer. Do not regret forcing to go to trial with a lawyer that acts like this to you or doesn't believe in your claim. A judge, while having discretion, would likely allow an adjournment of a trial to allow you to retain new counsel who can become abreast of the case and issues.
In California, the case is a civil malpractice case. Yes there is a contingent retainer. We are Plaintiffs, with prior depositions that contradict what this lawyer is trying to appeal. We have stated for several years that the first action caused the most damage. The second cause of action contributed ontop of damages. This lawyer has bullied to the point of tears and telling us we must follow this way, even though it would seem like perjury or contradictions to depositions to get his way. He has also done some other egregious behaviors, that I publicly do not want to disclose. We were worried he would either sabotage or case or leave us high and dry.
Do not risk going to trial with anyone you are not comfortable with representing you. This is your case. It is your money and your claims--your life. You can terminate the relationship and the lawyer would have a charging lien or retaining lien on the file, but your new lawyer can handle that once a settlement/verdict is reached.
Yikes--let's be clear there: The client is in charge. If you like the settlement agreement and tell him you accept it, that is it--the case is done. He does not get to pick--you do.
Thank you for your answers. The defendants made a settlement not to his liking, and declines to counter back with an official SDL or 998. He stated numerous times he will not represent the remaining action with punitive damages at trial. He has said he is willing to walk away without anything. If he does are we allowed to ask the defendants for the original offer prior to retaining new counsel to go to trial?
If it is something like a legal tactical decision, that is generally considered within the scope of expertise of a lawyer and the lawyer can override your wishes. That can, of course, result in a situation that breaks down between the attorney-client.
If you want that settlement that he will not accept or counter, or if he will not proceed pursuant to your desires and they are not tactical, then there really is a big issue here. You might want to look for another lawyer and see what their thoughts are on taking over the case--some lawyers won't touch it, others might. If it goes to trial, the judge should ask about offers and demands. Defendants should advise of their demand, and your lawyer will state no counter. A good judge will give you an opportunity to be heard outside the presence of opposing counsel, and you can voice your objection to the judge then. But I would not let it get that far. You may want to seek another counsel.
You are welcome. Best of luck! Not all lawyers are bad. I am sorry you are experiencing this. I hope the judge is kind to you and your next lawyer treats you properly. Be well.
