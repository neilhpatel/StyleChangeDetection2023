I am not sure what you mean by on the same lease. All 4 of us signed the lease at the same time but we only signed the lease for our own rooms. Like their names are nowhere on my lease.
When you signed YOUR lease, you agreed to certain stipulations and guidelines set forth in the text. As long as you are abiding by those terms and you're on separate leases, you are not liable for the roommate's choice to disregard the terms of his lease. Because it's not working out, the sooner that roommate and girlfriend are gone, the better, from how it sounds. I'm not advocating to narc out your friend, but casually mentioning the female's constant presence to the landlord could get the ball rolling. I'd talk to the other roommates and go from there. You don't want to be the only asshole if they like her being there and you rat her out.
Thanks for the advice. The other two roommates are also tired of them and so are our common friends. ( I am suspecting someone from the party told our landlord about her presence.).
