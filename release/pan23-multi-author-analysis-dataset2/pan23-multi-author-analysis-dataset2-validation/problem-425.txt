Always have; It was a big part of why people fought against NAFTA. US floods Mexican corn market with subsidised corn, undercutting local growers. It's also why so many Mexican farmers turned to more lucrative crops and fed the drug trade.
This is a case that I often remember when dealing with genetically modified products The issue is not whether or not they are better crops, the issue is the intellectual property that these large companies hold. Monsanto suing a small farmer for using genetically modified canola crops, went through the years and years of litigation before landing in the Canadian Supreme Court. Although Schmeizer was eventually found guilty of using the Monsanto crops by 5 to 4 margin, any monetary damage by Monsanto was nullified. Schmeiser maintained the whole time that he never used, purchased, or bought genetically modified seeds from Monsanto, and that the crops obtained the genetic traits strictly due to pollen from adjacent fields of other farmers.
obviously farmers have to gene sequence every seed before planting to ensure they don't run afoul of someone's intellectual property rights.
"seeds spreading" is a non-issue. farmers purchase seeds every time the sow. no profitable farm uses reused seeds, they would have completely random and unhelpful genetic changes compared to the original.
2) it's irrelevant, because farmers buy new seeds every time they plant. that's how farming works: you need predictable genetics. the guy in this lawsuit intentionally cultivated the genetically modified plants he discovered near the edge of his property.
3) there have been zero cases of monsanto or any other patent holder company (edit: "successfully" because y'all are pedants lol) suing a farmer for accidental genetic drift. exactly zero. not a single one. therefore, we must conclude that no, it's not a problem for any farm owner, at all.
if you park your car in a private parking lot and the lot's owner decides to steal it while you're out, is your car his to keep?
and as an additional example more to your point: if you find $10,000 on the sidewalk in a bag, you're legally required to report it and return it to the owner if possible.
so, yeah this entire trial was in line with property laws that exist in the US (unsure how canadian property law compares though, and the case was in canada. i'm just not aware of the laws).
that's not how farming works. you need to start with all the same cultivar or you'll end up with a terrible harvest.
and it's not that he found a "better" crop -- in fact, it's basically impossible for his specially cultivated, partially roundup-ready crop to ever be profitable.
and after a couple generations of crossbreeding, crop cultivars tend to lose hardiness anyway. so he actually found a worse crop at the end of his land.
this is a common misconception held by people who know nothing about the last 100 years of agriculture.
professional farmers buy huge quantities of identical seeds every time they plant. trying to select for their own genetics would be a waste of time and arable land, and would put any farmer out of business quite quickly.
that may happen in some instances, but there's a major reason why there are so many patented cultivars, genetically engineered or traditionally crossbred.
there is literally not a single case ever in north america where monsanto sued and collected from someone due to accidental cross-contamination.
this whole story is just mexican government propaganda lol, "look, we're doing something to protect our corn heritage!".
on the positive side, at least on reddit i've noticed a shift towards logic and reality over the last couple years.
Yes, in essence, all corn has been genetically modified simply by selection of specific traits over hundreds of years. However, the Genetically Modified label is used here to refer to crops that have been modified using newer methods of genetical manipulation and patented the resulting seed. Farmers do not hold any rights to keep using that same seed. It must always be re-purchased by the conglomerate patent holder.
