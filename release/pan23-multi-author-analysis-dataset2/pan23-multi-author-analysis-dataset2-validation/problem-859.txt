It's a myth that "only the richest American families" in southern states could own slaves, which is perpetuated mainly by Confederate apologists hellbent on arguing that the Civil War wasn't about slavery.
Many people in the antebellum South owned slaves. I wrote an answer on this awhile ago, adapted from the multiple times it's come up before. Before we get to that, here's a handy chart adapted from the 1860 census that looks at percentages of families who were enslavers, and percentages of enslaved people, in the seceding states and border states:
It's funny you mention Twain, because he classified lies into three categories: lies, damn lies, and statistics. That statistic you quote is used by Confederate apologists to make it sound like the war wasn't about slavery. (It was about slavery.) To answer your second question first, while many enslaved people worked on slave labor camps (Monticello, Mount Vernon, etc), many households in the South owned "only" one or two enslaved people.
If you ask this question in this way, you'll get what seems to be a low number because it counts only property owners, who are heads of households, and not families/households who would benefit from the slave. (Think about it in this way: in my household I own a car, but my wife and child also benefit from my ownership of the car -- she drives it, he rides in it, we all use the groceries it brings home, etc.).
So now we get into some basic stats. The 8 percent number is accurate, but it's also misleading, because fully half the states in the United States banned slavery, and those states held well over twice the population of the southern states -- about 22 million in the North, about 13 million in the South. Further, in the South, about 4 million of the population were slaves. So 22 million people were ineligible to own enslaved people right away, plus there were about four million enslaved people themselves -- so the question has to center on the population eligible to own enslaved people, that is, the remaining 8.2 million.
It also depends on whether you look at the percentage of slave owners (or slave-owning households) in the overall population of the U.S., or in slave states particularly.
So the better question is what percentage of households owned enslaved people. Here's a resource for the 1860 census which breaks down slave ownership by state:
To expand on that just a bit, the reason why how you count slave ownership matters is that if you state the question as "what percentage of whites owned people in 1860", you get a number that's about 8 percent of families owning enslaved people. (See the 1860 census link for context.) That number is often used by Confederate apologists to "prove" that the war couldn't be about slavery, because such a low percentage of households owned enslaved people.
If you take a look through that it's quite illuminating; slaveholding families ranged from a low of three percent of the population in Delaware, to highs 46 percent in South Carolina and 49 percent in Mississippi. It's also interesting to look at enslaved people as percentage of population, where 57 percent of South Carolina's population and 55 percent of Mississippi's were enslaved people.
Think for a minute about what you're saying here -- are you really under the impression that 49 percent of Mississippi's households were "the rich?" Certainly the richest Southerners owned many slaves -- enslaved people were worth a lot of money -- but many Southern households owned only one or two people. only about 50 families owned 20 or more slaves.
Those numbers are very interesting. Would it be fair to presume that there's near identity between slave owning families and wealth/land ownership? In other words, I would think that percentage of slave owning families in a particular state closely corresponds to the wealthiest X% of families in those same states. Given the social/political power held by those at the top of the wealth ladder, it's easy to understand how united slave states were in opposing slavery to the point of succession.
That number is great for making it appear that the war wasn't about slavery. It also ignores the fact that slavery was illegal in half the states, which comprised most of the population of the U.S.
I'm curious as well about the overlap. Especially looking at these numbers. For instance according to the chart 49% of homeowners in Mississippi owned slaves, but 55% of the population was enslaved. These numbers don't really give a clear picture of whether it was primarily the rich who owned slaves or your average American at the time - especially when considering that the Union population more than doubled the Confederate. I think the data point that says that only 8% of US households owned slaves is a better indicator than looking at each individual states since states varied in population size and slave intensity. These numbers would be great in determining what the war was about though.
