Has someone been formally appointed by a court to be in charge of your father's estate? If so, who is it? If his estate was small enough to meet small estate requirements, has your stepmother taken steps to do the required paperwork?
Yes, all of his monetary assets went to her. I don't care about the money though, and she has said she doesn't care to have his personal belongings. In the will it lists myself and my siblings (18 and 14, 17 and 13 at the time) as gaining possession of all his belongings.
The only person that is in charge or your late father's assets is someone who has been appointed by the Clerk of Superior Court as the administrator of his estate. If there was a will, the person named as executor in the will ordinarily will be appointed unless they decline to serve or are unable to serve for some reason. If there is no will, anyone can apply to be administrator. No one else has authority to decide who gets what. You can take a copy of his death certificate to the Clerk or Superior Court in the county he was living in and apply yourself. You will need the name and contact information of every other potential beneficiary (ordinarily spouse and children) and they will all get notice that you have applied and will have an opportunity to object. Spouse will probably be appointed if she wants to serve.
The will lists myself and my siblings as receiving all of his assets, though my stepmother applied for spousal share. The executor has not had any hand in the matters.
The administrator has a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries to make sure the property gets to the right person. Who is the administrator of the estate? They have an obligation to take control of the assets and give them to you. They can use the power of the court to do so if the grandparents wonâ€™t cooperate. If they are failing to do their job you can ask the clerk of court to replace them with someone who will or to order them to do so.
