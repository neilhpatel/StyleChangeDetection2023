We tend to think of imperial Rome as a city of marble and concrete. But almost all of the city's buildings, from grandiose temples to ramshackle insulae (apartment blocks) contained considerable amounts of wood.
By the first century CE (which seems to be your period of interest), Rome was largely a sea of multi-story insulae, punctuated here and there by temples and sprawling elite houses. Temples and elite houses could and did burn; but fires tended to start and spread in the insulae.
The walls of insulae were typically built of brick-faced concrete, though the upper stories might use a money-saving "half-timbered" method . The best apartments were invariably in the lower floors. The higher one climbed - and some insulae, despite imperial legislation limiting their height, were probably well over 100 feet tall - the shoddier construction became, and the more wood was used.
Even when an apartment was built entirely of concrete, its doors and window frames were invariably wooden. At least in the upper stories, the floors were usually wooden as well. The attic apartments, cheapest and most dangerous of all, were located directly below the roof - which was, you guessed it, wood (though covered in fireproof tile).
There were thousands of insulae in Rome, packed cheek-by-jowl along narrow streets (Nero's post-fire legislation mandating wide roads and fireproof buildings seems to have been largely ignored). For most of the year, the wood in all those buildings was bone dry, needing only a spark to flash into flame. And sparks were everywhere. Since few insulae had fireplaces (especially not in the wood-heavy upper stories), the inhabitants had to rely on braziers (metal dishes holding hot coals) to keep warm and for simple cooking. All it took was a single overturned brazier to kindle an entire insula.
Once one insula flared up, the neighborhood often followed. Despite the presence of the aqueducts (and laws mandating apartment dwellers to keep supplies of water on hand), there were nothing like fire hydrants in ancient Rome. The vigiles (night watch) served as makeshift firemen, but they could do little beyond tearing down structures to create firebreaks.
Monumental buildings like temples had less wood than the insulae. Their roofs too, however, were framed with wood, and the same was true of elite houses and most public buildings. If a fire broke out when there was a strong wind blowing - as happened during the conflagration of 64 - flames would jump readily from roof to roof, consuming whole districts of the city.
When I was touring Pompeii the other day I was wondering this when even one of the temples near the forum was noted to have been in the middle of reconstruction after a fire. I figured the more expensive and important structures featured more stone/marble, but it makes sense that things like the roof and upper floors were made of wood to save on weight and whatnot.
The design of the roads in Pompeii is fascenating. There seems to be a walkway on either side, a main central path with what appear to be cart grooves, and then large stone "crosswalks" near intersections. What was the purpose of these large stones? Were they to allow easy crossing during heavy rains so water could flow past them? Did carts roll right over them?
It's amazing the Romans never had a police force or public fire fighters like we do today. So many headaches could have been avoided if things like public elections had guards posted to prevent violence, or if there were state sponsored fire fighters that could handle a fire without first bargaining with the owner.
Many wealthy Romans invested in real estate, and some (most famously the triumvir Crassus) actually maintained teams of slaves who specialized in the construction and renovation of insulae. It was more common, however, to simply hire a contractor. These men typically had a small staff of highly-trained slaves or freedmen for skilled building work, supplemented by dozens or hundreds of unskilled workers hired for the duration of the job.
Would people just pay a bunch of builders to put a house up or extend a road or was there some sort of bureaucracy and public building department?
Could I bother you with one more question? I've been searching online but can't find really anything I'm looking for.
shows the stones I'm referring to. Any explanation would be appreciated, Google isn't helping much.
Unfortunately, we don't know. It was called the Insula Felicles, and towered impressively enough to become proverbial (several authors make casual reference to it). Since Rome had plenty of other tall buildings, the Insula must have been well over 100 feet high to excite so much comment.
Yes, they were stepping stones, spaced so that carts could roll right over them. I once visited Pompeii during a heavy thunderstorm. Streams of water eight inches deep were rushing down the gutters; but thanks to the stones, my feet stayed dry.
After the great fire, Nero established regulations about the minimum width of streets and the maximum height of the insulae. Later, Trajan established a new maximum height. To judge, however, from the facts that exceptionally tall insulae are recorded to the end of the imperial period (one was so tall that it become a tourist attraction) and that Rome's minor streets continued to be narrow and tortuous, these regulations were mostly observed in the breach.
The most notable reference is in Tertullian's Against the Valentinians, where a heretical sect's idea of Heaven is likened to the Insula Felicles:
"Well, perhaps even for our creator \[the heavens\] have been distributed like apartments. Perhaps they have various shops built on in front and assigned to each god by floors--as many floors as there are heresies. In this way the world becomes an apartment house; indeed, you might think the celestial flats are the Happy Isles Apartments \[i.e., the Insula Felicles\], located somewhere. There even the Valentinian god lives--in the penthouse." (7).
