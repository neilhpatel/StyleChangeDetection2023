This sounds an awful lot like trying to commit fraud. You need a probate attorney and to start that process. If you can pay the mortgage and your sister doesn't want the property then it can likely go to you.
I guess it just felt weird to not start probate for 1 year but the person who advised me to do that if I can was an attorney with legal aid. I’m just trying to figure out how to not be homeless but I don’t want to do anything wrong and what she advised me to do just feels weird. I am also afraid creditors will take the house somehow. I just don’t know anything about this.
Yeah, you really need to talk to a probate attorney. Their business loan needs to be handled. Their house and any other assets need to pay for their debts. You may still be able to keep the home. But ignoring it and hoping things work out is likely going to bite you in the ass.
Their income barely covered their cost of living each month and I tried to help with some of that even though I don’t make a lot, so I don’t believe they have anything in their bank.
They had an sba loan for I think $20,000, a few credit cards probably owing around $8,000. Their house was I think $99,000 and they still owe $88,000.
They also were both in the icu on ventilators for almost a month and I have no idea but I am expecting to begin receiving hospital bills for possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars. Since it was covid I have been told that can be dismissed somehow but I’m not sure.
You and your older sister would own half of the house assuming you can keep the house without being forced to sell to pay remaining debts.
It is a strategy to prevent creditors from coming after the estate to continue to pay the bills until the year is over. Having said that, if you absolutely know your parents had no major debts (other than the mortgage) the need to do that has dwindled significantly. You may even run into issues with being able to access their finances without being appointed the Personal Representative of their estate, which can only be accomplished by opening the probate. You're also going to essentially be paying for the upkeep of half of your sister's estate and may never recoup that from her. Do you have a plan with her about the house? You should discuss it with her. Because while that house is technically going to be half her's, she's also responsible for half the upkeep on it.
I'm not certain whether that is actually legitimate if you intentionally avoid probate, however. I would definitely try and get a consultation with an SC Estate lawyer to be sure.
