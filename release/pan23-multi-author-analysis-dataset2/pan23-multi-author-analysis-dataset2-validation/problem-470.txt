If they can show they provided a service and you knew and agreed that this service would be provided, you won't likely be found in favor of on the basis that you never agreed to pay for said service. The judge isn't going to conclude that they agreed to perform the work for free for no apparent reason.
This is what I am unsure about and really needed an opinion on before making a decision on how to handle this. I don't want to go thru the all hassle, take a hit to our credit score, then get in front of a judge if the odds will not be in our favor. May be best to try to negotiate with the 'doc' to reduce money owed or payment plan or something so he doesn't get all his money and be done with it...sigh.
I was a debt collector for many years. Dispute the charge immediately if and when it appears on your credit report, demand validation of debt from them (trans union, equifax, experian). When you hear from debt collectors make sure they go through thr full FDCPA GUIDELINES. If they don't tell you " this is an attempt to collect a debt any information obtained will be for that purpose" and that they are recording the phone call as well as they need to verify that speaking to the right person by either the last four of your Social or date of birth they can speak to no one about this debt other than you or your husband or wife. Anything less is breaking a law also let them know that from this point forward you wish to have them cease and desist phone calls and all interaction with you will be done through the mail at the address you provide they may say that you have to have that in writing ask him for the fax number and then write out the written request of cease and desist or mail it whatever. Also demand all documentation pertinent to the debt they are collecting on in terms of the balance owed dates anyting and have make them validated that as well.
He has invoices and text communications. Don't know if that will be enough to be worth the fight on our end or try to negotiate with him directly to maybe reduce the amount owed avoiding debt collection entirely.
I'm not certain what you're asking, but to clarify the point I was making, the FDCPA only applies to third party debt collectors, though some states have laws that are similar to the FDCPA and also apply to original creditors.
