Very nice writeup! I recall brain surgery (the partial or complete severing of the corpus callosum) still being in use as last resort for very extreme cases of epilepsy. Was this pioneered alongside things like lobotomy or is it a product of a later time?
Oh boy, I get to talk about my area of research! If you don't mind, I'm going to lump the end of the 19th century in with the first half of the 20th because they're a bit hard to separate and the really fascinating stuff moved past theoretical in the second half of that century-long period. I'm also going to answer this in chunks because I have a lot of holiday things to do.
Psychosurgery did not die with the lobotomy. With the advent of brain imaging and improved microsurgical techniques, it is now possible to target brain tissue by the millimeter, which, as it turns out, can be an effective if last-resort treatment for certain mental illnesses. It is used by one hospital in the US (Massachusetts General) for treatment of medication-refractory intractable mood, anxiety, and OCD disorders. Outside of the US it's used for all of those and even eating disorders. It is not, however, effective on the disorders it was initially designed for (schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders).
The end of the 19th century brought about a new concept in care for the mentally ill - treatment. Prior to the early 1800's, lunatic asylums were just warehouses for the mentally ill. If you relatives could not afford the time/energy/money to manage you and your symptoms at home, you were sent to an asylum, essentially for storage. There was no evaluation, no treatment plan, no plans to eventually send you home, nothing. There were procedures you might undergo (various types of hydrotherapy, straight-jacket style options, isolation) but that was really all geared towards control during your confinement. Even the expensive, private asylums for the upper classes were basically storage facilities. They were significantly nicer to live in, but there was no treatment as we know it today.
Around the early- to mid-1800's, as medical care overall progressed, people began to consider that, like "physical" health problems, maybe the secrets of mental health problems could be unlocked and solved. The change in attitude started with the private institutions for the elite but trickled down. Mental hospitals were dangerously overcrowded, a better option was needed.
Coming up - the explosion of somatic treatments for mental illness, including some really radical ideas.
As medical care progressed, the late 19th century-early 20th century saw a renewed interest in mental health care, and mirroring the rest of medicine, the interest went from management to treatment, with the belief that the mysteries of the human mind be unlocked and that with the proper treatment people could and would be cured. This time period, the period just before pharmacological innovations changed the face of mental health treatment, wasn't always linear, but it was very much inspired by what scientists were learning about the human body.
It would be difficult to list every single treatment that was designed and implemented during the pre-pharmacology years. If you want a deep dive, I recommend the book Great and Desperate Cures by the late Dr. Elliot Valenstein. Valenstein left no stone unturned in his exploration of the time period and it's a very readable book, regardless of your experience with the material. I can definitely cover some of the larger, more widespread treatments that were being tried at that time.
So-called "shock therapy" was one of the most widespread treatment modalities of the period. The basic concept was that you could get a patient to "reset" if you caused a significant enough shock to their system. Doctors had seen that patients sometimes experienced temporary relief from their symptoms after some kind of significant somatic illness or trauma. Doctors had long used hydrotherapy "shock" patients into compliance, so now they turned to medicine to provide that shock. Initially, high-fevers were used. Called pyrotherapy, doctors would artificially induce high-fevers through by intentionally infecting their patients with diseases like malaria. Other methods were derived. There was insulin coma therapy, where doctors would use insulin overdoses to bring patients into a comatose state repeatedly for days or weeks at a time. Also popular were treatments that involved inducing convulsions. This included Cardiazol shock therapy and eventually the most prolific of the shock therapies, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). ECT is still used today, although not to induce convulsions. (Convulsions are actually suppressed with a muscle relaxant.) ECT was much safer than treatments involving Cardiazol, insulin comas, and malaria.
Freeman was not satisfied with the leucotomy procedure. It was brain surgery. You needed anesthesia and a hospital's surgical room, the leucotomes frequently broke apart in the patient's head, it was expensive and time-consuming and most importantly, he couldn't do it. You needed a neurosurgeon. All of these were barriers to widespread use and Freeman truly believed that this could revolutionize the treatment of patients warehoused in mental asylums. He wanted something faster, easier, and cheaper, something that could be available to all of the overcrowded mental hospitals across the country.
By the late 19th century, psychiatrists, anatomists, and researchers had figured out that cognition was the product of the brain. Once they had that figured out - which was a big step, it was long thought to be seated in the heart - it wasn't a big leap to connect lunacy (mental illness) with the brain. And with unintentional brain injuries like those sustained by , neurologists and psychiatrists had clear evidence that 1) brain function was divided up into multiple areas and 2) the brain could still function overall despite injury to and/or destruction of some of those parts. Most importantly (for psychiatrists) was the revelation that changes to the brain could result in changes in behavior.
Doctors and researchers started to zone in on the frontal lobe as having a significant degree of control over emotions and behavior. A scientist at Yale, John Fulton, started exploring this with chimpanzees by performing frontal lobectomies - completely removing their frontal lobes. This idea was picked up by a Portuguese neurologist by the name of Egas Moniz. Moniz had more or less captive human test subjects from a local mental hospital and he started refining surgery on the frontal lobes as a way to control mental illness. Seeing the drastic changes that occurred in frontal lobectomies, he experimented until he came up with his final product, the prefrontal leucotomy. In this procedure, a number of cores of frontal-parietal brain tissue were removed by a device called a leucotome with the end goal being the easing or complete absence of a patients psychological symptoms/disorder. It is this procedure, for which Moniz would later win the Nobel Prize in Medicine. (His use of non-consenting mental patients as test subjects was swept under the rug).
The ingredient that made psychosurgery widespread and even a household name was actually an American psychiatrist named Walter Freeman. Despite not even inventing the procedure, or even being able to perform it (he was a psychiatrist, not a neurosurgeon), Freeman is considered the father of psychosurgery. He teamed up with a neurosurgeon named James Watts and started offering this procedure to his patients, and colleague's patients, and to local mental hospitals. He was quite the self-promoter, so much so that patients' families started reaching out to him. One of these families, the Kennedys - yes those Kennedys - paid him to try this procedure on a member of their family with what we would now call intellectual and developmental disabilities. Rosemary Kennedy underwent a prefrontal leucotomy and it was a disaster. With brain imaging decades away, sometimes surgeons cut too much, and that is precisely what happened to Ms. Kennedy. She became completely debilitated and never recovered. This was an adverse consequence that doctors just accepted as a risk.
And so the frontal lobotomy was born. The story goes that one day Watts walked into the offices he shared with Freeman to find Freeman hovering over an unconscious patient with what appeared to be an ice pick inserted into her brain via the inner orbit of her eye. Watts was horrified and never worked with Freeman again.
Now a free agent, Freeman was able to refine his procedure and sell it to the world. I think most people are familiar with the details of the procedure, but just in case, it can be described as thus: you anesthetize a patient with ECT and insert a surgical instrument called an orbitoclast into the corner of the patient's eye, break through the orbital wall, insert the orbitoclast into the frontal lobes, and swing it to destroy the white matter connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain. How you swing it and how much you swing it depends on the patient and their particular symptoms.
