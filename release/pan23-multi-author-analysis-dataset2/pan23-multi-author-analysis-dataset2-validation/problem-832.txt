Subsequently, they did, in fact, come and get your car shortly there after and, without having a destination from you, took it back to their lot.
Does it matter that my request went from the initial insurance company, to a 3rd party service, who in turn hired a local tow company to do the tow. I never spoke to the actual company who towed. No one would ask them to bring to their tow lot and charge them.
Hmmm I see what you mean. If this wasn't a tow service, would it change anything. Like if I said to my neighbor hey, come take my car and they did, would that be theft?
Let's say I called you and asked you to moved my headphones from the car to my house but instead you take them home and keep them. Then you call me later and say I have your headphones, give me money or I'll sell them.
But that's not what happened here. You didn't tell them to take the car to your house or anywhere else- just to come get it from where it was.
So you called me and said "Hey, I left my headphones at McDonalds, can you go grab them before someone steals them? I'll meet up with you later to pick them up.".
