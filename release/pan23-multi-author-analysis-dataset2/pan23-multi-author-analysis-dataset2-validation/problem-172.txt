Hi there - we're happy to approve your question related to your creative project, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists and the like, based on past experience: some people working on creative projects have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what's needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it's not always what you want to hear.
Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you're asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don't know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.
If you're already part-way through an enterprise of such ambition, I imagine that you're aware that our knowledge of Pictland in this period is, to put it mildly, hazy. No single native Pictish chronicle or history has survived, which means that our knowledge of the inhabitants of much of Scotland in this period depends very largely on a combination of archaeological discoveries (which, by their very nature, are largely unhelpful when it comes to establishing things such as definitive geographies and chronologies) and the few details available to us in a few disconnected lines from Irish manuscripts and an occasional entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, together with some medieval poetry. All of these written references date to at least a few decades, and often many centuries, after the fact. Talorc, the ruler in whom you're interested, is essentially nothing more to us now than a name on a king-list; we know nothing of either his character or his reign. As for Pictland, the most that non-specialists in the period generally think they understand comes from Bede's reference to a people divided into two main groups: St Columba, in the Ecclesiastical History, went to "preach the word of God in the lands of the Northern Picts," which "are by steep and rugged mountain separated from their southern regions" – suggesting what's become a generally familiar early medieval geography in which the northern Pictish people inhabited what are now the Scottish highlands, while their southern brethren lived in central Scotland alongside the British kingdom long centred on Strathclyde and the Gaels of Dál Riata in Argyll.
Thanks to some important developments in the historiography of the Picts over the past two decades, however, it is now possible to say something worthwhile and fundamentally new in connection with the Pictish geography you're enquiring about, as well as about the Picts' relationship with the Northumbrians. In the former case, the key paper that you ought to be interested in is Alex Woolf's highly influential redrawing of the Pictish kingdoms in an article for the Scottish Historical Review published in 2006. Woolf's chief interest in this work is not the old, crude division of the Picts into northern and southern branches, but rather a finer-grained enquiry into the location of the most important kingdom of this period, a polity referred to in the sources as "Fortriu", which he refers to as "the core territory of Pictavia" and relocates from the lowland location suggested by earlier generations of historians to the vicinity of modern Inverness. Since Woolf wrote, Noble has added the important suggestion that Fortriu was likely centred on a hill-fort stronghold known as Craig Phadrig, which is a little to the west of Inverness. All this, I think, makes Fortriu the most likely location for the Pictish kingdom you are imagining, and the vitrified fort at the best candidate for the royal "seat" you are interested in, so it seems well worth recapping Woolf's arguments for you here.
If we review Woolf's argument for relocating Fortriu, we can see that it has three main planks. The first is art-historical, and draws on Isabel Henderson's 1958 argument that the focal point of the highly distinctive Pictish sculptural tradition can be located somewhere around the head of the Moray Firth. The second is tied to the location of the most significant battle of this period, one that I expect you are already quite familiar with: the Battle of Nechtansmere, fought between the Picts and the invading Northumbrians in 685, which resulted in a decisive Pictish victory, the death of the Northumbrian king Ecgfrith, and the temporary collapse of his powerful kingdom.
The battle-site of Nechtansmere was long identified, again by place-name evidence, as Dunnichen in Angus, in the Scottish lowlands, but Woolf astutely points out that this location, which is characterised by gently rolling low hills, is an incredibly poor fit for the spot mentioned by Bede, in which the Picts were able to hide an entire army from their opponents in "some narrow passes in the midst of inaccessible mountains". Woolf instead points to a second place-name clearly associated with the contemporary term "Dún Nechtain": Dunachton in Inverness-shire, which lies in the Mondah Ruadh mountain range, south of Loch Ness. I included photos of these two locations in an essay that I wrote on Nechtansmere a few years ago that you might like to review – , it's hard to imagine that Woolf is not right about the correct location of this battle, and that Ecgfrith and his Northumbrians were invading what is now Moray, in the Scottish highlands, not Angus, in the lowlands.
Thirdly, Woolf also goes into some interesting, if technical, detail about the linguistic and historical evidence for Fortriu provided by other extant sources. The Annals of Ulster, for instance, notes that Bredei son of Beli – a man noted as the "king of Fortriu", and remembered today as perhaps the greatest of the Pictish kings – "destroyed" the Orkney Islands in a raid in 682. Such an expedition, he points out, ties in to Adomnán's brief mention of an Orcadian subregulus at the Pictish court of Bredei son of Meilocon in the 6th century, and certainly seems to make much greater sense if we located Bredei son of Beli's kingdom in the north than it would if Pictland was centred somewhere in the Scottish lowlands.
Woolf is able to link this fragment to a prototype Scottish regnal list which locates Dub's death at Forres, and states that his body was then hidden under the bridge at Kinloss, both of which are locations on the Moray Firth close to Findhorn, once again fairly close to modern Inverness.
Taking all of this together, then, the majority of historians of early Scotland, led by Alex Woolf, now tend to accept that the most important of the Pictish kingdoms, Fortriu, was located in the Highlands around the area of the Moray Firth, and it's certainly possible that the chief stronghold of its rulers was at Craig Phadrig, although if for any reason that identification does not suit you, the location currently occupied by Urquhart Castle, which is , has also been suggested as the major stronghold of the kings of Fortriu.
Lastly, and in relation to your enquiry as to the political status of Fortriu and Pictland relative to the Bernicians/Northumbrians to the south, control over a polity as far away from the Northumbrian heartlands as Fortriu was probably patchy and nominal at best throughout this period. Bede (who was, we need to remember, himself a proud Northumbrian) does tell us that the Picts paid tribute to Oswy, but Fraser (writing before the significance of Woolf's work on Pictish geography had really percolated through the ranks of historians of early medieval Scotland) suggests, based on his reading of the Vita sancti Cuthberti (c.700) that the focal point of Northumbrian power in Scotland in this period was probably in lowland Fife, much further to the south than Fortriu. He also notes that Oswy's fragile imperium was a sprawling one, stretching as far south as the Thames and as far west as Lancashire. Most of these territories were significantly richer than Fortriu would have been, so it seems doubtful that even a king of Oswy's power would have devoted much of his attention to the northernmost portions of his area of influence, and certainly the Northumbrians lacked anything remotely describable as a bureaucracy capable of actually exerting significant control over dependent areas – really, influence in those days was a matter of invasion, or fear of invasion, not of some sort of permanent quasi-colonial power. Moreover, Oswy himself suffered several significant reversals of fortune during your period, not least in 651 and 655, when the Mercian king Penda invaded his Northumbrian heartlands.

Fortriu, to begin with, remains almost entirely unknown to us. Woolf counts a total of 13 passing references to this name and to its main variants in the Irish chronicle-record, the first of which dates to 664. Almost all of these references are mere notes of the accession or deaths or kings who are described as rex Fortreinn or Fortrenn.
