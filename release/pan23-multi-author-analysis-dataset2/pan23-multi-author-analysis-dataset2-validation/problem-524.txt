Well, 1st people say they are going to sue for lots of things. Few actually retain an attorney and actually move forward with a case.
If you are actually served with papers, then you'd need an attorney. But that's really unlikely to occur.
And in all honesty I wish this was all fabricated because it's put me in a great deal of worry. I absolutely adore my boyfriend we've spent near 4 years together toughing it out long distance and we still are. He treats him like he's broken or his opinion has no meaning. Just today she told him that "autistic people don't make great decisions" and I'm absolutely furious about it. She's super quick to shut him down and will try to feed him lies like I'm only dating him for disability money or that I'm not into him and to be very honest I'm appalled. I wouldn't be fighting so hard for him if that's all I wanted or I didn't like him all that much and truth be told we make each other want to grow as people.
If you exaggerated for the purpose of 'spicing' up your posts, not advisable but even that would have to have lots of extraneous and harmful information to be a problem.
I don't have any advice, just wanted to clarify for others that may be able to help -- it's your boyfriend's mom that's threatening to sue you, correct?
She's a manager somewhere but I never really mentioned her name. I think I may have used my boyfriend's first name maybe once but his first name is super common.
The stories I would share was witnessed while on call with him and honestly she's super possessive of him. He's been so down over all this lately too and I just hate seeing him so upset.
Like she said I'm manipulative and I literally had to take a step back. Ask myself if she's right. At the end of the day I decided no it's not manipulative for us to want a future together especially away from her. She said the only way we can work is if I move and come to them and I refused because me and my boyfriend know we don't want to live in that type of situation.
