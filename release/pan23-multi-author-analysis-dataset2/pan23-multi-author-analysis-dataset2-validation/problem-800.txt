Insurance defense attorney here. People grossly underestimate the cost to repair vehicles based on photos, especially nowadays. It is highly unlikely that USAA is taking advantage of you (full disclosure: I have USAA insurance and have found them to be a honest organization).
I’m sure you have a point but you don’t know the car or the damages and your experience with Usaa does not speak for everyone. I’m sorry but seeing the car for myself and knowing car body shop friends the cost of those damages is at least a little inflated. There’s also a 2k rental car charge because it took them 45 days to repair it?
Hey I appreciate you letting me know. Sorry for dipping into your pockets I really am. It’s sucks and I only did that to save myself money because of how much I was struggling so instead of maki me feel worse don’t say anything at all.
Get out of here if you just want me to feel bad. I came here to seek help and that’s how you talk to people? I’m not being selfish I was just trying to survive.
You know what’s unfair? When someone drives without insurance and hits someone else. Every uninsured driver on the roads raises my insurance rates so stop being selfish and stealing from me. You are not being charged more because you didn’t have insurance. You are being charged for the amount of damage you caused, no more and no less.
First is to stop paying the debt, in which case you will likely be sued. You can then hire a lawyer which would cost you several thousand dollars or you can try and defend yourself while going up against USAA’s lawyers. You will have to take multiple days off of work at your new job to handle all the legal wrangling of the case. Your only defense will be the charges appear to be overinflated. How are you going to prove that? They will submit repair estimates from a licensed adjuster and/or a licensed repair shop who actually examined and repaired the car. Your defense will be “I know a guy” who owns a body shop and based on the pictures at the accident scene, this seems inflated. You will say 45 days is unreasonable for a rental car and they will show receipts that the car was actually in the shop for 45 days. You will lose in court and you will be responsible for paying the entire amount of the judgment immediately. There is also a chance you will have to pay USAA’s attorney fees for the lawsuit. Also immediately. If you have $20-$25K cash to pay that judgement immediately, then you can risk it for the remote likelihood of getting a few thousand dollars knocked off the bill. But If you can’t pay the entire judgment right after the verdict, then you will be in default and USAA will then go after your assets, garnish your wages and they will report this your credit record where it will stay for a long time.
Your Second option is to keep paying in installment payments the amount you already agreed to and avoid all of the above.
2) Don’t try to save a few bucks by driving without insurance, and you won’t ever have to worry about any of the above.
You say that I won’t have a case but let’s say I get several claims specialist to also quote me on the price of the damages based on photos. Let’s say the quote is a few thousand dollars less. You don’t think the judge will side with me when they see that other real specialists are quoting me a significantly lower price? You don’t think they will ask USAA to pay for an inflated price (if it’s true) and for court fees, financial burden, time and emotion stress?
That’s because USAA has no need to play ball with you. They could have taken you to court themselves, but decided it wasn’t worth their time, so they were polite and sent you to collections instead of going after a judgement. You can fight this, but you’re bringing no weapon to a war. And you’re at fault for the accident , so you’re the villain. Sorry.
It was and I feel horrible for it. I really do. I made a mistake and I’m paying for it. Its worth investigating whether I’m paying too much. It’s a lot of money.
2) USAA has actually expended that money in this case based on the good faith estimates of the shop who fixed it. The judge will find the costs they submit are reasonable and appropriate based on the evidence. Just because you can find a lower one after the fact is not going to weigh in your favor. You have the benefit of unlimited time to search. They need to start the repair process as promptly as possible after the accident. A judge is not going to penalize the innocent party after the fact.
Do the photos include pictures of what’s under the visible damage? Maybe you bent a frame? Caused mechanical damage? You have no idea of knowing the true damages based off of photos.
1) it is impossible to make an accurate quote based on photos only. You have no idea what the damage underneath the “skin” is based on those pics. A judge (or jury) will side with the adjuster/repair shop guy who actually inspected the car, not the guy who only looked at a few pictures of the car.
I bet those other drivers thought it was a bit unfair when you caused an accident that damaged both their cars. I hope they had uninsured driver coverage.
Hmmm the thing is they have sent it to a collection agency to collect from me already and I already agreed to start paying because I thought it was for the high damaged car. Also, I have a ton of debt and low income but I just received a 70k a job that I will be starting soon.
Yeah I mean it was like a 2012 Acura but still the damage just seems so minor. They were able to drive off fine. The front bumper was scratched and dented slightly. I just don’t believe it. There was also a 2k rental car charge because the damages took them 45 days to repair.
