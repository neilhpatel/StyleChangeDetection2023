If they put in written material, diagrams or photos they can ask the other person cease and desist using copyrighted works were transferred only for non-commercial use.
Without a contract specifying who held the copyright it is entirely possible a court could consider the seller to also own the copyright as well due to the editing you just described. You'd have to see a copyright attorney over that to do that kind of evaluation.
So there a couple options here, one is a lot cheaper than the other, but not necessarily what they want.
The cheaper option is to treat this person as another copyright holder and the 5 just sue for the profits of the sales. This can be done in small claims and is relatively cheap to do so for courts. The owners of the copyright all deserve an equal share of the profits of the sale. But acknowledging the seller as one of the copyright holders means losing control. Without a contract, any of the copyright holders can do what they want, donate, sell, set on fire, make a sequel, whatever. The 5 lose the ability to stop the seller from doing what they want, but they get a share of whatever profits they can dig out of the seller.
The second option is for the 5 to assert they are the only copyright holders. This is obviously a lot riskier to do to the lack of contract. In this posture, the 5 can DMCA takedown any digital infringement. But to sue over copyright infringement means registering the work with the US Copyright Office and bringing suit in Federal Court. The costs of this are fuck huge. A copyright suit in federal court with a copyright attorney can easily cost 150k+. And if the court decides the seller counts as a sixth author, then they're out the money and possibly the seller's attorney costs - so $300k+. Chances are things go to settlement, but even if that happens the 5 are looking at likely 30k+. No guarantee the seller will settle.
