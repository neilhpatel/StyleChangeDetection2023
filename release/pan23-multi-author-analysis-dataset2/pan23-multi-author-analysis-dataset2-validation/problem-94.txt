Also, don't get into all the rumors about her shady dealings when you call. Keep it short, give them the details about the children that you and your husband personally witnessed. Everything else is outside their realm and irrelevant the the children's safety.
Yeah, I dont want them to think it's a false report. Just based on their history I found on google and the sketchy stuff I have seen there I'm just not sure who or if I should make a call. Is there a local number or national one I should call.
If you’re getting red flags, give a call. Let CPS do the work on figuring out if there is further action needed. You were doing your due diligence based on the flags that went up for you and nobody should fault you for that.
Let me answer your question with another question; If you drive by in the dark next to a construction zone and are a light giving off the look of a fire instead of a safety light, would you call the fire department?
That happened to me recently and I never found out I’d the light was a fire or not but I know that I’d rather have called on a false alarm than known my call could have stopped a potential accident.
Yeah I just moved my horse elsewhere a few days ago without ing her the real reasons because they kept expressing a ton of interest and saying that they wanted to trade or buy my horse. I was starting to worry my horse would end up "missing" with how bad they seemed to want him and with their last history didn't want him stolen and moved somewhere then told that he ran off...
