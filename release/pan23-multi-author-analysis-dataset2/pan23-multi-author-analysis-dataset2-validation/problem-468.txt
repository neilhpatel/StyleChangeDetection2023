Looking specifically at this. Per the CARES Act, she would have only received anything from the CARES Act / "Stimulus Checks" / "Economic Impact Payments" if you were a dependent under the age of 17, and then it would have only been $500.00. Since you are over that age, the main way you got the $1,200.00 was because you filed independent in 2019 (or 2018, if 2019 had not been filed yet as of the point they issued the credit last spring). If you were claimed as a dependent, over the age of 16, in whichever year they referenced, the payment would have been zero.
That being said-- that doesn't impact the tax benefits she might have received in general to claim you as a dependent, so again specifically I am just looking at the CARES Act and the Economic Impact Payments from last year.
If you were able to be claimed by another taxpayer during the tax year in question, you should refile indicating that another taxpayer could claim you.
If you legitimately were an independent per the IRS rules, you don’t have to do much. Respond to a lawsuit if you are summoned (though this isn’t lawsuit material), respond to the IRS if you receive a notice from them.
