If they refuse to leave you will need to evict them. If you have never done this before hiring an eviction attorney to handle it is a good idea. There are some things where if you miss a deadline or do something wrong end with you starting the process over. Many eviction attorneys will handle this for a flat fee.
If that was in the written notice, go to court to file for eviction. Once you win, then you'll arrange for a sheriff with a court order to remove them.
There are at least two relevant moratoriums, with one being struck down recently. The Maryland-specific one is based on COVID-19 hardship, if they cannot pay rent due to some COVID-19 reason and you are evicting them for nonpayment of rent.
>Governor Larry Hogan issued an emergency order that prohibits Maryland courts from ordering the eviction of any tenant who can show that their failure to pay rent was the result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Examples include losing employment, needing to care for a school-aged child, or being diagnosed with COVID-19.
Their financial issues existed pre-covid so I doubt the MD one applies. Didn't think it'd come to this so I'm only vaguely familiar with the federal version. Heard it's expiring, and recall hearing it was recently struck down. Will get on it Monday I guess.
