I follow your logic and I agree that if they hadn't broken the law by driving without a license the vehicle wouldn't have been where it was and that accident wouldn't have cared. Legally, it makes no difference for your civil liability in the accident though.
The issue of the vehicle having no insurance and her having no driver's license has nothing to do with you. The issue of her driving a vehicle that wasn't hers isn't an issue at all unless the car was stolen.
I said feel because she was driving without license and a car that wasn't hers. Even if she was driving a car that wasn't stolen she was still driving a car she was uninsured for, and unlicensed to drive meaning she shouldn't have been on the roads in the first place.
Driving without a license or insurance are reasons for her to get ticketed by the police. Which I agree, she should be.
I get it, it's frustrating. She was doing something that she wasn't supposed to be doing. But... you hit her. The law is pretty clear-cut on that front.
