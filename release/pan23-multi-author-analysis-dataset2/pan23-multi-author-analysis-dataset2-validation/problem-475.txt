Is there some reason to believe the state health department has asked these providers to do otherwise?
The state stipulates that COVID vaccine providers must follow CDC guidelines. When they are outright denying the vaccine to 1a individuals who are not “their patients” and instead giving it to lower priority “their patients”, they are failing to follow the guidelines. There is currently no other vaccination option in my state, so those who can’t go through them, get nothing, even if they are first responders or otherwise high risk as defined in 1a. They are misappropriating a taxpayer-subsidized vaccine for their own profit.
If you’re a qualified epidemiologist I guess you can seek appointment to whatever role oversees your state health department or their vaccination program.
There’s nothing wrong with doctors giving treatment only to their patients. That’s usually how healthcare works.
I don’t know anyone who would say this rollout has been perfect. But giving doctors medicine to give their patients isn’t really how it has gone wrong.
The people who decided to give those doctors the vaccines are better qualified to decide how to proceed than you. It’s totally fair for you to ask questions. You have medical policy questions not legal ones. But unless someone qualified addressed your concern I think your judgment about those decisions is premature.
The health system leadership is not following CDC guidelines in their decisions about who gets the vaccine. This violates their vaccine distribution agreement with the state and the state should absolutely take them to court over this. These decisions are shutting out a large portion of the state population from getting a vaccine they are otherwise qualified to get. In the middle of a pandemic. This is going to cost lives. This is very wrong.
You don’t understand. This situation does not involve decisions made by individual physicians. People who do not already belong to one of the three major health systems in my state can’t even make an appointment to receive the vaccine. They are being turned away before even their eligibility is determined or they have a chance to speak with a doctor, or even a nurse. If you are not a part of the system you are automatically shut out. This is a decision made at the top within these companies by people who don’t see patients.
