OP, this means that your father was sued over the debt and that he lost. That means that the issue of limitations periods is irrelevant, at least for the moment: garnishment only happens after the issue is heard by the courts and decided. Depending on how he got here, that might be fixable, or it might mean he now needs to contend with the debt in full.
Did your father receive any paperwork from the courts, or have any unexpected visitors with paperwork for him in the last year or so, prior to this writ of garnishment?
He hadn't received any paperwork from courts or unexpected visitors about this case until this recent one. He also hasn't gone to court for this case either.
It's reasonably likely that your father can have the judgment set aside for lack of service of process. He had a right to be notified when the creditor began legal action towards him. As they were able to locate him to serve him with notice of the garnishment order, presumably they could have located him earlier, as well.
Given the amount in question here, I'd strongly recommend he talk to a lawyer. He can get a referral from the , or from any of a number of other places. In a pinch, even Google works.
Okay, thanks for taking your time to help me with this by the way. I appreciate it. A lot of times, he'll tell me he's 100% sure about something and it's just wrong. If I find out something I said on here was incorrect, can I ask you for a new opinion based on the new information?
Whether that's worth doing will depend heavily on other factors, which his lawyer can review. The end result of setting aside the judgment is that the case will be heard a second time, with him (and his lawyer) in attendance the second time around. That only helps him if he could win the suit or at least marginally defend the plaintiff's claims: if the lawsuit was only filed more than three years after his last payment, for example, setting aside the judgment would give him the time he needs to make the argument that the debt was past the limitations period and that the courts should not order it enforced.
If the outcome of a second hearing on the issue will be that your father is still likely to lose and still likely to face garnishment, then setting aside the judgement might be throwing good money after bad. If that's his lawyer's advice, he may still be able to negotiate with the creditor to set up a payment plan instead of facing garnishment.
If your post is an update and asks no new legal questions, it's generally allowed but will be locked.
I can't speak for the moderators, but in general this sub is pretty open to follow-up posts. Try to consolidate your questions into a single new post, instead of spreading them out, and do link back to this post so that people can follow the chain of events.
Well, the statute of limitations is 12 apparently 3 years (that's why you listen to the person with the "Quality Contributor" flair) unless action has been done to renew it.
If that represents an insurmountable debt, he might be able to file for his own bankruptcy and include it in the debts to be discharged, but $17k on its own is a very small amount to declare bankruptcy over and I doubt it'd be worth the impact and cost.
This is one of the risks you take when you co-sign a loan and is the reason that having a co-signer makes the borrower a better credit risk: there's a second person to take the hit if the borrower defaults. Had the borrower not declared bankruptcy, your father could have pursued them in small claims after paying to try to get his money back, but I expect that option was closed off. If the debt was discharged in bankruptcy, then they aren't obligated to pay it any more - but your father still is.
Your dad is responsible for the debt. If they declare bankruptcy and are absolved from the debt then your dad is solely responsible for it.
What is his location and what kind of debt is it? If you're lucky the statue of limitations to collect may almost be up.
Loans where the creditor is out of state may be handled under the other state's laws, which may have a longer limitations period. However, ten years is a long time.
Certain loans, such as student loans, are special-cased in the law and may not expire the way a private loan would.
Most debts in Maryland have a limitations period of three years, so the creditors may no longer be _able_ to enforce the debt simply due to lack of action.
Secured loans, where the creditor has a right to collect against the property of the borrowers and guarantors, need to be handled with care.
Is the loan still listed on his credit history? I would expect that if nothing has happened with the loan in ten years, it'll have fallen off the report. If so, and if it's past the limitations period, your father may well be safe from that debt in most ways that count.
He's saying he co-signed it in 2006 and he brought it up because we got court papers in the mail 2-3 days ago, it wasn't a student loan, and it was in Maryland. He's saying it might be a secured loan, but he's not 100% sure.
