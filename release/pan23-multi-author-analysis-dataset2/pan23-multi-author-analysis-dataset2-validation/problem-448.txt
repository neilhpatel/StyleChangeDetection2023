Many animals from what we call today the "charismatic megafauna" - big cats, elephants, ostriches etc. - from Africa and India were known in Europe since Antiquity. Menageries had been maintained in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East for centuries, and European emperors, kings, princes, cities, and even religious institutions^1 kept this tradition in the Middle Ages for the same reasons: prestige, entertainment, hunting, and diplomacy. Exotics animals were routinely trafficked: in the 13-15th centuries, for instance, giraffes were captured in Africa and sold throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle East, with some ending up in India and China (Buquet, 2012). The trade also involved animals from other areas such as brown bears, polar bears, or reindeers.
Starting with Charlemagne, who purchased monkeys from Italy (we have the customs receipts) and owned an elephant (gift of Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid), one could say that a menagerie was a regular feature of a royal or imperial treasure.
Menageries were not modern zoos that could be visited by the general public: they were kept in private estates and typically opened to high-ranking visitors, sometimes in elaborate shows meant to impress them. However, menageries were also used for public propaganda, and there are many instances of exotic animals being paraded in the streets by a travelling court (and courts travelled a lot). In the early 12th century, in the city of Caen, Normandy, monk Raoul Tortaire witnessed on market day a parade by Henry I of England, Duke of Normandy (who had a menagerie in Caen), that included a "fierce Ethiopian", a lion, a leopard/cheetah on a horse, a lynx, a camel, and an ostrich. The parade was attended by an admirative (and occasionally frightened) "multitude" (Loisel, 1912). Tortaire describes the ostrich as follows:
What species of animals were kept? A recent survey of the inventories of twenty European menageries from the Carolingians to the 15th century in England, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain gave the following results (Buquet, 2013):
In 1235, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II took his large menagerie across the Alps for his marriage to Isabella of England. People in Italian (Ravenna, Cremona, Padua, Sienna) and German (Worms) cities were awed by the Emperor's pet cheetahs (that he used for hunting), dromedaries, elephants, monkeys... and his Arab soldiers (note how, like in Normandy, exotic human beings were part of the show). The arrival of Louis IX's elephant in London in 1255 was greeted by a large crowd. Lorenzo de' Medici's giraffe was exhibited several times, including in one very public event in the streets of Fano in 1487, where people could feed it bread, fruit and onions from their windows (Buquet, 2013).
Giraffes were known but less common (they seem to have had trouble surviving transport). The status of zebras in uncertain: unnamed "striped she-asses” were given as presents to the kings Alfonso X of Castile and João I of Portugal in the 13th and 15th centuries while unidentified wild equids called zebros were mentioned in those countries (Nores et al., 2015). Rhinoceroces, hippopotamuses and crocodiles did not appear in live form until the Renaissance (Buquet, 2013). Tigers were well known by Romans (they are accurately depicted in Roman art, such as the Antioch mosaics) but became legendary in the Middle Ages and their appearance was more or less forgotten. Tigers only resurfaced as living animals in the late 15th century in Italy, possibly bought from Constantinople markets (Wille, 2010). It is important to note that medieval Europeans did not consider panthers/leopards (Panthera pardus) and cheetahs (Acynonix jubatus) to be different species, unlike people in the Arab world, Persia or India where cheetahs were commonly domesticated (Buquet, 2011).
French kings maintained two menageries in Paris from the 1330s to the 1490s, one in the Louvre and another in Hotel Saint-Pol, in addition to the menageries in their provincial estates and to that of Vincennes (Loisel, 1912; Bournon, 1880). One of the last leoniers of the Saint-Pol menagerie was a Miss Marie Padbon, who was paid 250 livres by Louis XI for keeping and feeding his lions (Sauval, 1724). The locals were certainly aware of the lions: in 1490, a carpenter named Gazeau who lived near the Hotel Saint Pol ("Hotel of the King's lions") was seriously bitten by a young lion and sued the current leoniers, a couple named Sabrevoys. Gazeau claimed that the servants of the Sabrevoys had forgotten to close the door of the yard where the lions were playing, letting them escape in the neighbourhood, and that he had been bitten when trying to capture a lion (he said that he had put his hand in the lion's mouth and grasped the tongue). The Sabrevoys claimed that Gazeau had for some reason entered the yard, attacked one of the lions, and was bitten in self-defense, as brute animals are allowed to do (que defensio conceditur animalibus brutis). How the suit ended is not known (Mandrot, 1906).
Having a menagerie was a status symbol. Those animals were expensive and came from faraway lands. The owners of menageries used them to display their wealth, but also their power and international influence. Exotic animals were either purchased (and sometimes ordered) from traders or they could be diplomatic gifts from (or exchanges with) foreign princes. French king Louis IX famously gave the elephant he had brought back from the Crusades to English king Henri III in 1255.
Parades were not the only occasions when common people could see strange animals. Some princes organized Roman-style public fights pitting animals against each other (like in Florence in 1459 for the visit of Pope Pius II, Ringmar, 2006). Others, like Frederic II, used animals for hunting, domesticated cheetahs particularly. In addition, menageries required people to take care of the animals (the leoniers in France), as well as traders or farmers to provide feed. Much of our knowledge of medieval menageries actually comes from the bills paid to carers and feed providers! In Northern France in the 14-15th centuries, the menagerie of the Duke of Artois kept several camels in Hesdin, and a local miller provided them with bran. Official accounts show that more money was spent feeding the birds kept in the menagerie than on feeding the "poor prisoners" in the local jail (Duceppe-Lamarre, 2007).
Information about the presence of exotic animals in the daily life of medieval people remains far and between and incomplete. Still, there were many menageries, even in the countryside, and lucky commoners would have been able to see such animals from time to time, or talk to people who had seen them, or to people who took care of a menagerie. The sketchbook of Villard de Honnecourt, a craftsman or architect from the 14th century, shows animals that seem drawn from observation, including lions and a porcupine.
In any case, many people would have been familiar with animal iconography. A major source for this was the bestiaries, which were illustrated compendiums of beasts, some real, some mythical, each accompanied by a Christian moral lesson (actually the main point of the bestiaries, they were not treaties of natural history). Those bestiaries drew from older traditions and works, notably the Greek Physiologus. While the richly illuminated bestiaries that have survived today would not be available to commoners, their contents were widely known. For instance, Raoul Tortaire's description of the ostrich he sees in Caen matches that of the bestiaries of the time, which likens (negatively) this bird to people who pretend to be faithful but are not (the ostrich has wings but cannot "rise above earth"), or likens (positively) the ostrich to those who disregard material wealth and look up to the heavens (the ostrich forgets her eggs to watch the stars). Bestiaries can be linked to menageries: Philip de Thaun, an anglo-norman poet who created a famous bestiary (he came up with the name) was attached to the court of Henry I, Duke of Normandy, who owned the menagerie seen by Tortaire.
These bestiaries found their way into the general cultural environment: church sermons, allegorical literature, tales and fables, heraldry (the Elephant and Castle of the City of Coventry, and sculptures (Pastoureau, 2011). A survey of French Romanesque sculpture shows about 20 examples of sculpted elephants in churches and other monuments, some of them quite different from the real creature, other more realistic (Thibout, 1947).
So, to answer the question: a peasant could certainly recognize lions (which were represented everywhere) and probably elephants. Other animals such as camels, big spotted cats (leopard/cheetah), ostriches, monkeys, giraffes, and crocodiles (the latter were unknown in real life but were shown in bestiaries, which gave us the crocodile tears) may have been recognizable by some people. Other animals, even when they were mentioned in bestiaries (tigers, hippos), had had little to do with the actual animal so a person who would knew the name would not have recognized a real one. Zebras and rhinos were basically unknown, though there was a monoceros described as a sturdier unicorn.
Miss Padbon seems to have been an outlier, and, in the case of the Sabrevoys, while Mrs Sabrevoys was involved in feline management, it was her husband who had the title of "guard and governor of the King's lions." The three other Parisian leoniers whose names are known are men: Guillaume Séguier in 1364 at Saint-Pol, Guy Natin (father), succeeded by his son with the same name at the Louvre circa 1370. In any case, the document where Padbon is cited do not include many women on official payroll (there a couple of passementerie master workers).
You mentioned that one of the leoniers was a woman, and others were a couple. Was this sort of job commonly filledby women? Was it held to be respectable for a woman to work as a leonier?
