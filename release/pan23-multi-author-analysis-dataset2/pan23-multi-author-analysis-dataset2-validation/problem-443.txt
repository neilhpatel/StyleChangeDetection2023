The number of unreserved spots should be equal to the number of tenants who are paying for those unreserved spots, unless for some reason the lease does not guarantee a spot for that monthly fee.
Changing the availability of unreserved spots mid-lease is problematic. You are welcome to contact the property management and ask for confirmation that the change in policy can accommodate their legal obligations under the lease.
I'll add a bit of context: I did mention that it was a newly built property. When we signed our lease, over half of the units within the building were vacant. So it's entirely possible that the re-zoning accommodated the number of parking paying tenants at the time. I'll not presume bad faith in that aspect for now.
Be very careful about risking being towed. A towing company that is appropriately towing based on parking rules wouldn't generally be liable for wrongful towing. Small claims would be an option to pursue recourse for towing fees, but a judge could determine that you shouldn't have violated parking rules for any reason.
It's also entirely possible (and I'd say likely) that some residents are abusing the unreserved parking and using spots that they are not paying for. However, no enforcement for that seems to be taking place. The company has made no communication to the residents about it either as far as we can tell.
So, I suppose that in a nutshell: Keep doing what we are doing and keep writing to them every time it happens even if we get no response. Unless the the situation eventually gets sorted out, and in the case we found ourselves getting towed because of it, resort to small claims?
And in the middle of this we are stuck in this conundrum in which we want them to enforce the rules so we can make legitimate use of the space we are paying for before they star enforcing the rules on us for illegitimately resorting to use a space that we aren't entitled to.
If the property management is routinely lax on enforcing parking rules, they may eventually run afoul of contract law and be breaching the lease by charging for an amenity that can't be used due to their inaction. Repeated written requests for enforcement and clarification should be sent to property management until you get a response.
