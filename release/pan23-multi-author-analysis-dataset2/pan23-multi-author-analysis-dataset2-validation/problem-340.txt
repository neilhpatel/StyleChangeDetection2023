It sounds like you still owe them for any unpaid rent while you lived there and, perhaps, your share of rent through the end of the lease term on a rent sharing agreement. Yes. You undoubtedly owe them money.
You can. If I were your roommate, that would lead to me suing you. You might be better served to work out what you owe.
The thing is, is that they forced me to leave, they made it unbearable. I would have stayed and paid my portion of what was owed, if they didn't bully and harass me. The day i left i was cornered by 2 grown men yelling at me. As a roommate you have no legal right to evict anyone. If i treated my roommate how they treated me, no i would not expect anything from them. At that point it was MY decision to get rid of them.
You can ignore them. They can sue you. If they sue you, they have to win, and then they have to collect. If they are harassing you, report them for harassment. But they have the right to sue you.
Blocking them is not a good idea, depending on how much you owe them, their next step would be to sue in small claim court, I would advise you to avoid this by talking to them.
I understand but the person asking me for this, is relentless, they don't care that im going through financial struggle, i can hardly afford rent where i live now, how am i supposed to afford rent in 2 places...this person is not reasonable, they wouldn't work with me to try and actually help me while also paying them off....they just want to see me homeless.
I answered them but now my question is i know i pay back the rent owed but do i have to pay back the wifi? Electric? Gas? Water/Sewer? If my bame isn't on any of those bills, i could understand water/sewer but what about the others?
