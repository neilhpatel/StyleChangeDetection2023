Have you asked the surgeon what happened? Did you not receive the result through the portal? Are you certain you werenâ€™t negative on a rapid test and positive on a full test?
In any case it sounds like you are without loss to sue for. You might complain to a state board of medicine.
First, this could have been the result of incorrect data entry. Go and get tested and see what the results are. Talk to your primary care doctor.
If you were not known to be positive at the time of the surgery, who was then responsible for telling you about your results would be interesting. That's not at all to say that you shouldn't have been told, but who's at fault for your not being told could be complicated.
Figure out your covid status and file your complaint. Get vaccinated if you aren't already, six weeks after a negative test.
Chances are that your coughing after surgery was the result of having been intubated. It happens a lot. It happened to me five weeks ago. Doesn't really sound like you've suffered any harm. What is it that you want?
You might want to reach out to your county's health department. They should have been notified you were positive and gotten in touch to discuss quarantine and contact tracing.
I was coughing for several days after my surgery. If you're okay now don't sweat it. If the coughing continues, gets worst, or you have a wet sounding chest you might want to follow up. Ventilator pneumonia is a thing too. Nobody's fault, just something that sometimes happens. The risks are all covered in the informed consent that you signed.
If your hospital is in a different county from where you live you might need to get in touch with that county's health department as well.
