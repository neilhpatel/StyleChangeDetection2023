Unfortunately title ix guidance and case law haven’t addressed this situation, except where the tardiness or absence was due to a medical or other emergency related to the child. I highly doubt that not having childcare every day would count as an “emergency”, so it’s hard to say if this would be accommodated.
ETA: sometimes we don’t realize how course policies may impact students in unintended ways until a student points it out to us. It’s very possible the prof completely forgot about the conversation with your gf and was thinking only of ways to encourage timeliness more generally.
More facts might help us evaluate this situation better. Why exactly is she late to class, and what do the scheduling issues have to do with it? Is she waiting for you to return home with the car too, or just to take the child (can she take the child with her and hand off at school)? Is this a scheduling issue with daycare, like their “half day” program starts just before her class does, or she is the only bio parent so she has to be the one to check him out and hand him over to you? Did you guys sign up for the classes planning on being late, or are you specifically having issues finding babysitters right now (they might be more willing to accommodate if it’s temporary)?
Ever class period when my gf comes in a few minutes late he stops talking and makes a comment about how being punctual is important for passing his class, so my gf feels as if he is making this personal.
She should go to his office hours, rather than flagging him down after class. We are often very tired and flustered after class and just trying to get out of there quickly for the next class. So go to his office hours or email him to set up a separate meeting time.
I am not a lawyer but I am a professor. Has she talked to the prof again since he announced this change in policy? I would start there.
