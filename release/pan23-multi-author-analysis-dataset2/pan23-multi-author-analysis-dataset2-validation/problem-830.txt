Did someone within the Iranian regime make these threats?? This is blatantly threatening e terrorist attack against civilians and should be treated as such.
Your arguments have no validity here. You're living in a delusional world. You are backing the wrong horses. There is, in fact, Good vs. Evil. In the Western view, the regimes in Iran and Russia both fall into the latter category. Even Saudi Arabia doesn't find itself on that level.
My guess is they are also planning to assassinate diaspora Jews if Isreal doesn't attack. Kinda pointless to listen to people that say they want to wipe you off the earth no mater what.
To those in doubt, Iran bombed of the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1994. The car bombing made the building collapse, killed 86 (including the driver of the car bomb) and injured 300+.
EDIT: If you have seen the small cement/metal poles around Jewish buildings and schools around the world, they have become common as a measure against a car bomb running into the building after it happened in the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires.
