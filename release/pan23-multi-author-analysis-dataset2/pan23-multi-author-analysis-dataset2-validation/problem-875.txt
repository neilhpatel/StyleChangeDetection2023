I understand that part of it but it's mostly the sham/shotgun part of it that I am trying to understand. I have not been able to find any other cases that combine rule 12(b)6 with a sham/shotgun pleading motion. These are both for technical sufficiency, correct? So does that mean that the issues raised in the complaint are not in dispute?
12(b)6 doesn’t mean the issues in the complaint are not in dispute. Technically it means that even if the facts in the complaint are true, there’s still no claim upon which relief can be granted. These are filed every time and rarely succeed.
12(b)6 will be filed by defendant 99%+ times in civil litigation. Never seen or was involved with one that didn’t start with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
I understand the meaning of the 12(b)6 rule, but have not been able to find any cases where it is used in combination with a sham/shotgun pleading motion to dismiss. My understanding is that these are both issues with the technical sufficiency of the complaint. The facts and evidentiary documentation support the fact that I was not paid at the amount promised in writing not at minimum based on the number of hours I worked. My employer confirmed in the mtd that I am owed wages, claiming the underpayment was "accidental", and that I was terminated for making a complaint to my supervisor about the shortage in my paycheck. Since complaints drafted by pro se Plaintiff's are construed more leniently than those by practicing attorneys, I'm not clear on how a mtd challenging the technical sufficiency of the complaint, especially when the facts and documentation support the claims alleged, is an appropriate response.
Basically there are three ways the defendant can win a case, each requiring far more time (and money) than the last.
Later down the line and usually after some discovery, a defendant will usually file a motion for summary judgment. In this scenario a defendant will essentially say “see I told you so and the facts are not reasonably in dispute, so let’s save everyone the time and rule in my favor now.” Plaintiffs often file the same motion or a cross motion saying the opposite. (This is a very simplified explanation of an MSJ).
And the sham/shotgun part of it? I'm not sure I understand why that was added in there rather than just sticking with the failure to state a claim aspect of that's the issue. I thought sham/shotgun was more applicable to subsequent amended complaints rather than an initial complaint by a pro se plaintiff. I have not been able to find many cases with failure to state a claim and sham / shotgun together in a mtd....
<TLDR; motions to dismiss always say all of these things. 99% chance the employer’s attorney copy/pasted it from one or many previous complaints.>.
First, a motion to dismiss. Requiring little time and little money (relatively), it’s a no-lose pleading for a defendant. In a MTD and among the many other reasons I won’t list here, the defendant is basically saying “yeah I did everything he/she said I did and it didn’t amount to <cause of action in complaint.
My complaint was served 12/4 and has not progressed beyond the responsive mtd. OC obtained an extension of time to respond to the complaint by waiving service, not because I extended the offer and waiver form, but rather by way of a motion filed 6 days after the marshal served defendants. He lied and said service had not been made at that time and that he just happened to hear about the case, even though he filed a notice of appearance, coincidentally, the day of service. The rules say track two cases are supposed to file a CM report with the court and the judge issued an order saying as much after filing, but that deadline has long passed because OC refused to participate in a cm meeting with me, saying he requested a stay on all pretrial events in the mtd, pending a ruling on the mtd. No ruling on the mtd for 5 months now. I tried in good faith for several weeks to meet and confer but he refused to participate. I motioned two months ago for the court to either order participation in CM or schedule a status conference to address the issue . In response, silence.
Or it can go the distance. The judge will have decided which supported facts to believe and make a conclusion of law based on those facts. Rarely gets this far.
Thank you for the info. I have the written employment offer showing a salary of $678 a week and the pay stub showing I was only paid $185 for 3 weeks of full time work, both filed with complaint. You would think this case would be a no- brainer, but OC has acted to conceal the wage theft and retaliation for over two years now. He has lied to the court multiple times to such extent that it's clear to me that I will not be receiving a fair trial. My former employer is a dirt bag involved in criminal conduct and this attorney is on permanent retainer to clean up any legal issues that arise. Wage theft is also a common practice in his workplaces. As such, OC is a frequent flyer in courts here, and my employer is a multi-millionaire and pays OC very well for his "services" when in fact, OC is more of an accessory to crime than an advocate for justice. It seems that the judge is holding me to a higher standard of conduct than an officer of the court. I know pro se parties probably say that often just because things aren't going their way or because they lack understanding of the law and the rules, but that is not the case here.
