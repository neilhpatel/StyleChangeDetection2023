It seems pretty clear that your employer requires that you disclose to them the nature of the start up and get their written permission. There is an r/LegalAdviceIndia to which you should post.
Unless there is legislation that would prohibit or override such a term in an employment contract or agreement, then your employer can enforce that term. You would need your employer's permission to engage in business outside of your job, and if you fail to seek it (or if you go ahead with starting your business despite their refusal of permission), they can most likely discipline or terminate you. They might also be able to sue you for damages arising from your breach of contract, if there were any, though it's unlikely they would be successful unless your starting a business actually did damage them in some way (e.g. if the business competed directly with your employer, or if you used trade secrets or other insider knowledge gained from your employer or assets misappropriated from them to help your business).
Your option would essentially be to follow the terms you agreed to and ask your employer's permission to start this business, and abide by their decision, or to start it without their permission and run the risk of getting fired, and possibly sued.
