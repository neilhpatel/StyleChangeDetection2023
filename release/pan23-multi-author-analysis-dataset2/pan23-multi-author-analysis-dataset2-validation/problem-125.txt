Do we forget 2015-16 so quickly?? Trump insulted McCain saying he only liked people who hadn't been captured. People said he was done. Yeah, right. In Oct 2016 he insulted half the population of the US by saying he could grab them by their genitals with impunity. People said there was no way he could win. Yea, right, who won 2016 again?
If only there were something someone could have done to, you know, exclude Trump from ever running again. If only someone, like maybe McConnell himself could have found some way like say via some sort of trial in the senate to prevent a guy who to absolutely no one's surprise takes a dinner with a white supremacist from ever having even the slightest chance from holding office again...
He announced his presidential campaign by accusing all immigrants from Mexico as being rapists and murderers. That was literally the first thing he did in politics.
