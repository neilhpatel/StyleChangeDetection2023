> In a statement at the end of financial leaders' meet near Bengaluru, India said the statement condemning Russia's war was endorsed by all members except Russia and China.
And you seem proud of the fact that you don't care, what does that say about you as a human being for not caring about the destruction Russia is causing ?
Just like Putin? Let me guess he condemns the war again ? Maybe the BS is bought by internal audiences, but not elsewhere. Just the other day Modi / India had a chance at UN, but abstained. That speaks clearly where he stands and no amount of spinning will change that.
They can and do talk about themselves in the first person all the time. Top ministers do this all the time when representing their country.
It's against India's policy to do so. If this resolution was about US during their illegal invasion of Iraq, India still would have abstained.
Whataboutism leads to no where and people see through these "condemn the war" statements. India is aligned with Russia as is its prerogative, but do not expect not to be criticized for it. What Russia is doing is unequivocally wrong and should be condemned by everyone.
And as for Russian Indian and American shitshow going on the internet.. There are thousands of protesters currently in Germany trying to stop Ukraine aid. Does that mean Germans support Russia? No. It's just some people.
The same thing goes for india. The ideologies of people vary to a huge degree. Some people who are normal outgoing people who have seen the west change politically and want to ally with them. However there are also some who are still stuck in the cold war era when US supported genocide by Pakistan and russia helped us, US also stops gps access to indian army in 1999 war. They think US will fuck us over again. These people support Russia.
Russia has made a huge impression and goodwill amongst the Indian population since independence and this kind of sway takes a lot of time to change.
The people here differ from culture to culture for every 500km. U really can't generalise us for being in support of a single country. Some support the west and some support Russia.
And as for why u see pro Russian stuff on indian internet.... Most of the pro western people do not go around saying NATO best. However for God knows why, Russian supporters always feel the need to publicly shout their preferences whenever possible. That's why u see more pro Russian stuff. And normal bots and spams are there too.
