The states attorney letter is about the criminal prosecution of the drunk driver. I you tell them your damages, they may order the driver to pay restitution, though in reality many offenders have no money and never pay the court ordered victim restitution.
I understand sometimes the defendants cannot pay what is asked, but after the incident(I saw he lives in a fairly modest house) I would like to proceed with whatever charges I can since this has ruined a huge set of my summer plans for June/July!
He had insurance & I initially made a claim with them but opted to cancel it since they were giving lackluster assistance & absolute minimal coverage for my repairs to my vehicle(whereas my insurance is totaling the vehicle).
I‚Äôm not sure how much I can get from my insurance company either but if there is anything I can do to help recover any of the charges I‚Äôm facing/going to face I want to take advantage of this, as I am not in a great financial place to begin with & this is a brand new process to me!
It's sort of the job of the other driver's insurer to lowball you and try to push you around. Sometimes threatening to sue them or hiring a lawyer gets them to act more reasonably. Good luck.
Thank you for the information. I did not realize I could make a claim with both insurance companies! My insurance has covered the deductible, as well as their ‚Äòmax‚Äô amount of days with a rental, so I will absolutely be paying out of pocket for that, I was just not sure how long I could get away with claiming when I contact the SA.
I don't think you should "cancel" the claim with the other insurer. I think you should try to get as much as you can from them. If your insurer is totaling the car but charging you a deductible and not paying a rental car for the whole time you are without a car, then at least make a claim for those amounts with the other insurer.
Perhaps this is a question for another sub, but can I just ‚Äòalter‚Äô the claim I‚Äôve made with his insurance & just tell them my insurance totaled it out & I want X amount reimbursed for my rental/deductible/oop fees?
Edit2: by saying my insurance covered my deductible, I mean that they took it out of my total loss check, which I will of course be reporting to SA.
NAL, but I work in auto insurance. Orders of restitution get my justice boner hard because I never get to see them myself.
Edit: as far as getting as much as I can, I would like to, & don‚Äôt mind being a bit pushy back, but I am clueless as to what I can push for. I‚Äôm so upset this has happened I would like to get as much as I can out of this!
Second question: Who to make the claim with? The order is making this guy to pay directly if I remember correctly, so I'd focus on claiming the things his insurance won't cover. You claim the things with his insurance that yours couldn't cover.
You'll definitely want to loop in your insurance company as well because they are a party of interest and should be helping with these matters.
If you did get hurt, well.. personal injury attorneys are sharks, but they definitely know what to ask for and navigate this BS. üëç.
You should still be able to talk to someone if you do have an urgent need. There's usually someone covering their coworkers phones/claims for emergencies on extended breaks. More than a few states have pretty narrow windows of time for response to certain circumstances. If you're having some difficulty getting someone to make a decision on something you think is urgent, you can probably ask for a call from your adjustors supervisor.
Honestly, your insurance company should be subrogating his company and at least getting your deductible back for you. You can definitely request it directly back, that should get you your money faster. It maybe declined though because different companies will have their own processes for it.
As for making a claim, what were your damages? Liability is pretty broad and can cover alot of things, but only things that are reasonable. If you had no injuries or medical bills, general damages such as pain and suffering are not going to be awarded because you had no pain.
Expect coordination with your insurance company because double indemnity is a real and annoying thing. I've sent too many people to collections because people thought they were being smart. It's why a claim with his insurance company might be difficult at this point. Id get a meeting arranged with both adjustors on the phone to talk about it to speed things along if there are problems.
The only concern I'd have in working with his insurance company directly. I'd wait for your insurance company to handle the liability investigation with them then make the claim for the extras. You don't want to be in the middle of a disputed liability fight if you can help it.
To be clear, I will follow through with my insurance totaling the car out, and then come after his with the rental/other charges my insurance will not cover. I do not know there is anything other than the rental I am missing with this claim, but of course maybe I am not being very thorough with everything. I will be looping my insurance people in. Should I have them do the talking for me? I like the idea of getting both parties on a meeting. I will talk to mine to see if I can coordinate such a thing. I am certainly not trying to screw myself over here.
As for looping your insurance adjuster in, I'd just talk to them about what their plans were for communicating with them. Each company will have their own process and each adjustor will be varying degrees of helpful about it. I'd get a feel for that first before anything else. It'd be better to let a helpful adjustor do their job than step on their toes if they're trying to get something done because you think it should move faster.
I am patiently awaiting the check from my insurance company, but as it turns out my adjuster is out until the 11th.... Any suggestions or tips I should take into consideration since I will be waiting for over a week to get in touch with my insurance and desperately need a rental ASAP?
A couple questions, given that there were no hospital visits, I assume the migraine strenh headaches from hitting my head on the wall as well as the trauma that has been lingering since the accident is not worth anything? This is not an exaggeration I just do not know a thing about damages/pain. Should I consider an injury lawyer in this situation if I wanted to pursue those charges? Odds are I wont because I understand most of the time these charges never come back to be paid from the defendant(or something like that).
I can't give you advice on the injury unfortunately since my scope is usually about the liability and vehicle damages. You maybe able to get a free consultation if you did attempt to speak with a lawyer about it just from my own personal experience involving an injury claim. They typically won't handle the property damage side since that's more cut and dry by comparison. That depends on the lawyer though.
As for your adjustor being on vacation and the rental. I skimmed it. They only approved for 3 days right? There isn't a general and universal standard for the number of days you'll get in rental for a total loss - its laws and company decisions. The idea is based on how quickly a reasonable person can buy a car knowing they'll get money. That opinion can vary.
Did you have the check? If you have the check then you have your answer. I think I mentioned mitigation previously? You have a duty to mitigate your damages and in this case the rent. Your life might be busy, but you need to buy a car.
I unfortunately was told via my adjusters sit in that I would have to take the matter into my own hands as far as approaching the other guys insurance. It is not something I am not prepared for, but would you have a word of advice you could share as far as how I should negotiate with them? I am just hoping to get about a month of a rental and my deductible(which I believe my insurance is already taking care of). I imagine there will be a lot of resistance on their end but perhaps considering I have this letter from the SA do you think they would be less inclined to try and resist fulfilling my request?
Unfortunately delays can happen waiting for the check to arrive because it sometimes doesn't consider that. It isn't likely you'll get any kind of extension unless you can prove that there was negligence by the adjustor that didn't follow the rule they were supposed to follow. However unfair you think the company's policy might be, they won't change it unless they did something wrong such as break a law.
Insurance is highly regulated and companies make their rules according to those standards. A good adjustor will do everything within their little box of rules to help. Crossing the line often means getting fined, fired or both.
If they haven't sent you the money for your total loss (assuming you got and accepted the offer) yet then that's a supervisor call. Try to get direct deposit set up too.
I haven't accepted the check from my insurance yet, but I have about 2 more days left to do so. I wanted to try and resolve this rental car issue before finalizing anything so as to not trap myself somehow.
DISCLAIMER: You're asking questions that are HIGHLY dependent on a company's standard procedures. I'll give you insight from my own experience, but I can't garuntee its accuracy to your case because I don't know the companies involved and it'd be unethical to tell you if I did.
Neither insurance company will pay for any more rental than needed and as I mentioned what gets paid for rental wise is you'll get the number of days that company deemed needed to buy a car.
Does it take a month to buy a car? No. A week tops after you get an offer. If it took a month to get you the offer then that's on them, you'll get the month unless your policy limits apply.
They owe to make you whole (not better) for a thing that was not your fault and directly caused by their customer. That's the mindset.
