In a non-emergency, whether a doctor will agree to proceed with one parent withholding consent and, possibly, threatening to sue, is another question.
So I cannot be held legally responsible? For more contest I’m Roman Catholic but I don’t practice much. I value health over religion. If it comes to the child’s health or the religion it’s going to be the childs health 100% of the time for me.
If you allow your child to become more sick, more injured, or even to die, because you refused to get them necessary medical treatment, yes you can be held legally responsible.
Possibly, but broadly speaking it is the right of the parent to consent or deny their child medical care pursuant to their religious beliefs. Hospitals and doctors can challenge that in court, but are often wary to do so unless its a truly life/death situation.
Source: Am a health administrator who ran a peds unit a while back, only ever saw the chief of medicine, social work guys and C-suite approve challenging a parents decision when it was a treatment that would literally save the kids life. Never saw it happen on things where there was significant doubt ("it could work, but no guarantees"). Its an expensive process to challenge a parents decision in court, and can lead to some truly awful PR and community backlash, especially if its a conservative area.
Like I said, broadly speaking, my experience with this comes in the inpatient side of ped's, I never worked in an ER/trauma unit so I'll take your word for it that if there was disagreement, they'd save the life but I don't believe that they'd force treatment without a court order if both parents were opposed. Are there doctors who'd say fuck it and do it anyways, for sure, but i'm speaking more about what the law/courts allow.
