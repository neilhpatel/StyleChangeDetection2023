Not on a joint lease, no. You can make whatever arrangement you want with them, but ultimately the landlord isn't going to agree to have you not be joint and severally liable. If the subletter doesn't pay, you have to pay in full and then sue them.
Would that kind of documentation help if I need to pursue legal action though on my end though? Meaning if I do need to pay in full and sue would having a signed agreement from the tenant/subletter indicating that they are responsible for their portion of the rent and if they do not pay I will pursue legal action help me at all? Or does that not hold up in court?
Having the sublet sign an agreement wouldn't hurt in court... they're already responsible, but the extra paperwork might make things easier.
What if this isn't with a sublet? Ideally all 4 of us are permanent tenants who have all signed on the lease. I want to make sure that all of the tenants of the lease are paying their fair share and that if one doesn't then the remaining leaseholders aren't screwed/ can atleast pursue this legally. Is it still the same scenario?
Ahh unfortunately that won't happen. It's wild how much trust we're putting in absolute strangers, how do people in the city do this all the time?? I'll see if it's worth it creating the documentation anyway but thank you for all your help!
