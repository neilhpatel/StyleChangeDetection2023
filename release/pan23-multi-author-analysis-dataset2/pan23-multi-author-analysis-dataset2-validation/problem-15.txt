2. Seek out a marriage counselor and work on your marriages foundation as I'm reading a lot of things that makes it sound like you're on loose footing.
IAAL but not yours—Idaho is a community property state so you really need to meet with an attorney who can explain how this works. Commingling funds can make them community assets and so you might already have a legal claim to many of his assets already. Please meet with an attorney who is licensed and does this type of contract work so they can give you a full picture of what you are eligible for. Especially if you plan on having children with this guy.
Not a lawyer, but just as a bit of life advice--he can either have a stay-at-home partner OR he can try to avoid alimony (spousal support)--he can't have it both ways. Don't sign anything with him without having your very own attorney (it can be paid for by him, but they need to solely represent you, per a written agreement between you and the attorney) review the paperwork. But I wouldn't agree to a prenup that has you sacrificing your career AND sacrificing future rights to spousal support. That's the whole point of spousal support--to make up for one partner sacrificing their career for the sake of the other or the sake of the family.
NAL if you don’t have a prenup today and you divorce it is up the your attorney and his and finally judge to come to an agreement for settlement. You cannot draft a prenup if you are already married you can however get a post nup.
If you are married 10 months and already discussing the dissolution of your marriage you might want to seek out a marriage counselor as well.
