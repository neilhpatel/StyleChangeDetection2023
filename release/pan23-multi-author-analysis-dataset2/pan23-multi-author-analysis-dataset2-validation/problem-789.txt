What state? Many states have their own, broader analogues acts. I see it now. Minnesota does not specifically include analogues of diazepam in its list of scheduled substances, so you may have had a factual defence to the charges. I have two new questions:
Then why was my charge dropped? I didn’t plead guilty, I was in my 4th pre trial. It also clearly says in Minnesota, Did you even read my post?
You edited your comment, I was unaware of this now my comment looks rude and ridiculous but I’ll leave it original unlike yours.
Inpatient treatment is not a normal sentence, and having the charges dropped is not a normal outcome of a conviction. Did you agree to it as part of a diversion program, in lieu of conviction?
I’m extremely glad i went to treatment, it saved my life. But how can I be court ordered to treatment when my charge was dropped?
I asked to go to trial on 4 separate occasions, was refused because the drug test from whatever lab was not received until 6 months later. Right as we had the drug test data, the charges were dropped.
The bottom line, however, is that if you accepted a pre-trial resolution to your charges, then you don't really have any grounds now to go back and change your mind, especially now that the charges have been dropped. You had the option at the time to either push back on the prosecutor's offer, or to force the issue to trial, if you were unhappy with the offer of treatment in lieu of prosecution. Personally, I would say you came out quite well, even if it was expensive: you do not have a criminal record, and it's extremely likely that your treatment was cheaper than a defence lawyer would have been. It also helped you get your use of benzo analogues under control. All in all, that's a success.
All of this needs to be proven in court. In my case, there was zero proof of any of the above listed terms.
This is exactly the problem, I asked on 4 separate court dates to go to trial but I was not allowed to because the prosecutor had not received the drug test results. This took 6 months.
