Hitler was ethnically German. The part of the old Austro-Hungarian empire that became the modern country of Austria after World War I (which was the part of the Austro-Hungarian empire Hitler came from) was the German-speaking part. Up through the nineteenth century Germany was a geographical region that included lots of countries, most quite small. In the nineteenth century the two largest German-speaking countries were Prussia and Austria. Prussia united most of the other German countries (including the Kingdom of Bavaria) under its leadership and formed the German Empire in 1871. While the new German Empire did not include Austria, the German-speaking Austrians were still considered culturally and ethnically German.
“On the evidence of a report by the Bavarian authorities in 1924, which questioned how Hitler was allowed to serve in the Bavarian Army, Hitler almost certainly was enlisted through an error on the part of the government. The authorities could not explain why he was not deported back to Austria in 1914 after he failed his physical exam for the Austrian Army. They concluded that the matter of Hitler's citizenship was simply not raised; thus he was allowed to enter the Bavarian Army.”.
What does it mean to be “ethnically German”? An Irish man speaking English isn’t an Englishman. Why does it matter if the Austrians spoke German? Plenty of Poles spoke German in places like Silesia, but they were Poles and not Germans.
And, Hitler’s family were all Austrians, well, his paternal grandfather remains a mystery to this day. According to Hitler’s own laws (the Nuremberg Laws), he really should have been regarded as a Mischling of second degree.
Ethnicity is a social construct. German-Austrians were seen as ethnically German by people in 1914. The western part of the Austrian empire was part of the German Confederation prior to 1866. After the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, the German-speaking part was actually called German-Austria for a little while, to differentiate it from the other parts of the empire that were divvied up.
Before 1871, "Germany" wasn't a country in the political sense. Prussia, Bavaria, Oldenburg, Hannover, Wurttemberg, Saxony, etc., were countries politically speaking. People didn't see Bavarians as more German than German-speaking Austrians, let alone did they imagine that Bavarians had more in common with Holsteiners than they did with Viennese - if anything they thought the opposite. "Germany" was a geographical region referring in general to that area of Europe where Germans lived. You're right that "German" is arbitrary. But nineteenth century Europeans were very interested in the concept of ethnicity, and one of the main ways they defined it was what one's native language was.
