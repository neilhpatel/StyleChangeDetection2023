First: what of they never said and you never knew? Lots of shit happen on others homes that you never know.
Second: everything depends on hoa cc&Rs. You likely have little control. And your phobia may not have any effect.
Unfortunately, or fortunately for the family who would be denied this place to live because of your phobia, it's very unlikely you'll be able to do anything. Short of an HOA provision barring snakes from the condo, there's absolutely no recourse.
If you are unable to handle even being in the same neighborhood as the pet snake of a neighbor, you're going to have to find a new place to live. It's a pet. You don't get to demand what pets your neighbors are allowed to have.
If I had a phobia of toe nails, and condo rules allowed occupants to have toe nails, I’d have no recourse against the neighbors I’m otherwise okay with, but I just happened to see they had toe nails because they were wearing sandles.
The most neighborly thing to do is seek therapy for your phobia. It’s unreasonable for a whole condo complex to accommodate your fear of largely harmless animals.
