But the bank or the servicing company should be able to pull video footage of your use of the machine, pull logs of your usage what you were or trying to do at the time, correlate that to logs and errors on the machine and finally, do an actual count of the money lodged or collected from the machine and determine if they have an unexpected overage(an extra amount of cash they can't account for on official transactions).
But really, the video should suffice to at least prove you were lodging money, prior to an error, and that their excuse they "can't find any transaction logs on the account" doesn't fly.
Any overage means they screwed someone and the machine is calibrated incorrectly and a risk to business. If they ever had missing money, you'd be sure they'd be investigating, and should be the same with additional cash.
There should be a record of you at least accessing your account at the time and date you used the machine, if you checked your balance, or what you tried to do, even if you quit out, or the machine got an error. If they can't find those logs, they are lying about looking.
Someone hasnt dug deep enough, or just passed the buck to someone who did a basic check and said "there was nothing there". They didn't see transactions on your account coz the machine had a physical error and backed out mid transaction and didn't complete, so it was never committed to your account.
Financial institutions are one of the most regulated industries, there are logs for what users do on every system, even if it's just looking and nothing else. There are logs about who access the logs of what users do. And backups of every transaction completed or not, in case there is an issue that needs correction, or worst case "disaster recovery" where they have to rebuild entire batabases(multiple) and keep the records up to date (they restore and reprocess them from these very logs in some cases).
The machine should have logs, and physically have your money, they need an investigation when the machine was serviced and cleaned out or restocked and what monies they had they can't account for.
So when I called them today and they told me about the claim being denied, they said that they had no records of any transaction going through my debit card. So I guess it’s safe to assume that they haven’t checked the ATM machine. Also the fact that they asked me about the location of the ATM and the ATM ID. I’m still hopeful, but I submitted a complaint on the CFPB website.
Edit: just saw it’s been six business days. You may want to call around and find the right banking regulator or at least give them a heads up what you are going to do.
Maybe word “journal “ confused you… On the left-hand page right date and time of each activity that occurred first one would be July 2 at 10 Am I lost my money in the ATM. second entry At 10:15 AM on July 2 I spoke to a teller and the bank manager at the specific branch and they told me to call this specific phone number and the specific company journal entry three would be at 11:30 AM on July 2 I called this company spoke to this person etc. etc.
It has been 15 days. Technically 8 because they messed up the first claim and put in an incorrect amount. I submitted the second claim with correct details on the 12th. I submitted a complaint at CFPB and the claims department at wells fargo took down the ATM ID where the incident happened. Apparently they did not know which ATM the incident took place. But other than that, what more should I do?
