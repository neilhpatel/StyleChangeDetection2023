If you have not already get a lawyer. DON'T be mean or disrespectful to the people who will be in charge of everything about you If you go to jail. It is their house. Please be safe. Best of luck.
I was allegedly found with 1gram of thc wax. Even though Iâ€™ve been a medical marijuana for 9years. Mandatory minimum sentencing is 1year for one gram of wax . Am I for sure going to face 1year in jail?
Most likely just the pot charge unless you assaulted someone in jail. Then they can tack on a charge. They would have already so just don't piss anyone else off. Hire a lawyer.
What state are you in? Florida is insane so if you are then you need a lawyer now. And don't drive on Bond Stay home be boring as F If you are not careful you can do time. Get a lawyer even a cheap one is better than none.
Okay then don't drive. Even in FL with a medical marijuana card you cannot piss dirty at all if you get pulled over. Pot stays in the system for ever! Keep the card current that is your protection. Do not dive with others unless family and NO giving"friends ride's" Florida and Georgia are not prisons you want to be in.
You are more likely to get in trouble driving around in a city where you just was a jerk to the police who mostly conduct Traffic Stops. You ever hear the song" Don't let catch you driving dirty".
