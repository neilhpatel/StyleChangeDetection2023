Economists are fairly well agreed that the fiscal spending of the New Deal didn't bring the USA out of the Great Depression for two reasons:
There was a sharp, severe depression in the USA over 1937-38, and then suddenly output started rising quite sharply, and this was before the US government really ramped up spending for WWII. This is somewhat a mystery of economic history, there is some evidence that it was probably increasing productivity, but why did it start rising in the middle of 1938? No one has come up with a good explanation of this.
1. The New Deal spending was mostly matched by an increase in taxes, rather than being funded by deficits, so on Keynesian grounds we wouldn't expect the fiscal spending to have an impact. (Note, the 1930s were before modern statistical collections in the USA, so there is a bit of modelling involved, but work in the 1950s and 1970s estimated that in 1933 real GNP was $62.1 billion less than 1929, while the budget deficit was only $2b, and in 1935  it was a shortfall of $49.3 b versus a $5b deficit (Fishback, 2010, page 404 (20 in pdf) ). There was a sharp spike in the US federal deficit in 1936 - leading to an a $10.6b shortfall against a $7.5b deficit, but this period was brief, caused by paying a bonus to WWI Veterans, and then the government deficit fell as revenues started to come in from the Social Security Act of 1935.
The USA saw increases in the gold supply due to a revaluation of gold in 1933-34 (the USA went off the Gold Standard in 1933), and then inflows of gold, principally from Europe, as fears built about the detoriating political and economic situation there - wealthy Europeans, even ones who weren't direct targets of Nazis, had reason to fear appropriation of their wealth if a war happened.
Speaking more generally, the New Deal was not just about raising government spending, it was a complex package of policies, often changed throughout this time. One part of the New Deal was farm programmes that were explicitly aimed at reducing economic growth, so to the extent the farm programmes were effective then this was a barrier to recovery. There were also other acts, like the Banking Act of 1935 that gave the US Federal Reserve the power to change banks' reserve requirements, which it did, increasing them several times in 1936-1937, thus reducing the money supply and playing a hand in causing the severe depression in 1937-1938.
Wartime spending did stimulate the economy, but there is a bias in our measures of GDP and gross national income. The accounting framework was built around concepts of a market economy, in particular the definition of GDP is output minus intermediate consumption, where output is measured in terms of sales (intermediate consumption is things like burning coal to fuel a power station, or hiring a lawyer to write contracts, as opposed to using an asset like the power station itself). So if a firm produces a product that no one wants to buy, GDP is lower. This is hard to apply to government production which is supplied free of charge. Therefore goverment production is valued as the sum of costs: (wages + benefits paid to workers [called compensation of employees] + consumption of capital). This is true no matter how valuable or useless that output is. Consequently the US saw surging GDP growth in WWII, but this wasn't necessarily a desirable recovery from the point of view of a peacetime economy. WWII also saw suppression of civilian consumption (both directly via rationing, and indirectly via credit limits and price controls), and increases in labour supply (women entering the work force, retirees returning, working hours per week rising). So increases in economic output, but not so much in economic well-being. This is something to be aware of when discussing economies during large-scale wars.
So the impact of the New Deal overall is hard to assess.  Conveniently, in 1995 (a few years ago now), a survey was done of economists and historians who were members of the Economic History Association. In this survey, they were asked to agree or disagree with a number of statements about US economic history, including the statement "Taken as a whole, government policies of the New Deal served to lenhen and deepen the Great Depression", found that 27% of economists agreed, and 22% agreed with provisos, while only 6% of historians agreed, and 21% agreed with provisos. So we can say with some confidence that in 1995 economists and, to a lesser extent, historians were divided on the question. (Less conveniently, to the best of my knowledge no one has carried out a similar survey since 1995.) And there has been a bit more academic research (I've added a couple of papers in the sources) directly on the topic and of course much more research on government interventions more generally, which might have changed opinions. But, overall, it seems fairly clear that there is quite a bit of grounds for disagreement about the role of the New Deal.
The Economic History Association's website, eh.net, has a couple of interesting articles on the Great Depression in the USA and its recovery, including theories around why, which I recommend for more reading.

2. The Great Depression is generally agreed to have been caused by a contraction of the money supply, caused (unintentionally) by the US Federal Reserve and transmitted to most of the rest of the world via the Gold Standard. Economists are fairly confident in this one because there's a strong connection between when a country went off the Gold Standard (or, in the case of Spain, was never on it) and that country's recovery in the 1930s.

Isn't that the same Steindl who wrote the eh.net article Economic Recovery in the Great Depression that I linked to? This sort of thing is why I was puzzling over the question of whether mean reversion is a heterodox or orthodox position.
Hmm, I'm going to have to think about how to answer that one, partly because I think that's a reasonably orthodox position (but what drives the trend? We have seen a decline in trend growth in volumes in recent decades across the developed countries). And what is a natural cause in the economy anyway? It may take me a day or more to formulate my thoughts on this.
I hope this is clear, I haven't had a question like yours before and I am trying to work out how best to articulate a lot of concepts floating around in the back of my head.

I suppose - I think I was referring to the sort of narrative Steindl 2007 posits, of forces inherent in the economy raising productivity, and that seemed rather unclear wrt what forces he is alluding to when he describes “mean reversion” influences?
Mean reversion/return to trend is a very standard null hypothesis in , the basic assumption is that whatever shocks are going on right now will be worked through, people will adapt to the new price level, or price growth, or oil price or whatever, and go back to normal. This isn't a great hypothesis on theoretical grounds but it's a hard one to beat empirically.
The forces inherent in the economy, well assuming we are talking about a relatively peaceful country with relatively stable property rights and money supply and etc, it's people looking to improve their own lives and do things a bit better, from inventing new machines to inventing new techniques (e.g. the assembly line), to expanding existing businesses, to building their kids' education to etc, including of course giving up on ideas that turned out to be bad (e.g. leaded petrol). These sort of changes are very hard to see at the macro level, nearly every single thing is unimportant from the point of view of the whole economy. For example the economic historian Robert Fogel in the 1960s concluded that even railways were unimportant to US economic growth in the 19th century:
It is the same Steindl, hence why I was likewise a bit uncertain about how I should consider the mean reversion claim, but your explanation was very helpful and the Fogel thing is quite surprising. Thanks lot once again for the explanation!
