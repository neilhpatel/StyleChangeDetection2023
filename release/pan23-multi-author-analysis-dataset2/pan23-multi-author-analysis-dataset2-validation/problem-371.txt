And frankly she was absolutely right to tell you leave on the basis of your comments. Asking a roommate out (and did you know she was gay when you did so?) and then commenting on her orientation when she rejected you? So very very out of line.
Not at all. I am confident that nowhere in OP's lease does it say anything about asking roommates out or making stupid jokes.
It sounds like she has illegally evicted /u/Charphl91 and is now illegally withholding his security deposit.
It might be a little late to say this but: it is extremely unwise to attempt to find a dating partner in the people you share an apartment with. It rarely works out well. Look at it from the women’s POV - you now have someone living in the same space who is interested in you sexually. This isn’t a comfortable feeling AT ALL. Add to that your comments (if you made them, it’s not clear from your post) and I can quite understand why your roommates weren’t comfortable with you in the property.
