CJIS (criminal justice) data is strictly confidential. Your offender has violated a number of agreements, not only by giving them to you, but possessing them in an insecure environment. I work with this type of data for a living an am required (as is every officer or person that has access) to be recertified every year to maintain access. This certification is done though the FBI. By sending those files to you he has committed a crime.
As a general rule, there is no need to have your own attorney when going to the police as the victim of a crime.
You should immediately report this to his employer. This is not something you want to mess around with. Departments are audited and access controls are in place and traceable. You need to call them and specifically tell them that you wish to report multiple CJIS records violation. That specific wording will cause all kinds of things to happen in the department as, again, they are subject to audit on this and a lack of control of such data will create a large number of problems for the department.
The policy manual and other documents are likely viewable via public records request. Criminal justice information is absolutely not, however.
