They may not count towards this particular work week. It sounds like his weeks may start on Wednesday, impossible for us to say.
The work week is any consecutive, consistent 168 hour period they define, it doesn't have to match up with the calendar week or his work schedule or pay period or anything really.
His work week (pay period) is defined as Sunday through Saturday. The previous week I included was paid correctly, except the last Saturday 29th he was paid straight time, when clearly he was already over 40 hours for the pay period before he started his shift Saturday.
But you could technically work 80 hours straight weeks in just the right way and you don't any more in those work weeks. Which is why nailing down the work week may be important here.
The whole thing boils down to hours worked, not so much days. He worked over 40 hours for this week, this pay period. I just included the days to hopefully make it easier to see what happened.
A "work week" for the purpose of calculating overtime pay owed is a distinct concept and is not necessarily the same as an employee's work schedule or their pay period. An employee could be scheduled to work Monday. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and their pay period could have them paid weekly on Thursdays for the previous Thursday through Wednesday, but the employer's "work week" for overtime purposes could be Tuesday-Monday. Usually there will be some alignment between these periods just for the sake of simplicity, but it isn't required, and employers are free to define a different work week that doesn't align with pay periods or actual employee schedules in any particular way.
Employers are also free to define a work week that reduces their overtime costs, if they choose, so long as the work week period they set is intended to be fixed and permanent and they aren't changing it regularly to avoid overtime pay.
According to federal law, if I understand correctly, anything over 40 hours should be considered overtime, regardless of if those hours were paid straight time, time and a half, double time, whatever. Right? That's our main question. Cuz he hit 44 hours at the end of Fridays shift, so all of Saturday should have been time and a half.
If you're absolutely certain they are one and the same here, then his best recourse is still to let the union handle it. If they can't/won't, then it's to file a wage claim.
It shouldn't matter if the hours were straight, double, or 1.5 cuz they are still hours worked. Right? One hour should = one hour regardless of how much is paid for that hour.
They are saying that he didn't have enough straight time hours, cuz the double time and time and half hours did not count toward total hours for the week. Straight time hours did not exceed 40, but the 12 hours of time and a half and 8 hours of double time were not added on to the total number of hours worked that week. They say after the 7th consecutive day his hours reset, which is in the middle of his scheduled work week AND pay period.
The employer may have a payroll system that only attaches benefits to "regular hours" and not OT hours worked.
