It was a resignation letter, but it clearly stated I would stay on full time until the end of the school year, and stay employed part time. No part time work was offered at all.
So if you resigned, you’re not qualified for unemployment. If you didn’t resign, they offered you a job and you said no, you don’t qualify. Most likely you’ll need to pay at least some of it back.
The only work offered was a school route, which is back to full time. But with the risk of bringing covid home. I just absolutely can't. Our district can't go 10 days without 1 to 3 new cases confirmed in the schools.
Hopefully at the very least I can get a waiver, or something. I am still considered employed by them and have to keep up with my cdl requirements, such as physicals and endorsements and get them to them promptly.
They can term your employment immediately after your resignation, many do in fact. They don’t have to offer you a part time opportunity due to circumstances. Anyhow, there isn’t a bullet proof way to protect yourself here. Just present your case at the hearing. Again, you’ll probably need to pay the amount back that you got AFTER you were offered the job and refused.
I understand your situation and I do sympathize, however your employer most likely doesn’t care and legally doesn’t have to care about these circumstances.
