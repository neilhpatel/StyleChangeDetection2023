And as I understand it from someone on here after I made a smart comment about someone who got five years or something being out on parole in a year or two, federal prisoners have to serve 85% of their sentence before being eligible for parole.
If he gets the maximum for everything he was just convicted of, that would be 60 years. OTOH, getting the max for everything is pretty unlikely.
I didn't know of anybody who ever did that in real life, until the last year or so. Mr. Rhodes here, famous for his eyepatch and now a sedition conviction, was a certified firearms instructor until he dropped a firearm one day and shot his eye out.
Celebrate now and enjoy as the protests you support in the future get labeled as seditious and attacks on America. And the freedom fighters that you personally support get locked away. Never celebrate government overreach, even if itâ€™s done to those you oppose.
Nah, I think we'll keep prosecuting Republican sedition. If someone on the left commits an act of sedition I'm 100% ok with them being charged for it.
