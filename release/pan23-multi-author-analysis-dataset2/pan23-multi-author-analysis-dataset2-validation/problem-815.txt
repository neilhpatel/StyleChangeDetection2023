I'm also from UK, I didnt save the image nor did I send anything, I deleted the entire chat, blocked reported them and I deactivated my account, I am panicking a lot.

It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
If it's reported, evidence will be taken from both people and the chats would be recovered. They will see clearly how it played out and it will show that you were not to blame. Depending on your local laws around baiting and essentially minors catfishing older people, nothing would happen. It's worth looking into those laws online. I would like to clarify now though I am in no way a lawyer/legal rep nor even from the states. Just a security guard from the UK with an interest in national law and internation law and legislation. Also I've seen someone else mention it but report the user. Not only have they committed a crime but this again proves your innocence.
