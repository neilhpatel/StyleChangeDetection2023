It has. Crazy. But I’m glad to hear it’ll reopen in the near future. I visited Notre Dame about ten years ago. I’m in no way religious but it was stunning for so many good reasons. Westminster Abbey in London is also very awe-inspiring.
I'm not super religious either, besides old Pagan beliefs. But some of the most impressive buildings on Earth are old Churches, Mosques, and other huge Temples.
Hagia Sophia, The Rome Pantheon, The Athens Acropolis, Borobudur Temple, Masjid al-Haram Mosque, Notre Dame Cathedral, Seville Cathedral, Saint Peters Basilica and the whole of Vatican City.
Notable mention are the dozens of really awesome looking medieval Gothic architecture Cathedrals, Churches, Ministers in Germany and France built during the Holy Roman Empire.
A little bit mixed between mostly Norse, Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology. My fascination on the stories behind the myths grew to where I started to observe Pagan holidays and other traditions.
Its not like how people currently worship in the Christian/Muslim religions. It's more so just observing the holidays and traditions, keeping the myths alive. Like the next big holiday is Lupercalia. Basically a more 'crazy' Valentines day. Then Dísablót at the end of the month into March to get ready for farming season.
But if you want to jump straight into full blown reading by spending money. Be warned some reading is easier than others. Like Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, to the average reader they're long boring books but if you're genuinely interested in Greek mythology they are two of the best surviving examples. A lot of the time you might need to find a modern translation of the books especially if it's based on a Classical Poem.
But if you're lucky, some university and schools might have mythology/classical learning classes that you go to.
Depends where you live and what tools of learning you have access to. All of my knowledge is self taught, except a bit of knowledge passed down from my grandmother who is Danish and loved telling tales to me as a kid. The rest I had to teach myself by reading up on mythology both online and books, there's documentaries and stuff you can watch to.
Depending on your current knowledge now, I suggest just googling things your curious about. Like if you want to know more about Odin, Freyja, Thor, Loki, Týr, and the rest of the Æsir and Vanir. Just Google Norse Mythology, Wikipedia although not the most credible can be a great starting point to see if it actually interests you.
I'll give a few Amazon links to some books I like. You might be able to find the same books for cheaper elsewhere.
this one's a very easy read, it was made for children. But it's one of the first books on Greek mythology I read and owned as a teenager.
Final step would be to partake in Rituals. Like for example making your own Shrine or Alter dedicated to whatever God or Goddess you choose, you'd have to look those up. I'm personally not super crazy into this step. Mostly because as much as I love the Old Gods and their Religions, I'm not going to worship them as if my life depends on it.
If you're wanting to go to the next level and start observing the old holiday/festivals then start by looking up the holidays and seeing how they were traditionally observed and how or if there's modern version (Lupercalia/Valentines Day or Yule Winter Solstice/Christmas).. most modern holidays believe it or not, are actually based on old Pagan holidays and remember most of the time it's just treating the holiday like a normal holiday. Except I love to reference the old Pagan Holidays/Traditions instead of the modern take, it's a great conversation starter with people who question you.
But I am in a process of trying to decorate a garden with cool mythology shrine/alter decorations. Like a statue of Athena under a mini pergola. I would love to create a Wooden/Straw Goat shrine soon to add to it.
I’ve heard that it will be reconstructed to match the as built design before the fire. Original timber framed components that burned will be rebuilt using that construction technique. Other parts of the cathedral had been renovated before the fire that utilized modern construction techniques, and those will be rebuilt in a like manner.
There's a whole industry in Europe focused on period-accurate restoration. It will likely be restored in a fashion that is safer but otherwise aesthetically identical.
