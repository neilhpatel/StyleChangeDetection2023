If she is the parent that gets to make major medical decisions and you made one without her, you're technically in contempt of the court order giving her that power. She could take you to court over it and have a judge decide whether or not the violation is worth some sort of punishment, whether it be a fine, imprisonment, or a modification of whatever orders are currently in place regarding custody of the child. Whether or not a judge would actually do that in this situation is anyone's guess.
Purely conjecture, but one would hope that the judge would see that the parent who took the child's wellbeing into account and made it a priority would hopefully tell the mother too bad so sad because her idiocy is a threat to her kid's health.
This is kinda what Iâ€™m banking on but know the courts have zero emotion and abide by the law, so the whole grey area made me ask this one in the first place.
everything is 50/50 and medical is 50/50, but if I recall (looong time ago went to mediation so dont recall everything) she gets the hypothetical 51%/49% on medical as the custodial because the courts need to make it that way. Again, I could honestly be wrong and giving bad insight for you to help answer it, but just going off memory of the mediation.
I think this is verbatim what the agreement says with us too actually. I definitely need to go back and double check everything. Thanks again and I appreciate you and everyone else.
Your papers should specify. My child's father and I have joint legal custody, with me having sole physical custody and our papers state that "Both parents agree that they shall discuss and consider the wishes of the other parent in all major decisions to be made regarding the minor children, including but not limited to medical, dental, religious, educational and recreational activities. Provided, however, in the event of a dispute between the parties, the custodial parent shall make the final decision on any such issue.".
