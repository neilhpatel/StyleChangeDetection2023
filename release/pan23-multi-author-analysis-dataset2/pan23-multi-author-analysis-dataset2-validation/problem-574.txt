EXACTLY. These prisoners that were pardoned after they fulfilled their 6 month contract will be the greatest recruitment tools for Wagner group. I'm sure that the majority of prisoners who heard the Wagner group offer turned it down because they didn't think that Wagner or Russia would keep their word.
Now we know what the recent announcement about releasing prisoners who had survived their tour in Ukraine being released was about. Promise made. Promise kept. They're trying to get new recruites...
It’s not like they showed the prisoners by name, it was just a bunch of “prisoners”. I’m sure those “prisoners” are going to show up again in future recruitment videos.
