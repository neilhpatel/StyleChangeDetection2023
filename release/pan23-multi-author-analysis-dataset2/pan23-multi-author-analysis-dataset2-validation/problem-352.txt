If your employer is aware that you don't want to be there anymore and are looking for employment elsewhere, then yes, they can terminate your employment for that. Employers generally want people who want to be there.
Disclosing the fact that you don't want to be there anymore might put your job at risk until you can get another line of employment lined up.
Why are you being loyal to a company that isn’t loyal to you. No pay raise in 7 years?? I wouldn’t disclose that you are looking for another position and I wouldn’t feel bad about it one tiny bit. Maybe ask one final time for a raise and then put in your 2 weeks notice if it’s denied again.

He has had 4 separate renovation projects at their house and bought 3 additional vehicles (didn't trade anything in or replace a vehicle, just added more to their personal fleet) in the time I have been here.
