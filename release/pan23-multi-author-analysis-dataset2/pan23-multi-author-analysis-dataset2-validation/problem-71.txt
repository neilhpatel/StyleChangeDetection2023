(One modern editor, Farquharson, thinks there's a lacuna before this bit, that is to say a bit of the text is missing, after the bit about 'fresh beauty in an old woman or an old man'. The editor of the Teubner critical edition, Joachim Dalfen, disagrees.).
The long and short of it is that you cannot trust all translations. The bit that Hammond translates as 'the seductive charm of his own slave boys', τὸ ἐν παισὶν ἐπαφρόδιτον τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ, is simply omitted by Casaubon -- presumably because he bowdlerised it.
The translations that bring out the sexual character of τὸ ἐπαφρόδιτον are correct to do so -- the word even includes 'Aphrodite' as part of it -- so there's absolutely no doubt about that.
The other matter is the meaning of παισίν. There is, in a sense, a genuine ambiguity over this word: if you take a look at , you'll see that they boil down to.
There are parallels with the use of 'boy' in modern American English. So you might imagine there's a certain leeway in how you interpret it here.
We can safely take it that the implication of sexual relations rule out the first meaning. παῖς always indicates a power imbalance, so whatever meaning we choose, the sexual relations are going to be non-consensual.
On your second question -- how can you have confidence in an arbitrary translation of an ancient work, when translations vary so widely -- the answer is that you cannot. Checking out reviews in scholarly journals will help -- reviews that appear elsewhere will be basically useless for finding out about accuracy -- but even they may not pick up a case like this.
Throughout Meditations, Marcus Aurelius take what I what term as pretty neutral to unfavorable view of sex (or at least the indulgence of lust). Earlier in the book (1.17) he writes:
So are we looking at sexual assault on minors, or on enslaved people? Hutcheson-Moor and Long have opted to interpret the text as referring to minors.
Except that isn't the complete phrase. The full phrase is παισὶν τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ, where τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ effectively means 'belonging to him'. That firmly indicates possession or ownership: it cannot mean 'children of other parents'. So, in light of that phrase, I'd say Hammond's translation is the only accurate rendition of the text.
Based off of your answer and previous reading on this sub, sexual contact between the wealthy and enslaved would at the time not have been the repugnant sexual assault that we view it as today. However, what was the prevailing attitude toward it (or do we not know)? Was it viewed as routine and normal, or some form of over indulgence (but not inherently evil). Basically, was Marcus Aurelius' attitude toward it just an expression of his own view or indicative of a wider perspective on the subject.
I can jump in here where u/kiwihellenist left off, on the follow-up question about sex with enslaved people.
As you rightly say, we would view this kind of act as repugnant sexual assault. The Romans, however, did not. Enslaved people were legally property of their enslavers - totally and utterly owned by them, and therefore under their dominion in every possible way, even bodily. From the earliest sources we have (comedy plays by Plautus from 2nd century BC), the sexual availability of enslaved men and women was taken for granted, to the point of being barely commented upon. There is evidence for this across Roman literature, at almost all levels of society where people could afford to enslave. Usually it's casual, as in this satire by Horace (1.2.114–9):
"Now really, when your throat is parched with thirst, you don’t ask for golden goblets, do you? When you’re hungry, you don’t turn your nose up at everything but peacock and turbot, do you? When your crotch is throbbing and there is a slave-girl or home-grown slave-boy ready at hand, whom you could jump right away, you don’t prefer to burst with your hard-on, do you? I certainly don’t. I like sex that is easy and obtainable.".
Now this is comedy, but the joke is observational: Horace is pointing out an obvious fact of life. If you're hungry, then eat. If you're thirsty, drink. If you're horny...
Hope this answers the question, although there's always more that could be said. I'll finish by reiterating that to our modern standards, this is all quite clearly repulsive, and even if the Romans aren't passing judgement, that doesn't mean I'm not.
Perhaps we might expect satire to contain references to this, but sex with enslaved people pops up even in things like farming manuals, for example Columella, who advises against giving the sexy slaves jobs as overseers (1.8.1).
Whatever Marcus Aurelius says about resisting the attractiveness of the people he enslaved, his predecessors certainly did not do the same. We know Augustus had a particular favourite - a young man called Sarmentus (see Plutarch's 'life of Antony 59.4) - and there is epigraphic evidence that both he and Tiberius employed beauticians who worked on some of the boys they enslaved. Cassius Dio says of Trajan that his taste for boys was pursued with a tasteful moderation and never bothered anyone (68.7.4). Again, these are all pretty casual mentions with no sense that the audience is supposed to be passing moral judgement.
"The next point is with regard to slaves — over what duty it is proper to place each and to what sort of tasks to assign them. So my advice at the start is not to appoint an overseer from that sort of slaves who are physically attractive, and certainly not from that class which has busied itself with the voluptuous occupations of the city. The lazy and sleepy-headed class of servants, accustomed to idling, to the Campus, the Circus, and the theatres, to gambling, to cookshops, to bawdy-houses, never ceases to dream of these follies; and when they carry them over into their farming, the master suffers not so much loss in the slave himself as in his whole estate. A man should be chosen who has been hardened by farm work from his infancy, one who has been tested by experience".
As you can see he's advising against moving enslaved people from the city, where they might have been corrupted by all the vices of urban living, into the countryside where their lazy habits and love of luxury might threaten the operations on the farm. In terms of attitudes, this is pretty standard Roman moralising stuff to be honest, and I think the casual remark about sexy slaves emphasises my point from the original post. Columella takes it for granted that an enslaver will find some of the people he enslaves, or some of those on the market, physically attractive, and is suggesting that they are best kept at home rather than being sent to work in the fields. Notably, the sexy ones are separate from the lazy ones - there's not necessarily the same moral judgement of both groups.
Based off of everything you've provided there seems to be no difference to the ancient Roman mind between consensual sex between the free and assault on the enslaved.
Hmm, I don't think I'd go quite that far: sex with enslaved people was really not the same thing at all. Take a look at that Horace poem again. He's essentially saying that raping an enslaved person is equivalent to having a quick wank to relieve a bit of sexual tension. The enslaved person is just there to be used and discarded as the enslaver wanted - no more consent is expected from them than the knarly old sock under a teenage boy's bed.
Sex between free Romans, either hetero or homosexual, was bound by very tight social rules and expectations. By and large, women were not expected to have sex before marriage, and then to remain faithful to their husbands. Men had a bit more freedom, but were generally expected to get out any urges on enslaved people or prostitutes, rather than violating a free daughter or someone's wife. If attracted to men, again it was better to take advantage of an enslaved man than risk compromising the virtus of a freeborn man. As people often know, Roman moral codes were more concerned about the role a person took in the sex act (e.g. penetrating or penetrated), rather than the genders of the partner.
I can't answer that myself, maybe someone else can. I have a lot of respect for Martin Hammond and I think he is very precise, so I'm inclined to trust his word, but for a fuller answer you'll need someone who specialises in sexuality in that place and period.
I'm not a scholar of Mediations by any means (or any other scholar), but I don't think the passage is too incongruous. To me it fits with his general "dispassionate" world view (for lack of a better word).
All that being said, it would obviously be naïve to think that every Roman adhered strictly to these rules, and in fact there's plenty of evidence that they didn't. Roman poets, especially Ovid, Propertius and indeed Horace, are always talking about female lovers who were clearly not their wives, and of sexual relationships with men that don't necessarily conform to the moral code. Their works are full of the trials of trying to attract sexual partners and the ups and downs of relationships. In these cases, consent clearly was a factor, otherwise all the moping about unrequited love would make no sense. We're a world away from the horrific abuse of enslaved people, from whom every shred of dignity and bodily autonomy was taken away.
