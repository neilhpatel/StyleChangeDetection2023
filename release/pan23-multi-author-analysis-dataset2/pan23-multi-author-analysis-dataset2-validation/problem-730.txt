I'm not really sure why someone saying "hi" would send you into this much of a panic, but no, ditching after ordering something as small as a dollar or two isn't going to be a crime.
Likely not criminal since, at least partly, you didn't appear to have malicious intentions. You just got scared off by someone greeting you.
Crime? Probably not. Theft requires intent to take property. You didn't take or try to take anything. Theoretically it's a civil matter, if McD's can prove they suffered monetary damages from filling your order which wasn't paid. Even that's a stretch though. Don't worry, they're not going to come after you for something this small.
Also keep in mind that most people would not feel compelled to flee a restaurant nor would they feel violated due to a stranger saying "hi" to them. I was painfully awkward at points in my youth as well. I had to work to grow out of it. You might want to spend more time around others you're not completely familiar with in order to become more comfortable in public. It takes time.
Yeah, that's a fair point too. The McDonalds kiosks require you to pay before you actually submit your order, so OP either paid for the food and then left it (no harm done) or never finished placing the order (also no harm done) so not sure what the worry is.
