ya gotta buy one more puff. but got any welder friends, doomsday preppers. farm dude friends/?. is your car a prius or a late model ford diesel? those are the big buck one, but they are all bringing big prices. You just got to make it rough, reinforce the bottom with plates. what they said.
Talk to your local law enforcement agency and see if they do sketching on CC. This makes it so if/when they thieves do get caught, they have a note of yours being stolen. May stop the stolen CC ring.
Also check with your insurance: they may offer a discount for putting it in if this is a common problem in your area.
