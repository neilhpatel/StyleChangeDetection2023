Texting and flirting isn’t illegal. And the school can’t transfer classes for every jilted attempted relationship.
She needs to block him. If he’s doing more than that your parents need to get involved and depending on the specifics get the police involved.
If there was a sexual assault you should go to the police rather than expecting the school to handle it. Texas does have laws against sending sexual texts to minors. But it would have to be explicitly sexual, not just pestering for a date.
So first of all, you can't really do anything yourself apart from support your sister. You probably for instance can't make any official statements or complaints on her behalf. She's going to have to be the one to do it.
What you've described is not problematic but perhaps there's more to the story. Him asking her out or trying to flirt with her becomes problematic if he does it repeatedly despite her indicating her disinterest. And even if that does happen, if he does it only on his own time and doesn't try to subject her to unwanted attention in class or as part of schoolwork then it doesn't really concern the school.
