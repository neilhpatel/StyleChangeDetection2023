Elsewhere on the same thread, u/yodatsracist offers an additional commentary on the same rumours and here on AskHistorians.
First, a clarification: the rumours alluded to relate not to US President Herbert Hoover, whose presidency ended in 1932/33, well before the Mafia became subject to significant US government pressure, but (as mentioned below the topline in the OP), rather to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was in command of the bureau from 1924 until 1972.
Second, a resource: I commented on these allegations, noting that it is by no means fully "accepted" that Hoover was "homosexual or bisexual" (though certainly that is widely believed), and that Summers is generally not considered a reliable source, in an earlier response about Hoover's rapid rise and later career. The relevant part of the longer thread .
Meyer had no such photo. Hoover virtually chased him out of the country. If Meyer had had such a photo he would have leveraged it. Summers’ source was not credible. We will never know if Hoover was gay but it is certain that he wasn’t showing up to high profile parties in cocktail dresses which is what the source said.
