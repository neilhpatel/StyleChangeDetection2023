First, are you a single family home owner or in a shared structure? If you're in a shared structure, you have two different policies that are held.
If you're in a condo, it's likely the latter and is also likely a requirement given to them for loan approval for folks and such.
If you're in a single family home though, I have no idea what this could possibly be about. Regardless, I am not aware of any HOA that operates out of personal checking. The building always has their own bank account. I don't even think it's legal to have an HOA managed checking account running out of personal checking for an individual.
Strange for an HOA to purchase fire insurance on your behalf. Who is the certificate holder of the policy and who is insured? I could see them asking for a certificate of insurance (proof) that is paid for and maintained by you.
Home insurance agent here. This is correct. OP, if you can find your insurance policy, see if it says "HO3" or "HO6". If it says "HO6" then they do indeed have a separate policy on the exterior of the dwelling.
2. Policy for the building that covers outside unit damage. These policies are usually covering tens of millions of dollars and have a significant cost associated.
You'll need an attorney to review your HOA bylaws/regulations and what your responsibility is. You may be able to review.it yourself, but if you don't understand everything, then lawyer up to be certain.
Also request a copy of this new fire insurance policy. Second of all, it is very illegal to operate HOA business out of a personal checking account. It’s called commingling of funds and it’s a major no no.
