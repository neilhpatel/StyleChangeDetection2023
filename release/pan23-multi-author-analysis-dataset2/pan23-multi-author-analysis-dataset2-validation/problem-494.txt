I am salaried. I don't do any record keeping of hours. And I have an email from an HR person saying "you are salaried/exempt.".
You may or may not be misclassified. It helps to educate yourself by clarifying what what wage orders MIGHT apply to your position, and comparing those to each other to contrast the differences and clarify which applies to your job position.
Something interesting I noticed though is that the offer letter didn't ever say the words "salaried" or "full time.".
You have 4 years to file with the DLSE so don't fret too badly. You could take a day or so to review the orders, if the one you believe applies doesn't clarify and support your company's position, you can show it to your HR department, or just file your wage claim:
For the kind of work you describe, in general, you must make twice the State minimum wage (and maybe a higher local minimum wage if you have a county or city ordinance) and have direct managerial authority over two or more employees UNLESS you qualify for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Order 14, or some other exemption.
I believe the exemption is only for certain exemptions (executive, administrative), so it may depend on your role. Off the top of my head I believe the minimum salary does not apply to the outside sales exemption but I think there are others as well. Not sure if this applies to your situation so it's definitely still worth looking into if you think you are being underpaid.
