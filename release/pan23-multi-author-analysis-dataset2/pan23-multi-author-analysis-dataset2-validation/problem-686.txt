Yes. As an employee you have a duty to your employer and you are in a position to know this was a glitch giving incorrect pricing. You should have reported the glitch to your employer, not exploited it. By exploiting it, you've opened yourself up to criminal charges and having to pay back the $15k restitution.
I mean, I agree that embezzlement may be a stretch (depending on how broadly they interpret the phrase "entrusted to you"), but you're surely not arguing that you didn't commit theft from the company, are you? And if you're not arguing that point, at that amount of money isn't it kind of a distinction without a difference (i.e., they can call it whatever they want, but you'd still be fired and you'd still be criminally prosecuted for a felony offense by the DA in your county?).
It was a glitch. Your defense is that you didn't break into someone else's car, they left it unlocked with the keys in it and you just drove off in it. You knew it was a glitch. Civilly, this is unjust enrichment. Criminally, you absolutely have criminal exposure here. You need to talk to a criminal defense lawyer to try to negotiate this so you don't end up convicted of a serious crime. You will almost certainly be terminated, and at best they will sue you for the money. At worst they will file a report with the police, you can be arrested and charged, and have to pay restitution. Lawyer, now.
