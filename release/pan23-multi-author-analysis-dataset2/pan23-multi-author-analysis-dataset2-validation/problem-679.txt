The paper provides an overview of Russia’s nuclear forces. Russia’s strategic nuclear forces have about 310 ICBMs with 800 warheads deployed, 176 SLBMs with 624 warheads deployed, and <70 bombers that can carry.
Edit: The report also contains a brief history of US and Soviet/Russian nuclear buildup, treaties between the nations, Soviet and Russian nuclear doctrine, and an overview of their advanced weapon concepts.
Out of curiously, does anyone know how inspectors know if 1 of the participating countries that is being inspected is not hiding an extra stash of nukes? How are we supposed to believe if Russia ain’t hiding an extra 5k nukes?
If it makes you feel better, there's virtually no benefit to any country of selling nuclear weapons to any country that doesn't have them.
I try not to think about it often …but we are constantly 1 bad decision away from ending our little human race. There are many subjects that I often choose to just bury my head in the sand on. This is one of them. Then I hope that cooler heads will always prevail.
