That sounds unfortunate but certainly not illegal in 49 of the 50 states. No reasons are needed, and if reasons are given, they can be fair or unfair, correct or incorrect.
The only possible thing you can do here that could get you some money (potentially) is if you were misclassified. Many, many 1099s are. What state, and what sort of work was it? Was it like a job, or was it more like working as an Uber?
I left that job because i got “my dream job” described above, until that unfortunate situation happened.
I dont think that’ll cut it unfortunately. I believe it was a w2, working in WA state, and was 40 hours a week doing web work. The contract was supposed to be a temp job at first, but was then expanded as a contractor with no end date because of covid. I manually submitted my hours via spreadsheet monthly.
If it was a job (W2) that turned into self-employment (1099) then that was illegal. You The first two things you can do would be to Google two IRS forms, SS-8 and 8919. Fill those out and file them. And then report this to L&I.
I don’t think it turned into anything during the tenure there. I have a document signed by both parties and the title is “independent contractor agreement”. After signed, i got an email address to use with the company and basically just had a 9-5 job m-f (40 hours) where i would record my hours worked, days off, etc. i wouldn’t get sick time or paid vacations. My paycheck would come directly from the company along with regular employee’s once a month.
For example, if you were to design and maintain websites for three companies: a painting company, a restaurant, and a hardware store. If you designed websites for a website design company, you were supposed to be a W2. It costs you a lot of money to be improperly classified.
That is 100% illegal. You can't sign a contract to give away your legal rights, any more than I could sign a contract letting someone murder me and not get arrested. You can do what was said above.
