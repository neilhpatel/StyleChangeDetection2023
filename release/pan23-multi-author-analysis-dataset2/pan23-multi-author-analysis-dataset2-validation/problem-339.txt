The question of why 20 years specifically is also in the Roundtable, but personally, I prefer this bit from u/AncientHistory:
> Twenty years is the arbitrary cutoff AskHistorians settled on because...basically that's what works. It's a nice round number, and that's about it. I wish I could tell you that we workshopped the cutoff and referenced in-depth historical analyses and had deep discussions about When IS history? but the long story short is that it's a point of convenience: there has to be some cutoff, to give a bit of distance between current events and now, and 20 years has worked pretty good so far.
Even after 20 years, when you look at events like the 1999 apartment bombings, as was discussed , you'll see that the available documentary evidence is pretty thin, and while we can give a shot at tackling such controversial questions, a lot of that thread boiled down to "which journalist and/or possibly biased source or unreliable narrator do you believe?". Which admittedly is a lot of what the historic profession actually does (this is pretty much the question for any ancient or medieval source which is our sole documentary evidence for a given event, as I understand it).
Anywho, regarding Putin and Putinist Russia, I would say that very much of it is still in the realm of journalism, maybe political science, but not really academic history. Steven Lee Myers' The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin is probably one of the best books published out there on the topic, but noticeably Myers is a journalist, and also his available source material thins quite a bit after 2000.
