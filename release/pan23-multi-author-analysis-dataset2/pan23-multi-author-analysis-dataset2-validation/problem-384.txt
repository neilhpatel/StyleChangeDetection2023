You're owed a work environment where you're not harassed in regards to a protected class. If your employer has solved the issue so that it doesn't happen again, that's it. You're not owed compensation because of one incident that your employer followed up with to prevent further instances of it.
That's not a hate crime as per the legal definition. /u/Internet_Ghost is correct in that the employer has an obligation to take measures to have the harassing behavior stop. If their measures were effective in preventing future harassment then they don't need to do anything further. If this becomes a pattern and the employer isn't taking effective action, then an EEOC complaint would be warranted imho.
Question - based on what I know, a hate crime is any crime done due to a protected status, and sexual harassment is a crime. Since she did that due to my gender identity, why wouldn't it be a hate crime!
This particular harassment was not a crime. Words alone almost never rise to a criminal level. Even if the behavior continued, your civil recourse would be against the employer failing their legal duties vs. suing the person making the comments.
