If no, then they have done nothing wrong. It's irritating, but they are within their rights to reclaim money given to you by mistake. Yes, there is a time limit given on when they can reverse charges, but they are well within that limit.
My point was aren't I supposed to receive notice? I automatically deposit anything over 1k from checking to savings and suddenly yesterday I had a massive negative balance with no warning.
Correct I have it setup where it automatically transfers to my savings. Not sure why I keep getting downvoted lol. I know now the money is not supposed to be mine. I am just concerned how money was able to be deposited in to my account and then removed without any notice given. It caused me issues yesterday because of it. I'm fairly certain I have to be given notice.
Did you take the money and move it? Or do you have something set up with your bank where if the balance is over $1000 then move the excess to savings?
I would call you bank and let them know the issue. Also, pay attention to where random large amounts of money come from before moving it to savings.
It matters because the law you pointed out specifically talks about deducting money from future paychecks. Since you don't work for them, there are no future pay checks for them to deduct from.
I don't think it matters that I don't still work for them. Again I do not care really that this happened to me. However I could foresee how this could be a larger issue for others in certain circumstances. Sending someone money by accident, not notifying them of any issue and then pulling the money from their account with no notice. Especially from a source that I've been receiving money from for years. Does that make sense and at least leave you somewhat questioning the legality of it?
Yes. But you no longer work for them. Thus there is no "future payroll" for them to deduct from, which is what 4 covers.
Like I said, it's a canceled check. Annoying, frustrating, but it happens. The money is not yours and they don't owe you any money. If they owed you money and pulled this, I would be questioning it. If they had left it for 60 days then pull the money back, then I would be questioning it. But neither of those things happened.
