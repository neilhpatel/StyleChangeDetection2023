Then I feel like you're leaving something out in this story, because swatting tends to be prosecuted quite vigorously.
Nothing happened last year, the only times the guy sent the pizzas and swatted me twice was in 2019. Over an hour ago, he sent a pizza delivery to my house AGAIN, 563 days later after the last incident.
In any event, in the past almost two years nothing has happened except a pizza. I'm sure you can find a lawyer to pay by the hour who will send some letters for you.
Unless you know who the person is or a way to identify them, I imagine the only help a lawyer could be is to communicate the situation to police so they verify with you in the event of a 911 call. Without identifying who did this, there isn't much to do.
