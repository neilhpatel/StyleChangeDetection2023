If attacked, you can generally use a like amount of force to defend yourself. Don't "arm yourself" unless you've already got training. This isn't the time to do that.
Thank you for the response, I appreciate it. It sounds like the general consensus is that in order for any type of peace to occur if this escalates that I should wait until assaulted. I understand that this is just a legal position and it makes sense, just doesn't make sense from a practical stand point that I should allow myself to be victimized again in order to not be victimized again. I'm sorry if it sounds argumentative, I'm just very frustrated by this situation and feel like there really isn't any option out there for me to prevent the assault in the first place.
Our instructors in the police academy warned us that if someone woke up one day and decided they were going to kill a cop, then we probably couldn't stop the attack. But we could take steps to be able to survive the attack and limit injuries. The main thing you can do (and this applies to everyday life, not just this situation) is to start walking around in Condition Yellow, not White. It's a color code that a lot of soldiers, cops, and tactically-inclined people use; DuckDuckGo "Cooper color code.".
Thanks for being understanding. This was very helpful to read. When put into that perspective it does make a lot of sense. I can't prevent something from happening, but I can prepare to act appropriately if and when something does. Very insightful perspective.
I appreciate this. I also thought about accidentally antagonizing by recording her. The police recommended I record everything every time I leave my apartment and if I see her to tell her I was recording her, but that feels like pushing the envelope to me. This is a good alternative suggestion. Thanks.
