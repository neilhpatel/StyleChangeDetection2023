How exactly voting worked varied depending on time and place. Elections as we understand them in the US today largely date from Progressive reforms from the early 20th century onward.
Elections in colonial Virginia, for example, would be considered massively corrupt by our standards today. Voters gathered at the county courthouse, and votes were cast in-person, and by voice. There was no secrecy to your vote, so everyone, including the candidates and all of your neighbors, knew exactly who you voted for. These elections also featured fairly significant amounts of what we can with no great measure of injustice characterize as bribery. Even though the practice was strictly speaking prohibited, it was very common for candidates to provide voters with generous quantities of food and alcohol on election day. The idea that your vote was your own private business was foreign to colonial and early national America. Kentucky continued using a form of voice voting until 1891. For many American elections, voting was an open affair.
Even when paper ballots were used, it was not always a secret for which candidate or which party you had voted. Unlike today, there were next to no government rules governing ballot access. Virtually anybody with a printing press and enough paper could print ballots. Political parties and reform associations alike could print them. The parties, usually through their friendliest newspaper, sponsored the ballots themselves. In order to vote, you had to make sure you went to the Democratic or Whig or Republican booster at your polling station and get the right ballot for that party. Therefore, your vote wasn't even really secret. Parties sometimes printed ballots on specific colors of paper, so that could give things away too. If you wanted to split your ticket - vote for candidates of different parties - you would have to scratch out a name on the ballot and write one in.
With all of this in mind, there have been some fairly naked attempts at vote buying, some of it quite well documented. In the Gilded Age, some party organizations used vote buying shops. Here's how it worked: actually giving somebody money in exchange for a vote was a bad idea, but there was no rule against giving somebody, say, a token in exchange for putting in a ballot for the "correct" party. After you cast your ballot, you would go to the location of a vote buying shop, and sell your token for a certain amount of cash. We even have records of political fixers budgeting for how much money it would cost to buy votes in given areas - rural areas were generally more expensive.
As far as how long it took to get results back, it really depended on time, place, and the nature of the election. For local elections, same day results were in the cards. After the invention and widespread use of the telegraph, collecting returns statewide occurred much more quickly. Presidential elections used to be far more confusing than they are now because until 1848, not every state held its presidential elections on the same day. This, for reasons that should be obvious, slowed the process considerably.
So the thoroughly unsatisfying answer to the question of how secure American elections were is: it depends. A local election run entirely on voice voting could be said to be secure in a certain sense, but not fair by our standards. Both voice votes and votes by paper ballot were the objects at times tremendous social pressure to vote one way or the other. Cheating the system, were one sufficiently motivated, was not tremendously difficult, and the kinds of shenanigans that went on helped create the process we know today whereby the political parties function partly as means for controlling ballot access.
I was especially surprised to know that you don't have to produce such a paper when coming to a voting station, only naming your address (if I remember correctly). Which seemed to be wide open for "carousels" (multiple voting) or other malicious or unwitting irregularities. How true is it? (Maybe not today, but 20 years ago, per the rule, would also be pretty representative.).
Thank you for the response. It sounds, to me, that while it varies in security, it wasn't close to where we're at now. As I consider it, it makes the original design - the electoral college as a buffer and no direct voting for the Senate - seem slightly sensical. And it makes the idea of election security feel like a lot of nostalgia for "the good old days", an idea that wasn't quite how we actually did it.
It's one of those things that cuts both ways in a certain sense. Today, we have a bureaucratized but by no means fool-proof registration system. Fraud is possible, but it takes some doing. Our current voter registration and candidate ballot access exists for very good historical reasons rooted in abuses that became apparent in the Gilded Age. These changes have been accomplished, however, at the expense of making candidate nomination and election an "indoor" as opposed to "outdoor" process. Candidate nomination and election is much more tied into state and local government apparatuses that than it used to be. For everything that was wrong with the way 19th century elections worked, and there was quite a lot wrong with them, there was next to no bureaucracy involved in getting your name on the ballot in many areas quite simply because the government didn't have much control over the process. If the local Temperance League wanted to run a candidate against both the Democrat and the Republican, there wasn't much of a reason they couldn't.
I think it could be a nice question all of its own to dig into the history of identification of American citizens or even better, some specific problem that may have made this problem manifest. It's interesting that this matter remained so granular and diverse for so long, while US was I think among the first to massively use mechanical computers to keep track of people? (I mean the Social Security punch card database that propelled IBM to prosperity along with its German projects... and probably was responsible for the entire history of electronic computers as a result, considering how dominating IBM was for much of it).
