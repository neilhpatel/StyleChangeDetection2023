Is there anything I can do to get the money back from him from what I put into the place because the way I hear it he's wanting us to leave so his sister can move in it after we have done fix the place put popping in it put wiring in it got it all up the code to rent or to be lived in and now he wants us to just to leave all the sudden just leave like that is there anything I can do at all to get my money back.
It is nothing like that we didn't rent nothing no lease no agreement it is my cousin they place was a piece of shit hull before we started fixing it and if that was the case wouldn't he have to keep the place up? Like maintenance garbage and all he has refused to fix anything we had to do it all so what do we do ?
So I should basically take all the water pipes out the wiring hell the whole breaker box the flooring and all the wood I bought for it? The agreement was we can stay there and fix no problem and no problems will come but now he thinks he can come say leave and we will it ain't going down like that.
For the most part when you invest in someone else's property without some sort of clear written agreement about how you're to be compensated for that investment you are giving them a gift.
I'm fine with the eviction that's no problem he can evict away but what I'm saying is it's I don't know it's too complicated to explain my cousin was the one that first rented it from him and they had some kind of agreement because he had to get an agreement to get the power on you know what I mean so the powers in our name the waters in our name internet everything is in her name at this place so there is some kind of agreement I'm sure we had to have one to get the power on but there's not one with our name on it.
If whomever controls the property wants you all to leave you need to get your notice period and then you need to turn off the internet and power and go.
He can ask you to leave. If you don't leave voluntarily, he can follow the legal process for evicting a tenant in your state, which likely involving written notice to vacate, followed by action in the court system. If he does anything to force you to leave without following the legal process, such as disconnecting your utilities, changing the locks, using or threatening violence, he has likely violated the law.
I would but it's not that easy we have nowhere to go me my wife and 9yrs old girl .I have had no job due to having covid and I will not be threw out like rats when we had a plan only person renigging is him the place wasn't even supposed to be rented I'm thinking of calling the inspector/code enforcement whoever I have to to do something about it I will not let all my work I did go to waste they have to be something I can do to be reimbursed right?. honestly he's just being a dick for no reason if he wants to act like a landlord then he will get treated like one he hasn't did a thing to this place since we have been here and he comes up threatening me and bringing up my dead dad to me fuck him.
