I can't comment on how far back this goes or about specific "princess culture," but since you asked about Victorian children, I can tell you with complete certainty that Victorian little girls loved princesses, and they did so as part of fairy tales and also as part of pretend games imagining themselves at the highest level of society. (As usual, I'm focusing on the UK.).
A fantastic answer. Thank you for taking the time. Would you mind expanding on the idea of the invention of childhood in Victorian England? Was it just in regards to ‘play’ or did this extend further to things like keeping children out of work, etc?
One of my favorite stories by MacDonald, first published as The Wise Woman in 1875 and later The Lost Princess, is about two very spoiled little girls, Princess Rosamond and Agnes, a poor girl. They are both stolen away by the magical Wise Woman so they can learn their lesson. They both travel through a magical painting and experience a series of adventures. Agnes ends up in the castle, where the king and queen demand to know what has become of their child, so it looks for a while like Agnes and her poor family are in for a world of trouble. Rosamond, meanwhile, finally ends up seeing the error of her selfish ways and becoming good, which she shows by finding her way back to the castle and standing up for Agnes and her parents, who are about to be punished for "kidnapping" her. The story is very typical of many Victorian children's stories: there is an overt moral lesson, and the child protagonist learns to be a better person. The reason I picked out this story is that the major moral change is in Rosamond the princess, not Agnes the poor girl (and Agnes is generally a worse-behaved child, and used as a contrast to the princess). This shows that, to the Victorian child audience, the princess was the one they were expected to imagine themselves in the place of.
In the 19th century, the availability of cheaper printing and the expansion of literacy formed a ready market for children's stories, one that was met with delightful, colorful, and in many cases very moral and charming children's books. On top of this, the 1800s are sometimes said to mark the "invention of childhood," with the idea being that childhood was seen for the first time as a time to be cherished including play, imagination, and fun. This may not be strictly true, but there certainly was an expansion of products for children. Children's books, instead of being strictly moral, started to be about entertaining and delighting their audiences, too.
From George MacDonald's numerous stories featuring princesses ("The Light Princess," (1867) The Princess and the Goblin, (1872) and The Princess and Curdie (1883), among others) to Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Little Princess (1908), princesses were a popular topic in books. We can safely assume that the number of princess stories was serving to meet the interests of the smallest literature enthusiasts. Child-friendly editions of fairy tales (Grimm's, Andersen's, and others) were very popular, including Andrew Lang's Fairy Books, of which there were a dozen. Lang started with the Blue and Red Fairy Books, and eventually had to resort to names like Olive and Lilac Fairy Book, with covers in the given colors. On top of this there was Lang's 1908 The Book of Princes and Princesses, stories of the childhoods of historical figures. Many Victorian fantasies (MacDonald's among them) took the form of fairy tales being explicitly told to children, with the narrator addressing the little readers/listeners directly (for example, this sweet bit: "It is plain enough to every one of my readers what she [the princess] ought to have done...").
Princesses were also a favorite topic in children's theater, especially in plays based on fairy tales. Performances were put on specifically for children and were very successful, with children (often unaccompanied) paying a penny to get in. The Princess's Theatre in Oxford Street, in addition to countless other theaters in London and around the UK, staged lots of children's stories featuring princesses that are still familiar, including Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Twelve Dancing Princesses, as well as others made just for the stage.
This is terrific — I associate princess culture with Disney, but I suppose almost all of Disney’s princess stories are based on very old fairy tales.
As for the kids themselves, playing pretend was a favorite form of play for children of all ages. We have rich evidence from diaries and letters of children being praised for their elaborate imaginations in playing out complex stories, and adults sometimes joining in the fun and playing along. Children from wealthier families could even count on not only cast-off clothing to dress up in, but also costumes and props bought specifically for the purpose. Many adults remember back fondly in their writing of trunks or closets full of dress-up clothes. Some even had the entrance hall or other room of the house transformed into a theater (sometimes with stage, curtains, lighting, and even scenery) for plays. Their scripts could either be bought for home performance (often with parts for all members of the family and friends) or written by themselves. We have lots of mentions of delightful plays written and performed by children, and many of them are based on fairy tales. Playing a princess would have been done in the context of fairy tales or to emulate the highest class. You can be sure that little girls were dressing up and playing princess at least as far back as the time I'm most familiar with.
I particularly love the idea that we can distinguish between a child enjoying a story with a princess in it versus a child identifying as a princess by locating the moral center of the narrative.
Do you happen to know if the reason we call fairy tales fairy tales is because of these prismatic fairy books?
I’m also curious if there was a gender asymmetry in these stories — are there many stories that allow boys to imagine themselves as princes? I’d imagine boys might have a wider diversity of imaginative roles?
You're right in that there were more roles for boys in these stories than for girls, but there were also plenty of princes in children's books. (I won't claim that I can give an accurate count of how many princes and how many princesses there are in these stories, but in my estimation there are more princesses than princes.) In addition to the stories from fairy tales, there were other stories with princes as heroes, usually in the model of fairy tales. We need look no further than Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince (1888), though in this the prince is literally a statue that contains the spirit of the prince as he was in life, as he learns what suffering is by seeing the city around himself and sends a swallow with the most valuable parts of the statue to the poor. Another example is W. M. Thackeray's The Rose and the Ring: A Fire-Side Pantomime for Great and Small Children (1854), a satire of medieval stories and also contemporary folly featuring two princes, two princesses, and a variety of ever-more-unlikely coincidences. It follows the tradition of English pantomime, and therefore both works as a silly story and a satirical allegory, so everyone in the family could enjoy its reading.
I like the way you think, but "fairy tale" goes back at least to the 18th century in English, derived from the French Conte de fées, literally "fairy story" or perhaps "story of fairies.".
After clearing it with the mods, here is my response to your question. Please let me know if I can further explain or expound on it, since we're talking about a tracing historical ideas, which can be tricky!
Later edit: I should also mention that, to a degree, boys also played the way I described less, because the world of sport was very male-oriented in this era, and so boys were spending more of their time doing sport than girls were. So, while boys might have also been playing soldiers and pirates in ways that girls were generally discouraged from when they were playing pretend, boys also had other freetime activities available to them (though some sports, such as croquet, were actually more popular with girls than boys).
I've seen the claim made that it was in Victorian England, that children's books, children's toys, and children's entertainment exploded as a result of dropping infant mortality, urbanization, and more disposable income, which is why I wrote it in there, but exactly when and how and to what degree is widely debated. I'll try to give you the quick version so we don't move too far off from Victorian princesses! The conversation in academia starts with French scholar Philippe Ariès in 1960 with Centuries of Childhood. Today's scholarship about historical childhood goes back to Ariès. In that book, he argues that for a long time children were seen as tiny adults, and his main evidence is that in artwork children are depicted that way. He points to the whole idea of childhood originating around the 15th century, and even after that children were distinguished chiefly as being capable of different tasks for the family. Remembering that life was mainly rural and agrarian, you can understand why this might be (particularly if, like me, you grew up on a farm). In the Middle Ages, he writes, there also wasn't an effort to keep children in sexual ignorance as there was later: peasant children would sleep in the same bed as their parents, for example. Another important point is that child mortality was very high. If a child survived to around ten, they might be expected to live to adulthood, but especially the first few years of life were doubtful.
It's not so much about what childhood was like as what it was popularly imagined as. I think my answer to the question will help! Let me know if I can give further explanation. .
