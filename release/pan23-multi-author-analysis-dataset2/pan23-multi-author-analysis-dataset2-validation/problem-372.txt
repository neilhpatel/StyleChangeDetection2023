We're sending 6 democrats to the house and kept our Democrat government, AND expanded voting rights and codified abortion rights in our constitution. It was a great night for Michigan!
I am SO GLAD to have woken to this result. I live in an area with a lot of Dixon and "Prop 3 is too confusing" signs and really worried. I don't think I even realized how deeply I was holding my breath until I could finally let it out.

Sadly no. In my district we just elected a republican to the house. Katko was retiring and they even recently redrew the maps. I was hoping a Democrat would finally win but it looks like he lost by 3000 votes.
Back to the regularly scheduled programming of drug ads instead of political barrage... for another few weeks, at least.
