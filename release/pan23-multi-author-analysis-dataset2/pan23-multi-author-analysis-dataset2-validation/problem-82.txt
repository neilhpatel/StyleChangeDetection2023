Beshear formed a committee and has been talking about legalizing medical via executive order. Hopefully he tries.
I should have phrased that differently. It would be a lot better if we had democratic politicians who actually set out as part of their platform to preserve gun rights. I am well aware that many folks on the left appreciate their gun rights just as much as those on the right, me being one of them, but that isn't reflected in the politicians who claim to represent us.
In a lot of southern states, pro gun democrats would do well. I consider myself a pro gun democrat. I've considered campaigning in the south. I bet I could do decently well.

That’s part of it. But Kentucky is weird because in the past 30 years, they’ve had 5 Democratic governors and 2 Republicans.
Kentucky has a HUGE alcohol industry (Bourbon/Whiskey) that donates to Republicans to keep it illegal.
I don’t think Kentucky will see recreational legalized anytime soon because Republicans have gerrymandered the state races to the point they have a supermajority.
