Through no fault of your own, there's a bit of wrong approach to assumptions embedded in your question. Some of this smacks of Euhemerism, which takes its name from Euhemerus, a Greek writer of the late 4th century BC. He suggested that oral narratives - the myths of his time - were based on real people or inspired by real things. Every since then, there have been attempts to "chase down" the origin of folk narrative and belief, attempting to find the source in real things. Folklorists generally see this as the wrong way to approach things - but it doesn't inhibit people from trying, and it inspires several questions on this sub every week! In fact, it is a matter of modern folk belief that folklore is usually based on something - and if we can only track down this core inspiration, we will understand the tradition once and for all.
The folk did not create the idea of elves to suit the circumstance. They explained the circumstance with the elves because they seemed to be the likely culprit.
An unusual event does not "trigger the creation of certain creatures"; rather, it causes people to look at the spectrum of beliefs that they have to explain what just happened. An event can put wind in the sail of a belief, but under normal circumstances it does not cause the belief ("under normal circumstances" is put here to allow for the exception, because with humanity, anything is possible!).
There are many theories that are put forward to explain stories about giants. These include that there actually was a race of giants, that the stories are recalling a now extinct subspecies of hominid. I have also seen stories about giants justified by the idea that people had found mammoth skulls and then invented the idea of giants - thus creating the stories. I have also heard people put forward the idea that stories about giants are evidence of ancient alien visits.
These are theories (and I'm sure there are many others) to explain why diverse people have stories about giants in their oral traditions. I suspect that the many removed comments to this posting reflects how people are intrigued by these theories and put them forward in response to this sort of question.
To provide an example close to what you're after here: people have long questioned why some people suddenly die, and there is particular concern about infants who either die suddenly are who after a point seem to fail to thrive. It was easy to imagine that there was some supernatural agency at play here, but it did not cause people to create an entity that was responsible for that supernatural event. Instead, they looked to what they "knew" existed in their surrounding and the process went something like this: there are elves all around us, sometimes invisible, and always lurking about in one form or another; they are attracted to the company of people and if care is not taken, they will abduct people; that person died suddenly, or that infant seems to be acting strangely, therefore, the elves (which we know to exist) must have acted and likely abducted the person (or infant), replacing it with a changeling that appears as the person's corpse (or as a failing infant).
Because traditional folk belief relegated giants to an ancient time, modern folk belief follows the following course: many ancient peoples had stories about giants; all legends have an element of truth within them; the stories must be linked by something that was real (because all legends must have something real behind them); therefore, there must have been a race of giant humans that may have been a subspecies of hominids or aliens or ... fill in the blank with speculation.
A first point: stories were not likely that widespread; those expressed in cultures speaking Indo-European languages likely came from a single common ancestor rather than from unique, diverse and widespread traditions. Non-Indo-European-speaking cultures occasionally have stories about giants, but they are not necessarily as widespread as is occasionally asserted.
That aside, many (but not necessarily most) pre-modern folklore collections describe a giant or more than one giant playing a role in the creation of an aspect(s) of the world. These are what is known as etiological legends - narratives told to be believed that explained the origin of something. Stories about giants typically involve times in a remote past or a remote location: people would not describe actually seeing giants in their own time - unlike elves/fairies/trolls/hiddenfolk/etc., which people believed it was possible to encounter. It was impossible for people to imagine that a giant was hiding nearby because they would be easily found out; it was easy for people to imagine elves hiding nearby.
The question here is whether these are reasonable theories. Embracing these sorts of ideas has become an aspect of modern folk belief. The core folk belief at play here is that "all legends have an element of truth embedded in them." There is no evidence that this is true; this is part of modern folklore. Theories about the origins of giant folklore may be fun to think about, but there is absolutely no evidence to reinforce them.
The premodern process related to giants typically followed the following course: look at that enormous stone in that field; how did it get there? it would have taken the strenh of someone who was enormous; a giant must have thrown it there, but since no one remembers that happening, it must have happened long ago. The folk believed that there were once giants, and so it was easy to see the consequences of their existence in the world around them.
Those lines of speculation are not theories resting on facts. Diverse people had stories about giants because some of these stories diffused with Indo-European languages. These and other stories reflect a natural process of people attempting to grapple with the origin of the remarkable world around them.
Thank you for the explanation Though my question was a little vague, I indeed wasn’t looking for a reality based origin of the tales but more the cause of it’s existence. Thank you for your time writing this down for me.
I think I follow what you're saying in the second paragraph, and I don't see anything there that leaps out to me as wrong.
It is a matter of modern folklore that older legends have an element of truth embedded in them. People believe this to be the case even though there is usually no evidence to support it. It is a matter of popular belief. Indeed, it is often embraced by all sorts of people including scientists who seek to find "what is behind a given myth/legend." The pattern is then to offer speculation based on no real evidence, but the speculation suits the belief that there must be something real to cause the legend to exist. That idea "that there must be something real to cause the legend to exist" is, in itself, part of modern folk belief.
I feel like the important distinction here is that "all legends have an element of what modern, Western, secular/scientific people would identify as truth embedded in them"? Like you say, for the people telling stories about giants, the giants were indeed truth, right?
For people telling legends about giants, they were likely to be seen as real - yes, as you indicate. For some modern people considering those legends, the search is on as to why the legends existed: they existed because something must be behind it. Fossils were large bones. Therefore, discovery of fossils caused giant legends. This is speculation that is unsupported by any facts, and yet it is passed off as modern folk belief to explain older legends.
I guess what I'm trying to get at is that if you went to the people telling stories about giants and said "there must be something real behind your stories about giants" they would say "yes, the giants are the real thing behind them". They wouldn't say "well, there is an emotional truth to it" or something like that.
Like, the only reason for modern people to search for "the reality behind the legend" is that you don't accept the legend as true, because it doesn't match your "scientific" conception of reality. When you tell a legend (excuse me if I'm using the wrong term, I know you distinguish between 'legends' and other kinds of stories, but I forget how) about, like, Robin Hood fighting Little John with a quarterstaff to cross the river, there's no effort to find the "real explanation" because the story fits into what we understand as the physical laws of the universe -- it fits our Western, modern, secular version of "reality". We don't say "well they got this story from looking at dinosaur bones" or whatever.
My only point is that modern folk belief now maintains something about older legends that cannot be proven, namely that there was some truth behind those old stories. Modern folk belief maintains that this is true without evidence, and it must be, consequently, seen as an expression of modern folklore.
