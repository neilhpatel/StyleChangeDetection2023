This is wrong. Federal law prohibits you from owning or purchasing a handgun until youâ€™re 18. There is no federal minimum age for owning a rifle or shotgun. Federal law prohibits FFL dealers from selling to minors, but private sales of long guns to minors is not prohibited.
Only thing to be wary of here is that you and whomever you are buying the rifle do not participate in a straw purchase. If the person you are buying the rifle from purchases the rifle with intent to re-sell to you, you both are in some big trouble, if caught.
Well if it's bought with the intention to resell, purchaser would need an FFL because there is no intention to use the rifle purchased. There is a lot of grey area to these laws but this post could be used as evidence that you are intent to by pass the spirit of the law which would do you know favors or the person assisting you with this purchase.
IANAL but just wait till your 18, if you get caught breaking this law and found guilty, your right to carry for the remainder of your life is forfeit.
