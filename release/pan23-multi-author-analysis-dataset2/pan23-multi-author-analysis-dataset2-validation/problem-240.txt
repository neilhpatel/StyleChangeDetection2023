This war has done one thing that has significantly changed the calculations of the world, it has proved Russia is not a rational actor and Mutually Assured Destruction might no longer be a big enough deterrence.
I'd go so far as to say this is, for all intents and purposes, a nuclear war already. Up until 2/24/22 nukes were primarily a defensive deterrent. But Putin invaded with the threat of nuclear retaliation if anyone got involved in Ukraine's defense. Instead of a defensive deterrent, for the first time in history we have a major war where the aggressor is explicitly using nuclear weapons as an offensive shield.
It's not supposed to represent an actual measurement of time, but how close humanity is to wiping itself out. Originally, it was supposed to merely measure how close humanity is to nuclear war.
It's just for the scare effect, that's why they don't use a real measure. Just something that's always close to annihilation.
The last time I saw a story like this, I added up every announced edging closer and away from midnight announcement, using the time the clock was originally set at.
