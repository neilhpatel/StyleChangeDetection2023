Normally when a mortgage loan is originated and funded, you receive a letter from the original servicer if the loan servicing is being sold plus a letter from the new servicer. It isn't usual for the loan servicing to be sold at all. It is a little unusual that you would have the loan servicing sold from lender A to lender B and then back to lender A again. Do you have the trail of letters to back this up for your own protection? If I were in your shoes I would contact both companies (loan servicer A and loan servicer B) and get it in writing if you don't have anything in writing. I would also contact the CFPB. You don't want to find yourself paying the wrong servicer. NAL. This is a practical answer.
