Alot of places near me are rent only and you still have to pay for Gas, Electric, Water, Sewage. So you have all of those bills on top of rent which could be $700-$2400 depending. It's very hard to find 1bds lower then $900 monthly.
A more detailed description of the recent bill OP received, and how it delineated these charges, if at all.
There is so much confusion in the comments based on OP having conflated these two issues of rent charges and utility billing.
The clauses on rent and rent increases verbatim from the lease, rather than OP's characterization of these.
I'm also very curious about the history of the lease and how payment for these items has proceeded over previous months as that may tend to prove how the parties understood these terms. Limitations on rent increases imposed by statute or the lease agreement may not apply to increased utility expenses that a tenant has agreed to assume.
It sounds like there may be some landlord ratfuckery, but its impossible to tell because OP has not provided enough reliable information.
If you got the notice of rent increase today, it is too late to increase your December or January rent—since January 1 is less than 30 days from now. If you got it in the last few days, it is still too late to increase your December rent. So here's what you do:
Agreed. I’d also like to know if there was a change in ownership or property management. I find it odd that places bill you for the previous month. Every apartment I’ve been in bills you for the future month. That way you are guaranteed the living space for the next 30 days. Maybe the landlord/management is trying to catch up and change the billing days?
As for utilities, ignore the $30 flat fee and ask for an itemized bill as usual. "A $30 flat fee for utilities is not included in the rental agreement, Please provide an itemized bill as usual.".
1. Pay your original rent for December. Explain, "This is the agreed-upon rent. Any rent increase requires a 30-day notice and therefore cannot apply to December rent.".
2. Decide whether you agree to pay 77 percent more going forward. If not, find a new home. If that's what you're doing notify the landlord that you do not agree to the rent increase and will be vacating the property.
