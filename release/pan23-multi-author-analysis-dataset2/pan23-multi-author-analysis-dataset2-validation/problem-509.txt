It depends on the definition; blackmailing is the threat to expose IF demands aren’t met. Extorting is to threaten for something. But it isn’t mutually exclusive because when you hear extort it’s more physical while when blackmail is being brought up the act hasn’t been done or was done without violence. It’s really semantics; however I’m not a lawman so I don’t know if a dictionary definition is the same as a legal definition. I do know that if you were to spill the beans you could be charged as an accessory or at least charge for not reporting a crime.
Although it was also my understanding that an ordinary citizen could not be held legally responsible for not reporting a crime under most situations.
It's the tying together and conflation of "do this for me" to "or else I'll report your crimes to the police" that's the extortion/blackmail part.
If you start making one of those depend on the other, that's where you're dancing into "...aaaaand now I'm also committing a crime" territory.
Hahaha I guess that depends on the kind of crime they committed, the kind of person you know them to be and from how far away you can safely make those threats. Exercise good judgement .
Yep, understood. I'm just being pedantic I guess - I thought extortion was specifically threats of violence and blackmail was threats of revealing information.
