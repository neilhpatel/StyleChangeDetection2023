Doesn’t this break anyone else’s heart? They locked up a poet. A person who’s art is writing. She didn’t sell drugs to schoolkids, she didn’t kill someone, and she’s getting a worse punishment than a lot of people who commit those crimes do.
And they’ve done it to thousands of other people, torturing, jailing, killing. The open barbarism in the world right now is just staggering.
well her crime along with the person she was found guilty with is being of the baha'i faith. it's a religion that says peace to all and all are welcome. can't have that.
To give this some context. Baha'i is a religion originating from Iran in the 1800s. Followers have been suppressed and persecuted on (actual) religious grounds due to tension with Islam (and Christianity). In practice they are usually accused in Iran of being agents of foreign powers and attempting to destabilise Iran - an easy "enemy" to rally against.
anecdote if you’re interested: the ones i knew in my hometown basically told me ‘it’s the old guard at the top of the chain (kinda like the vatican as a comparable thing) who refuse to change the rules’. their beliefs on the bottom of the chain vary, like most other religions. the ones in my hometown were socially progressive, but there aren’t very many of them in my hometown, which means this is a pretty small sample size.
they don’t have a church structure, they just meet at each other’s houses. the men and the women both participate in organizing their community stuff and the funds etc, it’s just the HQ that has the rules against women being in high office and stuff, and as far as i can tell they’re known for just having a stick up their ass.
they don’t shun people in their group who break the ‘rules’, didn’t proselytize to me, saying their faith is 100% a choice (and they didn’t even make their children participate in prayer, though the kids sometimes came to the meetings and did all the holidays because why wouldn’t they like to eat and party lol).
as an atheist gay woman i’ma give this anecdotal experience with religious people a 9/10. they’re still pretty weird though, gotta say. and i have yet to meet one that’ll touch alcohol, even among the more progressive ones, though one did smoke weed….
Baha'i is a weird religion. Central to their text is promoting love and acceptance, while these tenets are clearly at odds with some of their teachings that are very conservative. Sex is an act reserved between a married man and a married woman (so no pre-marital, extra-marital or homosexuality allowed) - and women are disallowed from holding high religious office.
