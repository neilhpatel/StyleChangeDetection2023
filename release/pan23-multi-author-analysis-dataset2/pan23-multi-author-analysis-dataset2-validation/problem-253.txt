There are a number of services that provide brokered communications between co-parents that avoid certain words and phrases, and preserve a record for any future needs. You should talk to your lawyer about amending your current order to provide for one of those.
I will most likely be seeking a lawyer. I'm looking on here if there are other options before that. But amending the parenting agreement might be what it comes down to.
There is a huge range of normal transitions in place. From friendly co-parents who meet, have coffee, and give the kids some transition time, all the way to co-parents who meet at a police station for a transition. It isn't about normal. It's about what's best for your kids.
I also agree, the kids are the important thing. That's why I'm not trying to take it to court if I don't have to. I don't want them being caught up in a big thing between their mother and I unless it's absolutely necessary.
You and mom can agree to anything you agree to. Including use of one of the sites / apps. But if you want it enforceable, or if she wonâ€™t agree, amending the order is your only real option.
Be careful of this. In co-parenting, things can be bigger things when the court is not involved. Sometime the path to peace is clear boundaries.
