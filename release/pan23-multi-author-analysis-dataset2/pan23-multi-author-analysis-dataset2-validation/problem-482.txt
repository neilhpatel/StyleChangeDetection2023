Exactly. Say nothing at all further to the police. The police can legally lie to you so saying theyre not a suspect can make the suspect more relaxed. They are asking him to come down because they cant force him to come down; the meet up there is to get him to say things they can use to arrest him; very rarely are they wanting to question him to exonerate him. The father has no legal obligation to talk to any police officer about this unless there is something like a subpoena, which is lawyer time anyways.
"you are not a suspect" is a classic police tactic to get suspects to voluntarily incriminate themselves.
because they dont have a piece of evidence to make it a murder case. That is why they are trying to bring people in "to talk". Things they say, no matter how small, that supports the police's case will becomes facts of the case.
This is a murder case. Even assuming your father is innocent, best to have a lawyer because the police are going to be taking this very seriously and may apply pressure in ways that are uncomfortable and coercive.
I put very rarely because there could have been a few times in history when this happened where they are looking for guidance from someone they truly donâ€™t think is a suspect.
The problem with getting a lawyer is now he's paying for something he shouldn't have to. He has no obligation to talk to them, he should just say no thanks I already said everything I know. If they want to push it they can get an arrest warrant and then a lawyer will be provided. He already said more than a lawyer would advise, don't continue.
The next step your father should make is to contact a lawyer. He should, under no circumstances, speak to a detective without representation from this moment further. Remind him that utilizing his fifth amendment is not a sign of weakness or guilt.
True but my point was he's already talked to them, hiring a lawyer can't fix that. He has no reason to talk to them any further though so don't waste money on a lawyer if they have no case against him. If they had anything they wouldn't need to invite him to the station, decline the invite.
