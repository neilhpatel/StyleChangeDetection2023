You said they have not written to you about why they’re holding it. Have you written to management requesting the security deposit, though? When I moved out of my last place it took a while for mine to be returned so I sent a simple message basically like “friendly reminder!” & referencing that they were coming up on their deadline to return it soon. That’s when they had incentive to work on returning it and I received it the next day.
If your landlord doesn’t return your deposit less an itemized list of damages within 14 days of you moving out they forfeit the right to keep it at all. If they do this willfully they may owe you twice the amount wrongfully withheld. The deposit also cannot exceed the amount of one month’s rent and if your landlord owns 6 or more units they have to place your deposit in an interest earning account and tell you where it is, and pay you most of the interest. All of the above only applies to non-rent stabilized units. You can read the law here : and a simplified explanation provided by your state’s AG here : starting on page 23. It’s important to be certain your landlord has your address. It’s easiest to demonstrate that they have it by providing it in writing via certified mail. You might do so now. If you read subsection b of the law, you’ll note that your deposit cannot be withheld for any lease violation. It may be withheld only for specific reasons, and they still have to tell you why they’re withholding it within the given timeframe.
He received my new address in a written request (Does email count as "certified mail"?) dated May 3rd along with an itemization request.
Do the units have to be in the same location? My location had three units but I'm unaware of what other properties he owns.
The units don’t have to be in one place, I’m not sure of any simple method by which you’d figure out whether he owns other rentals, though. is a product provided by USPS. It’s just one way to prove someone has received your communications.
EDIT: Does he also need to provide a reason for why it's being held before this 14 day point? I know you mention specific reasons and such.
Okay. I can certainly confirm that he saw the email, as he responded to it eight minutes later, saying:
Reading the document, I have no idea to what extent the law was "deliberately broken" but if he's been renting in the state of NY for 20+ years I imagine that's something he needs to be aware of to one extent or another.
The email with your address should be sufficient so long as email is a method by which you’ve communicated in the past or communication via email is provided for in the lease.
One way to demonstrate that your deposit is being willfully withheld/the law is being deliberately broken is to contact your landlord in writing (again, preferably via certified mail but email may be appropriate) and remind him that he’s neither returned your deposit nor furnished an itemized list of damages. Keep a copy of the certified mail receipt as well as a copy of the letter. For all we know, he might respond that he already mailed it to you and the mail is delayed or someone has stolen your mail.
In response to your edit, your landlord needed to provide the reason he’s withholding your deposit, referred to as an itemized list of damages, within the 14 days. This is stated in subsection e of the law and also iterated in the AG’s handbook :
Here’s advice about suing your landlord on small claims court by NOLO : and a guide produced by the state :
For context, the landlord lives in Massachusetts, not New York. So he hires a property manager to handle the moment-to-moment repairs for the property and such. Email is 100% a way we have communicated consistently in the past, we have exchanged dozens of emails, I would say.
