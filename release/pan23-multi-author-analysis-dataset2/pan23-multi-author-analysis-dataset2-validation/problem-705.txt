I caught this a little late, but you pose a quite interesting question: starting from Fathers and Sons (published 1862, but discussing the environment of the 1830s onward), What is to be Done? was published the following year, and Notes from the Underground was published in turn in 1864. Dostoevsky returned to these themes in Demons and to some degree in The Adolescent. So all of this is happening over a very short and politically charged time; the liberal agitation for the abolition of serfdom was realized in 1861, and it seemed that indeed further liberalization was on the way. These somewhat anemic measures, as they were perceived by Marxists, anarchists, and other radical elements, simply preserved and modified the ancien regime: thrusting state-owned serfs into subsistence-farming or, later, factory work hardly resolved the economic inequality of the Empire. At any rate, the summer of 1862 was marked by violent student uprisings, and the following winter saw the attempted Polish January Uprising.
Additionally, it was the liberalization under Alexander II that even allowed for these works to be published as they were. Fathers and Sons explores nihilism, which is a rather complicated and evasive position; many self-professed Russian nihilists held to deeply divergent views. The central tenets are rejection of the extant structures: serfdom, monarchy, Orthodoxy, and so on. For some this meant terrorism or suicide, for others the absence of political commitments. Bazarov, for example, initially believes that love is incompatible with his nihilist beliefs.
This is what Chernyshevsky rejected in What is to be Done?: instead one must have political commitments. The fictional veneer for Chernyshevsky is thinner than in Dostoyevsky or Turgenev, and the novel very much plays the part of a philosophical treatise. To turn to Dostoevsky, he held nationalist, Slavophilic views, ones inherently at odds with the radicalism of Chernyshevsky. In perhaps the most famous vignette of Notes from the Underground, he derides at lenh the utopian Crystal Palace for denying individuality and freedom:
(Schopenhauer returns to this theme, as "a ship without ballast is unstable and will not go straight").
To most directly respond to your question, I will defer to the Slavicist Sasha Murphy on 19th century Russian literature:
One reason you're finding more philosophical novels in Russia than elsewhere is the fractured political environment of the 1840s onward, without more traditional outlets; and the enmeshment of philosophical questions with political ones (note these aren't especially cerebral concerns, but urgent ones on the place of future of Russia itself). These themes were taken up by various other authors, like Mikhail Artsybashev in Sanin or Nikolai Leskov's Daggers Dawn, but they aren't the direct replies like we see earlier. Anti-nihilistic novels and short stories were quite common in the 1880s under the direction of the conservative editor Mikhail Katkov, and while these were quite popular they largely aren't very good as literature.
But I don't think that philosophical novels, or novels as the chief venue of a philosophy, are uniquely Russian. Compare Being and Nothingness with Nausea, for example. One is overtly a philosophical work, but I don't think that means the other is necessarily relegated to "conveying a philosophy" but not itself acting as a treatise on that philosophy.
if I can add a follow up question, did people reading these novels see them as philosophical treaties?, because I think of many other successful novelist of that era like Alexandre Dumas or Mark Twain, and people back then read their novels mostly because they were fun and entertaining, not necessarily because of their ideologies.
I'm afraid I can't speak strongly to a transnational history of the book, but for Russian readership (which, really, was a rather small slice of Russian civil participants--remember that the serfs were freed immediately before this back-and-forth, and that serfs composed more than a third of all Russian subjects!) the debates into which these novels played would be very apparent and, in the case of Chernyshevsky, extremely bald-faced, though neither Dostoevsky or Turgenev were particularly subtle. These novels do serve as entertainment, but the political environment--even in the rural periphery as we see in Fathers and Sons--was quite charged throughout the late 19th century. Nikolai Nekrasov, for example, began publishing the epic poem Who can be happy and free in Russia? in 1866, which as the title promises explores the melancholy of quotidian Russian life shared by peasants and aristocrats--the Russian быт is laid bare, with a strongly political twinge (indeed, the poem was never published in full due to censorship).
The works invite debate, as we see the characters engage in: when reading the excerpt above from Notes, one cannot help but respond to either the churlishness of the narrator or the naivete of his imagined interlocutors. Does man really desire independence over rationality?
