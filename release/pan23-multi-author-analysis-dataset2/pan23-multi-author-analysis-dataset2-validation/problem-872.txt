Oh nice! I actually had an LLC in MN. Which I’m guessing you would want to do for yourself so he can pay your LLC from his. - the Secretary of State website can help you with that.
Depending on the type of work and city/county i am curious if there are any regulations on licensing. Such as being a licensed electrician, plumber, residential building contractor or residential remodeler license.
I've heard subcontractor, independent contractor and sole proprietorship thrown around some.. are those in conjunction with an LLC?
I know when you to the sos.state.mn.us site there is the option “how to register your business”. Under that tab there is the subtopic “Types of MN Businesses”. That should give you more information about what they register. I myself had an LLC for my real estate consulting and it was just me. The main agent I worked with had his own LLC which he paid me from.
Subcontractor to my understanding would be the person the contractor of the project hires out the specific jobs to. Depending on if you are doing general construction or specializing you may need to hold a license as well in that area. The fee for both the LLC and the license should not be too much and I know for the LLC it was a one time fee and just renew it every year by confirming online you were still in business.
Once you have your LLC you will also need to get a EIN - employer identification number for taxes, which is free, it’s just a matter of filling the paperwork out on the irs.gov site.
But confirm first with the area you will be working or contracted for if you will be required to have a license with the city/county/state. I know it’s typically a BS license with a fee so they can check their box but it will save you the pain of any set back if it gets asked when an inspector comes through to certify the work completed.
