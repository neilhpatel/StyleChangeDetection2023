You should have the death certificate now or soon. Did they say it will take longer? Who is dealing with the funeral home?
Unfortunately, as a stay-at-home Dad without a job, I'm not sure of a probate attorney who can do this for little to no money. The local Legal Aid team said they don't have anyone on their roster that can help in this matter.
You need to see what the employer wants you to sign to see if you can legally sign it. Will the next of kin not fill it out?
I'm doing my best to keep her estranged mom (next of kin) out of it. She has a lot of debt (like 3rd mortgage and utilities arrears) and I don't want her to get any ideas that it should go to her instead of her grandkids.
The employer wants me sign and return a W-9 in my name to release those funds to me (but they admitted quite possibly in her name and said I should have no issue depositing that money in her accounts or a trust).
Whether your children (you) accept those assets or not, they may nevertheless have impact on public benefits.
If they go into a trust for the kids would I still have access in the event of an emergency since they are both minors?
Do I have to track down each and every asset on my own? I'm dubious in my own ability to find the assets she may have held that are a little harder to find.
You have the right instinct for the wrong reason. It sounds like these assets may belong to your partner's children (again, you need a probate attorney) rather than you. You should be guided by counsel as to how you handle those.
We were listed jointly on the house and the vehicles. I was not on the mortgage, though, and we own the vehicles outright. Probably a dumb thing to do, but I paid off most if not all of any debt she was carrying on credit cards, orthodontics for the kids, electric bills, etc. (close to 10K worth of debt).
Gotcha. Thank you. This is turning out to be a potentially costly lesson in being proactive about protecting and finalizing one's estate. A will would have been so much easier and far less expensive.
This was the advice of my personal banker, too. He made it all sound fairly simple and even said to look up his wife who works that department at the courthouse. But it almost seemed too easy, so that's why I wanted to get some differing opinions.
