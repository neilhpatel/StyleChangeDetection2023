Probably not. Corporate (which another comment suggested) will likely not do anything, since they are not the owner's of the dealerships. And since you are dealing with a, presumably, 3rd party warranty company, then there is nothing that GM can do.
If your state has a Bureau of Automotive Repair, you can call them to complain about a repair facility.
The threshold question you need to consider is whether you have money damages. Did you pay the lazy dealership anything out of pocket? Did you incur rental car costs not subject to reimbursement by the warranty company? Did you lose any income because your car was not running for several months? Are you not made whole, financially, by having the car repaired?
Did you get a customer satisfaction survey? If so, fill it out based on your experience. You’d be surprised just how important these surveys are to dealerships.
If your answer is no, then you probably don’t have recourse through the court. If the answer is yes, that’s just a first step in figuring out whether you can take them to court.
