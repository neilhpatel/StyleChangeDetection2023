Did you send them a check/electronic payment/etc. for June 2021, or did they apply the "last month" that you already paid to it?
There's no one weird trick where they can double-dip a month of rent. Either the $650 was for June 2021, in which case they need to apply $650 somewhere towards the future if you also sent them a check for June 2021 three months ago - or it was for the last month that you are in the apartment, in which case it hasn't been "used" yet.
Upon signing the lease last year, I paid the deposit, first month and last month all at once, 650x3 for a total of 1950. Electronic. It is all even notated in the lease. prepaid rent for June 2021, first month, deposit.
That lease is paid for an concluded, at least in my mind. As of 7/1/2021 going forward I am month to month.
In correspondence with him this morning, if I want a new lease, I have to pay for the last month's rent in 2022 of that new lease up front.
After signing the lease and paying the first month, last month and deposit, I have since then paid only electronically every month when the time came to pay rent. I had done that all the way up until May, in which I didn't pay and was late. Fast forward to today, I am late on May, July and August (because the way I understand it, I paid June 2021 on the day I signed the lease). So, this morning, I paid May, July and August, including the late fees. Am up to date 100%, at least the way I see it, maybe I am wrong?
In conclusion; No I have not paid June 2021 within the recent months due to me believing I have paid it already.
The way that I read the correspondence from the property manager, if I want to renew the lease (because currently, I have a pending nonrenewal at the end of August, this month, in which case I have to move out or be evicted), then I have to pay June 2021 still, otherwise i'm delinquent or late, or whatever it is they are claiming. Yet, I paid this upon the signing of the lease, which notates that June 2021 was specifically already paid for ahead of time.
Oh, so in that case they're 100% entitled to ask you for the last month's rent on the new lease. You haven't paid it! They no longer are holding a "last month's rent", because it was "consumed" in June. (Edit if this makes it any clearer: what I was saying before about double-dipping is basically what you are trying to do here. You're trying to argue that the "last month's rent" you paid should count for both June 2021 and June 2022.).
