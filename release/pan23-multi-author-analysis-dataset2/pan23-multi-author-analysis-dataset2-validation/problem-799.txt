This is an incredible answer, thank you so much. It seems, reading this, that while she faced troubles with the court, it was not necessarily different than other military leaders have faced--after all, she is not the only general in Chinese history to face difficulties in court politics. Which I find fascinating, as the standard narrative as I understand it is that the Ming saw an increasing hardness of boundaries of gender.
Her first appointment was from her late husband, Ma Qiancheng, who was a 宣抚使 (Xuan Fu Shi -- something like a city/region commander) at present day Chong Qing. After her husband died in prison (he was imprisoned due to framing from other officials), Liangyu took over1 the appointment, which is a 从四品2 (Cong Si/4 pin). This happened in 1613 .
In 1620, ) launched attack on the Ming borders, Liangyu was deployed to help in the frontline defense, and promoted by the court to become a 三品3 (san/3 pin).
In 1621, after her brother died in a tough fight in an attempt to break siege. Liangyu led her troops to support the remaining soldiers who managed to survive, and to aid in the defense of . , promoted her to 二品 (er/2 pin) and bestowed her the title of 诰命夫人4 5 (Gao Ming Fu Ren = Mrs xx by imperial mandate) . 诰命夫人 is a prestigious honorary title given to an official's wife or mother , as an recognition and reward for his/her tremendous contribution to the empire. It's ranked from 一品 （yi/1 pin) to 五品 (wu/5 pin).
Wow! I'm actually quite surprised you knew about her. Though she is a famous one in the last days of Ming Dynasty, she wasn't very well-known amongst the wide array of skilled and respected generals throughout the last 5000 years of Chinese history.
This is an excerpt from her personal biography6 (written by historians slightly after her time). It was a letter she wrote in 1623 to the emperor about the mistreatments she received. It's rather long so I will not do a word-for-word translation, here's the rough one ' I fought brave and hard for the empire, but there are people spreading disharmony and distrust between you (the emperor) and me, and who has never even seen the face of the enemy but dare to boast their power and might. Then when the real enemy comes, they are the same people that will ran in fear without a fight. Such as one official, who after being defeated, went back to the encampment and refused to let me in upon my return. For such a strong and mighty man to be envious and jealous of a mere woman, he should be ashamed,'.
Possible at certain point, but not very likely by the end of her career. I will look at it by going through briefly her whole career as a great general of her time.
So how did the court in general react to her rapid promotions and achievements? Would it have hindered her further promotion to higher duties and titles? Possibly.
