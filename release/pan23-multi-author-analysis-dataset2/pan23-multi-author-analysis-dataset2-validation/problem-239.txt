The relations between the NCOs and enlisted ranks remained hierarchical. Even with in the NCOs, the rank of sergeant and corporal had some degrees of separation. John Williamson wanted sergeants to be among themselves and the corporals likewise. This was to ensure command structure among the enlisted ranks.
To be a NCO, a soldier had to have: experience, can read and write, show mastery of the drill, and capability of command. While a NCO could not command a company, they did however command a platoon or squad in the case of a corporal. The army itself did not have an established time requirement to become one. In the case of corporal, besides a vacancy, one had to have the most experience and proof of drill mastery. For the most part, it would be at least a year before any chance of promotions. For sergeant, one had to be the most senior corporal in the company or regiment. Each company had three corporals and two sergeants. That means with ten companies, thirty corporals and twenty sergeants including the sergeant major. However, seniority did not always mean automatic promotion. The Coldstream Guards put a three month probation on corporals to prove themselves, otherwise the next corporal would get his chance at sergeant. Commanding officers, such as captains, would be the deciding factor of finalizing the promotion.
However, from the standing orders of the Dragoons in 1755, they required that dragoons have four years of experience before being eligible to be corporal, and then three as such for eligibility for sergeant. So far, I have not seen other units employ the same year requirements, but still have moved to ensure competence of the prospective NCO.
your mention of the sergeant major interests me, as i've seen it mentioned but never in much detail- can you shed some light on what duties someone of this rank would be expected to perform?
The sergeant major is the senior most sergeant appointed to this rank. On muster rolls, it does not differentiate from other sergeants of the regiment. The appointment meant it was not a promotion on level that would increase pay, but unfortunately meant additional duties to perform. Each regiment would have one sergeant major, even if a regiment had two battalions within, and the sergeant major would muster under the Colonel's company's numbers.
Lance ranks did exist in the very later parts of the eighteenth century. Lance meaning it was not an official capacity but the soldier would act in the parts. A Lance corporal would technically be a private who had gotten the privilege to stand in as a corporal and have the same duties. However, it could be taken away at will versus a bona fide NCO would have to face a court martial before being officially demoted. These would be temporary ranks and did not increase the soldier's pay for being a lance NCO.
The sergeant major is the closest enlisted soldier to the officers as he part of the officer staff in which he works directly under them. In turn, the sergeant major is in charge of all the NCOs subordinate to him, giving out the duties of the privates but also making sure the NCOs are not neglecting their duties too. They would be present at regimental parades and field days, and ensured the proficiency of the men. If sergeants and corporals were expected to know the drill like the back of their hand, the sergeant major had to know it perfectly and know everything there is to know about the economics of the regiment. In cases of vacancy in quartermaster or adjutant positions, the sergeant major may be asked to take it. Still no extra pay though.
