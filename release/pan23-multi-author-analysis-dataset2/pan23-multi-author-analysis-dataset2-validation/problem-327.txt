(Based on your inclusion of "duke" I am assuming you are focusing your question in Western history).
The major difference between the three is the amount of territory they have under their control, and whether or not they control that territory in someone else's name (not including God). A duke is very high up in the "chain of command" as we could call it, but does not have the status of king. A duke could have vassals under his command controlling lands in the duke's name, while the duke himself would often (but not always) be holding lands in the name of a king. There are exceptions to this allegiance requirement such as can be seen in the Italian city states, where dukes often reigned over small pieces of territory with no king above them. The land that such a duke reigns over is referred to as a duchy, while the king's is a kingdom (see a pattern?). The difference between such a duke and a king comes down to territory and recognition. The tier between a duchy and a kingdom is a principality, which is ruled by a prince (not to be confused with the royal title granted to the legitimate male offspring of a king). A principality is also historically a common type of state in the Italian peninsula.
A king is the sovereign of a state, and may have dukes as vassals (as well as other ranks of individuals such as counts, barons, knights etc.) while a duke would not have other dukes subservient to him without an alliance between two states formed. A king's peers are only other kings, and his superior can only be found in the papacy or an emperor, keeping in mind that some later kings would discard ties to the Vatican and achieve a truer form of sovereignty.
An emperor is trickier because the requirements change over time, as most things do. In pre-eighteenth century Europe to be emperor meant to be the Holy Roman Emperor, which was a title that was granted by the Papacy and not one that was inherited. To best describe an emperor, it is best to acknowledge the other half of your question: What stops any independent ruler from simply claiming the highest possible title for himself ? To become an emperor, one cannot simply declare themselves to possess the title while a single kingdom is all they control. It would cost far too much face and would be a challenge to the status of other kings, assuming the individual in question was a king and not a prince or duke, which would be even more problematic. Asserting oneself as emperor implies that multiple kingdoms are under the control of that single individual, which if it simply were not the case then our new (and false) "emperor" would be laughed at by proper monarchs who knew their own status.
Conversely, not all who reigned over multiple kingdoms assumed the title of Emperor. This assumption of rank changed from state to state. Philip II of Spain for example was certainly in charge of an empire - one of the largest in human history, and was even the son of Charles V, a Holy Roman Emperor, yet he did not claim the title of Emperor for himself. Catherine II of Russia however did claim the title of emperor (Empress in the female rendering) over the Russian Empire. Later in history as the Age of Exploration concluded almost every major European power would at some point be an empire, including Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. These countries all held territories outside of Europe, most notably in Africa and Asia, while claims to territories in the Americas were gradually fading for reasons varying enough to warrant their own threads. But again, things change over time, and because human society was shifting away from monarchies and kings and queens were losing power, monarchs in these states were not always named emperor because they were not in charge of the empire. In the British case we know that Parliament was slowly and steadily gaining power while the monarchs lost power. This is why during World War II, despite the British Empire retraining territories outside of Britain's traditional borders, King George was King George, and not George, Emperor of Britain. Conversely, in the late nineteenth century William I became the head of the German state, which was an empire, and therefor assumed the title of Emperor of Germany.
The major distinction seems to be that if the monarch is the true head of state then they could claim the title of emperor, but cases such as Philip II means that the rules behind who considers themselves emperor or not changed over time. Catherine II and Philip II lived in very different times and different places, and the good historian will always account for even small differences let alone such massive ones.

Ok then, let's take the case of the Duchy of Savoy. They have been elevated from County by the HR Emperor, and have been awarded a few more territories on both sides of the western Alps. Throughout its history, the Duchy has been orbiting between the Spanish and French court, depending on political gains (or inability to prevent other people political interventions on their own affairs). But they had to wait until the 19th century to proclaim themselves Kingdom until they acquired Sardinia, at what point they proclaimed themselves Kingdom of Sardinia even though they would never set foot on the island until Napoleon invaded.
as a followup/focus on the question: why would someone like a sovereign, independent duke like the Milanese Dukes or the Savoy before the kingdom kept being a Duchy and not "promoting" themselves up to Prince or Kingdom? Is there a PR problem towards the once superior Kingdom they are cutting ties with ("I will manage my lands on my own from today on but in exchange I'll remain below you in rank just to keep a facade")?
Conversely, if you are a duke within a kingdom (i.e. there is a king reigning over you) then you do not actually own your lands by any right besides that which the king granted you, or a previous king granted your family. You are holding those lands in the kings name and paying some sort of tax to the king. Furthermore you owe military service to the king, as do your fellow dukes. If you on your own decided that you will take your lands, break ties with the king, and maintain your title as duke, then it is in the king's best interest to stop you immediately lest his other dukes realize that they can just run their own show without the king. Unlike the example of the prince, the king in this scenario would be forced to resort to strenh of arms to resolve this scenario, and the separatist duke would doubtlessly be executed. The king's strenh of arms is completely reliant on his vassals in that his army is going to be raised by these men to fight for the kingdom. This means that if such a duke did want to break away from the kingdom, he would need the assistance of his peers to do so. In other words, breaking away from a kingdom would require other nobles to aid the duke, and engage in rebellion. The duke would never be able to simply break ties with the king. The king became king by being born the son of the previous king, but the king remains king through power (physical, political, etc.). If we consider Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan we can quickly see that the leviathan/tyrant/king needs to be feared to remain in power, and thus most will be unwilling to oppose him openly.
Was it a lack of de iure legitimacy, the not existence of a "Kingdom of Piedmont" that prevented them to crown themselves, or was it because they were barely keeping on with France and Spain and they wouldn't be able to face either should they proclaim themselves their peers (so it means that when they did they felt they could)?
But could he have been able to do so if a Kingdom of Sardinia weren't established yet (or if there have been no other handy de iure Kingdoms available in the area)? The Dukes of Savoy have also been Princes of Acaja since the 12th-13th century but never styled themselves as princes. Was there a need to be granted a de iure title in order for Victor Amadeus II to be crowned king?
So the HR Emperor raises the state to a Duchy, which is Kosher because an Emperor can do that (raises a Count to Duke). The later acquisition of Sicily, and subsequently the exchange of Sicily for Sardinia, put Duke Victor in charge of Sardinia, with the Treaty of Utrecht raising the Duke to King of Sardinia. So Victor was King of Sardinia, but he was also Duke of Savoy. But he did not decide on his own as a Duke that he would now be a king and make Savoy a kingdom. He fought a war and part of the treaty for that war granted him the title of king and a kingdom. Without the Treaty of Utrecht, Victor would not have been able to raise his rank. The Treaty represents legitimacy granted to him by other sovereign bodies, most notably in this case the Dutch Republic, France, and Britain. That recognition grants Victor the ability to go ahead because he knows that these states will treat with him as king. This allows Victor to treat with other kingdoms, as they know that he has political sway and influence within other states. The Treaty is what granted Victor recognition which in turn grants him right to rule.
So the issue there is that while Victor (to stick with our example) was a prince of another territory, but that does not make Savoy a principality. Similarly, when Sardinia was obtained by Victor, Savoy did not become a kingdom. It was ruled by a man who was a king, but that king was the Duke of Savoy, and thus was sovereign of the duchy. Victor could style himself as Prince of Piedmont, but his main source of power was as Duke of Savoy.
