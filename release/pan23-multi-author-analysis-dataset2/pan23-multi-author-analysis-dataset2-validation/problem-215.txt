Sounds like your sister actively choose to leave the home because of the abusive environment created by your parents. The police may not be “cooperating” or escalating from your perspective because they know she is safe somewhere (possibly in a secure space where she’s actively being protected by social workers like at a shelter or youth center or something, or with her BF and have already engaged with a social worker about her home life and whereabouts) and of sound mind and aren’t keen to get involved in a family matter (even if she’s a minor there are definitely cases where police prioritize general safety over the parents desire for them to drag their child home against their will). I anticipate if you change your approach as others have suggested you might learn more about the possibility that the cops will tell you “she’s safe, leave her alone, she’s engaging with the right supports, no we can’t tell you where she is”. I’m not familiar with OK state law, but 16 may not qualify as a endangered minor as far as the cops are concerned in practicality. At that age they likely know that it’s futile to drag her back just for her to run away again.
