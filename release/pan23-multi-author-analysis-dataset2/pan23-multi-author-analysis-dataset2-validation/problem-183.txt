First off, Denmark was not historically under Swedish control. There was a Swedish War (can't remember which of them) that they lost so badly that effectively all of Denmark was occupied except for Copenhagen, but most of the territory was restored after the conflict.
As for controlling the access to it, Denmark actually did that. It was known as Øresundstolden (the Øresund Tariff). It was introduced in 1429 by Erik the 7th of Denmark (aka Erik af Pommern) and was made possible by the Danish control of Helsingør (in modern Denmark) and Helsingborg (in modern Sweden) and the pressence of a fleet garrisson and cannon batteries on each side of the straight. Eventually exceptions were made for the German Hansas.
- in 1639: 620.000 rigsdalere (after further increases introduced by Christian the 4th. This eventually led to bad relations with the Netherlands, who supported Sweden in Torstensson's War between 1643-1645, which resulted in a significant decrease in tariff levels. After another war in 1658 Sweden was entirely exempt until 1720).
The access itself was easy enough, if you just paid up, although the tariffs grew to be so high that they were lowered or ignored as part of peace treaties. It was actually cheaper at one point to transport goods by land to avoid Øresund entirely. This was raised as a concern by some of the merchants in Copenhagen in 1831, which were met with a slight decrease in tariffs. In 1855 the US said that it wasn't particularly fond of the system either and accepted invitations to negotiate a complete stop to the collection. In 1857 a treaty between Denmark, the US, and several of the most active trade nations was agreed upon (likely to avoid diplomatic problems or conflicts with its neighbours). This gave Denmark a one time payment of 33,5 million rigsdalere (about 12 years worth of tariffs at that point) in exchange for the abolition of collecting that specific tariff and a continuation of some services by Denmark.
- at the turn of the century: about 500.000 rigsdalere (the trade expanded to a point that this tariff alone was about 10% of the Danish state's revenue).
If you are interested in the raw numbers, then here are the ones I could quickly find (my sources don't say if it is adjusted for inflation, so I don't know for certain).
TLDR: the traders and nations were really not fans of the tariffs and control exerted by Denmark, so they threw a ton of money at the Danish government in the 19th century to make them drop it. They agreed and that's why it's not controlled anymore.
Wow thank you for your time in writing such a good answer to my, a bit vague question. We don't learn much about this area of history in England, hence my ignorance. I didn't even know enough to ask the right questions so it was hard to get Google to help. I've since been able to find out more about the Sound Dues (tolls you mentioned and it's very interesting).
If you had the time or knowledge - Do you know if people ever tried to sneak by these ports? Or if Denmark ever just cut them off to a county, like a trade sanction?
On page 10 there is a painting and a note of how the authorities offered to tow boats to the booth, at a cost of course, if the winds were not favourable so that no time would be wasted.
The first is particularly well-sourced and published by the Helsingør Museum for Søfart (museum for seafaring). Here are some highlights.
No problem. I suppose I could look it up for you when I have some spare time, and if you have other questions on Scandinavia feel free to ask, I might be able to help you out.
Thank you you've definitely already given me enough that I know what to ask Google I've already been on the wikis about this, and there's some information about the technicalities of it. But I'm also interested in the human side, what was it like being a sea captain going through here ect. Anything you know would be appreciated Cheers!
Hi again. It seems most sources are in the libraries, which are obviously closed, but I did find two extra sources somewhat approaching “the human” perspective – I hope they sate your curiosity a bit. Both of them are in Danish, so if you don’t speak German or similar, I think it’ll be a tough read (but the first article has English notes).
On page 5 it describes that the process of reading the inventories and checking them could mean the ships had to anchor for a day or two, much to the chagrin of captains.
On page 15 there is an example of a published pamphlet detailing how the tolls were calculated and how much the categories would be charged. There were also several privately translated pamphlets by traders to several languages, so their countrymen knew what to make of it all.
On pages 18 to 20 there is a short account of two traders who passed through the toll booths and their inventories, but it is mostly just about what they sold.
There is currently a collaboration between the Dutch Rijksuniversiteit Groningen and the Danish Rigsarkivet to digitize the latter's 700+ volumes of notes and calculations:
