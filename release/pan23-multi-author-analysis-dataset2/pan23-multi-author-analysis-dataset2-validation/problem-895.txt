Under Federal Law, you remain on the payroll for as long as they withhold your paycheck. File a complaint with the Labor Board, which will probably take about three months to process. Delaying the return of the laptop may extend your employment period.
(d) Repayment of employer losses, including for spoilage and breakage, cash shortages, and fines or penalties incurred by the employer through the conduct of the employee.
For what its worth I'm not entirely sure it would be an employer loss, but even if its not an employer loss it is still covered by the regulations which also prohibit deductions for equipment necessary to do the job under subsection (b).
The remotely possible exception is if you legitimately signed some form of document (could've been referred to as anything, really) that gives the employer a leg to stand on.
This is, legally speaking, difficult to do as even a slight mistake in the document's strict wording would render it unhelpful to the employer, and most employers aren't even savvy enough to attempt this or to have foresight enough to accomplish it.
However, this is a warning that there does exist the low-but-nevertheless-non-zero possibility that this employer is in the right.
As a practical matter, even if they do indeed possess this particular gotcha, I wouldn't suggest being unnecessarily timid because of it. Within the best-possible light, this is still a dick move by them.
