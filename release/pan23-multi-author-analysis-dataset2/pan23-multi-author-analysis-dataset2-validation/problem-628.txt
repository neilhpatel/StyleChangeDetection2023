I don't make wages. I'm disabled and surviving on $800 a month. I was trying to crawl out of that situation through investing and it was actually going very well but it's starting to look like the stars have aligned out of my favor.
If they sue you, based on the financial situation you describe here you may be “judgement proof.” Essentially meaning that they cannot collect. Social security disability benefits are protected and can’t be garnished. Your homestead and vehicle (one for each licensed driver in home) can’t be seized. When your income and property is exempt, there isn’t much the plaintiff can take from you if they successfully sue you. Warning though that if you mix your exempt SSD money with, for example, your grandmothers not exempt earned wages in one bank account, your SSD income loses its exempt status because it’s been mixed with non exempt money.
Well since you have no money their options to collect from you are limited. At this point there really isn't anything you can do. Let the chips fall where they may.
