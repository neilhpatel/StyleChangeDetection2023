Union leaders say the strike is meant to draw more attention to rules requiring that members work three weekends per month and sleep away from home for more than 10 nights per month.
The conductors' union met twice with management without progress before the strike. Other unions joined in support, and have filed strike notice for both the Christmas and New Year's weekends to put pressure on SNCF.
Or is the real issue the workers want to be reclassified so that they qualify to form their own official union?
So is this strike about money alone? What does it mean exactly to give the strikers more "recognition"?
It appears to be about working conditions rather than pay, so money isnt the issue. It's strange though, I can't actually remember an instance of a Trade Union objecting to industrial action organised by its own members.
The ticket inspector's argument is that the 600 euro a year bonus and 12% pay raise over the next 2 years is not enough when their salary is already so low.
An inspector with 22 years of experience earns 1864.19 euro gross per month, with a bonus payment of 425 euro gross (I'm not sure if this bonus is monthly or annual). According to the SNCF, between 2012-2015 an on-board customer service agents in the middle of their career earned 2400 per month, station managers earned 30,996 euro annually, and drivers earned 34,741 annually. And that's before including the bonus. The French government statistics website INSEE says that the average net salary in the private sector was 16.30 euro per hour in 2020. At a 35 hour week, that's a net salary of 2282 per month, so yes it would seem that ticket inspectors are being underpaid.
And that's how we keep wages suppressed, when we buy into the idea that salaries are fairly paid according to whether a job is 'skilled' or 'unskilled'.
Secondly, the railway company already pays other employees higher salaries even though they don't require a university degree to perform their duties either.
And that's before we look at the idea that we now require university level education for jobs that didn't need it in the past. If we used the United States as an example, 44% of job ads state that a 4 year degree is a job requirement. Since 1980 the cost of going to college has increased by 169% while graduate salaries have only risen by 19%. Between 1979 and 2020 salaries increased by only an average of 17. 5% while productivity rose by 61.8%.
Therefore the idea that having more than a high school level of education means your job is more 'skilled' and therefore you will earn more money is not true.
It would be better to stop believing in the myth that we have skilled and unskilled labour as its just a tool to turn us against each other to keep wages down. If these ticket inspectors get their demands from this strike then that means the money was already there to give it to them.
Of course it does. For one because of inflation. If your salary stayed static for 22 years then it would be worth significantly less than when you started.
Here is a source about wage suppression for people born after 1980 in France to see that it's not only an American phenomenon -.
