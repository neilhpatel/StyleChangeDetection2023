If the house was listed as including a dishwasher, you may ask the seller to pay for a new one. Talk to your realtor. This is one of the reasons you pay a realtor.
If it was listed in the ad for the house, but not in the contract, it might be more difficult to get them to pay. Talk to your realtor.
All that said, it depends on how much your time and effort and stress is worth. They may buy a replacement dishwasher after a few weeks or months. Our you can go out and buy a higher quality one yourself and not have to deal with it.

Title: I bought a house that was listed with a dishwasher, but it is non-functioning. Do I have any recourse?
All real estate transactions are caveat emptor: buyer beware. Basically once you sign the closing docs, the house is yours with all the problems and issues. This is why inspections are always so important, as is some extra funds for things that do break.
Unfortunately inspections, even with a very good inspector, are limited in their a scope. They simply just canâ€™t find every problem even if they were there for 8 hours.
