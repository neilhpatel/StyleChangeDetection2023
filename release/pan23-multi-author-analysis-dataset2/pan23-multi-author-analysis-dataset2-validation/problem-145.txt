Once you file the paperwork to start the divorce proceedings, you can probably also file a motion requesting that the court limit your wife’s access to the marital home since she’s moved out. The motion you’re most likely to receive would be a temporary order for her to only enter the house during certain times or at a scheduled time agreeable to you both so that she can collect things she left behind. She would still have rights to the house and its value - if you sell it, this order wouldn’t affect how much she would get from the sale. Without any such order, she can come and go as she pleases. Unless the court finds she’s abusive and you need a restraining order, you’re unlikely to permanently or totally ban her from the premises. Be reasonable in your motion - you’re worried about her being there when you’re not there, not that you’re trying to prevent her from accessing her personal items (chattel) that might still be in the house.
Hahaha, those pesky rights of property ownership. She also has the right to move back in at any time with the dude of her choice. Or just bring him by to have a look around.
I’m not in your state but I do practice family law, so it’s worth checking out on your state’s websites or with a PA lawyer.
