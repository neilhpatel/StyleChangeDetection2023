I called another fact check kind of lame for presenting "needs context" fact checks of factual claims as if they were catching Biden in something. The way this fact check does it is much better. A lot of their checks provide additional context and possible counterpoints, but all of the fact checks start by answering the central question: is the claim accurate? Only then do they go into a more nuanced analysis of political interpretations and the like. I approve of this format.
