You're probably thinking of the upcoming "" requirement, which requires a more-secure ID document (driver's license or State ID), and those more-secure ID documents include a record of your citizenship. The reliable citizenship information is what makes them suitable for travel to Canada or Mexico without a passport, but it's the anti-forgery aspects that will make them suitable for domestic air travel.
It takes money and equipment to do the REAL ID background checks and create the REAL ID documents themselves, so many states dragged their feet and the Federal government gave them extensions on the deadline repeatedly. With the COVID crisis, the Federal government pushed the deadline out again, to May 3, 2023. I fully expect the deadline to be extended again after that final, final, emergency extension only, final deadline.
If your Oklahoma learner's permit has a photo, it will be sufficient to fly domestically until May 2023.
When you are ready to get your driver's license, proving your identity, citizenship, and residency and choose to get the REAL-ID compliant version.
Either get regular state ID or just go to the airport. TSA can verify your identity using other means. If you have any picture ID have it with you. Also add some extra time (additional 30-40 minutes).
You mention you're flying from Oklahoma. Provided your permit was issued after June 28th, 2020, it'll either have the star on it, or it'll say "NOT FOR REAL ID PURPOSES" in it's place.
Does your learners permit have a Real ID star on it? Your learners permit is good for federal identification as long as it's one with the Real ID star on it.
