NAL, but I am a doctor. Were you consented for tubal ligation as well as the Caesarian? If not then it’s probable that they’ll argue that they performed the operation that you had consented for. If tubal ligation was on the consent form then you have a much better case. As I understand it, though, you’ll have to demonstrate financial damages, which I imagine will be from the extra time off work that you’ll need. This probably won’t be that long for a straightforward laparoscopic tubal ligation. It might well be that even if you could demonstrate that you suffered damages they probably won’t reach the level that would interest a medical malpractice lawyer to take your case on contingency.
Make sure you take copies of each bill (facility, OB, anesthesiologist, etc) to your lawyer too. Make sure you didn't get charged for services (the tubal ligation) that were not performed. It may be a good idea to ask your lawyer if you should request an itemized bill.
I filled out an entire separate set of paperwork for the tubal ligation at 20 weeks pregnant. I was surprised that he said all he needed was for me to fill it out at the time as I had expected some type of push back or an attempt to get me not to get it done. I'm honestly more upset that I have to undergo another recovery when I should be almost done at this point. Thank you You bring up good points about the finances as well.
This is also a good point as he sent me to get it done by a different doctor. Now I have to get another consultation appointment before the surgery can be scheduled and its even more waiting for something that should have been done by him.
In addition to the possibility of malpractice, I'd also ask about the possibility of a contract claim. Your doctor agreed to perform two services for you but performed only one of them, leading to increased costs for you for the procedure, additional time off from work, etc.
This is another good point The doctor they sent me to doesn't accept my insurance So when I called them back to tell them that they tried to tell me I was basically on my own, until I brought up that it should have been done but the doctor forgot. Then they magically had the other doctors they network with that accept the insurance and sent me there.
