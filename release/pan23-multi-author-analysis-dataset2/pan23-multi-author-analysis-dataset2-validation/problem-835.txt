The scientific method is not really a "thing." This is one of those things that historians of science know, and people who study the actual operation of science know (anthropologists, sociologists, etc.), but everybody else is sort of gob-smacked to hear, because we use the idea of a "scientific method" as a pedagogical way to teach students how to think critically and to believe that the success of science is due to some kind of straightforward methodological principle. (This is easily the highest ratio "thing everyone in my field knows to most shock outsiders have when hearing it" thing for the History of Science as a discipline.).
Wow, I had no idea the way I thought about scientists was so factually flawed. Would you mind explaining what exactly is flawed with the way science is taught in detail, and maybe how it ought to be taught? You’ve already gone into a bit of detail, but I’d love to hear more.
“There is a good deal of ballyhoo about scientific method,” Percy Bridgman wrote; though, as he shrewdly observed, “the people who talk most about it are the people who do least about it.”.
But what is taught as the "scientific method" is a post-hoc rationalization that has nothing to do with how scientific work is actually done by actual scientists, and certainly is not responsible for the rise of Western (or any other) science. Even the idea that science exists or progresses primarily on the basis of "tests" is not taken that seriously by historians of science; it certainly doesn't apply to why people started believing one idea over another (there was no true test for heliocentrism until the 19th century, yet astronomers had converted to Copernicanism long before that), and there are plenty of fields of science that don't rely on falsifiable experiments to guide their work (very few ideas are truly falsifiable in a simple way, anyway).
Which is a bummer, I know, but understanding that at the beginning can open up one to actually looking into what has made science successful and what (if anything) makes it a privileged way of understanding the world.
What you are really asking, stripped of the erroneous assumption of the question, is what _epistemologies_ did different people use? How did they decide that they "knew" something? And the answer... is going vary dramatically by the place and time. The Ancient Greeks prided abstract deduction as the ultimate form of knowledge making; you knew something if you could deduce it from sensible (in their mind) axioms. Copernicus appears driven both by a sense of aesthetics and a predilection towards sun worship. Galileo and Boyle privileged knowledge gained from experimental machines (instruments), to much controversy from others who were unsure whether such things could teach one about the natural world. Einstein privileged a sense of "completeness" and was suspicious of anything that went against this (like quantum mechanics). I pick these three very disparate examples just as a way of illustrating how different epistemological considerations can range. There are other things one could look at, such as whether they consider algebraic proof sufficient as a way to learn about physical knowledge (yes for Einstein, no for most others), whether they think experiment truly has the last word (yes for Boyle, not so firmly yes for Einstein, definitely no for the Greeks), what the goal of scientific discovery is, and so on. These things shift by time and place and person. It is only in textbooks and popularizations that these differences get smoothed out into some kind of coherent expression of the same impulse and method.
What we tend to think of as the rise of science is less about a formal epistemological method and more a set of assumptions about how the world works, what kinds of questions are going to be useful ones, and the social arrangements that allow for systematic ways of attacking these questions from many different angles. It also includes assumptions about what the point of such things are, and ideas like, "you can resolve differences by writing up your ideas and attacking other ideas, even the ideas of dead people." All of which we sort of take for granted today, but this very simple idea was not present for most of human history, and there were civilizations that had something like science that lacked this.
Anyway — there is no simple answer to this issue, because it is at the core of the serious study of the history of science, as well as the philosophy and sociology of science. But I hope I have given you a little illustration of why an obsession with a "method" is not the right answer. The idea of there being a "scientific method" is mostly a 20th century pedagogical idea, and a rhetorical weapon deployed by people who believe that scientific authority is better than other forms of authority (religious, political, whatever). One can agree with the project of such people without succumbing to the bad history that they deploy to advance it.
In terms of recommending things to read, if you are philosophically inclined, Kuhn's _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ is usually what people read first on this. It is not where one's views should _stop_, but it is a fairly good place to start, because Kuhn frames the stakes and underlying issues very well. In terms of the history, Shapin's _The Scientific Revolution_ does quite a lot of myth-slaying in a very concise book, and it is well-written, so it is also a good place to start.
A good paper against the unfortunate results of the pedagogical attitude, which I often recommend to students, is Susan Haack's Six Signs of Scientism. It even has a handy list! With preoccupation with the "scientific method" as point nr 4.
Okay, so apparently scientists don’t really use the apparently made-up scientific method. In that case, why was I (and presumably others) taught that Sir Francis Bacon invented the scientific method?
Which is only to say, it serves several different pedagogical aims, none of which are about understanding history on its own terms, all of which are about trying to turn you into a particular kind of student and/or citizen.
The myth of the scientific method, and really of the "Scientific Revolution" (historians don't really believe in that, either, at least not the version you were taught), is part of how Western (and maybe more) education indoctrinates you into believing that the success of the West is due to some kind of superior knowledge (and not, say, more mundane and possibly quite temporally-limited factors), that scientific knowledge is a special form of knowledge that sits above other kinds (which you may or may not agree with, but false history isn't the way to argue for that), and gives you a model for critical thinking that isn't _terrible_ but is not actually very useful when you are looking at fields of work with significant unknowns (which is why you mostly only use the "scientific method" to study things that have already been studied before, which is what makes up the bulk of science education prior to graduate school work).
There are _many_ myths taught to people, even scientists, about the history of science, and they generally boil down to an answer like the above, though some are more specific (e.g., teaching you that science is about a parade of geniuses over time is a way to give you a model of what it means to be a "scientist" even if it is not a very good model of how history works). They always serve a function by the people who make these curricula or push these ideas, and some of those functions are what we might think of as benign (like getting people to respect science), but some are less so (like the historical ties between the idea of Scientism and Western Imperialism).
Well, "how it ought to be taught" is a fraught question, because again the way it is currently taught does serve pedagogical functions even if it is not strictly true. And you will find that if you look into how _many_ subjects are taught, and many forms of history, there is a disconnect between what the experts know about it and what we teach people who are not experts.
But in terms of coming to a more accurate descriptive approach to science historically and in the past — this is what the disciplines of science studies and the history of science try to do. The history of science looks carefully at how what we call science developed over a vast amount of time. It sees "science" as a changing entity, a form of human culture and society, and something that changes in the various historical contexts it exists. Which is to say, it regards "science" more like we typically regard "art" or "politics" and not as something "outside of human society." There is no singular "science" in this model — knowledge-production has taken many different forms over the years.
Anyway — there is no single snappy answer other than the rather vague ones I've given. When I teach introductory courses in science studies and the history of science we look at many examples that reinforce this sense of science as an interesting though very-human part of society and culture, and look at its rise as a profession in the relatively modern world, and look at the way this view of science changes our understanding of how science and society are interlinked. It is a view that can be either disturbing (some see it as undermining the authority of scientific claims to knowledge) or empowering (some see it as providing a way to think more critically about knowledge systems in general, and it allows you to answer questions like "what would we want to do, as a society, if we wanted scientific knowledge to be better in some domains?" in a way that the "method" approach does not).
