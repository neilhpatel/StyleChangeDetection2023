Where are you located? Generally speaking, a doctor's note caries no legal weight. As for COVID and other things, people (including pregnant women) are being vaccinated. But to be clear, are you the only person who does what you do, in your unit?
There’s only one of us staffed in the ER. And there’s no other person around us to take symptomatic patients.
That's why I was asking, because you wrote "there’s no other person around us to take symptomatic patients." Suggesting you are the only person who can do it. But in any case, you do not have an accommodation request that the hospital has to honor. They have to give you proper PPE and between that and vaccines there's no reason you need to get infected, millions of healthcare workers have worked directly with known COVID patients every day without getting infected. The hospital need to follow proper protocols of course.
I’m guessing your job is or is similar to a Respiratory Therapist. You are requesting to not cover an ED while we are in the midst of a respiratory pandemic and EDs are understaffed. It would be hard to convince most employers that is a reasonable accommodation.
You mention other pregnant employees get alternative assignments, but do any of those people have your same job title and are making the same request? The depth of staffing resources differs dramatically between positions at a hospital. For example, you can’t equate flexibility given to a phlebotomist with your request because the job pool and duties are different.
Other home units, other medical conditions, other accommodation requests, etc., are not comparable to your situation.
Know, however, that there may be other things pertaining to their situation which you aren’t privy to. Immunization status, comorbid diagnoses, etc. may make their requests more reasonable than yours.
