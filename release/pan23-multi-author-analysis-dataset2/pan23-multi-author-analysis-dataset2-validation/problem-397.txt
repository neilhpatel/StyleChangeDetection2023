Hypothetical questions go there. This sub is for people personally dealing with current legal problems.
Unless you are personally, currently dealing with a cease and desist, the off topic is more appropriate.
That I've got planned but as it's an international issue currently i hope to throw it open to a more international crowd while at the same time asking for myself.
IP laws vary, sometimes wildly, around the world. While similarities exist, each specific location this is occurring in may have a different answer.
If you're in the USA, the "best" answer is to have an IP attorney advising you on whether or not your models/prints infringe someone's IP or not, and have that attorney ready to respond (and potentially litigate) if a copyright holder thinks it does.
I'm in Denmark but the advice stands and something I'm definitely going to look into, also whether we have a US or UK variation of recovering legal fees (in the UK the winner does automatically, the US you can but only if the state has anti-slap legislation).
What I'm hoping for, and probably won't get, is a feel for the laws internationally. If it's a UK company filing suit I'm not sure if it would be in a UK court or a Danish court for example.
