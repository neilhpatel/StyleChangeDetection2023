Understood. Knowing they’re stupidly planning to travel to a state with far stricter rules than where they live, I’m mostly concerned that if they go through with their plans and get caught with fraudulent cards in NY their kids will be stranded with no family able to get them. But I guess the likelihood of them getting caught is pretty low unless they do something extremely stupid.
So what happens if the FBI shows up and he just says he doesn’t have a vaccine card at all? Is it better to direct them to his employer who may have a copy? I thought there was a database large employers were supposed to use to confirm their validity, but I guess I was wrong.
Edit: it seems like your link was more about reporting the people who are making/selling fake vaccine cards. I know the idiot isn’t smart enough to make them himself, so will the FBI even care?
They may choose to continue to investigate, or they may drop it - it's impossible to say. Generally, they're going to be looking for the people actually selling the fake vaccine cards, but they have a place to send tips in the link I posted and it's the best option for right now. They'll choose if they want to contact his employer.
