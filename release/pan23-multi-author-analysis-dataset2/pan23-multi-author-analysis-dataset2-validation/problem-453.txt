1.) Yes, you can be sued. Your insurance company will likely handle it for you under a legal process called "subrogation" if you notify them of it, which I would sooner rather than later just to be safe.
I’m in a pickle because apparently I’m not on the insurance (my father owns the car). Does this change things?
2.) You can be sued for, at the very least, all the medical bills he incurred from the accident you caused, and any pain and suffering he might be able to prove (which is always a nebulous concept, but I don't think it would be NOTHING here). You could counter to reduce negligence with the facts you pointed out about his culpability, but obviously in a car vs. scooter argument people in a trial generally have more sympathy for the scooter, so this isn't me saying or not saying you should go to war on this.
Well, it might mean the insurance will try to argue they're not responsible for the claim. But that's something you talk to the insurance about. At worst, it means you have to pay for a lawyer yourself, and it means that you don't have the money of the insurance company to fall back on to offer to settle. Then again, you're far from the first person to be driving their dad's car under his insurance without being an insured driver and life has continued to go on in these cases, so it's not like your situation is unheard of.
