Oh it will. His followers will say "he made the best out of a bad situation" which is absolute bullshit. If people think he's got this in the bag it's going to be a rude awakening. I'm not saying he will lose, but it's gonna be a tough race for him. I think it's gonna be a super low voter turnout this next election. A lot of people, including me, have just lost all hope in our government as a whole. That union thing was the nail in the coffin for a lot of us.
that'll probably come back to bite him on election day. at which point his party will get mad at millennials and genZ instead of take a serious look at the causes & what could be done better next time.
don't even be that optimstic. when he loses, it'll play out like hillary -- all young people's and progressives' fault, dem candidates can never fail or make bad decisions, they'll run the same exact type of worthless milquetoast old "moderate" who spent most of his career agreeing with republicans in 2028.
Modern conservatives hate anyone with a D next to their name and he took office during the middle of a bungled pandemic. It's not exactly surprising, especially when there's a lot of morons yelling both sides because they can't tell the difference between fascism and a moderate.
