Yes, it sounds like the people with three cars are out of compliance. There's nothing prohibiting them from letting that rule slide while still prohibiting outbuildings.
Unless you have some other designated parking, it sounds to me like they intend for homeowners to only keep 2 vehicles at the property. Depending on how the Board's enforcement policy is followed, this is probably intended as a prohibition against a 3rd vehicle parked within the association.
If you built the barn/shed in violation of the outbuilding prohibition, they would just force you to demo it at your expense, maybe plus some punitive fine(s). They don't have to catch you in the act. If they find out you built a shed, they can begin enforcement.
Ok that is what I was wondering. I didnt know if they werent enforcing one rule could they continue enforcing others.
It sounds more like if they enforced the 3 vehicle rule on me but not others that would be illegal but one rule can be lax if it is lax for everyone while enforcing other rules, is that what I am understanding?
If they aren't enforcing a prohibition against parking in driveways or parking on the street, then that indicates that the board interprets the garage parking differently, or has chosen to not enforce it altogether.
I certainly wouldn't take the risk of building a structure in clear violation to solve a questionable parking violation issue. However, if you have the space and money for it, you may consider adding on to your garage to accommodate 4 vehicle parking. You would just need to get board approval and (probably) city permits first.
