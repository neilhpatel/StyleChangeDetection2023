I would say that it's a globe from between 1947 and 1954, as India and Pakistan are shown as independent, but French Indochina is still "Indochina".
I suspect the idea of showing Germany and Korea as single countries is that they were more-or-less considered to be under temporary occupation until a final international settlement was reached.
I see that Beijing is transliterated as "Peiping", which apparently was a standard transliteration under the Republic of China until 1949, and Thailand is labeled as "Siam", which was the international name until 1939, and again from 1946 to 1948. So assuming that the globe was labeled accurately, we can date it to somewhere between 1947 and 1949.
I would also note that the both Tibet and Mongolia are shown as something like autonomous regions of China, but with borders that look a bit inaccurate.
In this, Germany is depicted with post-1945 borders, but not yet depicting the division of the country into German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). That division was formalized in 1949, so this map represents the four powers occupation period. Though, the globe might be as late as 1950 before they revised the manufacturing to recognize the change.
edit- /u/poastertoaster, could you take a photo of Ethiopia region? I can see that Eritrea is depicted as separate from Ethiopia. Determining if the globe labels Eritrea as British protectorate/occupied area or not _might_ help confirm it is before 1952, or if manufacturer is making a stylistic choice to depict Germany and Korea as unified countries despite political realities as /u/Kochevnik81 states.
