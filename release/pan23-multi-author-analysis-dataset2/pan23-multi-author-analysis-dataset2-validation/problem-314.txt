It's illegal to fire someone for filing a workers comp claim. He needs to file a workers comp claim asap. How to do this depends on the location.
That is 100% correct. You have no right to go to the story and once you have been banned you can be arrested if you go back.
A private company can ban you for any reason, or no reason at all (caveats for protected classes aside). You are not likely to ever get any form of compensation for being banned from the store.
Omg, I’m sorry: “Can someone get fired if they ask for worker’s compensation and is it worth it to get it?”, also “Is it ilegal for a manager to tell someone to not get worker’s compensation?” I really don’t know anything on the subject sorry (my friend is not a minor).
That said, your friend should know that as you said, depending on your state (assuming this is in the US) it may be illegal for an employer to retaliate against an employee for filing workers' compensation and/or to threaten them in order to try to prevent them from filing.
