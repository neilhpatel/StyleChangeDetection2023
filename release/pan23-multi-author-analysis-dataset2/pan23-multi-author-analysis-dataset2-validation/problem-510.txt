Please be sure to mark your calendars for the full series, . Next up is Volume XII on Jan. 26th, spanning 1868 CE to 1959 CE.
First up are three messages printed in the paper during the last months of 1870, and they are connected to the siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian war. During the siege the Parisians used balloons to send important personnel and mail out of the city to reach the departments of France to control the conduct of the war. I have taken articles from the paper and translated them into english so they will be available to all of you. Hopefully you find them as funny and fascinating as I do.

So mail by balloon, a new and novel way of sending mail! This kind of information seem to gain great interest among the readers and population at the time. News by balloon are usually marked in the paper as “sent by balloon” or such. There are also some reactions in the social life of the people as well. The next message is a piece taken from a column in the paper that complains about the new balloon mail being all the rage.
The impact of these balloons seems to reach even the salons of Stockholm such as they were. Clearly Paris still is all the rage, and manages to stay relevant even while encircled and closed off from the world. A feat worthy of remembering at least in my eyes. The next message gives information on the first “landing” of an aerial vessel in Norway. \[3\] A balloon that started it journey in Paris the 24th of November 1870 and after a long and arduous journey crashed in southern Norway.
\[5\] Krødsherad county about 65km or 40miles in a straight line from the capital.The actual landing/crash took place on the mountain Lifjell but the news of the areonauts spread from Krødsherad..
\[6\] Mandal is a town on the southern coast of Norway, presumably the ballon passed here according to the message from Oslo.
Further study in some Norwegian libraries got me more on the story of the balloon and its aeronauts. The name of the balloon was La ville d'Orléans and during the night of the 24th the two men piloting the balloon, Paul Rolier and León Bélzier found that the balloon was losing height in a thick fog when suddenly they encountered land in the form of a Norwegian hillside. The two men abandoned the “landed” balloon and preceded by foot down the hill until they found a small cottage. Upon entering the house they found no people but a matchbox upon which the words “made in Norway” where printed. This told them where they had landed. They followed some tracks they found in the snow and arrived in a small community to great surprise by the locals. Hailed as heroes and adventurers along the way by enthusiastic crowds they traveled to the capital and there delivered their mail to the French consulate. \[9\] Certainly quite the adventure….
Lastly I have to include my favorite gem from the newspaper. This is a short article that brings news to the reader about the increased reading of the bible in the swedish town of Helsingborg in Scania, Sweden. The writer seems worried about the situation and even makes some sweeping remarks about people from the district Småland, while the town of Helsingborg is situated in Scania and thus in the wrong place. Perhaps the stress of the writer is clouding his or hers memory of Swedish geography...
Please keep in mind that I am by no means a professional translator, and English is my second language. The source material is also not a modern text and this creates some tough choices. I have tried to maintain the feeling of the original text and keep the translation close to the original so if it reads like a terrible mix of english and swedish please excuse my translation and the odd sentence structure of the original writers. The Brackets "\[\]" mark footnotes or titles that i have added to the text, Italics in the translations point to a foreign language (usually french). The translated messages are separated by reddits quote blocks. Citation marks and punctuation is kept as close to the original text as possible. The footnotes with comments regarding the translations are kept right below the translated paragraps, while litterature and sources can be found att the bottom of the text. Now that the disclaimers and introductions are taken care of, let's start with an introduction to the french balloon mail that was hot off the presses a thursday morning in 1870.
\[10\] Pigor, are young girls and women serving on farms, a female equivalent of a farmhand. Maid is not the sharpest translation...
One of the cases that I'm currently working on keeps cracking me up. It seems like something out of a historical satire. A Baron Munchausen type thing. "Murder on the High Seas: Except the ship is not on the high seas and its attempted murder: The Musical.".
Hi! I saw the floating feature and have been waiting for my chance to chime in with some stories from my work with my masters in history. I work with newspapers and transport history in Sweden & Northern Europe during the 19th century. During my work on my paper i have stumbled on some nuggets that i would like to share with the community. These articles were printed in the paper Stockholms Dagblad, a daily newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden published between 1824 and 1931.
\[11\] Småland (literally tiny-land) is a province in Sweden which is known for several rebellions and its tough local farmers that do not want to be bothered by kings and other bigwigs. The province is hilly and forested and made for strong natural defences. Notable conflicts are the Dacke war and the Scanian war. Both saw harsh fighting in the province.
\[12\] The writer is pointing towards the “tradition” of rebels and highway robbery that Småland was historically known for. Why this should apply to a city in Scania is up to the reader to figure out.
Clearly this “sanitary” problem is best to leave to the proper authority. This message is so close to an angry note left in the communal laundry that I was stunned. It follows a common theme, say what is wrong, state that this leads to chaos and the degradation of society. And end by stating that this is unsanitary and then appealing to a higher instance for a solution. Hopefully you found these little glints of a newspapers best golden kernels as entertaining as i did when i found them. Some other notable examples is the “Discovery of a new paradise - in America.”\[13\] that tells the readers about Yosemite and its wonders. “Female telegraph workers in Russia” \[14\] and “Electrical Ringing-Devices” \[15\]. The source for the articles is the paper Stockholms Dagblad, and for the interested it is digitised and searchable at the National Library of Sweden's homepage.

So, the details. A US ship was docked in Santiago de Cuba in 1884. Not a big ship, about 8 crew, plus officers. Naturally, the crew got some leave and some of them went ashore, as sailors do. One of them, a German named George Row, got drunk and came back to the ship, screaming and railing about how he is going to kill everyone on board. He sobered up, apologized to the Captain, and said it won't happen again. Another day went by, he got drunk, again, and threatened to kill everyone on board, again. So, he's clearly got something on his mind.
This time, George grabbed a razor, grabbed the cook, for some reason, and slit his throat. Maybe the cook was really bad at his job. Except, he did not slit his throat. Poor George can't seem to do anything right. He cut the cook's neck, but managed not to hit the windpipe or the jugular. The police returned, arrested the man again, and carried him off to prison for real this time.
After the second incident the captain went to get the police, who were not thrilled about having to do some work, but can't let this sort of thing go on. They found George, actively NOT killing people, in a bar. They arrested him and dragged him away. Somehow, George escaped the police before they get to the prison, ran back to the ship, and started making murder threats a third time.
During the Peninsular War, Fernando VII, King of Spain, was captured and replaced by Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, who became King in 1808. While his authority was not recognized by the Council of Sevilla, the governing body of Spain, Fernando's imprisonment made something clear to the criollos of el Río de la Plata: the Spanish crown was weakened and they lacked the resources to effectively stop a revolution, if one were to happen.
