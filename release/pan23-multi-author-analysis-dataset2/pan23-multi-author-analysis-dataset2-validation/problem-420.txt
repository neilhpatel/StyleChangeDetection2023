You have an obligation to preserve evidence you reasonably know may be the subject of a lawsuit. You 'knew' once the neighbor asked for it. You can be held liable for the consequences, which is the inability to find/convict the real criminals. As to deleting/destroying it and lying about it - that depends on what they can prove if you get sued over it, but the consequences would be worse for you.
Given that you're obligated to do it anyway, maybe consider this an opportunity to smooth relations over with your neighbor, regardless of who was at fault for the dispute. Maybe he ends up being less of a jerk to you in response.
Turn the video over to the police when they come knocking with a warrant or subpoena. Don’t do anything to delete the footage until then. The neighbor made you aware of the crime and the fact that the police were notified, and you confirmed that you had video. Playing fuck fuck games is a good way to earn yourself a lot of trouble you don’t want. Any of the scenarios you described could result in you getting charged with obstruction or destruction of evidence.
On top of that, even if you hate your neighbor, do you really want a criminal running around your neighborhood who could possibly victimize you or someone you don’t hate next?
Can you cite where it would be a crime to delete video before it was requested? I'm looking for law its a crime to delete evidence even if done before formally requested. I'm not worried about being a victim i have enough fire power and body armor for a small army but at the same time i really hate this Asshole neighbor and the aiding them in anyway just bothers me. I'm glad it happened to him and it goes against my religious beliefs to aide him in anyway.
I'm not trying to be difficult but you don't understand how much i hate this person. He could be at my door begging to save him from dying and i'd slam the door on his face and tell him to not only to quit wasting my time and to die faster but do it off my property so i dont have to pay for cleanup.
