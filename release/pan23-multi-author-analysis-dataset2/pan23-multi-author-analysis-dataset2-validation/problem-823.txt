There is an ongoing decipherment project in which a pair of objects has begun to yield results leading to it being called a Rosetta Stone. That is the decipherment of the khipus, a writing system tied in knots that developed in the Andes over a thousand years ago, and the "Rosetta Stone" is the two Collata khipus. Khipus are writing tied in knots instead of carved in stone or written in ink. While they first appear during the Wari period (roughly AD 600-1100), they are most famous for their use during the Inca Empire (1438-1533).
Around 1300 khipus, usually assumed to date to the Inca period but rarely carbon dated, still exist today. The "typical" khipu consists of a top cord with pendant cords hanging down from it. These cords can be made of cotton but also of animal fibers such as camelid furs. Knots are tied into the cords at different intervals, which is the main way that khipus encoded information. Some khipus appear colourless today, though this can be a preservation issue in cotton, while others were dyed.
The Inca used khipus for a variety of purposes. Most famously, khipus were used for accounting. The Inca ran a vast empire which at its height was the size of the Western Roman Empire. Their economy was redistributive, so accurate record-keeping was essential to mantaining the proper flow of goods. The decimal system was deciphered by Leland Locke in the 1920s. While this allowed us to read the numbers on many khipus, it still doesn't tell us anything about the context of what those numbers meant, and it also leaves a whole group of non-numeric khipus unintelligible.
Because the khipus weren't just used for accounting, even though this is a persistent myth. Spanish chroniclers also reported that the Inca used khipus to record their histories, literature, and correspondence. While many academics used to proclaim that khipu use had stopped when the Spanish burned all the Inca khipus in the 16th century, we know now that this is not true. When the Spanish arrived in Peru and conquered the Incas, some of them tried to adapt non-numeric khipus for similar usages in the new colonial context. The Mercedarians are a religious order who were particularly involved in khipu use in the Andes. They used khipus to teach the Lord's Prayer and the catechism, and they taught the Indigenous people how to use khipus to make confessions. Herders also continued making khipus to keep track of their flocks. Some Andean communities continued to make and read khipus until the early 20th century and still use them for ritual purposes (without being able to read them) today.
In 1783, Collata and the neighbouring village San Pedro de Casta (today most famous for its alleged UFO sightings) were involved in a Native insurrection led by Felipe Velasco Tupa Inca Yupanki, who claimed that his brother was an Inca pretender hiding out in the rainforests. Yupanki was captured and executed by the Spanish before their planned siege of Lima could take place, but Spanish archives hold over a thousand pages of unpublished testimonies about the revolts, giving Hyland a great deal of information to work with when attempting to situate the Collata khipus into the context of the revolt. While many local leaders were implicated in alphabetic letters intercepted by the Spanish, no alphabetic letters were found implicating the Collata leadership, whose khipu communication was never found, so they escaped persecution.
In short, Hyland learned from the village elders which ayllus (lineages) sent and received the letters, then used local Quechua colour words to determine that these khipu cords were phonetic. This is the first decipherment of an element of a khipu since Leland Locke's in the 1920s, and it's the first evidence that khipus could encode information phoneticallly. Rebus systems for encoding information are not unprecedented in an Andean context, as Hyland discusses here in her :
Enter the Collata khipus. Sabine Hyland, a khipu researcher at the University of St Andrews, was contacted by a woman called Zoila Forss. Forss lives in Finland but grew up in San Juan de Collata, a small and remote community in the Andes. She got in touch with Hyland because she knew that her ancestral community had some khipus and she wanted to know if Hyland could make any sense of them. At the time, Hyland was becoming known for her work on khipu boards, hybrid khipu-alphabetic texts that were used in colonial churches in the 18th century. These boards had names in Spanish with khipu cords hanging off at the end of each name and were used to keep track of villagers' obligations for festivals. While there was some hope at the time that these khipu boards might be the "Rosetta Stone", the lack of one-to-one correspondence meant that while they taught us a lot about how khipus encoded information (e.g. using ply direction to indicate which moiety a person belonged to), they were not a key to "translating" the khipus.
But the Collata khipus were different. Hyland travelled to Collata where the village elders granted her access to the khipus. She and her husband were the first outsiders ever allowed to see them thanks to the lobbying of Zoila's mother Meche, head of the Association of Collatinos in Lima. The Collata khipus are made of animal fiber cords dyed in various colours. There are no knots tied in their cords. They were accompanied with manuscripts from the 17th and 18th century. By talking with the village officials and examining the documents, it was determined that these two khipus represented correspondences between local leaders during a rebellion against the Spanish in the 18th century.
Hyland used this context to make an incredible decipherment of part of the Collata khipus. She explains it in for Scientific American:
As you can see, deciphering the khipus is an incredibly complex process, and we are only in the early stages. Most of the Collata khipus have not been deciphered yet, though some projects are in the works to determine whether that is possible. The Collata khipus may well prove to be the Rosetta Stones of the khipu world, but there are a lot more stages involved in using them for such a purpose because we are trying to reconcile two fundamentally different ways of encoding information. The khipus are a three-dimensional writing system, where identifying the fiber, ply, and knot positions of a cord using the sense of touch is just as important as using the sense of sight to identify colour. An incredible amount of anthroplogical and historical context is needed to interpret these objects, something which is not available for most khipus in museums of shaky colonial provenance. But Hyland's work proving that some khipus were phonetic and logosyllabic means that the goal of deciphering them is closer than it ever has been.
I find the Rosetta stone to be amazing not just in that it became a key to understanding something, but in that it was "the" key, i.e. it was the only thing at the time that could have functioned as a key. In programming, there's the idea of a "bus factor", the number of team members that would have to be hit by a bus to kill the project, and in many of these situations, the Rosetta Stone or the Behistun Inscription really do seem to be the things without which we would never have learnt what we learnt, at least not without great difficulty, and while these may be the main such inscriptions, I would love to hear other stories of individuals who were equally as important.
