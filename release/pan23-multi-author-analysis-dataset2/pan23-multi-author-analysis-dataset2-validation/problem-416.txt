Killing yourself with several shots to the chest sounds a bit far fetched to me. The boss did it and the wife is doing what she’s told so that she doesn’t end up killing herself with several shots to the chest.
It sounds more like he “arranged” for this to happen rather than fall on his superior’s swords in a tribunal. Anyone loyal enough to him to follow orders could have done the deed. He doesn’t necessarily have to have pulled the trigger for him to have still chosen his fate.
It's unusual, but not unheard of. Especially if he used a military issue pistol with standard jacketed ammunition, multiple shots to the chest would be feasible. Even if the first shot was fatal, he wouldn't lose consciousness right away. Might be extra motivated to follow up with more shots, due to the pain.
I know of a documented case where a man committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest with a single shot break action shotgun. First shot wasn't immediately fatal, so he reloaded and fired a second time. With a semi auto pistol, getting five or even more rounds off in a few seconds before loss of consciousness is absolutely possible.
