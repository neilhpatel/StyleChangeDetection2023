1. If she has passed away, then her estate has her money. You let the executor know that you are owed this money, you make a claim on her estate.
So mobile home communities, often a person owns the house, and a company owns the land. The company gets the last word on who can live in the house, but they don't own the house. Makes things super complicate in a situation like this.
Can you TL;DR? This is too long, your trip doesn't matter, you getting along doesn't matter, ditto for storage. What is the core legal issue? Do you need to make a claim against the decedent's estate?
If a tenant were to move out between notice of summons and attending that summons, would they protect themselves from receiving a credit-trashing eviction notice?
If there's a summons, they've already filed in court, and future landlords will see it. Even if you win, future landlords will see it. Try to negotiate with the HOA for 30 more days.
Also a bargaining chip you have is that it's expensive to sue/evict you. If they give you 30 more days they avoid that cost. But make sure they are convinced that you'll be gone.
