From my reading on the subject, this seems impossible to answer with certainty because of the two fold source and historiography problem concerning rapes by the Red Army in Germany 1945 in general and the specific lack of interest in the perspective of the 800.000 female soldiers of the Red Army in general and specifically on this subject.
I have written about the general problem of rape and WWII and what needs to emphasized in this regard is that there are several major underlying problems in writing about this subject in general and this question specifically:
The first one is that the history of post-war rape has for the longest time been written by male historians in a way that took no interest in the perspective of the women raped beyond using their stories as illustration for their greater point and took even less interest in the perspective of female Red Army soldiers on these events.
Júlia Garraio has written about the specific way rapes committed by the Red Army have been written about in her article stating that the image of the Red Army as a horde of rapists was not only a strategy of proliferating a narrative about Western values in Germany but became, together with stereotypes of the victimized women, a pillar of German post-war foreign policy by demonizing "Asian barbarism" and communism. Because of the raped women becoming a metaphorical stand-in for a victimized Germany, threatened by strange masculinities and barbaric hordes from the East, the actual perspective of the victims of these crimes, let alone other female perspectives were simply not considered in this sort of writing and scholarship that dominated the discourse on these subjects until not too long ago.
Count to that the heavy social stigma attached to sexual violence, which lead to victims being extremely reluctant to discuss the subject, we end up with an extremely difficult source situation concerning the issue. Atina Grossmann once addressed this in a review of the BeFreier und Befreite by Helke Sander and Barbara Johr , which was what set off renewed discourse and interest in the subject in the early 90s:
Similarly, little interest was extended to perspectives of the female soldiers of the Red Army for a very long time. Reina Penninon famously started her with a telling quote from John Keegan, who wrote in his 1994 book A history of warfare that.
With this sort of sexism prevalent in Western academia of the 1990s, it is hardly surprising to also find it present in Stalinist Soviet attitudes to its own fighting women after WWII. /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov 's answers and give a lasting impression of how recent the idea of researching their persepctives is and how instituionalized sexism existed in the Soviet Union. Samantha Vajskop has also written about the subject in , stating.
Ingo von Münch in his book Frau, komm!: Die Massenvergewaltigungen deutscher Frauen und Mädchen 1944/45 mentions an account of a female Red Soldier who stated that the Germans had it coming. Who that woman was, even her name, what she had experienced and in what role she observed these deeds, he does not mention. Like the perspective of the German women who were raped – to say nothing of non-Germans raped in Germany post WWII – this only illustration for him about how badly the Germans were treated at the end of WWII. The actual people behind the sources are not his concern.
How do historians view “a Woman in Berlin” as a source for a look at day-to-day life in Soviet occupied Berlin? I found it to be a fascinating if horrifying read, but have always wondered if it is seen as an accurate portrayal of a women’s life in occupied Berlin.
There is only one extensive source collection available in English pertaining to the perspectives of women in the Red Army: Svetlana Alexievich's 1988 The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II (recently republished). The book consists of interviews with women who had fought in the Red Army re-counting their perspective, from witnessing the horrible violence exacted on them by the Germans, to the horrors of the battlefield and how they experienced it, to their hatred of the Germans and how it was for them to kill.
What is however notably absent is their perspective on rapes committed by their fellow soldiers, which is most likely related to the book having been written and the interviews collected while the USSR still existed by a Soviet writer. Few sources on this subject exist and if they are cited, they are mostly cited by male historians and writers who, again, do not use them as sources worth investigating on their own but to illustrate larger points they want to make, often influenced by still prevailing Adenauer era narratives.
And because of that attitude exactly, we can not with any sense of generalization and certainty say, what the women of the Red Army thought about their comrades-in-arms committing rapes in Germany.
The book "A woman in Berlin" is fiction and not an authentic document for the life in Berlin in 1945.
That it was treated as an authentic source for so long has to do with its complicated publication history. It was written by a woman named Marta Hillers. Hillers was a German journalist who had worked for the Nazis as a propagandist during the war and would later go on to write for a large number of German magazines while living in Basel.
In the early 50s, a friend of hers Kurt W. Marek who worked under the pseudonym C.W. Ceram while also employed by a large German publishing house convinced her to publish a book that was supposed to be based on the experience of 1945 Berlin. It was then published the first time in 1954 in several languages to much controversy because even back then doubts about its authenticity arose. Due to the vontroversy, Hillers forbade another publication during her life time. According with her wishes, this didn't happen (though photocopies circulated in the 80s) and it was only republished in 2003, agian to much contoroversy.
In 2016, Hillers' estate was handed over to the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich and so Yuliya von Saal, a historian speciliazing in Russia and the Soviet Union, worked extensively on the estate and the documents that are part of the estate, most prominently the original typoscrip Hillers wrote in 1954.
What Saale shows is that while parts of the book are based on things Hillers did indeed observe in Berlin in 1945, a lot of the narrative is fictional and strongly fictionalized. There is an especially strong aspect of this when writing about sexual violence: Hillers uses sexual violence as both a way to explore how women especially suffer under war and men but also – and this accounts for it's popularity in Germany especially in 2003 – as metaphor for how Germany suffered. In Hillers' book, women being raped by the Red Army also serve as symbol for Germany losing. This is something many, many, many narratives about the end of the war do: Germany has lost and now it's women are violated and Germany is as a nation a violated woman.
Von Saal summarizes that the entite thing is a "mixture of a novel, a movie script, and a diary" and that this is not a source but literature and fiction.
