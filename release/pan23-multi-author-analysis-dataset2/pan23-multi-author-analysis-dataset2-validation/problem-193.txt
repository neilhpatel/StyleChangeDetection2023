This is a fascinating scene from Hamburger Hill. Not only is it the only depiction of a Kit Carson Scout (a North or South Vietnamese soldier who had defected to to the SVN government and then volunteered work the United States) in cinema that I am aware of, it actually shows something that they did: Put on demonstrations to show how they were able to penetrate American defenses. The setting of the scene is definitely very weird and the whole speech feels incredibly out of place. Contemporary photographs of these demonstration shows entire crowds of American soldiers (more often than not newcomers) watching on intensely as a lone Kit Carson Scout crawl through the concertina wire after having having stripped down to his shorts. Sometimes, the demonstration would be accompanied with a running contemporary broadcast from loudspeakers. It would often be followed by the Kit Carson Scout explaining to the onlookers the importance of building effective barricades and giving them advice as to make them stronger. Sometimes, even generals attended these demonstrations, of an unnamed Kit Carson Scout greeting Lieutenant General Donn J. Robertson in 1971. How would a demonstration look in reality? This eyewitness account written by SP5 Thomas Maus and PFC Bill Eftink gives us an idea:

Yes, they did! Of course, different Kit Carson Scouts had different approaches Some would often to try and avoid doing just that by essentially yelling into the tunnels for their enemies to give up since any resistance was futile. That was the best case scenario and sometimes work. However, there are many accounts of scouts either functioning as tunnel rats alone or together with an American colleague. Huynh Bong, for example, who was a scout for the 11th Infantry Brigade Recon, did it all by himself without prompting. He blew the entrance of a tunnel with a claymore, borrowed a .45 caliber pistol, and just went straight in. What his American colleagues did not realize was that he was immediately pulled into a fight with a PLAF soldier and even got out alive after an enemy grenade went off inside of the tunnel. As one contemporary report said, he "escaped with only a slight case of shock and a rather muddy face.".
The portrayal shown in the film, however, is not particularly good. There is not even a mention of who this person really is beyond his name and that he is a defector (something that is only obvious to the viewer if they know what the Chieu Hoi program is), but beyond that, nothing. He is demonized for no reason other than to make the FNGs (and the viewers) aware of the enemy's capability. Instead of using the moment to add some additional nuance, that there were North Vietnamese who wanted to work for the Americans (!), it becomes a useless 'us vs. them' display with little connection to reality. This continued marginalization of Vietnamese voices and perspectives in American depictions of the Vietnam War fails to add complexity to the Vietnam War as depicted in popular culture and leaves South and North Vietnamese men and women as silent stereotypes. Han, the Kit Carson Scout in the film, would have understood everything S. Frantz was saying -- after all, Han had studied English at Kit Carson Scout school before being assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and likely had American friends amongst his fellow soldiers.
While there were plenty of American soldiers who distrusted the Kit Carson Scouts, commanders at least attempted to make grunts trust them. The role of the scouts were to protect American soldiers, to prevent them from falling into ambushes or from stepping into a booby trap. They were incredibly effective at their job and there are countless of accounts of not only their heroism in battle but of how they prevented the deaths of many American soldiers. Yet this came with a cost. For North Vietnamese defectors, it would be impossible for them to return home and their families would likely suffer because of their defection (through ostracization, losing job opportunities, being publicly humiliated, etc.) , something which prevented many North Vietnamese soldiers from defecting in the first place (only 2,000 North Vietnamese defected in comparison with 150,000 South Vietnamese).

I read the wikipedia article on Kit Carson Scouts and I'm still unclear on how they were organized and used. Wiki says there were ideally 100+ per division. Were they organized into their own units within the division? Or, maybe parceled out 1 per squad or platoon? Were they basically point man on patrol or was it more of an instructional role or something else?
In divisions, Kit Carson Scouts were parceled out wherever they were needed. But they would often find themselves assigned to specific units within the division where they remained for a longer period of time. The process was usually something like this: Defection -.
As with the source material, /u/Han_KCS goes silent in the aftermath of the war. The historian takes over!
If I may be so bold, what became of you after the war? Did KC scouts face retribution when the South fell or did most of them come to the US? What kind of life did you and your fellow scouts have in the post war years? How were those in the US treated by the Vietnamese community?
One question I have about Vietnamese assisting American forces; would they ever have to be tunnel rats as they're generally smaller?
Kit Carson Scouts were first and foremost as point men on patrol where their abilities could be used in the best way possible (spotting ambushes and traps, etc.). Yet they also served in other capacities, such as interpreter. In specific cases, they served as part of PSYOPS teams. Higher ranking scouts could become instructors for other scouts.
Unfortunately, the truth of the matter is that we do not have any personal accounts from scouts written after 1973.
The Wikipedia page is very, very poor -- something that is reflective of the limited state of scholarly research into the program. Funny enough, my article is a reference for the page, but has apparently not been used!
Interesting details you've pointed out. I wouldn't have known that this was a poor portrayal. I think you're onto something when you mention the marginalization of the Vietnamese perspective. I read a long time ago that there was actually an ARVN unit that reached the top of the hill first, but they don't appear at all in the film. Still, I liked the movie overall.
