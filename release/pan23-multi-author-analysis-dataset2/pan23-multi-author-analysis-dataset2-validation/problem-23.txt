Nope. The house was left to my friend by her father in his will (it's still in a trust, I believe, as her mother is still alive) and he doesn't live there. He decided a few weeks ago that he wants to and so he put up the camera to try to catch my friend doing something that would give him grounds to kick her out.
How on earth would the brother have grounds to kick her out? It sounds like there is more to this situation. Also, you say the police were called while the brother 'was there', implying he was at the house, and the police complimented his gun collection, which I assume was also there. Can you explain these things? Also, why doesn't your friend just...take the camera down?
I don't think he has the grounds, I just think he's using violence as a threat. I don't know the exact legal situation other than the house was left to her by her father in a will, but as the mother is still alive, it's in a trust. He's a domestic abuser so he's bullied my friend and their mom into basically staying in line. Because it used to be a family cabin, he seems to feel entitled to it and I guess my friend never changed the locks because he used their old key. And my friend called the cops who bagged the camera as evidence saying they were charging him with a 3rd degree misdemeanor for stalking and something else. She didn't know about the camera until he went on a tirade last night and told her.
