The best, most concise resource I've seen on this topic is created by P. Gabrielle Foreman, who is currently working on the book, "Historicizing Slavery: The Art of DisMemory." The document was crowd-sourced among scholars of slavery and offers linguistic and philosophical suggestions and guidance.
One of the points they raise, "Please honor the humanity of the millions of people treated as chattel property by naming enslaved people whenever possible" is a helpful reminder when writing about an enslaved person. It's a reminder that any given enslaved person had relationships with others that went beyond their status in slavery. Stephine Jones-Rogers, author of "They Were Her Property" (a remarkable book) is a great example of what this looks like in practice. In one scenario, she is writing about how an enslaved child was punished by the daughter of the couple that enslaved her. Early in the anecdote, she names everyone involved such that from that point forward, everything that happens to named people. In instances where she didn't have a child's name, Dr. Jones-Rogers refers to a child by their relationship to a named enslaved person (i.e. Mary's daughter.).
Thanks, these are some really great resources! After looking them over I've written the relevant parts using respectful language, and included a note about the language used + citation of resources.
In terms of Hemings and Jefferson, my understanding is that the debate is fairly settled. Which isn't to say there's a straight-forward answer, rather that there's overwhelming evidence they did have a relationship. The nature and dynamics of that relationship is complicated and layered. In terms of language to describe it, the best resource is probably the writing of . You can also see how we've tried to negotiate the language in answers on Ask Historians.
It's a complicated matter to be sure, as it's a shift in language that reflects a shift in thinking and research about the people who were enslaved. Which is to say, I am confident there are scholars of North American chattel slavery and other historians who still use the term but their usage doesn't necessarily mean it's appropriate for widespread usage.
I think it's helpful to remember that the shift in language isn't just about which terms we use. It's about recognizing the humanity of those who were enslaved and the choices made by those who were enslavers. In effect, it's a language shift that helps us tell a more complete, more accurate history.
