I'm not clear on your current lease status. Do you have a current, written, signed lease? Are you and your roommate on the same lease?
The property manager DID send us the new lease agreement by email around January 07, expecting us to return it signed soon. My boyfriend, the roommate and myself are on the lease. My roommate didn't want to sign it because it had a typo, so technically it is still unsigned. We haven't returned to the landlord and she hasn't asked for it yet.
Has your roommate ever signed a lease for this unit? Was she on the lease agreement before the one you received in January?
Since she is a month-to-month tenant, her landlord can provide 30-day notice to terminate her tenancy, and evict her if she doesn't voluntarily leave by the end of the notice period. (Once she's lived there for a year, the required notice period will become 60 days.).
It's not clear from your story if you are her landlord (i.e. she's subletting from you) or if you are equal co-tenants of your landlord. If you are co-tenants, you are on equal standing and have no ability to force her out. If she is subletting from you, then you can terminate her tenancy by following the procedure described above.
(The landlord could give you both notice, terminate your tenancy, then sign a new agreement with just you and your boyfriend on it, but it would be up to your landlord to decide if they're willing to go through with that.).
That's correct. If you are on the same month-to-month lease, your landlord can terminate it with a 60-day notice, since you've lived there for over a year. That would terminate the lease agreement for both of you. The landlord can't terminate the tenancy of just one member of a joint lease.
We both signed a month to month lease as co-tentants starting March 2020. From what you said, if the landlord was to give us a 30-day notice that would be for all tenants, correct? She wouldn't be able to just give a 30-day notice to my roommate ?
