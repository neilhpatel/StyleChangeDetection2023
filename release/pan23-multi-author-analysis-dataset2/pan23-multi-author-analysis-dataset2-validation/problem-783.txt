OP if you were unaware that same sex marriage has been legal in all states since the Obama administration... maybe you are not legally knowledgeable enough to handle this situation. Involve and attorney who is.
I am a woman married to a woman. We have a child with a sperm donor who is a friend. I have had extended conversations with multiple lawyers on this subject, as well as going through the contract and legal process for making an agreement with a known sperm donor and subsequently severing his rights so my partner could be identified legally as our child’s other parent. We all have a good relationship and our legal ducks in a row.
1) do not trust Reddit on this subject. Talk to a lawyer who works on queer family law in your state (or where the child would be born). Usually they will do a free 20 minute consult to explain the law.
2) you cannot make a contract giving up your rights/obligations before the child is born. You can make a contract stating your intentions, but it won’t be enforceable.
3) if you get someone pregnant with sex (“natural insemination” is a real bullshit term but I digress) the state will almost always assume you are the parent. When we got our court order, we all had to sign various affidavits that the donor and I had never had sex. You may eventually be able to give up your parental rights, but it would basically be treated by the state like you had an affair with her, which would make giving up parental rights a longer and more complex process.
3) the way this is handled for at home cup/syringe insemination is usually that the intended parents pursue second parent adoption for the non-gestational parent. Before that happens, you can definitely be on the hook for child support etc. Note that having her spouse on the birth certificate is NOT enough.
ETA: if you mean “naturally” as in sex, do not do this. Donation should be artificial insemination to prevent the argument that there was a relationship.
