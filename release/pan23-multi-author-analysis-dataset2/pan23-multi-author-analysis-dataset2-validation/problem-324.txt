Discarded signs? Signs they intend to come back for later? Signs stuck in the ground? Posted on a pole? Left there while they’re taking their lunch break? Can one even be sure which is which?
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to your question. It depends, like most everything else in the legal system, on the specifics of each unique situation.
Probably technically illegal (as it’s not up to you to determine what happens with someone else’s property), but maybe one of those things, depending on the circumstances, that no one’s going to do anything about.
NAL, but generally speaking if someone legally displays a sign, some rando on the street is not permitted to remove it. For example, if it were a political sign stating “Vote for” whoever, removing it and throwing it in the trash is illegal.
Questions I have are: is the sign placement legal in the first place? If yes, definitely don’t touch it. If it is not legal (this would usually be due to private property violation or vandalism), still don’t remove it, but someone could call authorities to file a complaint. Reasonably, this would need to be done by the property owner only.
Second question: Why isn’t the clinic removing the signs themselves? If protest signs are permitted by law, they can’t, so neither can you. But perhaps you could create a counterprotest sign to place there, if that’s an option. It may be worth reaching out to the clinic to see how you can legally support them.
I understand that protest signs can be annoying, but don’t end up with a misdemeanor because of it. The law doesn’t take feelings into consideration.
If a protestor stuck a sign into the ground with the intention of leaving the sign there, wouldn’t that be relinquishing ownership fo the sign. Therefore it wouldn’t necessarily be theft.
Not if it's on their, defacing their property, "post no bills" etc. If I do it, then I am destroying another person's property. There are a lot of "what ifs" here but the bottom like is that nobody can take property that doesn't belong to them, period. You can't find a $5 bill on the street and legally keep it. OP asked about the law.
And two wrongs don't make a right. OP's trespassing isn't negated because someone else trespassed. The law is agnostic to how righteous or twisted your motives were.
This all begs the question of why the clinic does not remove the signs. Perhaps OP can provide more context? There is likely a way to get the signs removed, but so many questions.
I’m not saying OP’s trespassing isn’t negated because someone else trespassed. If OP and the protestor are trespassing, how does that make OP liable for theft of property that the protestor left while trespassing? It wouldn’t affect the theft. It would however affect the person with the superior right to the property (i.e., the clinic’s right could trump OPs right if they both claimed ownership). I could be guilty or not guilty of theft irrespective of the trespassing.
