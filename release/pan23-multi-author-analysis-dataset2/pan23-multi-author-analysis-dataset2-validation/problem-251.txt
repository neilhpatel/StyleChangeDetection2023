Most harassment isn't illegal. If someone commits a crime, like assault, then you can report that to the police. Technically, wiping food on someone might count, technically, but the district attorney is unlikely to try to put the person in jail. This sounds like a horrible, miserable, toxic person but no, that doesn't sound legally actionable. There are a lot of jerks out there and we don't have the laws to throw people in jail, or suing companies, because people are total assholes. Being an asshole isn't usually illegal (or a quarter of the population would be in legal hot water all the time).
Your coworker would have been legally fine to call you names, be rude, give you shit tasks, etc. if the root issue is that she was doing the same to another employee and you reported that.
Stuff about how it made you feel (which I saw at least one instance of just scrolling through) is unnecessary. Nor do we need a word by word replay in the vast majority of cases.
That's much too long. You need to edit this post so that it contains only the relevant information: your location, the general stuff that happened, how management responded when notified.
