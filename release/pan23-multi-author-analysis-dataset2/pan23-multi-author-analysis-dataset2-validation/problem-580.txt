Warrants are issued by judges when there is sufficient evidence to justify it. While it's impossible for us to know for certain whether such evidence exists in your case, based on your story, I doubt it.
If the police has a warrant, they can and will get in no matter what even if you are in or out of the property, the warrant gives them the authority to do so.
The officer told me the same thing as he's been gone for 4 months Im just worried about my animals I always hear how they get killed by trigger happy cops sadly I mean I'm sure not all of them are like that but im just concerned I already asked him to never contact us ever again. But just the worry of having them bust in while I'm at work or while I'm out at night worries me.
My advice is to stop talking to this person. If they come by the house, call the cops and report him as a threatening trespasser, otherwise don't talk to him (don't argue, don't respond to insults or accusations, don't defend yourself, ignore him).
Just know that if they have a warrant, they'll go inside the property and more if there is a belief of a stolen gun, is the person claiming YOU stole it or did the person stole it?
Also, I don't believe they'll even issue a warrant if you already told the cop you don't have anything and the person already took his stuff, right? He just "forgot" the handgun?
The person has not live there for 4 months, right? Is he a tenant, friend, familiar or what? Context over the residency of that person is needed as well.
They can come anytime specified in the warrant or in your state statutes. It is highly unlikely they would obtain a warrant for this unless there is more to the story that we havenâ€™t heard.
