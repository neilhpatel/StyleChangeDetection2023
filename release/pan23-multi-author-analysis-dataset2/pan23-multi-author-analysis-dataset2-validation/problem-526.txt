Call them and tell them you demand they drop the bill or you will file in small claims for breech of contract.
If they send it to collections, don't pay any of it. Tell them you dispute the bill because of breech of contract.
Then file that case and fight it. Collect all your evidence. What specific dates were they closed. Record notices and make a spreadsheet with a summary of dates and notice times. Collect your work notices related to this and mention that to the judge too.
He also doesn't care that there was a an average of an 18 month wait-list here so my getting a spot is amazing. I would not have kept that spot without paying.
I tried that. I have a meeting with them on the 13. I have the exact amount I spent on additional childcare, the rough amount of time I paid for and didn't receive, and the average notice I was given before a closure. I can't easily calculate the loss of wages and my being on probation at work means nothing to this sexist jerk. I even technically paid for the first week of November given that the bills come out every two weeks not on specific days.
Just be really insist that you will not pay any due to breech of contract, and cite the missed days. Repeat it over and over. Don't let them bully you and don't agree to pay any part of it because that could be used to show you agree the whole debt is valid.
All agreements are meaningless unless in writing. Demand they write down any deal. After, email them your summary of what you talked about to the best of your knowledge.
If you live in a one party consent state you can audio record the meeting and it's admissible in court as evidence.
