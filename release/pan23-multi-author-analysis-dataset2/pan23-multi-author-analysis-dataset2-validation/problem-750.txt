The aggressive dog was properly fenced and under control of the owner- what more would you expect the owner to do? Also, most fences are not exactly on property lines, the property line is usually a few feet outside of the fence. Were you (or your dog) therefore trespassing on his land?
We were standing on a public sidewalk, the fence was maybe 4 inches back, my dog was standing on the sidewalk when she was bitten.
Evidently the dog wasn’t properly fenced if the dog is able to bite and draw blood from a dog standing on the public side walk.
Scroll up, I did ask questions, you replied with more details and your own interpretation of a MA statute (more than one applies, btw) as it applies to your case. Again, I wish you luck and hope your dog is healing well.
Yeah, I'm sure it always appears that way when clients leave out critical information. Would have helped to have complete information at the beginning. VERY huge to know you were standing on a public way and the fence was inappropriately fenestrated for the dog it was intended to contain.
I stated my location that was enough information for you to read the same law as I did and assess from there (if you even felt qualified to comment). None of your initial points in your response were relevant and you would have known that if you had used the information (read the relevant state law) that i’d provided.
Also, you should check into the actual state law. MA is a full liability state, even when owners make reasonable efforts to restrain their dog, if they fail, they are still liable for damage to property. Wow, i’m surprised I came to r/legaladvice and had to be the one to explain relevant laws to my case!
They’re called “questions” and good lawyers ask them before making assumptions. This is my case in point for calling you what you are.
It was? For some reason your display is only showing you partial replies, then. You should check on that. Sorry for all the confusion. I have work to do, and I graciously bow out. Again, good luck to you.
