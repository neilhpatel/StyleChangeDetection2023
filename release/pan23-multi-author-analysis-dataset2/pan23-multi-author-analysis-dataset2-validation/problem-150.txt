The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering easing a controversial climate risk disclosure rule it issued last year after receiving pushback from companies and investors.
“We got nearly 15,000 public comments on that proposal,” chairman Gary Gensler said in an interview Friday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He said it was customary for the agency to “review all that, think through the economics, think through the legal authorities that commenters have raise.

The plan, unveiled in March 2022, has been unpopular among C-suite leadership. Only 25% of CFOs surveyed by CNBC in 2022 support the disclosures.
Gensler also denied that the rule modifications are tied to political influence. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the agency’s actions the same day Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., chair of the House Financial Services Committee, announced a Republican Working Group aimed at environmental, social and governance, or ESGs.
The proposed “Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors” requires publicly traded companies to disclose to investors how their operations affect the climate and contribute to carbon emissions.
"Whenever a new rule actually has its intended effect and makes it harder for wealthy poluters to get more people to invest in their pollution, it's totally normal for us to tweak that rule to make sure it stops doing anything.".
