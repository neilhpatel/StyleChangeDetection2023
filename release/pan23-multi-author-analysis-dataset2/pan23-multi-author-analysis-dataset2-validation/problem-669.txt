You are not obligated to take-on the responsibility of being your brother's caretaker unless you want to, and if you do, you'll likely be eligible for the government subsidies to continue his care.
If you decline to take on that responsibility, another guardian will be appointed for him or he'll become a ward of the state and placed in a group home or assisted living facility depending on the magnitude of his needs.
Your household eligibility for subsidized housing will change significantly when there is no longer a disabled adult in the household, and when you become a household of one or two instead of four.
I do not expect that you will be able to move on from your caretaker role to an independent life as a tradesman but also retain the government subsidies your family gets now.
If your current housing is part of the government subsidy for caring for your brother, then you may have to move out if you no longer qualify for that housing on the merits of your own situation. That would definitely be something to discuss with the housing administrators as you weigh your options.
I appreciate the speedy reply. Though I am curious about events that would follow out of that. I would obviously contact his caseworker and it would be there that I would deny being his new guardian, but would I be forced to move from the current housing if I take over the lease?
There are a lot of options here, and it appears that you could be his guardian at some level, while receiving in-home services from a caregiver at the expense of the state. That would take a lot of the burden off you. It couldn't hurt to discuss these options with your brother's caseworker to pre-plan, it looks like the state of CA has many levels of involvement to facilitate keeping DD people in the community rather than institutions.
That said, it's still a huge commitment and few people will fault you for not sacrificing your life and potential livelihood to care for your brother, especially with his needs increasing, so a group home with professional caregivers is likely to be the best situation for everyone, including him.
I'd guess the housing situation is based on income eligibility, but it could also be based on disability. Your neighbor may have a less obvious disability, but only the housing manager would be able to answer your questions about eligibility.
I've seen the word group home brought up a lot and looking into it hasn't really left me with clarified information. The cost of this type of living doesn't seem to be explicitly stated or the menus can be confusing to navigate.
Understandable, I am completely unaware of these types of stuff. I appreciate the long post you made. I only have anecdotal evidence so bear with me, my abled neighbor seems to live alone mostly, but continues to live in a unit that accommodates wheelchair access. Which is what prompted my question.
Please also make sure that your mother knows you will not be taking over his care. There are things she may want to prepare for when that time happens.
If you're wondering what a group home would be like, they're essentially dormitories for folks who need varying levels of care and can't function independently. They are overseen by professionals and caseworkers to make sure the residents' needs are being met and they're protected from being taken advantage of or abused by other residents and random people, but of course nothing is perfect.
Group homes and the more intensive institutions are generally funded by the state, even if they're run by private companies or charities. The subsidies your parent receives to care for your brother would basically just go to providing for his care in one of those facilities instead of to your family.
