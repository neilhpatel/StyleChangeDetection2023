This is not a way to get out of paying what you owe. You should cancel the subscription via the terms of what you signed. They can sue you if you cancel your card like this and try to duck payment.
As others have said, it’s not necessary unless the company refuses to cancel the subscription. Contacting customer service is the first step.
You also don’t need to cancel the card. You can contact the credit card company and dispute the charges. You are under no legal obligation to pay for a subscription unless you signed a contract.
If you signed a contract, the company will likely submit the bill to collections and that will tank your credit score and add fees to anything you own. This only applies if you signed a contract. If you did not and they attempt to collect, reference the Fair Debt Collections Act.
If the subscription is for something odd or embarrassing, literally no one cares. There are no special legal protections, etc.
Now, companies in most states have a duty to mitigate their damages, so if they can't track you down to get updated payment information, they'll often just cancel the contract. They may or may not just eat the money for the months you had not canceled the service but also did not pay.
Just to be clear, contact customer service of the subscription site and/or the credit card company to stop the charges. There should be no need to cancel the credit card.
Canceling the credit card does not automatically sever your contractual obligations with the service provider. When you give someone a credit card number, you are making a promise to pay. Them attempting to bill you and getting rejected does not mean you don't owe the money.
Some US states don't have the same requirements, and a provider can continue to bill you and/or rack up unpaid charges and eventually sue you.
You'd have to explain to a judge or jury why it was a better option for you to surreptitiously cancel the credit card instead of contacting the company and canceling the service.
