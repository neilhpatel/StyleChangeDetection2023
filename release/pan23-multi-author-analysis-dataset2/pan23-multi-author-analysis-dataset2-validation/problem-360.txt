I don’t think any Supreme Court would want to overturn something of this precedent on standing, arguably paving the way for future presidents to do something like this.
I wish the supreme court would not get involved in hot button issues. This just degrades the view they want to hold of impartiality. The only way this qould lead to a positive is if it results in an eventual legislative solution involving restructuring and loan forgiveness.
Billions of dollars of loans being forgiven creates a plethora of economic problems. If the loans are forgiven, then the problems arise. This is an injury for people all around. Especially states, whose economies get hit. I get the standing argument I just feel as though this case is slightly different due to the potential repercussions.
At least Biden tried. So when you go vote in 2024, remember that he tried to help millions of Americans but wasn't able to because of that one term fascist.
They already have decided to rule on this very issue on standing multiple times. Standing is an important condition for the Supreme court to hear a case. Without it they can just rule it on what they want and are basically just legislating.
I understand the issue, but I don’t think standing is as relevant as you make it out to seem. The injury is clear as billions will be forgiven “if and when we prevail in court” (according to the department of education). This seems enough to meet the injury requirement of standing to me. Reasonable minds could differ but I think it would be a worse precedent personally to not accept this case, giving future presidents the potential power to do this (when it likely isn’t constitutional).
The states apart of the lawsuit have a cognizable injury as soon the debt is forgiven, at least in my eyes. I understand the purpose of standing, and it isn’t something that should be looked away from. But if that’s the case, any acting president can do something like this (above the legislature) then not be challenged until after the fact. This goes way passed executive power.
