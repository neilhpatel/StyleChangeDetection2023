Likewise, on the civil side... Even if you were to win (itself a dicey proposition), what damages do you imagine you would be awarded? Would they be worth the process you'd go through to get them?
Then your cars weren’t vandalized. Affixing notices to cars parked without authorization is generally legal. The law doesn’t get into what if’s or what glue is appropriate.
This might be one of those situations where you have to ask yourself if the juice is worth the squeeze.
I think you would have a hard time on the criminal side... If the property is validly theirs, it would be difficult to get the authorities to go with the vandalism route. Especially given that the damages sound like they're fairly easily repaired with a bit of elbow grease.
