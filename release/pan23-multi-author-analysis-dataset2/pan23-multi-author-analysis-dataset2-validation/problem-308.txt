The insurance company called her back and said if it was a small claims court she'd have to handle it herself. But that they would send her all the info and she'd have no problem proving it wasn't her fault. They also said cases like these have a limitation of 2 years and it's like 90days before that 2 years is up.
Even with liability, the insurance on the car at the time will defend her, including paying lawyers in the unlikely event this ends up in court.
It's extremely common after the silliest minor accidents that the not at fault party sues for a ridiculous amount, hoping for a better settlement.
One time I was driving a limo and the door guy didn't shut the rear door and I drove off at 5 mph and the door hit a cab who was staging sideways. The impact was so light, all it did was put a tiny crack in the tail light, and when we got out, we didn't know what happened and we didn't even think we hit each other. That's when someone said the rear door was open. Of course 2 months later the company gets a letter from an attorney representing the cab driver. He was "emotionally disturbed" and went from an "able bodied working man" to "distressed and" unable to work" which was of course so frivolous it was funny. Insurance took care of it and I never heard anything again.
This makes me feel better, thanks. I worry about her and have worried since I found out about it. Hope the insurance company calls back.
