Frequently, at least in ancient studies, scholars are expected to know modern research languages as well as the relevant ancient ones, and frequently big chunks of untranslated text just show up. As an example, I wanted to look something up in the (database of cuneiform texts); double-checking their typology page for the list of publications jumps right into four paragraphs of French, before a sentence or two of English. Its a very 19th century mindset still in many places, and the size of the field reinforces this--journals and publishers don't feel much pressure to move outside their comfort zone.
There is a heavy, heavy western European bias, especially without the competition of Soviet scholars to make Russian a big player. For Assyriology, there is a lot of good scholarship being done in Iraq (especially archaeology, both because of the obvious locational benefits and impressive institutions), but much is published in Arabic and makes a lot less impact, or a lot slower impact, than it should. For scholars wanting to work outside of European languages (or Arabic, maybe), there is limited opportunity. This makes developing a community of scholarship in that language much harder, reinforcing the lack of 'need' for Western researchers to engage with that language/community. The Finnish scholar Simo Parpola is foundational in Neo-Assyrian studies, and has taught a number of prominent Finnish students, but all publish almost entirely in English (not exclusively; German is also notable).
In sum, the structure of the field, rather than any single person, excludes languages from outside Western Europe, and only those who are working to make journals and universities more open to these contributions have yet to turn the tide.
Do many western scholars in ancient studies know Arabic, along with French and English? It seems like you'd have to be to be fully appraised of developments in some fields. It also seems like a very difficult standard to meet, particularly when you add in the requirements of ancient language proficiency.
I'm afraid my exposure is quite limited even in Assyriology and my anecdotal knowledge is not large.
Overall, the bulk of scholarship is in English, German, French (and Italian) and making a big enough splash that people will spend the years to learn a new language is nearly prohibitively difficult.
In my experience working with foreign sources, most historians will try and get at least reading fluency in a language. Since the majority of sources are written, there's little issue with slowly working your way through a source with a dictionary in one hand and a grammar guide in the other. However, language selection becomes a larger issue here.
It is also my experience that historiography in languages outside of the obvious ones is rarely if ever considered. If you are writing about say, Belgium, you'd read sources in English, French, Dutch and German. But you are unlikely to browse Japanese books for Belgian history. This may be different in non-European history, but in European work, the languages consulted are usually the local languages and English/German/French, these days heavily leaning towards English.
Generally historians writing in other languages will also gauge what language is most relevant. While I could in theory write a book about Spanish California in German, the question I'd ask myself is what would that achieve? If I want to reach a larger audience, I need to write in a language people will read. For better or worse, scholarship is largely done in English, even by non-Anglophone historians.
Now I can't talk about non-European history as I am a European historian by trade, but most committed historians in my experience, regardless of field, will consult the local languages. If you are studying ancient Chinese history, it would be foolhardy to not consult Mandarin sources.
So while I do think it probably does occur, at least in my field and in my experience, historians know their audience well enough to gauge what language(s) it would be prudent to do research in.
It's definitely not standard or expected for anyone working on pre-Islamic periods, but its not entirely unheard of. I think there's enough general semitics knowledge that for some its not as hard as starting from scratch, but I'd say its a conscious choice to learn.
While this could be the case, I find it incredibly difficult to square with the seriousness that my colleagues in other disciplines take their work, and the rigorous peer review process required for presentation in reputable journals. Should this be true, it would be truly shocking to me, as it would require not only a single bad-faith unethical historian, but a whole team of them working on concert.
This is interesting, because I've heard many things about non-Japanese Japanese historians' rattling off decades old discredited nonsense because they never bothered to learn Japanese nor connect with Japanese discussion of the field.
If this is truly the case, then I can only say it is likely to be old scholarship or "scholarship", as there are frankly too many books published today by non-historian actors attempting to tell history. Belton Cooper's Deathtraps comes to mind, which was thoroughly panned by Historians and frankly should not be considered serious academic history.
