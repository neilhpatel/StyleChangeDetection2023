Once more into the breach We have ourselves another fantastic edition of the digest that’s just filled to the brim with awesome posts from fantastic writers. Have a browse through the list below and enjoy the thread Don’t forget to upvote and thank the writers.
That ends us off for another week. I was pretty busy during the week so might have missed some sadly. If I come across any I’ll make sure to add them in for next week. Have yourselves a great time and we’ll be back next Sunday!
The post is up less then an hour and already people are finding stuff that I've missed My reputation is in tatters.
We’re on to our third week of our Black History Month showcase We here at AskHistorians have been teaming up with /r/BlackPeopleTwitter to showcase some fascinating parts of history. As part of that, every Monday we’ll have an entire tweet line up on Black history, every Sunday will revisit some old but gold threads, and on February 28th we’ll be joined by Dr Megan Hunt for a fascinating AMA on the Civil Rights movement and the ways in which our audience has actually been exposed to the movements through popular media and education Mark your calendars now dear readers, because it’s going to be great!
Let’s hit the wayback machine and check out some awesome threads of yesteryear, and look to history to find some threads on history!
Perhaps this thread, also from the amazing sowser, is particularly pertinent to our Black History Month showcase.
Many people are honestly surprised to find out how diverse history can be. Perhaps one of my favorite recent threads was /u/Bernardito looking at Photographic proof and everything!
Thanks /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov was kind enough to reseed a question so I could re-post, but other obligations got in the way. I'm happy to see it still found a few readers.
Thanks! I'm happy I had the opportunity providing something for the second question, a lesser known topic but a favourite of mine.
Once more we showcase some interesting yet overlooked questions that caught our eye and got us interested in history. Feel free to post up other questions I missed but you found interesting.
