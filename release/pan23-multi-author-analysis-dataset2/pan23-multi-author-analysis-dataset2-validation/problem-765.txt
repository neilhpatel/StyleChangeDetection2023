Part time and full time aren’t legal designations. Federally if they have employees who work long enough they must be offered healthcare or face a small fine.
They’re allowed to choose which employees get what benefits, even if it’s doing the same work. They just can’t be choosing the different benefits because of a protected reason ie women can’t be full time.
There's definitely a legal definition of a full-time employee, but to your point they aren't required to offer benefits outside of health care to them.
We both agree there's an aca requirement, and you seem that it's mandatory. We've both posted proof that that there's penalties if required to and don't.
Can you show me where there is mandatory anything? Must be full time? Where OP must get classified as full time based on hours?
Is there or is there not a legal definition of full time? Hint: click on the link I posted. I don't care what OPs company calls him, he's legally defined as a full time employee.
No the ACA considers what someone applies to or not. They don't get benefits based on hours worked by law. IF you like to show me a law that says that the ones op wants and they can't get because they aren't considered full time, I'm happy to retract.
edit- person I'm replying edited and quoted something and left out what's relevant. "without penalties" I said they're responsible for not giving benefits. they.. are weird.
