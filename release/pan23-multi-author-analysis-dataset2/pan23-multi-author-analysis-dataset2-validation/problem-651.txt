The relevant statute in Washinon state classifying this is RCW 9.35.020 section 1:No person may knowingly obtain, possess, use, or transfer means of identification or financial information of another person, living or dead, with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any crime.
So based on what you’ve stated, only going on the facts, it seems that the DA is focusing on the alteration of the check performed by your girlfriends part, in that capacity it would be considered identity theft per the above statute.
That said the fact the police said specifically felony identity theft was the reason for the warrant does not mean they are only going to charge her with that. The law as written was broken by your girlfriend, whether she made reparations to the affected party is not actually relevant to being charged, however the judge may take that into account during any sentencing as reparations is a possible penalty.
From a banking standpoint just what you have listed off it could also be fraud, forgery, and larceny depending on the amounts. And additional charges if she cashed any of those checks across state lines. It’s quite possible that the entity or entities pressing charges are not her dad‘s girlfriend but the bank the checks were written from or the one she deposited them into. And legally they are entitled to press charges in that capacity.
I know it doesn’t seem a fair charge especially with everything else you stated in your original post, however this is super serious stuff. I know you said she can’t afford to hire an attorney so she can apply for a public defender who will advise her legally. You may want to look into if there are any lawyers that may take the case pro bono, that is without pay, or if there are any local agencies or non profit resources she may qualify for.
So from a banking regulatory standpoint she has still altered financial information, changed the amount of a check in any way, with the intention to commit a crime, bank fraud in this case.
even if she only changed the dollar amount? apparently the check was written to her for a set amount. and what my girlfriend did was write the amount she wanted on a separate piece of paper, placed it over the check directly where the other numbers are for the original amount, and took a picture with her phone and deposited it with her phone using the bank app and it was accepted with the new amount she wrote on a piece of paper. she never wrote on the physical check.
but still... that wasn’t her intention. her intention was fraud and she will plead guilty to that. but she never meant to take the persons identity or try to impersonate them. even if the statute suggests these actions are identity theft, it seems extremely harsh to charge her with that being she’s very young and this her first offense.
As to it pertaining to identity theft that is due to the specific state statute, for instance if the federal government got involved in this they would likely charge her differently based on federal statutes and laws. Washinon state has their identity theft statute also covering financial information as part of a person’s identity. Thus they are charging her according to state law.
So normally the amount will determine things like whether it’s a felony or a misdemeanor, or even what other crimes it could be. Honestly I don’t deal with state statutes in my position, so I can only really go off the statute information. Which basically says anything over 1,500.00 is considered identity theft in the first degree which is a class B felony punishable under RCW 9A.20 which…not great. So you have all the information these are the MAXIMUM set out by the state statutes.
That is not to say she will get the maximum, she may not even end up being charged for the class b felony. A lot can happen between her appearing for the initial appearance to everything after that. They may offer a plea bargain or something to knock it down to a misdemeanor or a lesser felony. You can’t rely on that as definitely going to happen.
