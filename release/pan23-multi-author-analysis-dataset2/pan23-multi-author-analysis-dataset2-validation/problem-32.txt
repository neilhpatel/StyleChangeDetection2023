Lol, nice source. He heavily criticizes the Russian top authorities for years. Some of his frequently voiced theses:
P.S. Btw, if for some reasons the current Russian government loses the power before the end of the confilct or if the results of the conflict are viewed bad in Russia, it's quite a descent chance that the next one will share views of this kind at least partially.
- At the start of the "special operation" Russia should completely destroy Ukrainian infrastructure and, overall to act much much tougher to finish everything faster. All the time and even now they act criminally soft which will only lead to more casualties on both sides in the end. They also should mobilize 1-2 mln people right after the start to keep numerical superiority all the time.
- The Russian authorities would gladly betray Russian people one more time and freeze the conflict. But, fortunately, the West will not allow it, because they gladly sacrifice all the Ukrainian population to bleed out Russia. And Ukrainians in the frenzy of Russophobic propaganda are not capable of rational actions and fully controlled by West.
- Russian authorities should send troops in Ukraine in 2014. Any tries to solve this conflict peacefully on the Russian side was dumb because West never had an interest in that and just used the time to weaponize Ukraine. Overall, it's stupid for Russia to take seriously any kind of international institutes.
- The goal should be the destruction of the Ukrainian state, the occupation of all it's territory and the reunification of the deluded by Russophobic propaganda Russian people who live there with Russia. The top officials should openly declare it in order to inspire people for the war.
And, of course, he constantly exploits the theme that ordinary soldiers are heroes, but high officials are stupid, corrupt and ready to sell their country for good relations with West. They are the reason of all the problems in the country. You can easily guess, why does he use such a rethoric.
Well, he said mainly about infrastructure. Russia started to shell it only in October, and systematically they tagerted only energy infrastructure so far. For example, all the railroads are working all the time and used for transportation of personnel and military equipment.
This is not true, and Ukraine has gone on the record as having to push diesel engines into service to make up for service problems with their electric trains.
- So, in the end the Russia's complete victory will be the only choice for Russian authorities, but it would have much lesser cost if they acted correctly from the start.
Regarding "rape and genocie" - well, I think that anyone who is really interesting in what is happening there, already knows that this topic was heavily overblown in the Western media. Ofc war itself is a very bad thing and a lot of sad stories happened there, but c'mon.
Yea, Girkin himself is a bit fucked in his head, to say mildly. Interestingly, he is quoted by Reuters.
Interesting that you define Ukrainian media as "Western". Maybe ask Ukrainians why they think their people are being raped and victims of genocide.
No, I was talking about biggest Western media exactly, those who are still trying to comply with at least some standards.
If you are interested in anyhow near to an objective picture, Ukrainian media is a trash that is not worth to check. Ofc, Russian ones are not differ too much.
There are a lot of Ukrainians in the world and they can have different opinions. Whom exactly should I ask?
- many have some their friends or relatives killed or injured. After all, significant part of the male population was mobilized, army took a lot of casualities, and there are many casualties among civilians too.
Of course, strikes on the energy infrastructure disrupt the work of all systems of the state, a significant part of which is now working for the military purposes, directly or indirectly. Including transport, production and repair of the equipment and etc. That was the purpose of the strikes, I suppose.
If you are talking about some certain Ukrainians, there could be a lot of reasons, but it's not hard to imagine many of them:
- add there media that 24/7 blame Russia for everything, savoring tragedies (only on the territories, controlled by the Ukrainian government, btw) and spreading fairy tales from Ukrainian officials.
- also, if you live in Ukraine and express a different opinion, something bad could happen to you. For example, you can easily find yourself tied naked with tape to a tree or a pillar with a tag like "traitor" in the middle of the city and be beaten by "caring" citizens - or something like that.
Well the point is to demonstrate that even if they think that, they cannot win and thus they need to find some other way of working out their frustrations.
You want to demonstrate some point to smb. May be the Russian government also want to demonstrate some point to smb. Or the Ukrainian government. Do you think anybody actually cares about that?
In the end, in current circumstances I personally don't expect any improvement in the region in next months or years. For regular people in Ukraine in the first order.
I don’t doubt there’s people with these views, but their honestly stupid if they think Russia is simply being “soft” here. So even if someone who believed this were to come into power, assuming a world that’s possible, they are going to find out real quick this is the best Russia has to offer militarily.
I suppose someone can always find a way to worry about extremists and nuclear weapons, but that’s the ONLY other card someone new could actually play, and not just talking about it, but doing it. But that’s obviously a lose to lose to Russia, there’s no winning there, period end of story.
When everything started Russian forces was instructed to very strict restrictions on the use of weapons, if it could at least potentially lead to mass casualities amoung civilians. And that was used by Ukrainian forces to their advantages. After first 2-3 weeks some of the restrictions were lifted. It's open and well known information, I suppose.
Pretty sure, Russia would use nuclear weapon only in case of direct Russia vs NATO conflict. And, of course, the US territory will be the first target for that.
Well, actually, he sounds and acts like a person who really believes in most of what he said, which is much more terrifying. Any time I would choose to have a smart enough corruption as a high official, over the person who views the world like a teenager read too many chivalrous novels.
I am not an expert to discuss how effective certain measures are - but, obviously, if desired, Russia can come up with a lot of other things to do in Ukraine.
There was no systematic impact on the infrastructure of Ukraine until October. In October they started to target only energy infrastructure, quite carefully I would say. They already showed that can organize total and long-lasting blackout, but haven't done that yet. And most of the damage still could be repaired in few weeks - Ukraine just need to repair/replace the transformers.
And besides energy infrastructure, obviously, there are a lot of other potential infrastructural tagerts there. For example, all the bridges across the Dnieper are still there and works (except Kherson's one, that was shelled by Ukraine all the time Russian troops was in the city, and was finally blown by Russians on retreat).
