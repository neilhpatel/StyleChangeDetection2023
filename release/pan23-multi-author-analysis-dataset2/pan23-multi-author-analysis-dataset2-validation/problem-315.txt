What does this mean? How did you operate for 15 years thinking that you had autonomy, only to find out that you didn't?
This is not a legal issue and as such you would have no legal recourse. If you do not like the pay, title you are given, promotional opportunities/policy, working conditions and/or environment either work to change it internally or seek a new job.
Could get a lot harder when his new employer is checking his references and HR says “He’s claiming to be the director of Marketing? I don’t know about that, but it says in the paperwork here he’s been a janitor for the past 15 years.”.
Bold of you to assume that his old employer would do anything but confirm the fact of and dates of employment. Or that his new employer would bother checking references.
If you were describing your job to someone else, as on a resume, how do you think that would differ from how your company would describe your job? If you would say, "I decide what snacks to buy," and they would say, "He orders the snacks that Bill decides to buy," why is there a disconnect? Would they be lying? Would there have been an elaborate system of deception to allow you to think you were making decisions when actually you were carrying out Bill's direction?
As best as I can tell, your concern here is (or should be) that if you apply for work elsewhere, and the prospective employer checks your references, that your current employer would say you are misrepresenting your title and what you do, which is why I'm trying to clarify what the actual disconnect is or would be.
