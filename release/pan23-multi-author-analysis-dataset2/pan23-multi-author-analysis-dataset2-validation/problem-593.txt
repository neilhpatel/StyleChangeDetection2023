Established a legal framework of "effective occupation" to determine legal recognition of existing (before 1885) and future (after 1885) territorial claims. Effective occupation meant that a European power or a chartered company had to 1) make treaties with African chiefdoms/kingdoms in the territory claimed. 2) build infrastructure like trading posts, mission stations, roads, ports. 3) have a government and administrators "on the ground" in the territory claimed.
the Conference recognized the specific claims of the International Congo Society to the Congo basin. the Congo Free State was established during this conference.
Signatories agreed to allow free flow of trade and vessels on the Niger river, Congo river, and Lake Malawi.
Signatories all committed to work to end enslavement and the slave trade by African societies on the continent.
The Berlin Conference in 1884-85 was not about drawing lines on a map dividing the continent up. The scramble to make territorial claims had already started circa 1870, and the division of the continent into colonial territories and suppression of African resistance would be an ongoing process until 1905-1910. The Berlin Conference merely established a uniform "rules of the road" to sort out competing claims, as well as signaling that multiple European powers + Ottomans + the United States were interested in territorial claims in Africa.
Anyway, to address your underlying question about why Ethiopia and Liberia weren't colonized during the Scramble for Africa.
There were a few close-calls for Ethiopia. In 1868 Britain sent a military expedition to attack Emperor Tewodros II and free British envoys that were being held hostage. The British column secured the cooperation of _Ras_ Kasa, the ruler of Tigray and rival of Tewodros II. Kasa allowed the British troops to pass through Tigray on the way to attack Tewodros' capital at Maqdala.
Under siege at Maqdala, Tewodros II committed suicide rather than surrender. The British looted his capitol, freed the hostages, and quickly withdrew from Ethiopia.
While Kasa had allowed passage, he was eager for British to leave, and relations between the British and Kasa didn't develop further. Eventually Kasa would take power as Emperor Yohannes IV from 1871-1889.
Later on, in 1895 the Italian government signed a treaty establishing a border between Italy's colony of Eritrea and Ethiopia. The treaty also established mutual diplomatic recognition between Italy and Ethiopia. Italy inserted a provision in the Italian version of the treaty that said Ethiopia agreed to become a protectorate of Italy. In the Amharic version that passage only said when Ethiopia had diplomatic dealings with other foreign powers, Ethiopia could consult with Italy if they wished.
A diplomatic crisis ensued when Emperor Menelik II denounced the duplicitous treaty, and Italy mobilized an army. Menelik mobilized his army, and famously defeated the Italians at the battle of Adwa. by /u/Quadetvincet and /u/Khosikulu goes into greater depth about that campaign. Khosi points out that the defeat at Adwa was extremely shocking to the Italian government, resulting in the fall of the Crispi government, ensuring a second attempt to invade wouldn't happen immediately.
The popular perception is that Adwa is the battle that guaranteed Ethiopian independence. It is true that Menelik II managed to gain a great deal of international recognition for Ethiopia, solidifying it's independence.
However, Adom Getachew in Worldmaking After Empire points out that even after Ethiopia joined the League of Nations in 1923, European colonial powers like France and Great Britain expressed great concern over persistence of the slave trade in Ethiopia, and doubting the Ethiopian government's ability to exert control within its borders. Britain, France, and Italy were also concerned that Ethiopia continued to purchase and distribute small arms, contravening a treaty that those European powers had made to limit the importation of firearms into East Africa. Into the late 1920s, Britain and France were proposing that the League should impose European government advisers to help guide the Ethiopian government (which Getachew states is effectively advocating for colonization).
When Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Benito Mussolini and his government were justifying their actions to Britain, France, and the US by pointing to the persistence of slavery in Ethiopia, and arguing Ethiopian government was incapable of putting an end to the slave trade.
Italy occupied Ethiopia from 1935-1941, when British armies and Ethiopian Patriotic Army drove out the occupying army. In Revolutionary Ethiopia, Edmond Keller argues that in the period from 1941-1948, Ethiopia was very reliant on British financial and technical support for reconstruction. In that period, it looked very possible that Ethiopia could end up as a British protectorate. However, the American military saw Ethiopia as a place to build a node in a global radio communications network, linking NATO with Western forces and allies in Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, etc. The inflow of American military and development aid from 1948 onwards ensured that Ethiopia did not end up as a British protectorate.
This American belief that Liberia was within their sphere of influence also led to American corporate investment in Liberia. Famously, the Firestone corporation of Ohio controlled enormous rubber plantations in Liberia.
As for Liberia, I'm not going to go into quite as much detail. The short answer is that while it was never considered a true colony or protectorate, the United States did consider Liberia within the American "sphere of influence". So, when France annexed inland Liberian territory to French Guinea colony, and Britain threatened to do the same, the US exerted diplomatic pressure to ensure Liberias independence within the reduced borders.
And like Ethiopia, the United States viewed Liberia as a strategic military partner. Early in World War 2, the US developed airfields in Liberia as bases for anti-submarine air patrols in the Atlantic.
TL;DR- Ethiopia's independence was a tenuous thing. It was a combination of military success at Adwa, shrewd diplomatic maneuvering, and luck that preserved Ethiopian independence.
Liberia's independence was preserved by American diplomatic intervention. But, the United States and American corporations treated Liberia as something of a quasi-colony.
For Russia, there was an already established relationship with Ethiopia in the 1880s, and the Ethiopian army at Adwa was equipped with Russian cannons. The historian Paul Henze has stated that these early Russo-Ethiopian relations were probably helped by both countries being Orthodox Christian countries. So, in that sense you are right that sentiment mattered for relations with Russia.
This may be partly sentimental but it could certainly be argued that historical sentimentality was a major part of Western Europe’s dealings with eg Greece (their War of Independence, Churchill’s attitudes to Greece when dealing with Stalin, even their entry into the EU). So it seems to me that it may have had some influence at least.
After the battle, these attitudes very quickly change. Where writings had criticized the cruel manners and inscrutability of Menelik II, later writings laud him for his energetic work habits, his self discipline and shrewd governance and diplomacy.
Along with these more practical issues of realpolitik, what extent did the European perception of Ethiopia as a noble and old Christian kingdom against either Islamic or more ‘pagan’ areas of the Continent - from Herodotus to mentions in the Bible and the old medieval notion of ‘Prester John’ - influence their decision to let it retain its independent status?
For other Western European visitors to Ethiopia in the mid-late 19th century, there were varying and contradictory attitudes towards Ethiopian Christianity. Paul Henze has a very good chapter (chapter 7) in _The Battle of Adwa_ by Paulos Milkias and Getachew Metaferia eds. In the chapter, he concludes that many of the visitors to the country before 1895, particularly German and Austrian ones, took a dim view of Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity and the personal piety of Menelik II and his predecessors. Their language was often deeply racist, describing Ethiopian christianity as mixed with superstition. Describing Menelik as not-really-Christian and his methods of governance being so cruel they would be unacceptable in Christian Europe.
However, according to Henze, European writings about Ethiopia before 1895 were uniformly ethnocentric and quite racist.
Where earlier writings patronizingly praised Ethiopian peasant-soldiers hardiness but lamented their inability to comprehend modern tactics; later writings argued that Ethiopians _must_ have ancestral Caucasian admixture, making them quite intelligent people, actually.
The shocking success at the Battle of Adwa really changed attitudes, forced European powers to create post-hoc justifications for how an African country could defeat a European army. A good deal of that reassessment dwelt on "racial types", but there was some post-hoc recognition that Ethiopian Christianity was more sophisticated than previously allowed.
Their second argument, which is closely tied to the "effective occupation" argument, is that the Vai, Grebo, and other peoples living in inland territory claimed by Liberia were discontented with Americo-Liberians putting levies on trade from the coast, and that the leaders of the Vai had appealed to Sierra Leone, the leaders of Grebo had appealed to Cote d'Ivoire, for help.
To those annexations, the United States reacted with diplomatic complaints, but at the time Liberia was a low priority diplomatically. After each annexation, Liberia signed treaties establishing new borders with Britain and France.
