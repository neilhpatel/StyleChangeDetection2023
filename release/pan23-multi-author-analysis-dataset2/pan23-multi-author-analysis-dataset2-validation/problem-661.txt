Friend just got the wording of his lease back paperwork. He allowed them 60 days. If they stay over the 60 days (end of August as of now) they owe another full months rent on the first of the month for each month (no prorating if they leave the next day), +$100 a day for overstaying. Which would amount to around $5000 a month based on the rent.
When you do a rent-back, if it's properly done, there will be huge penalties (like $100-200/day) for an overstaying seller and there will be enough money held back in escrow to pay for those penalties should they not leave. A good real estate attorney can make it pretty airtight so that if you do have to eventually evict them, you get paid extremely well for your trouble. Plus, since the money is in escrow, you don't have to collect.
You already see the risk. How long will it take you to evict them if they hold over? Even if they are not immune to eviction due to COVID, the number of evictions that are likely to hit the courts in the next month or two is huge. It could take you months to get to court.
Along these lines put a set % of the sale value in escrow in addition to the over stay penalties. This could add extra incentive to get out by that date.
