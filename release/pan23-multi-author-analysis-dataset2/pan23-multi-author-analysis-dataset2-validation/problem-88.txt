Palestinian isn’t a religion and they warning about it because Christian’s are about the only people left in the Middle East who aren’t anti Israel and that can easily change.
Most Christians in the Middle East (with the Christians of Lebanon itself being a mixed bag of opinikns) are anti Israel. Many of the original infamous Palestinian militia/terror groups were founded by Christian Palestinians. Christian Palestinians in the region have always been mostly anti Israel.
sure but Christians are nearly extinct in Gaza and less than 1 percent of the population in the west bank. Pretty sure there are more non-Palestinian christians left in Israel-Palestine these days than Palestinian ones.
I'd like to start a whole movement pointing out that Christians also have the whole "I give to you and your descendents this land" bit in the bible, and argue that we've got just as much right to Israel as a bunch of people whose families had pretty much been living in Europe for centuries.
Many, sure, but anywhere from 30-50% of the population of Israel are Ashkenazi Jews who had been living in Europe for centuries. The central premise of Israel is the idea that this is somehow their home, that they are entitled to this land based on their history and religious beliefs. In the modern world almost every group that engages in religious based violence gets censured, slapped with labels like "terrorist" or "extremist". I don't have a problem with the idea that Jewish people want to live in a land they feel tied to. I have a problem with the fact that despite having a massive advantage in terms of funding and military equipment, the Israeli government is uninterested in pursuing any kind of talks that would lead to peaceful cohabitation. Yes, the Jewish people have often experienced persecution, but again the past should not be used as justification for ongoing violence of the very kind they claim they need protection against historically. There are numerous documented reports of Israeli forces going into Palestinian areas and attacking Mosques and brutalizing civilians. At a certain point some of them stared into the abyss too long and now the abyss stares back.
