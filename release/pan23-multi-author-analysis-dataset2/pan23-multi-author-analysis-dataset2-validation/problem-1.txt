I asked them about something of that nature and they weren’t willing to work with me on it (it’s a committee in the advising office that makes the determination.) Basically they said that my petition wouldn’t get approved unless I late withdrew after making another “effort,” which I honestly don’t want to have to do (a) for financial reasons, I’m 23 living independently and lost my job to covid but the school won’t help me with financial aid at all so I’m $100k+ in loan debt and (b) it may sound like BS, but I don’t want to go through the humiliating and overwhelming stressful process of taking a language class, since my last attempt at the university my professor called me lazy multiple times despite me going to office hours and working my butt off.
You probably need to secure the waiver from the disability resource office, they will have the ability typically to make the academic departments stick to it.
I don’t know which school you’re at but at least at MSU the RCPD could pretty much override anything, at least in the undergraduate world. I can’t imagine it would be much different at the other universities.
I have been involved in appeals for classes for years at a major univerisity, and the sticking point here will come in because your major requires FL classes. THat is why they are giving you a harder time - in some cases, they could requie a substitute for them, and you might want to explore that (ie talk to the disability services offices if there are classes that give the cultural and linguistic aspects of a culture but not as much aspect on the language itself).
Did you start petitioning with the disability office or another office? That can make a big difference. If your documentation supports it, then they should be able to SUBSTITUTE those classes with something else or work something out. It’s all case-by-case determination, and it is up to the university to make the call.
That’s what I was thinking. My advisor told me to take this route even though I told him about the medical docs and disability diagnosis, so I’m a bit concerned that the disability department wouldn’t be about to override since I wasn’t directly referred to them. Fingers crossed though.
Got it. Unfortunately you have to let the imperfect processes finish before you should complain anyway. Sorry that higher Ed has to be such a beaucratic mess.
I worked in a Disability Services Office at a University. It’s standard procedure in many universities to approach the student disability office to get a waiver as an accommodation, so long as it is not critical to the degree (i.e. waiver French for a French degree) and the documentation supports it. Many schools will not usually provide a waiver for ADD/ADHD. ADA requires case-by-case consideration, though.
