Much, much more can be generally said about prisoner exchanges and paroles in the Civil War , here, but specifically it does seem as though Confederate prisoners were sometimes exchanged from Camp Chase for Union prisoners. In 1861 , 23 were exchanged, put on parole: which meant that they were not to resume fighting in the Confederate Army. Perhaps there were more later on. Oral tradition could have transformed your family story from simple parole into something more heroic.
When the Smithsonian recorded French Carpenter , back in 1964, he told the story and played the tune. You can hear a bit of French Carpenter , and Erynn Marshall doing Wilson's Douglas' version of the tune.
Again, oral tradition being what it is, both your ancestor and Devil Sol might have simply been paroled, and it's just not in the surviving records. But let's hope not.
That is very interesting, thank you. The “family lore” was that he was conscripted begrudgingly, as literally no one in the area had slaves, or supported slavery, as it was such an incredibly poor farming community. It was always explained that when everyone around you is equally poor and struggling to keep the crops going, there is no reason to look down on your neighbor.
In 1864-5, the level of chaos in most of the Southern and Border states was high enough that soldiers had a good chance of getting through. Papers might or might not be checked. The authority checking them might or might not care what the paper said. Locals might help or hinder people attempting to avoid the authority of either side.
That batch of 23 were from Kanawha Co. in what's now West Virginia. None of them were named Carpenter, which may be important, because here in WV we have a story of a prisoner from the Kanawha region also getting released from Camp Chase for an irregular reason. Solomon "Devil Sol" Carpenter of Clay Co. was captured and sent there. Knowing there were several good fiddlers in the camp, the commandant one day announced that the fiddler who could play the best tune could leave. Devil Sol added a couple of notes to the tune George Booker, won the contest, and was turned loose. Of course, every fiddler back in Clay immediately wanted to learn it, and lots of fiddlers still want to learn Camp Chase , when they hear the story. There is something immensely attractive about a fiddle tune that might be able to get you sprung from jail.
Amazing! Thanks for the reply and the links. Quite fascinating. So, I suppose it also stands to reason that if they were paroled, they would be given some form of writ of passage back through the lines to facilitate travel?
A determined and savvy person or small group could travel between north and south, but it was always dangerous regardless of documentation.
A soldier walking the road in uniform seems like he would be shot or captured quickly. A soldier out of uniform, I had always heard was a hangin’ for being a spy.
During this time, their was little to stop wounded soldiers or other persons from moving around. It was still quite dangerous, and travelers of either allegiance could be subject to random attacks from armed bands making assumptions, or simply robbing. Stopping at a farmhouse to beg for food could be dangerous.
To be frank, I had always assumed that was a bit of whitewashing of family history- very tepid support of what we know now as an abhorrent practice. After all, who really wants to talk about great grandpa the Nazi? Great grandpa the guy who hated nazis and only joined because he had to and is secretly happy they lost is much more palatable.
The other thing to consider, besides your ancestor's likely camp described in the other comment is the region which he was from, the mountain region of North Carolina.
The mountainous western region of NC was generally known by Northern authorities to be only very loosely under Confederate control. By 1863, many men in mountain counties were openly avoiding military service under the confederacy and any contribution to the war effort. The following years, 1864 and 1865, disaffection in the mountains boiled over into feuds, banditry, and a low boil insurgency. Bands of union aligned men and confederates struggled for local control of each mountain valley. The drain of manpower and the instability inhibited agriculture, so provisions became scarce in a hungry and violent time.
