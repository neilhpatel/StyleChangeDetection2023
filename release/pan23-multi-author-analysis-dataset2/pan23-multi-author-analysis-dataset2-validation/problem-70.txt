The following is all sourced from Thomas Asbridge's The Greatest Knight as it's the only relevant book I have on hand, I'll try and find some others and add it in an edit.
The main event of the tournament was the melee, which took place over a large area usually between two designated points, which would be the two main camping sites for the visiting nobility - William Marshall's first melee was held between Sainte Jamme and Valennes in an area nearly thirty miles across and contained hundreds of knights, which according to Asbridge was typical for the time.
In the earlier tournaments of the Mid to Late 12th Century Tournaments were almost nothing like anything you see in GoT - there might be some jousting between two opposing fighters the day before the tournament started but it was not the main event nor did it occur before two spectators boxes.
The melee began with the contestants split between two "teams" who would line up opposite each other and then once it began they would all charge, once the two sides clashed and rode through each other those who still remained on their horses would splinter off either on their own or largely into teams of men who knew each other and knights following their lords. At this point another large difference between the 12th Century Tournaments and Game of Thrones Tournaments - this was not a battle to the last man standing with a clear winner who would receive a grand prize instead it would continue until dark or when all the fighters had become fatigued and retired. The glory and the reward came from capturing the other competitors - isolating them from their teams and beating them until they yielded. Once a fighter yielded he was honour bound to pay you a ransom and would have to turn over his equipment to you to be bought back, or kept if he could not afford it - as happened to William Marshal when he was defeated by Matthew of Wallincourt, who after William had paid his personal ransom refused to give him his warhorse back without payment.
As to their frequency, they could be held on any day that was not a holiday and not between Lent and Easter - with Asbridge saying that on the tournament "circuit" of Northern France and the Low Counties an event could be being held as frequently as every fortnight, announced in advance so Contestants could plan their travel in advance, and would draw knights and higher nobles from across Europe with King William the Lion of Scotland even travelling to take part in some French tournaments.
There's no indication that blunted weapons were used in the twelfth century tourney's - wounds and broken bones were common, generally for safety you simply had the fact that a knight's armour with padding and mail was rather good at protecting you and that your opponents were trying to make you surrender, after all a dead man can't pay his ransom.
The History of William Marshall relates a story where at one tourney Marshal was set upon by five knights and bludgeoned until, when he eventually managed to break free his helmet had been hit hard enough to twist it around so it was back to front, blind and almost suffocating Marshal was so frantic to remove the now battered and misshapen helmet that he badly sliced one of his fingers in ripping it off.
But yes despite that people did still die, trampled by horses, continuing to fight when they should have yielded or just an unlucky blow Asbridge states that in one particularly bad year fifteen knights died while tourneying in Germany.
In the 13th century there was a lot of emphasis on making the tournaments safe, partly for the contestants themselves, and for spectators - in the early 13th century more and more people attended tournaments, especially the less chaotic 'roundtable' events. And, more and more of those people were women. Roundtables were a series of contests rather than war games, usually based on the tales of King Arthur, and formed the basis of what we generally think of as a 'tournament'. The events usually tested things like archery, swordsmanship, horsemanship etc., with the joust as the headline event.
People generally did use blunted weapons. For example, almost every tournament opened with a cavalry charge, and the contestants would put a rubber-like ball on the ends of their lances so that they would still unhorse their opponent, but not run them through with a lance. This was convention pretty early on, at least by the time that William Marshall started at the tournaments in the mid-12th century, though it's less clear if swords were expected to be blunted. A lot of people did use blunted swords - injuries like broken bones were common, which is consistent with blunt force rather than the impact of a sharp blade - but it wasn't a formal requirement.
Was the ranson you were honor bound to pay the same as the ransom demanded if you were a prisoner of war? Would some of the tournament competitors not be able to pay their ransom, and if not, would they be held captive?
As tournaments became more popular in the 13th century, this changed. By the mid-13th century it was law that blunted weapons had to be used in tournaments, and punishments for failing to do so could be severe.
