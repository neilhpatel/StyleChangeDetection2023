Your signed contract almost certainly included a stipulation that it was contingent on a bank actually approving a loan for the listed terms.
Directions at this point are to accept the New deal, or roll back the transaction and return the car.
Thank you for your reply. The new contract only increases my interest by .17%, but nonetheless wanted to know if I had ground to stand on and if this happens often. I heard of Spot Deliverys and YoYo financing and just don't want to be getting screwed.
Just be sure to look at the two contracts with an eagle eye. This type of situation is notorious for moving multiple elements of the deal around to keep the payments close to the same. Make sure they didn't turn a 60 payment plan into 66, or 72.. etc.
I absolutely will be looking at both in detail and asking many questions to ensure everything else is the same. I spoke to them over the phone and they assured me it was merely a small adjustment made by the loaning body. According to them It was either that I put more down, or raise the rate from 4.5% to 4.67%. Thank you for your time and advice!
Every day. Spot deliveries are an effective way to get a buyer driving their car without waiting for the financing to get completed, and keeps the metal rolling and cash flowing.
New Hampshire's law about "conditional sales agreements" pretty much says that if the dealer can't get you financing at the agreed-upon terms and conditions, they can cancel the sale. They're just skipping over a discussion of "cancellation" and immediately offering you a new deal and saying you "have to" agree to it. The nudge is subtle.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
To compel them to observe the original sale agreement ? Very probably not. When a dealer can't assign your loan to a lender, they can generally exercise a "seller's right to cancel".
Because they are also very often the mechanism for fraud, some states (hello, Texas !) don't allow them at all, and some states require the auto dealer to explicitly disclose that you have the option to accept their cancellation of the sale and get a refund, before re-opening negotiations.
They're actually required to give you a disclosure about it, and you will probably find one in your paperwork substantially similar to .
