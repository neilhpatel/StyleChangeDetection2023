But why? New York did nothing wrong here. New York didn't drive into your friend's shop. There's a lot missing from what you posted (or what your were told).
Nope. There is some missed communication here. The next in line would be your friend's insurance, and if that doesn't cover it, then there's nothing. There's not always a "next in line." Why should you (and other taxpayers of New York) pay for this?
Honestly Iâ€™m not sure how the law works in New York. If an uninsured driver drives through a store, since there is no insurence that will cover it why the next in line would be New York.
The only possible theory here is that the state neglected to maintain something and that caused the accident.
In general it's the registered owner of the vehicle who would be liable for the damage caused by any driver (except a thief).
The most likely thing is that your friend is explaining the details poorly to you, or is themselves misunderstanding what the attorney is telling them.
It's possible the attorney believes the State of New York is responsible for damage caused by an out-of-state uninsured and unlicensed permissive driver.
It's possible the attorney thinks they can apply a homeowner's insurance policy to damage that involved an automobile in a commercial property without committing easily-detectable fraud.
Homeowner's insurance covers a handful of things outside the home, like personal property stolen from an offsite storage unit or your kid's XBox stolen from their dorm room.
But I've never seen a homeowner's policy that would cover your personal injuries or property damage when you were at work, outside the home.
Neither seem as likely as poor communication among and between your friend, their attorney, you, and Reddit.
Anyhow; I don't think you've got enough information to compose an answerable question, so there's gonna be a lot of conjecture (like mine).
