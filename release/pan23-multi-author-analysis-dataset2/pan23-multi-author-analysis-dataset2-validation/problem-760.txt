I'll just add a brief comment on the possible (or sometimes assumed) relationship between open-up of ports after Perry and mass outbreak in the end of Tokugawa Shogunate.
It is true that Japan experienced several large-scale outbreaks of different infectious diseases during 1850s and 1860s after the arrival of Perry, and some Japanese are said to have blamed coming foreign ships for a possible source of these outbreaks. According to a famous episode, people of the suburb of Edo (now Tokyo) were reported to witness or fox fay-beast (Kitsune) with multiple tails that caused the disease, and some of them believed that this beast came from USA (Fujita 2020: 68f.).
this is super interesting, thank you. Do you have a good recommendation for books on this time period in Japan? My local library only had WW2 or Bushido-focused books.
The source of the cholera nation-wide outbreak in Japan 1858 indeed came from an U.S. steam frigate Mississippi dropped in Nagasaki on her way from China Sea to USA.
On the other hand, large-scale outbreak of measles also broke out around Edo in 1862 when the 3rd outbreak - 1858 had been the 2nd - of cholera during Tokugawa Shogunate overwhelmed Japan, but we don't know the exact source of this outbreak. Measles had been known in Japan for long.
: I suppose this is the most standard textbook for modern Japanese history in English. [Added]: I forgot to mention that (the 3rd edition of) this book is also translated into Japanese and highly acclaimed as a standard history book also in Japan.

As for small pox specifically, Japan was never cut off from mainland Eurasia. Small pox arrived in Japan in the 8th century and had ravaged the archipelago ever since until it was eradicated.
: Prof. Mitani is the leading scholar in this period (Bakumatsu-Meiji) in Japan, and the original of this book in Japanese was certainly written in a academic style, but not so difficult to read for the public at least in Japan. The translation is sold out, but I suppose some second hand copies can be found and purchased in the Internet.
Most of these books mentioned in the list above seem to be OK at least for me (I'm generally really not good at judging the readability of English books, sorry).
Unfortunately, the detailed historiography in English is far from my original special field of research, but I can find the book list mentioned in and especially comments by /u/NientedeNada in the subreddit.
: If you are interested in Japanese culture as well as Japanese history in the 19th century Japan, this anthology on Japanese culture, seen from an American author who had been fascinated by Japanese culture and its ghost/ fairy tales will offer some interesting aspects of Meiji Japan. [Added]: Lafcadio Hearn's Japan: An Anthology of his Writings on the Country and it's People (2007) is a readable abridged version of the original.
: Autobiography of the military officer of Imperial Japan, born in Aizu Clan (which belonged to the loser side in Restoration). Thus, this is another story of 'Last Samurai', seeing the Restoration period from losers.
