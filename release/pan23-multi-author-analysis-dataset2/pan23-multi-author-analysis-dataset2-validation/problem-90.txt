Minnesota's small claims limit is $10,000. If the total amount owing is not greater than that, then you can take your friend and her boyfriend to court yourself to try to recover it. Both of them are likely liable for the outstanding rent and for the return of property you entrusted to them, so I don't see any reason you should go after only one or the other if you pursue this. A judgment in your favour would allow you to go after their wages and bank accounts or to place a lien against the boyfriend's new home until the amount is paid.
If the amount outstanding is more than that, then you can either write off the amount over $10,000 and go through small claims, or get a lawyer and go through the main civil court system. Which is a better use of your time depends on how much the difference is, but at that point it's at least worth getting a consult before making a decision.
You can try making a police report about the property taken from your home by your tenants, but they're fairly likely to tell you it's a civil dispute because you had given them access to that property in the first place.
My friend (not the boyfriend) has actually had her things stolen from him, as well, and from what she tells me it feels like all of this may have been him conning her.
To keep things clean, would it be wise for us BOTH to pursue him, together? Or should I keep it to just me, as I'm the one he owes the most to?
Assuming I pursue rent at a later date, is it impossible to pursue him without pursuing her? We'd like to make the case that he conned her into not paying so as to support all of his activities, instead.
Because your friend also owes you the outstanding rent, I would tread carefully and strongly consider keeping those two issues completely separate. Including her in your suit won't do your friendship any favours, but it will give you the ability to recover from her if her boyfriend doesn't pay up. You can always prioritize her boyfriend for enforcing the judgment.
Another way to slice this would be to go after her boyfriend for the value of the computer, only, and deal with the rent separately at a later date.
