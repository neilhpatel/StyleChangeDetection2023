If you are sued, get a lawyer who specializes in filial liability issues - PA has a few around. Just because your income is low does not mean you win by default, and it's unlikely that if they actually sue, that you will be able to argue it effectively without a lawyer.
Your mother's estate will be liable for these debts before she is, and if the sale of the house turns up enough money to put a substantial dent in the bills, then her care providers might choose not to pursue the rest.
The house needs things Ike a new roof and new wiring in some of the rooms I don't think we'd be able to do that, so thank you.
I'll talk to her about it, she mentioned writing letters but I live 2 hours away. I wish I could find some way to get her a medical advocate of some sort, I think she mentioned that.
Thank you for the info. I don't actually know how much debt she has so I should probably ask, but I'm afraid she'll want to do something crazy like stop treatment to save money. It's important though, I know.
