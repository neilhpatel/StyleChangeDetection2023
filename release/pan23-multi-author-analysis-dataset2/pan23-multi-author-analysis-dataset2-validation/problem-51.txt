OP, I apologize, but I had to lock your post. For some reason, your post filled up with genuinely terrible advice while there weren't many moderators online. I've nuked the vast majority of the comments, and the only advice you should take is that you should not take any legal action without consulting a local attorney. People as a whole tend to get very inaccurate ideas as to abandoned property, and go pants on head crazy about pet posts, so this was a bit of a perfect storm for absurdity to meet unmitigated overestimation of one's actual legal acumen in answering questions (despite no actual knoweldge at all whatsoever.).
IANAL, but work in veterinary medicine. Contact the shelter. If you hand the dog in and put your name as an interested party, the owner has so many days to claim the pet before it is put up for adoption and then you legally adopt it. Call your local shelter and see if this is the case.
Tell the owner you can no longer take care of the dog and will be taking it to an animal shelter. Then take the dog to an animal shelter. Tell the shelter the owner abandoned the dog and that you want to adopt it. The shelter will hold the dog and may even contact the owner. If they don't claim the dog than the dog can be adopted. You then adopt the dog and it is now legally yours.
One (completely untested) idea: start talking to an animal shelter or rescue rep about their hold/process. See what would happen if you turned the dog over to the shelter, would the owners give up rights to the shelter when contacted (or if they ignore it, let the hold time lapse). Could you then legally adopt?
