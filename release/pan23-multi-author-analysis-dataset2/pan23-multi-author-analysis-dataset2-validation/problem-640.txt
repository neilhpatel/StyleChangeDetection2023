>You knowingly and voluntarily accept the risks of delays and the apartment not being ready for occupancy on the date set forth in the Lease. You agree that our failure to have the apartment ready on the set date in the Lease due to a repair, renovation, improvement, or construction delay does not constitute a willful failure to deliver possession of the apartment or entitle you to any other form of credit, discount or other compensation. We agree that rent will not commence under the Lease until possession is delivered to you.
If they cannot give you possession on day one, you are not obligated to pay rent until they can give you keys and you can move in or you can terminate the lease altogether. This seems pretty fair.
I agree that sucks and is a really shitty thing to happen to you. The issue for you however is the contract specifically outlines a situation like this and the landlords obligations if it does.
It's not an issue of me having to pay rent though, its an issue of I have nowhere to live and I have 5 days to figure it out. And it will also likely cost me more money than I have to find an airbnb or hotel to house me for a month. Didn't mention this in the post, but I'm literally leaving residency for my first real job, I don't have the ability to pay any more than I was planning on. If they would have given me more notice in advance I maybe could have minimized the cost, but 5 days is not nearly enough time. Or am I crazy for thinking this isn't reasonable?
