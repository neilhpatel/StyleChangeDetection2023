I think a lot of the people calling for direct NATO intervention (and a no-fly zone would be exactly that) underestimate the death toll and increase in risk towards nuclear war.
As horrible as this war is, and as much as we all want it to end - as long as Russia doesn't attack NATO directly and deliberatly, it would be a horrible mistake to intervene. A no-fly zone would be the brink of World War 3.
I think a lot of people have swallowed too much kool-aid and think Russia is itching to launch nukes. I do not think it a realistic possibility at all that Russia would commit suicide by going there. They have absolutely nothing to gain by doing so, and would lose absolutely everything if they did. And they know it. It's why they keep bringing it up; to scare the world into allowing their genocide of Ukraine to continue.
As it stands, Russian nukes are working much better than Nato nukes. Because their deterrent factor is allowing this whole horrific ordeal to continue. Meanwhile, Nato nukes do not seem to worry Russia in the slightest. For exactly the same reason; they know that they are not going to be used.
The only reasonable and humane solution here would be to force Russia to halt its war via full Nato intervention. Russia knows they got no chance against Nato, but as long as Nato pussyfoots around, Russia gets to destroy all the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine, leaving, eventually, 40 million people without electricity, heat or water as winter approaches. I do not find this a palatable eventuality.
Its not about wanting it, its about accidentally happening. See Able Archer, Cuba, Berlin crisis etc. In none of these cases anybody wanted to nuke each other, but they thought the other one would do it. Simulations have shown again and again that nuclear war is a possibility.
Do you expect Nato to go first-strike then? No? That leaves Russia. Will they use nukes first, fully knowing that it is a self-destruct button? No. Despite the apparent idiocy of this whole affair, Russia has not displayed characteristics of an irrational actor. They just overplayed their hand. They aren't going to burn their own house down just to spite the west.
What they are going to do, if Nato continues to allow it, is destroy the ability of Ukraine to remain warm and fed into the winter. Then, blackmail Ukraine into relinquishing the annexed territories or risk the entire civilian population perishing from "natural causes" as temperatures drop and power stations continue to be bombarded.
Russia using nukes wouldn't be to help them win a war against NATO, it's to make sure NATO also loses. Also, if NATO intervention is the only thing keeping Russia from nuking Ukraine, Russia would have no incentive to not use them if NATO is intervening anyways, either through Article 5 or a no fly zone.
Its not about NATO deciding to go first strike. Its about them thinking it might happen. Its about commanders in the field, who have control over tactical nukes, deciding in a moment of weaknes. Its about false info. human error.
Not clear. Evidence points more to a UA missile gone rogue, as the S-300 doesnt have the range (at least from russia, barely from Belarus).
I agree with you that nobody wants a nuclear war, and I agree with your assessment of russia. But I think this is one of the cases where things can get out of NATOS or russias hand quickly.
You are bit too dramatic I think, IMHO a partial no fly zone that would cover the western part of Ukraine would solve missiles landing in Poland and not necessarily escalate the conflict further.
No fly zone would be for planes ofc but for rockets and missiles too. Maybe I am wrong to expect a jet to intercept a missile or rocket inbound from russia.
If a fighter is shot down, then that's the red line, NATO would have to intervene at some point, especially if it comes from belarus, go clean up all those launchers and see how russia reacts.
But I agree that the best would be to provide all the stuff needed to UA so they can end this as soon as possible but many countries are still slow on it.
You dont need a long range AA missile to intercept a long range cruise missile. S-300 has just 100 or 200 km of range, more than enough to intercept low flying cruise missiles.
AA systems are normally multi-layered point defense (as in, defending certain points nstead of the whole front) systems. If you put your AA close to the russian border, your AA would've been destroyed in the first few hours of the war. So you should not do that. Even if it wasn't, it would be easy to overwhelm a single-line-of-defense AA's radar with chaffs, decoys etc., so that many missiles could get through. Then you would be defenseless. Hence you want multiple layers. AA near Lwiw makes perfect sense, to, well, defend Lwiw.
You're welcome! And again, Article 5 isn't really a "button you can press" (even tho r/NonCredibleDefense pretends otherwise haha), but more a process where a lot of states have to agree on things. And even then they don't have to necessarily use their military.
And again, both Poland and the US have said its very likely a UA missile. Which also just makes a lot more sense.
