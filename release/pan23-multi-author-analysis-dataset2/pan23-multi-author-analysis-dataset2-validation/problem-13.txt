You can try talking to city hall about changing how that road is set up, to encourage slower traffic or to divert traffic away from the street, or about setting up more park space or play structures/fields to give the kids somewhere to go that isn't the road.
In principle, you could probably get a traffic officer to come by and ticket the parents of the children involved for being in the street and blocking traffic, but in practice, ticketing children for playing near their homes is usually a terrible look politically, and I wouldn't expect it to actually happen.
Yeah, speed warnings and ticketing campaigns generally don't do much to address how people drive. You usually have to redesign the street to actually effect change, since the way people drive is more informed by the road and the other drivers than by the law.
I can't exactly avoid it since I live on the street. ðŸ˜‚ I do drive slowly. My main concern is the kids getting hit by someone speeding. Sometimes we get people going 50mph. We had a speed monitor thing on our street for a week, but it did nothing.
Yeah, this street is connected to a main road and was one of the first to be built in the area. Its got a curve and ends pretty quick to a stop light.
The law is likely to be a _reactive_ tool, that will kick in when someone's kid is inevitably hit in the street, to assign blame as fairly as can be done. That's not much comfort, for obvious reasons.
That's a valid concern, and frankly I share your surprise that the other parents are nonchalant about the risks to their children, but it is what it is. My point is ultimately that this isn't much of a legal issue, so much as an urban planning one - assuming for the moment that kids _are_ going to play, the question is really "where," and not "how do we stop it," and going the other direction, protecting that space from reckless driving is similarly more of a planning problem.
You could petition whatever municipality is in charge of the road to add traffic calming measures such as speed bumps and roundabouts. Try reaching out to your very local representatives' offices; at the local level many representatives are actually really excited about small changes that help improve the neighborhood.
