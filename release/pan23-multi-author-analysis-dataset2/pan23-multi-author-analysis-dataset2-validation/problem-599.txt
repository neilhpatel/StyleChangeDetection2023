I will leave it to Africa experts to tackle the Africa side of this equation. But I'll repost part of a related I've written.
West Germany was in many ways a special case. Its Marshall Plan money was, as noted above, actually less than the money received by the UK, France and Italy, and was in fact not even the biggest source of aid it received in the postwar period - it received some $1.4 billion in ERP funds, but from the end of hostilities it had also received some $1.7 billion in the GARIOA program (Government and Relief in Occupied Areas), which was also US goods. This was also a loan, and so West Germany technically owed some $3.3 billion, and in 1953 reached an agreement where it would repay a third of this some (which was finally paid off in 1971). The remainder of the funds were in the country's ERP Special Fund, which actually continued to grow in size and make low-interest investments. Many of these loans were used for literal reconstruction in critical areas: transportation, export industries, housing and agriculture. The ERP funds later would be used in supporting international development, and ironically used by the German federal government to invest in small businesses in former East Germany after 1990.
The Marshall Plan, officially the European Reconstruction Program (ERP) was authorized by Congress in 1948, and administered by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA). The program ran from 1948 to 1952, and cost a total of $13 billion (or something over $65 billion in circa 2000 dollars). A significant condition for receiving funds was that the European recipient countries collaborate among themselves on economic integration, and so the 16 countries that signed up to the plan (which were, listed from greatest recipient to smallest: the UK, France, Italy, West Germany, Netherlands, Greece, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Turkey, Ireland, Sweden, Portugal and Iceland) formed a multilateral Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC -West Germany joined in 1949).
The program worked as followed: the OEEC determined what each member country needed, based on national governmental requests). The ECA in turn transferred the requested goods, which were largely American-made products being exported. The American exporter was paid by the ECA with ERP funds, but the European recipient country did not receive the items as gifts, but as items to be repaid with loans. The payments for these loans were made in local currency and deposited in a counterpart fund which could be used by the national governments for other investment projects (it was generally understood that the money would not have to be returned to the US).
So - the Marshall Fund actually has a few common myths associated with it: that it was meant to rebuild defeated Axis countries (especially Germany), that it was a gift, that it was a vast sum of money, and that it is singlehandedly responsible for rebuilding European economic prosperity as began to be experienced in the 1950s. While the plan played a role, it was as much psychological as economic.
That's some overview of the Marshall Plan. It wasn't a plan that "completely rebuilt Western Europe from the ruins" as much as it was a plan whereby the US government paid US producers to send requested exports to countries participating in the program (a number of which, such as Portugal and Turkey, had not even been combatants in the war at all, let alone suffered any damage) which was meant to foster greater European economic cooperation. Even here, the results were probably as much political and psychological as economic.
A final point I would like to note: comparing western Europe circa 1945 and Africa circa 1960 is already a very flawed proposition. Despite the massive human losses, infrastructure damage, and economic losses from the war, Western Europe was still one of the most advanced parts of the world in economic terms. Even in a country devastated like Germany, the human capital was still largely there - even if cities were in ruins with millions dead and displaced, the survivors were almost all literate and educated (many highly educated), with professional skillsets intact, and with personal years to decades of experience working in urbanm advanced industrial economies overseen by professional civil services. The UK, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Portugal also still maintained colonial empires.
In contrast, African colonies at independence were in a vastly different place. The population was overwhelmingly rural and agricultural, with very low literacy and education rates. Indeed, colonial administrations in Africa often prohibited certain levels of education or employment for Africans. Economic, social and political development in the former African colonies was therefore starting from a very different place than Western Europe after 1945, which was primarily rebuilding.
African countries have seen massive improvements in literacy rates, educational attainment, infant mortality, and life expectancy since 1960. The life expectancy part is particularly interesting given that the country with the lowest life expectancy in Africa hits the same marker that the United States did in 1900. Poverty in Africa is very real, but much of the issue is that overall its poverty is relative - the countries there have not grown as rich as fast as other parts of the world, especially in the past three decades.
It's a much bigger debate how much foreign aid has helped or hindered that development, so I will leave that part to one side. But a lot of Western perceptions of "Africa" seem to be stuck in stereotypes or data based on decades past.
That's what I got from Susan Stern's "Marshall Plan 1947-1997: A German View", which is a source for the original answer. Available . Her exchange estimate might be off...I do see estimates closer to $90 billion in 2000 dollars looking online.
While I'm poking around in that source, it might be of interest to readers a further breakdown as to what the Marshall Plan funds were spent on. Almost 70% of the $13 billion went to commodities: $3.2 billion on food, feed and fertilizer; $1.9 billion on machinery and vehicles, and $1.6 billion on fuel, with much of the rest going to such things as US currency for loans.
I guess to answer that I'd need to know more specifically what you mean about a divergence in transportation infrastructure between the US and Western Europe.
You said that the Marshall Fund didn't rebuild European economic prosperity, but is it responsible for the divergence in infrastructure between the United States and most of the recipient countries? I'm thinking of transportation specifically.
Let's take some economic powerhouses for comparison. In 2000, for Nigeria, the US' top import was Oil and Gas, Nigeria's top import was Fabricated metal products. In 2000, for Germany, the US' top import was Transportation Equipment, Germany's top import was Computers and Electronics. These are two very different economic relationships. Nigeria's is based on the extraction of natural resources, which employs very few people and does not involve the creation of general use infrastructure. Germany's is based on complex manufacturing, which employs many people and requires general use infrastructure.
This question encompasses an enormous amount of content. I will first point your attention to some aspects on why the Marshall Plan seems to have been effective in promoting Western Europe's post WOII economic boom, the conclusion to which I will link with the some perspectives on the general effectiveness of foreign aid.
The Organization for European Economic Cooperation certainly helped pave the way for these other treaties and organizations, but institutionally speaking it's actually the forerunner of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The United States wasn't directly involved in those projects of European integration.
The academic consensus on the effectiveness of the Marshall plan is that it was small relative to the size of European Economies, and that the popular image of it 'rebuilding Western Europe' is inaccurate. Eichengreen & Uzan (1992) suggest that it increased Western European's national income by 1951 by about 2%. However, it did set Western Europe on a path that would enable a very strong growth trajectory from 1951 to about 1972.
After WOII, European Economies were in crisis. Damage to infrastructure caused by WO II drastically decreased the productivity of countries. This would require a well thought out long term investment strategy to regain productivity levels of the pre-war period. At the same time, the pressure on governments to increase standards of living in the short term was large, after years of suffering. The Marshall Plan, though small in size, both supported governments in this trade-off, by making available some funds to go to (American bought) basic necessities such as food.
In short, the Marshall plan was not effective because a large amount of money was made available, but because it came at a time that it helped stabilize Western European economies, and came with requiremants that created some of the conditions that helped Western European economies with their immense growth from 1947 to 1972 (though there are many other reasons for this growth, such as a positive labour market dynamic because of population growth, a stable global financial system, technological advancements, ...).
The historical lessons from the Marshall plan thus indicates that it is not necessarily foreign aid, but financial stability and good institutional reforms that enable market forces to do their work and induce growth. The strenh of the Marhall plan was that its conditions strenhened Western-European financial & political stability through debt relief and immediate aid, while pushing governments towards productive investment and pro-market institutional reform.
