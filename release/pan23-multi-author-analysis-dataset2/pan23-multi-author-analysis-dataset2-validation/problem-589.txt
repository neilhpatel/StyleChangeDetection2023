Attorney here. U/sat_ups is right. I will add one thing. The state in which the work to be performed is likely the relevant state not where you live. So if OH is where the contract was to be performed, his analysis is spot on. If OH is where you live, then you need to look into the other states law on enumerated damages. That being said, the OH analysis is likely to be what most if not all states employ.
This doesn't seem to definitively answer the question. If no hours are worked, the penalty is deducted from a $0 check and a bill will be sent. For almost $12k, I'd bet they will send the bill and sell it to collections if it goes unpaid.
Not a lawyer but a recruiter. I don’t think it’s enforceable. Curious where your contract is located (state)? Most employment legal issues side with the employee as long as you’re not terminated for cause.
Also who issued the offer letter - Was it the company/hospital you interviewed with or is it from the staffing agency?
At face value, it seems like the recruiter doesn’t want to miss out on her commission and trying to twist your arm with scare tactics. I know there is a big mark up with nurses right now.
The agency pays the temp their pay check. The temp is an employee of the staffing agency, not the company.
Yes - I would cease all communication with the recruiter, they're clearly trying to save their commission. It's up to the company to sue OP if they want this supposed penalty (which does not sound enforceable as written IMO).
Staffing agency bills the client the bill rate ( pay rate + mark up) according to the hours on the time sheet the temp fills out and submits to the agency.
If OP is feeling froggy, I’d recommend reaching out to the hospital HR team and ask if that’s their policy or the agencies.
