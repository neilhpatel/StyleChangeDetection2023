Could you please help me out with a few images depicting what you're talking about? My suspicion is that you're seeing padded coifs that cover the lower part of the face, or possibly mail coifs that do the same.
I had to look a long time to find a name for them, but "fringed hood" seems to match. Or this one but it's a LARP item so it's not really a source, just a reference to what I mean.
I guess my question more specifically is: Was cloth-over-mouth (and optionally nose) a real thing, and was it done in medieval times? Was it a fashion choice or did it have some kind of practical element? I know women and nuns and stuff would sometimes do it, but I'm asking in general.
So no, not padded coifs or mail, since those are specifically protective. I thought maybe they were used so mail/plate doesn't scrape against a soldier's mouth and there's some softness in between, but that wouldn't explain wearing the cloth alone or with an open face helmet.
The first image looks like a civilian coif to me. It's cut high in the back and swoops down at the ears, which would make sense as they were tied under the chin.
The third image is a Victorian drawing, right? I would guess those are supposed to be mail coifs or some other protective garment worn under helmets.
People definitely sometimes wore garments that covered part of the face. My guess is it's because northwest Europe can be bloody cold and they spent a lot more time in the weather than we do. I know more about the armor specifically. There is a lot of evidence that, from as early as the 11th century, the wealthiest European soldiers were wearing mail coats with integrated coifs, which could be laced over the mouth so nothing below the nose was visible. Until fully enclosed helmets appeared around 1200 (and for some time afterward) this would be the normal way of things.
At a guess, because you don't breathe well with cloth or metal pressed up against your nose, while your mouth, neck and jaw are pretty exposed and can be easily covered.
The thing is, we don't have a user's manual for this stuff. Why did people wear hose tied to their belts instead of pants? We don't know, it's just something they did.
