The desirability of Greek mercenaries in the Archaic period is often cited as an argument in favour of their tactical superiority. The authors you mention are only a few examples of this trend; we could add, for example, J.R. Hale's chapter in Men of Bronze (2013). It is argued that, if other peoples were so keen to hire "men of bronze," as a messenger to pharaoh Psammetichos I allegedly called the Greeks raiding Egypt (Hdt. 2.152), it must be because they offered something that local troops could not provide. The reference to bronze armour is generally taken to imply what that something was: heavy equipment and the related ability to fight in close combat in regular formations.
But the story in Herodotos involves both Greeks and Karians, and he says nothing about their fighting methods. On its own, this doesn't say much about the martial prowess of Greeks at the time. There is no explicit evidence that Psammetichos or any other Near Eastern power specifically wanted to hire Greeks for any reason; they simply appeared on the coast at a convenient time. We can assume that the pharaoh was mostly looking to boost his numbers, and that the Greeks and Karians who practiced piracy along the coasts of the Levant would be eager for more regular employment and a more secure source of income. Herodotos claims that the arrival of the Greeks and Karians fulfilled a prophecy that Psammetichos would be saved by men of bronze, which is far more interesting to him than any tactical matters.
The argument that Luraghi and others have built on the basis of the Amathous Bowl is similarly tenuous. It seems to show men in armour and helmets we associate with Greeks, moving in a regular line and assaulting a city. Again, the mere reference to Greek equipment (and in this case, something like a formation) has been taken as evidence that these are Greeks hired for their tactical skills and superiority to local troops. But how can we be sure?
This is actually where the Greeks themselves come to our aid. Herodotos describes the armour and weapons of all the different contingents in the army of Xerxes. Admittedly it's centuries off, but its claims are pretty striking:
It would be easier to answer the question if our understanding of Phoenician and Cypriot warfare of the period weren't so murky. We know practically nothing about how these peoples fought. Local descriptions are effectively non-existent and even depictions are rare. On those grounds, it already seems very risky to take one of the rare images from this region and time period and assume that the people depicted on it are not even locals, but Greeks. How would we know the difference?
How much of a challenge does his theory offer? Archaic poetry and comparative ethnography () aside, doesn't comparative analysis on the basis of the loosely spaced Roman, Iberian and "Celtic" style of warfare indicate that a dense formation is not necessarily the natural state of relatively untrained troops? Especially as recent scholarship has pointed out that the alleged Roman switch from phalanx to maniples didn't occur at the traditionally suggested dates, and that there was likely a continuity of fighting style even if the formation changed^1 .
If we can trust Herodotos here, and if we can assume that Phoenician and Cypriot equipment had changed no more than that of the Greeks themselves in the intervening centuries, then we end up with local people armed and armoured in ways that would be very hard to tell apart from Greeks on a piece like the Amathous Bowl. Their helmets and round shields, the main visible features on the bowl, would look identical at that scale. In other words, we have reason to doubt that the Amathous Bowl even shows Greeks, let alone Greek hoplites in a phalanx formation. We can choose to read it as a depiction of Greek mercenaries in action, but it is perhaps more likely that it simply shows the indigenous warriors and warfare of Phoenicia and Cyprus.
Certainly it is beyond doubt that heavy infantry warfare was known to the peoples of Mesopotamia at this time. The Neo-Assyrian Empire, especially in the 8th century BC, seems to have relied on a corps of , sometimes depicted with , to operate alongside its archers and cavalry in battle (for which see Deszö, The Assyrian Army (2012)). There seems to be little need for the Assyrians to hire Greeks if they could raise such troops locally. The Assyrian presence in the Levant means that the Phoenicians had almost certainly encountered these troops and may have adapted their own fighting methods in response; either way, by the time of the Persian conquest they were no strangers to the concept of heavy infantry fighting, as Herodotos' description makes clear.
In this light it seems that the "Greek mercenaries" reading of the Amathous Bowl is putting the cart before the horse. It is assumed that the Greeks had unique value as heavy infantry, and therefore any heavy infantry we see on an object like this bowl must be Greeks. But the Greeks were not alone in using round shields or specialising in close combat. Indeed, they were likely only the westernmost offshoot of a whole range of Eastern Mediterranean peoples (from Egyptians to Phoenicians, Lykians, Lydians, Phrygians and Karians) who mainly fought with shield and spear. The bowl may not show Greeks at all, but even if it does, that may not be because Greeks were at all remarkable - just because they (along with the Karians) populated the mercenary market.
More recently, Paul Bardunias has argued that the formation of closed shieldwalls (akin to a sort of proto-phalanx) is natural behaviour for shield-carrying spearmen behaving as a mob, as each man seeks protection among his peers. Every band of spearmen will almost automatically form a relatively tight formation, however loosely organised, to protect itself from missiles and disruption. This is a more serious challenge to Van Wees' fluid concept of early hoplite fighting, but it still renders the Amathus bowl irrelevant to the discussion; we have no reason to assume that the basic tactics adopted by the Greeks around this time would not be used by similarly equipped Phoenicians and Cypriots as well.
If this is right, then the argument against Van Wees' model of the development of hoplite combat disappears. If we cannot securely identify the men on the bowl as Greeks, we certainly cannot infer that it shows a Greek phalanx in action.
^1 I acknowledge Michael J. Taylor's recent argument to the contrary, but vehemently disagree with his interpretation of the single painting he relies on and argue that archaeology and trends in artwork support the continuity theory.
Roman legionary spacing is not particularly strong evidence, since it is so controversial (and has been for over a century; I can cite you the endless exchange between Delbrück and Kromayer on this exact subject). It seems more relevant in the case of Greek hoplites to imagine what the occasional mention of synaspismos might mean. Of course it implies that the more "standard" formation still included room for condensation, but it also implies that there was an understood "tight" formation, whereas there was no formation described as loose or open until the Hellenistic pike phalanx.
The rest of Bardunias' theory is derived from experimental archaeology, and how much value this has in reconstructing historical warfare is in the eye of the beholder. That said, he offers several inherently persuasive reasons why a denser formation would offer advantages compared to a looser one, and at the very least his experiments show that tight shield walls could exist without immobilising and ineffectualising individual warriors.
I can't speak to the Persian example, but based on his article in AW XI.6 he really doesn't have a firm grasp of Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian equipment or methods of warfare (Murray Dahm's article aside), and in the case of Scandinavians doesn't fully grasp the problems of interpreting the sagas. In particular, he interprets the Bayeux Tapestry as showing a wall of overlapping shields despite this requiring a spacing of less than 60cm per man, which is too dense for combat according to his own experiments, and doesn't seem aware that in the 13th century sagas (our only detailed narrative sources) the skjaldborg is not how most warriors fight in battles. I take your point about it being more of a challenge because it uses the "Heretic" methodology to make his argument, though.
This will quickly devolve into a battle of comparative cases. Bardunias tends to cite Persian and Saxon shieldwalls as well as more modern anthropological evidence from the Philippines. This doesn't necessarily mean that he must be right, but it is a more serious challenge in the sense that it lines up the same methodology to advance the argument in a different direction, rather than simply restating the case for orthodoxy.
I'm not so sure it's particularly controversial anymore. While Goldsworthy and Sabin suggested that either the 3 foot spacing given by Vegetius was correct or that the Romans mostly fought with a 3 foot spacing but could fight in a looser 6 foot formation, respectively, Daly argued that the Romans were capable of fighting in close or open order as required, with some preference for open order, Quesada-Sanz argues that the Romans formed up with a 3 foot spacing but expanded and fought in a 6 foot spacing, Sage accepts Polybius' version, and Michael J. Taylor and M.C. Bishop use visual and archaeological evidence to bolster Polybius' credibility. Even Sam Koon, one of whose examiners was Phil Sabin, accepts Polybius' spacing and provides an excellent critique on the idea that Vegetius was transmitting a Republican source with regards to spacing. I think it's fair to say that, if not entirely without detractors, the idea that the Romans fought in an open formation is the dominant interpretation, and the one resting most solidly on the most evidence.
