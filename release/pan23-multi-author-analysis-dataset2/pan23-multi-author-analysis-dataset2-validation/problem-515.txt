Yeah… I remember when they were going to just “weaken” roe v Wade… didn’t believe it then and I was right, I don’t believe it now… they’ll probably announce it at the Mitch McConnell center or the federalist society….
Considering what Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett have said, such an extreme decision looks very unlikely. I am not surprised in the slightest by that.
Pfft. Even with the most extreme ruling possible, they are no longer in a strong enough position in state legislatures to overturn a Presidential election, and when you look at how their internal divisions are now starting to cost then control of legislative chambers even when they hold majorities of seats, I think their position will only weaken further.
I think this is going to backfire disastrously on the Republicans if they issue a pro-ISL decision regardless of how extreme or “moderate” it is. 2014 is long gone, and these midterms show as much. Republicans actually have to worry about voters now and their internal factions are at each others’ throats. Moore v. Harper is not going to save them from that.
It is foolish to only look at the current status quo when analyzing such decisions. You have to look at how it would impact us all in possible future circumstances as well.
There is no status quo. I’m responding to certain assumptions that people think will hold in future. These are the same assumptions that caused people to falsely expect Republicans to win these midterms. Instead, they got mutilated on the state level.
If the old status quo still held, Republicans would have just ridden a red wave. People are simply not willing to look past their preconceptions because such things are based on what happened in the period from 2010-2016.
You assume that electoral coalitions and the alignments of factional interests will remain the same and that certain patterns of pendular alternation from a previous period will continue.
The Dobbs decision, among other things, is leaving the different factions of the Republican party with irreconcilable incentive structures that have already begun to force them into working at cross purposes. This is frequently overlooked by those who assume the old “status quo” is still there.
My goal here is to help people look past those preconceptions. In 2016, there was a false sense of impending victory that engendered apathy. I fear a false sense of impending defeat could engender apathy as well and that the blackpilled doomers now pose the biggest threat with their hyperbolic statements.
Think of it like a thermodynamic system where certain outcomes become entropically favored or disfavored depending on changes to the overall conditions.
As when a solid undergoes a phase transition from one allotrope to another and the change in phase is not perfectly instantaneous but takes a period of time to fully propagate, so too will it take more time for the changes of this transition to fully propagate through the system.
