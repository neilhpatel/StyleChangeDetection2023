Security: Sitting down during a job is not a right. Many jobs have no expectations for siting and changing the status quo is legal. In fact many jobs have that in their job description (must be able to stand 8 hrs.) Unless you can prove discrimination it sounds like they can do what they want and have expectations for security to be mobile. As others said if someone who has a disability they can get a reasonable accommodation.
If the former, they likely have little recourse. If the latter, your site supervisor should talk to their contact person at the client and find out why the change has been made.
Individuals may be able to bring up a disability issue, if it exists, and ask for mats or chairs as reasonable accomodations.
You might be able to get at least something by going to OSHA or state worker health and safety authorities. It's pretty common to require some mitigation for 12 hours in one spot on concrete. Might not be chairs, but might be able to at least force getting some fatigue mats or changes to the work requirements.
In the meantime, good, well fit shoes and socks help. Unfortunately, security work if full of companies and executives who are perfectly fine with destroying employees bodies for not good reason.
