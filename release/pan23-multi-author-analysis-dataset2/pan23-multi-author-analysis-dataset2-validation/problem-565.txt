That's generally not how it works. If there is no will, instead of becoming the executor, you become the administrator. Where aare you located and how did you manage to put the house into your name?
This has all happened in Tennessee. I was able to change the deed to my name with shelby county by submitting a notarized document basically saying I am only living relative, maybe I am not using the right term. I was not able to change the mortgage to my name with Bank of America. They needed a will, which she did not have. They told me I could simply pay the monthly mortgage and "hope" they let me become owner of the home once it is paid for.
I simply chose to not do anything and let the home foreclose. I hadn't looked into it since then, 2019, and received a letter from Rubin Lublin law firm recently about surplus funds. I honestly have no interest in the funds because I do not want to be responsible for completing debt payments. I have no idea who all she owes and no time to find out. I don't even live in Tennessee anymore.
I would be as well. You were not authorized to administer the estate (presumably) and even if you were, the debts have to be paid. I'd talk to a lawyer before anything else. Her creditors might still be able to come after you personally for putting the house into your name instead of selling it and paying her debts and taxes. You cannot inherit debt, but if you administer improperly, you can be personally liable.
To protect yourself, or just for peace of mind, you should consult with a probate attorney who is a member of the Tennessee bar. They can tell you what exposure, if any, you have here, and/or if you can accept the money.
The purpose of the foreclosure is so that the overdue property taxes can be paid and also the mortgage company can get their share of the proceeds. Most likely they deducted the $100,000 that they were due and what is left over goes to the heirs (you).
Edit: I hope I did not make a mistake in doing this. I got absolutely nothing out of it. I even paid for her funeral out of pocket. The home was foreclosed and auctioned a few months later.
You can walk away from this and do nothing if you choose to do so. You don't need to retain the services of the law firm (that contacted you about the excess funds) unless you choose to do so.
After you get more information about how much the excess proceeds are, you can decide whether you want to open up a small estates probate or retain the services of a probate attorney to handle her estate. In view of your comment about her debt, it is possible that her remaining, outstanding debt might wipe out the excess proceeds and there might not be much left over for you.
It is also possible that one of her creditors (companies that she owes money to) might file themselves to open up probate of her estate so that they can get paid some or all of what they are owed, if they find out that the excess proceeds exist.
