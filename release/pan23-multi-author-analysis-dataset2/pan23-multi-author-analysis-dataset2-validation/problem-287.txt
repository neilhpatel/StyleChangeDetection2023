First off, I’m a little unsure what you mean by “liberal democracy”. Are you meaning universal suffrage? Or multi-party democracy or what? In any case, I’ll try to describe it:
If you’re talking about how laws were made, and who controls government, then I think it fails, miserably.
The 1889 Constitution created two houses, one “upper” house, the House of Peers, and the “lower” House of Representatives (I’m translating from: 貴族院 and 衆議院 respectively). The Peers were nobles and basically rich property and business owners nominally appointed by the Emperor, Prime Minister or Head of the Privy Council. The lower house was officially elected by men over a certain age and, if I recall, property or tax paying status (this eventually settles to universal male suffrage for those 25 years old and older). So, maybe, liberal democratic?
Again, on paper, leadership of government fell to the PM, since, I cannot stress enough, Japan REALLY wants to look “modern” for the time. However, quietly, the Privy Council sort of rules, since they control access to the Emperor (and his ultimate acquiescence for things to be signed by him). Let’s take an example of how laws were actually passed:
On paper, the Emperor controls and “allows” everything. In practice, this was not the case. As during the Shogunate, and the Regent system before it, it was understood that the Emperor would never actually make day to day decisions of any kind. This thing is very Japanese in a way; the Emperor is the soul and divine justification for Japan, but no one expected him to wield power actually.
As the example shows, lawmaking by the actually elected Representatives is stupendously hard, and frankly, doesn’t happen much, in my opinion, not without hefty influence peddling. Any one Cabinet minister can derail the entire process, even if the PM backs it, and anyway, it is still up to the Privy Council. Again, in my opinion, this means the elected representatives don’t actually run the government in any meaningful way. I assume this doesn’t fit your idea of “liberal democracy”?
Later, if I can find time, I’ll tackle the movement from this system to a more fascist/nationalist one.
It seems you're making the claim here that even the period of Taisho Democracy in the 1920s was ultimately a pretense - is that indeed the claim you're making?
First off, this is when (IMO) we start seeing more connections to the Zaibatsu and people in the House of Representatives and Peers; many of the members are businessmen (who do not give up any of their shares or interests in these business). Something like half of each body seems to be made up of either full time or part time business people ( So, we can contend that they didn’t exactly have “the people’s” wants or needs in mind (though, as we get closer to the wars in China, and later WW2, public opinion will start to play a stronger role in the overt nationalism we see from the military (at least, retroactively).
