I believe the official story, but it seemed far fetched that Russia would invade Ukraine 9 months ago, yet here we are. But a coverup to avoid an escalation isn't that far fetched either, though unlikely as it may be.
I have a feeling this a coverup to avoid WWIII since it didn't really strike a major city or anything. Ofc the official story could be true since I don't get what the point of attacking some random Polish farm could do for the Russians aside from spreading terror among civilians since that is what those demons like to do.
NATO is now seriously considering setting up Air Defenses to defend from further accidents like this near and around Russia and Ukraine, and especially in Poland now. I'm glad WWIII isn't happening but it sucks Ukraine still has to suffer at the hands of Russia with NATO intervention being unlikely.
Poland alone would have happily escalated. Im not talking boots in russia or a radioactive kremlin, but using the attack to get more support for more aid etc. And Russia wouldnt have done shit as they would just be lucky they didnt start a direct war with NATO...
