Groupon’s business model is based on a revenue share between themselves and the local merchants, or in my case, hotels (I worked for Groupon Getaways). I am claiming that they purposely misled their own sales team, and their merchants, on how the revenue share worked. In my case with hotels, my General Manager, who is now still currently the Chief Financial Officer at Groupon, created a misleading excel sheet with a hidden tab that factored in an additional “booking fee” to customers purchasing vacations.
Many states have Public Attorney General Acts - they allow anyone in the state to sue an entity for statutory violations. If you could prove this happened in California, the state has a four-year statute of limitations on "unfair competition," but allows just about anyone to claim they were harmed by unfair competition or unfair business practices. I'm not sure if this would qualify, because I don't fully understand the details.
The booking fee is buried in a line item called “Taxes and Fees.” It is not individually listed. Additionally, Groupon distributed a purposely misleading excel sheet to their hotel partners to hide the fact that Groupon was doing it at all. Would that be illegal?
