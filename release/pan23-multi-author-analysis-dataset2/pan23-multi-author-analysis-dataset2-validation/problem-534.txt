Likely illegal. The City of Seattle now runs a Renting in Seattle Help Line at 206-684-5700. Contact them for guidance.
Did the landlord put that in writing? It is very likely illegal. Further, Seattle allows tenants the right of private action for damages up to $3000 plus attorney's fees. Check local lawyers who will do a free consult and work on retainer; there should be some (or a tenant's union can point you to one).
If illegal, you may need a local real estate lawyer to write a letter to ypur landlord to pursuade them that this approach won't hold up in court. If you live in a building with multiple tenants reach out to them about sharing the costs of legal representation. Most lawyers will do an initial phone consultation for free- reach out to 1-2 and discuss the situation.
If this were legal any LL could send a month to month letter stating hey I'm increasing your rent to whatever i feel like in 60 days. I'll decide what you pay me on the day rent is due. That would be absolute insanity.
