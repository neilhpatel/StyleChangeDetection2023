1st of all it is extremely strategically important for control of the black sea, and its warmwaterports are very important for Russian trade.
3rd it nowadays has a large russian population after Russias Annexation in 2014 there was a lot of migration towards it.
But most importantly the entire southeast of Ukraine isnt safe as long as the Russians have it. So Ukraine must take it to garuantee safety. The Russians use Crimea as a massive military supply base from where they supply their forces in the region and launch long range missile strikes.
If they keep crimea in partikular and any other parts of Ukraine in general when this ends ( lets say because the West Stopps helping and then trough diplomacy) its a win for russia. Then they just start another war and another war every time they feel strong enough. Even If they are not strong and just trow bodys till the other drows in Russian corpses Putin and his like dont care. That would just be a eneny that grows in power.
2nd it is a nightmare to take and very easy to defend. The land connecting it to mainland Ukraine is just a 7km stretch. Furthermore it is extremely heavily fortified with S400 SAMs and entrenchments.
