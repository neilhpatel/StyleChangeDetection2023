Enforcing your trademark rights and copyrights is up to you -- nobody is going to stop anyone from "stealing" your content. Enforcement usually involves sending DMCA take-down notices, and, in egregious or persistent cases, hiring a lawyer and suing the individuals or entities that are infringing your intellectual property rights.
In other words, you really can't stop people from infringing your rights, any more than stop signs force cars to stop -- but you have options in enforcing your rights if and when people do infringe your IP rights. Ensuring that you're willing and (generally -- financially) able to enforce your rights is usually prudent. If you have no means or will to enforce your rights, then your copyrights and trademark rights may not be as strong as you want them to be.
Ideas, in and of themselves, can't really be protected. Everyone has ideas and rarely are they completely new and unique.
Any unique writings or creative/artistic things you come up with (your photographs, your articles, etc.) are copyrighted automatically, from the moment you fix them in some medium (write them, publish them on a website, print them, photograph them, etc.). If you want "additional" protections and options for enforcing those copyrights, you can .
For the specific articles/posts you write up about those ideas? That's copyright protected from the get-go, though you can more officially register them for additional protections.
