Yeah, but that would be a double-edged sword. If they do that without pinning it on someone, it looks like people get away with releasing classified info. That could reduce the deterrence of prosecution.
But you can only pin it on people who feasibility have access to the data in question, which should be a pretty small group.
The more high profile the person, the more evidence you'd need to prevent from being found out. The consequences of getting found out would be extreme, too.
So you might be able to bump off some of a small group of nobodies with this method, but it's not going to work on anyone important.
"oopsie daisy someone just leaked that the secret weakspot of my tank is at the front, where the amour is thickest and most sloped. I suuuuuure hope nobody shoots me there...".
People really like to win arguments on the internet. So if someone says something wrong about your favorite tank its logical to use the information you have to prove your point. That leads to classified documents ending up on warthunder forumsâ€¦.
