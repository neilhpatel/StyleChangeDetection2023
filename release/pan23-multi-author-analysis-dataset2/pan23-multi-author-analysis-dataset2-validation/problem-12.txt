Iâ€™m not sure if I am missing something from the website but it looks like it only searches for New York City. I am in New York State, but in a different city. I was searching but did not see a similar page for other areas.
Visit the PACER website below (PACER is a legal information database that compiles information about legal cases from all over the US).
> The National Archives at New York City has legal custody of records filed in the Federal Courts located in New York, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico. We also have a selection of pre-Federal court records.
If any cases come up, they might have been held at the Western District of New York Court located in Buffalo, NY.
No cost to log in and if you find your case it will cost about 10 cents per page to look at any pages of your choice that you choose. You will need to create a username and a password. (The client code is not necessary, so you can just leave that box blank.) After you have logged in and another page comes up, you can search by using your name or your parent's names to see if any cases come up.
I forgot to mention with a case that happened so long ago, the pages may not be digitized in PDF form because the file may have been sent to the archives.
