It's "legal" in the sense that there is no law against doing it, but you still have to pay for parts and labor even though the result wasn't what you wanted.
If the first mechanic was negligent or clueless, you'll have to get another garage to say that professionally and then go after the first mechanic to recoup the cost of fixing his fuck up.
After a ton of research I’ve narrowed down the issue to being the throttle body, tires, and motor mounts as the issue. All things mechanics easily can diagnose (this guy isn’t a newbie).
Diagnosis was that my shocks were causing the shake and a tune up would fix my rough idle. Quoted me $4100 for a ton of parts, then gave me back the car with the same issues plus a check engine light and MUCH worse idle.
Basically everything he replaced was unnecessary and I suspect he did this to run me a huge bill rather then the simple bill of fixing those 3 items.
Here’s the thing: you took your car to a bad mechanic. He obviously didn’t know what he was doing and is a hack. You authorized repairs. Disputing them on your card is kind of shitty. Not illegal, just shitty. Take it as a lesson learned and don’t take your car to hack shops.
$4100 is not reasonable for those repairs. I showed my invoice with other professionals and they confirmed it is way off.
Authorized based on the fact that he assured me this would fix all of the issues I complained about.
