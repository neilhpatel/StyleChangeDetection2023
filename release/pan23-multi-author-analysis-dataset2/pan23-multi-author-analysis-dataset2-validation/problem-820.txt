Lots of apartment complexes charge the processing fee because they use 3rd party companies to process the payments. The 3rd party company charges to process the payments, and it takes time to apply them, etc...
Charging fees such as this is not Illegal, as long as tenants were told about this in advance. Paying by check, cashiers check or money orders, should not incur any fees.
Looking through your Rental Agreement, the information that should be included would be the different methods of payment available to you.  In most cases, you wouldn't see such an unreasonable "processing fee" if the only payment method offered is online.  If they only offered payments online, then tacked on a $35 "processing fee" in addition, they would be entering a "gray area" and approaching the "shady" or "slumlord" status.
It is unlikely to be required your Apartment Complex has to mention the additional "processing fee" in the Rental Agreement.  Technically, this fee would have to be covered within the "Terms of Use" on the website used to make your payments, since this fee is part of the website itself.
However, if they offer online, as well as payment drop-off, Cashier's Check, mail-in, over the phone and / or in-person payment options, then they can fairly charge an additional "processing fee" for the quickest, easiest and most convenient option.
My ex-wife and I used to rent from a large Apartment Complex, they did the exact same thing, also charging an additional $35 "processing fee" when paying through the website.  In my opinion, it was annoying, unreasonable, but still the quickest and easiest way for us to pay our rent.
What ways does the lease say you must pay rent? If it's only through this portal with the stated fee, you're SOL. If there is there an option to pay some other way (check, bank bill pay, for instance), go that route.
