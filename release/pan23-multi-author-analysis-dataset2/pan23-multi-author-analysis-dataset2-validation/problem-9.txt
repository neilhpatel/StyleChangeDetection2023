As the child's grandmother, your mother has no particular legal obligation to care for her. (Likewise, if you are an adult, she doesn't have any legal obligation to provide for you either.) If you believe the child is not safe with her grandmother, you should not leave her in her grandmother's care, but you have not described anything that sounds like child abuse.
If you file a CPS report, they will investigate the child's living conditions holistically, and determine whether she is receiving adequate care in your home. What outcome are you hoping for?
Im not saying it is her responsibility. But she wants to claim the responsibility, she gives my son everything while my daughter gets nothing. Makes it so I can’t work, but then keeps tabs like I’m the one abusing my kids. When she’s the one who doesn’t buy food and “provide” like she claims to others, and even tried to claim to the IRS.
I’m not even sure what outcome would come about it(that is why i asked the question) and I am fully aware she doesn’t have legal obligations to anything have to do with my kids or me. But she’s claiming it, tried to claim me and my kids on her taxes, yet REALLY doesn’t do anything. So not sure if you can see what I’m saying still...
She's welcome to tell people she's responsible for you and your children all she wants, whether or not she actually is. Telling people she takes care of your children does not create a legal obligation to do so.
If she is committing tax fraud, you are welcome to report that, or file your own taxes on paper and let the IRS sort out the discrepancy.
She can't stop you from getting a job, and you're welcome to stop associating with her or letting her see your children.
It is your responsibility to ensure your children receive adequate care. If they are being neglected at home, you will be the one held responsible. CPS will not order your mother to provide more care for her grandchild, if that was what you were hoping for.
Why is it your mom's responsibility to provide childcare, feed, change diapers and comb your daughter's hair? What behaviors have led you to consider reporting your mom for child abuse?
How is your mom making it so that you can't work? Since you think her treatment of you and your children is unfair, stop relying on her for support. Was your mom successful in claiming you and your kids as dependents?
