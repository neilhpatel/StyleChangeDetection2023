I put scare quotes around those two names because they are the terms those churches are commonly known by, but as descriptions they are perhaps less than completely accurate. The split between them is known as the Great Schism, and is traditionally dated to 1054. The actual division, though, was a gradual process lasting centuries. Its causes were really more political and cultural than theological.
There are literally hundreds of Christian denominations today, if not thousands. The existence of each one represents a division. But I will address four main splits that have contributed greatly to the Roman Catholic Church we know today. The first two rounds are taken with minor updates from my answer to . Rounds three and four are newly written. Be aware that this is going to involve some technical theology and christology.
The Catholic Church of today claims to be the same, original church that was founded by the apostles following Jesus' death and resurrection. In the Middle Ages, the doctrines it taught were famously described as those which had been believed "always, everywhere, and by everyone." Pope Francis is officially considered to be the 266th pope; the apostle Peter is considered to have been the first. The claim to this heritage isn't wrong; the modern Roman Catholic Church is certainly descended from the earliest Christian communities.
Arianism is named after an early Christian leader named Arius, who apparently taught that Jesus was a created being, not fully God. Basically, while Jesus was the Son of God and definitely was not just a man, there was a time before Jesus existed. I say “apparently,” because none of Arius’ writings have survived. His teachings are known only from their descriptions by his opponents, who obviously had reason to mischaracterize them. The Arian controversy was at the center of the first great council following the legalization of Christianity, at Nicaea in 325. With the support of an overwhelming majority (all but two of the bishops present, plus Arius himself), the council came down strongly opposed to Arianism. It adopted the Nicene Creed, which described Jesus in relation to God the Father using the term “ὁμοούσιον,” (“homoousion,” in Latin text), which is a tricky word to translate. It means something like “of the same substance.” Modern translations of the Nicene Creed in English translate it either as “of one being with the Father” or “consubstantial with the Father.” Regardless, it was a rejection of Arianism. In fact, the original version of the Nicene Creed ended with an even more explicit rejection:
But, like everything in life, the full picture is quite a bit more complicated. The Catholic Church can legitimately trace its heritage back to the earliest centuries of Christianity. But other churches can as well. Christianity has gone through a number of divisions during the course of its long history, and the Catholic Church of today is just one of the many resulting churches. And, as much as they have (mostly historically) claimed to be the "One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church," the Church of Rome has been shaped by these schisms as much as the other churches have. Like all the others, the Catholics are defined as much by who and what they are not as by who and what they are.
Arius and the two bishops who supported him were sent into exile, but his teachings lived on for some time. A number of Germanic groups in particular converted to Arian Christianity, where the doctrine persisted into the Early Middle Ages before being gradually displaced by Nicene Christianity. By the 8th Century Arianism seems to have died out.
In more recent centuries, the term “neo-Arianism” has been applied, somewhat inaccurately, to any Christian sect that denies the doctrine of the Trinity, or otherwise argues against the full divinity of Christ. Perhaps the most notable group today to be described (by outsiders) in this way is the Latter Day Saint movement, commonly called Mormonism. Mormon Christology is complex, but for the purposes of this answer suffice it to say that it includes a rejection of the Nicene doctrine of ὁμοούσιος. Jehovah’s Witnesses likewise hold non-Trinitarian beliefs and have been characterized as neo-Arian. But these modern groups are not actually descended from the original Arians in any meaningful way, so calling them neo-Arians can be misleading.
Ok, so Nicaea established that Jesus was fully divine, but what about his human nature? Was he also fully human? Or was he God in human form? And if he was both human and divine, how exactly did that work? Nicene Christians settled into a number of camps, including monophysitism (Jesus had only one nature, the divine), dyophysitism (he had both human and divine natures, but in a single person), and miaphysitism (Jesus was both human and divine, but had only one nature). I realize that these are extremely technical definitions even at the level of this basic overview; the theological writings from the time are almost impossible to parse at times.
Chalcedon’s embrace of the hypostatic union, and its condemnation of Nestorianism, split the church again along Christological lines. Nestorian church leaders fled or were exiled to the Sasanian Persian Empire, where they integrated with the Christian minority there. Nestorian Christianity flourished for a time in the east, reaching as far as what is now western China and holding significant influence under the Mongol Khans. It was later persecuted for centuries. Today a number of churches in the region, termed the “Church of the East,” trace their origins back to this branch of Christianity, though their exact relationship with Nestorian doctrine is disputed. Adding to the complexity of the issue, the Church of the East itself went through a number of schisms. The Chaldean Catholic Church, the largest currently existing descendent of the original Church of the East, has reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church and is in full communion with Rome.
Nestorian Christianity is a form of dyophysitism. It is named after Nestorius, the Patriarch of Constantinople at the time. The christology is technical, and I’m stretching a bit at the limits of my understanding to distinguish between it and the alternative. Essentially, Jesus (the man) and the Son (divine) are seen as being distinct, separate natures and persons, though they both existed within the same entity (Jesus of Nazareth). Nestorius was condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431. The Council of Chalcedon in 451 adopted a different form of dyophysitism, termed the “Chalcedonian definition,” or “hypostatic union.” This definition is characterized as “fully divine and fully human.” So Nestorian Christianity and Chalcedonian Christianity both say that Jesus was both human and divine, but Nestorianism emphasizes the distinction between the human and the divine, while the Chalcedonian definition emphasizes the union. Yes, this really was enough to cause a schism.
There had always been important differences between East and West. Going back a thousand years to Roman times, the language of administration and trade in the East was Greek, while in the West it was Latin. Later on the Roman Empire gradually split into Eastern and Western halves, each with its own emperor. In the West the empire soon collapsed, eventually giving rise to a patchwork of kingdoms, duchies, republics, principalities, and so on. The Church was one of the few truly unifying entities in the West. On the other hand, the Empire survived and flourished in the East for a thousand years after its fall in the West. There, the Empire itself was the unifying entity, and the Church was always closely tied to the Emperor.
"Catholic" in this context refers to the church in the West (Western Europe, at the time) which looked to the Pope in Rome as its head. "Orthodox" refers to the Chalcedonian churches in the East which looked to their own patriarchs. The most significant of these was the Patriarch of Constantinople, who was closely linked with the powerful Byzantine Empire (aka, the Eastern Roman Empire). The groups are both descended from the Chalcedonian Christianity that emerged from the council of 451.
The schism, as I said, was not really caused by any deep theological differences. There were no fundamental disagreements about the nature of God (with the minor exception of the "Filioque clause," explained below). The real issue that it all came down to is the degree to which the Pope held primacy over the Eastern leaders. Back in the early centuries of Christianity, five powerful and influential bishops were considered to be the highest church officials, each holding authority over the lesser bishops and priests in the geographic area surrounding their seat. These five, collectively called the "pentarchy," were the bishops of Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Constantinople. The relationship between Rome and the others was described as "first among equals." Even to this day, the Eastern and Western Churches agree on that description to some degree. A divinity school professor of mine summed up the problem by saying that the Western Church emphasized "first," while the Eastern Church emphasized "equals." By the High Middle Ages, the Pope claimed full authority over all the Church. The Eastern patriarchs (not to mention the Emperor, the bishops, the priests, and all the millions of ordinary people) were not willing to allow the Bishop of Rome to rule over them. The Pope, who was soon to find himself in a growing conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor (aka, King of Germany) over the Church's authority, was unwilling to back down. Eventually, a final break became inevitable.
Wow so enlightening. So basically the Catholic Church didn’t really established its name till later. When we refer to Roman “Catholic” we’re just talking about a splinter church from Christianity inside a fractured Roman Empire? I can see how confusing this church business can.
