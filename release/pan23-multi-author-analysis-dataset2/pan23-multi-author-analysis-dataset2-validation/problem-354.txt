> And be prepared for him to not respond via email but with a phone call, so be sure to record the call any time he calls you, NJ is a one party consent recording state which means it’s 100% legal for you to record your phone conversations.
I am always a fan of following up phone calls with a n email that says, “Per our phone conversation on X date, you feel that if I were to file a workers comp claim for my recent injury, I will be negatively affecting our relationship. Is that correct?”.
I figured that much. I just legitimately felt insecure about my job after that conversation. I figure there's also not much that can be done since it was a phone call on an unrecorded line so a bunch of "he said/she said'.
My boss complains constantly that I text and email him too much instead of calling him like he prefers. The one time I called him and he sent me home early I came in the next day and he wrote me up for leaving without permission. Lesson I learned was no paper trail= no accountability.
I definitely don't feel guilty about the idea of filing a claim. I'm more concerned with the blow back of filing a claim and them retaliating knowing I am in the vulnerable state of moving across country to a new company where they have close professional and personal relationships.
I would say both, that way you have a written record of the date and content of the conversations and the actual recorded conversation so there’s no debating what was said, otherwise he could just email back and deny the conversation ever happened.
