NJ has a public policy whistleblower law called CEPA that may protect you, if there's clear medical guidance somewhere that you shouldn't be working in your situation.
Yeah, if you are symptomatic that is definitely an issue; the vaccine does not prevent Covid 100% (as I'm sure you know), which means if you folks are testing positive, you are currently infected with Covid. As you indicated, the CDC clearly states:
That's the exact part of the CDC website I sent to my boss when I got the insane reply that we have to come in if we test positive. Boss is stuck between us and admin though, none of these decisions are the boss's.
No union but I'd love to learn more about how to establish one. I don't want to say in the comments what my job position is but I will say that the ethics of a union for our type of work is a hot topic for debate. Thanks for your response .
I wish we could unionize. I mentioned in a previous reply, I don't want to say much about my position in the hospital there is no union for my line of work. Most of us want one, especially after all the bullshit we've been put through with covid. I'd love to learn more about how to get one started but hospitals work hard to treat their employees like shit.
If you're unionized, then definitely contact your Union Rep. From there, they can take legal action to protect you and your patients. This is definitely an OSHA violation, so it's good that you already took the liberty of reporting it.
We're supposed to call out for any of the covid symptoms. However, we have to use PTO to do so and regularly get guilt trips for calling out. We were just recently lectured in a department meeting about how "well the handbook says three absences in a ninety day period is excessive..." This was in response to a few people calling out when there was a snow storm, one person calling out for a few days in a row after a car accident, and all of us periodically calling out when we experience anything that might be a covid symptom.
"Neither the recently authorized and recommended vaccines nor the other COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States can cause you to test positive on , which are used to see if you have a current infection\.​"\.
We've been tested for active infections, not antibodies. We wouldn't have the antibodies anyway because we got our second dose of the vaccine way back in January.
