Somewhat we get hourly health and wellness benefits that we don't have to pay in to receive for these hours. Also our company policies lead to disciplinary actions for unpaid time off up to and including termination. It starts at 8 hours and then you are fired after more than 40 hours. There's exceptions but only in rare circumstances.
Title: Purchased Paid Time Off. Can my employer choose not to pay out the difference from when it was bought and I was payed a higher rate vs now when I am paid a lower rate.

I wanted to clear up what is meant by purchasing PTO. It's a thing at two large corporations I've worked at, so I don't think it's uncommon or in any way illegal. It worked the same way at both companies, so I'm guessing the process is similar for the OP. I'm not a lawyer or accountant so I don't know specifically as to why it's done this way.
When hired, and before the end of the year, I can elect to purchase PTO, in addition to my normally accrued PTO, up to a set amount. The purchased PTO is deducted from my paycheck over the course of the next year. The amount deducted is based on my current salary, on an hourly basis. Several weeks after the start of the year, the purchased PTO is added to my regular PTO balance all at once.
If I elect to purchase PTO at the end of the next year, given that I have received a raise sometime during the year, the amount deducted for the next year will be the difference of the previously elected PTO amount at the prior rate remaining at the end of the year, and the PTO I elect to buy for the next year at my current pay rate. (A key point being, I can only elect and carry forward a set maximum amount of purchased PTO, and this is in addition to my regular PTO.).
Again I can't speak for the OP but I'm guessing OP's situation is similar. I'd expect to get paid back the difference in rate in their situation though.
It always seemed wise to elect to purchase the additional PTO, in case of emergency, with the expectation that it's paid out on my final paycheck if I leave the company.
As OP stated in a comment, unpaid leave is almost unheard of in this situation. It pretty much means you didn't show up to work. In exceptional circumstances the company will allow you to carry a negative PTO balance rather than take unpaid leave. Also there are special categories of PTO like maternal, extended medical, military, etc. that account for those situations without drawing from your regular PTO balance (but you might be required to use some or all of your regular PTO as part of the policy).
The way I see this benefiting me as a worker is that I'm always receiving a consistent amount of pay for each pay period. I'm guessing it makes accounting simpler for the company too, but I'm just speculating.
If I understand the OP correctly, if they took the PTO they paid for during the time they were getting the higher rate, it would make sense because that's the cost to the company of them not being at work during that time. Now that OP is paid at a lower rate, the cost of them missing a day is lower than what they paid in, so the company essentially pockets the difference, at OP's expense.
"Thus, a cafeteria plan does not include any plan that defers the receipt of compensation or operates in a manner that enables participants to defer compensation by, for example, permitting participants to use contributions for one plan year to purchase a benefit that will be provided in a subsequent plan year. This rule is commonly referred to as the "use-it-or-lose-it" rule, requiring that unused contributions or benefits remaining at the end of the plan year be forfeited.".
E: I realized this the issue is a bit more subtle than I thought before. I've never bothered to check what happens to my purchased PTO rate when I get a raise in the middle of the year, since it could only be to my benefit. But I did want to provide an explanation for those who might be unaware of this arrangement.
