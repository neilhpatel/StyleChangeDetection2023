They don't have to do anything destructive but you should make sure that Susan clearly understands that she is not welcome on the property.
Once you've told her that she is not welcome there and needs to be removed, you can call the police and remove her.
However, wouldn't it be a better idea to, today, call up the aunt in question and tell them that if they're bringing Susan, that none of them are welcome?
Yes, I have called my aunt about this and she's made no comment. That's why I made this post, everyone's been silent.
I have made it very clear to "Susan" that she isn't welcome at my household. She doesn't even know where I live now but that's another reason why I'm worried. I guarantee that once she finds out where I live, I'll get harassed with uninvited visits if I don't interact with her. I already have her blocked on all social media platforms, and even her phone number is blocked. I don't want any contact with her at all.
I used to live with her before i moved out. Believe me, she threatens people to get her own way and she is very sneaky about things. She was the reason I moved out of her household so fast. If it's not my aunt, I'm almost certain she'll get ahold of someone else that's coming and put words into my mouth that I never said saying she was allowed to come over.
Explicitly tell the aunt not to bring her. Ask her to confirm she isn't bringing her. If she won't be clear, simply cancel.
If she shows up, refuse entry if you'd like. I'd refuse to allow any of them in the home. If they force their way in, call the police. It may take a while to get an officer to respond, though.
I am in the state of Pennsylvania. I own this house currently, this is great to be knowing. I just updated the post with my state in case any other advice comes, thank you.
Send out a group text to all of your invited guests (at least family members) about the time that you will be expecting them and that Susan is not welcomed to attend. Explain that you are looking forward to sharing the holiday together, but if they bring Susan they wonâ€™t be welcomed in either.
