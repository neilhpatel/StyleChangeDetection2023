If you bought the vehicle as-is this is on you to fix. It's possible they were not aware of the issue as they do not test drive every used car they sell long enough to experience this issue. If it starts and stops they'll put it on the lot because the buyer is agreeing that no promises are being made about the condition and the dealership is not obligated to fix anything unless it's sold with a warranty. It's very likely you are correct that they did not inspect it and they aren't required to do that. If they don't inspect it then they can truthfully state they were not aware of any issue.
They told me they inspected it. When they got it the check engine light was on and they had to fix that problem (new spark plugs and an engine coil). So they had to at a minimum give it a safety and emissions inspection. But either way they garanteed that they gave it their 150 point inspection, which when I asked for that in writing, after noticing this problem, they wouldn't give me a copy. Idk how they could have missed this issue with a multipoint inspection.
