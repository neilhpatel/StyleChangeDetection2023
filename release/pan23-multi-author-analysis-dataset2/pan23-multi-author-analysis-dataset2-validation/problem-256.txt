All these people saying to sue are like ten steps ahead. Most companies don’t want to go to court over $700. It’s ridiculous to suggest that. The first course of action is sending them a stern certified letter with a deadline of paying fo work that was done, stating clearly that there was no equipment or agreement to wax floors, threatening to report them to appropriate workers’ rights agencies and lightly hinting at a potential lawsuit. Right now they just hope she goes away and doesn’t pursue the money. You need to start by showing them you are serious and know your rights. See how they react, then make your next move from there.
Have your mother fill that out and submit it to the state. It may take a bit but you'll get your money.
If she’s self employed and the company hired hers for services, she will need to file in small claims court. If she so chooses, she can send a stern letter certified mail stating this invoiced amount is due immediately and give them a specific time to remit payment by.
If she’s an actual employee and received paystubs with taxes withheld, as the latter paragraphs suggest by stating supervisor rather than company’s point of contact, she needs to file a wage complaint with state dept of labor.
Is your mother self employed and her business was hired to clean OR is she a cleaner who was hired for an in company position? What is confusing here is the information about self employed then last part of the same paragraph is “they decided that she’d be paid $700.00 bi-weekly” and not “for this job, her services are x amount with this schedule.” When a person is self employed, they set their own fees and hours.
