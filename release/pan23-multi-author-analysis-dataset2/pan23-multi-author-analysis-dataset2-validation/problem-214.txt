Clean your whole house. Everywhere the dog has been or had access to. If possible use bleach or other substance that kills virus.
Parvovirus has an incubation time of 8 to 10 days. That means the your dog was sick at the time of purchase. You can report this to the proper authorities if such exist in your state.
Do not allow any other dogs in the house for the next month. That is the recommended time to let the virus die out.
We have it in writing from the vet that the dog had the virus before we picked her up. We took the body to the Humane Society to be properly disposed of the day after she passed, but the breeder did ask for pictures/videos of the dog's dead body, and after we sent videos, she told us she could 'see the dog still breathing' and is accusing us of faking the dog's death. Thank you so much for your advice about the warranty act, it is extremely helpful and I really appreciate it. It definitely applies to her, she's produced at least 3 litters in 5 months. Just a crazy breeder. We didn't even realize she was breeding this many dogs in such an unsafe environment until it was wayyy too late.
The breeder can sue how much she wants. Do not discuss the case with the breeder. If you are served with papers, get a lawyer.
Most respectable breeders will have you sign a contract so I would check that first. Usually if the dog gets sick within 24 hours the responsibility is on the breeder. There are tons of irresponsible breeders around though.
