If the minor children are US citizens and do not have US passports, the father can use the to be notified if she tries to get passports for them. The US will a,so take extra steps to verify that parental consent has properly been obtained.
If she has a way to get Nigerian passports for the children, maybe. She needs the fathers signature (in person at the passport office) to get US passports for the minor children.
NAL Inform the judge/lawyer of her plan. She can’t force those over 18 to go, but the minors perhaps, if the divorce hasn’t happened yet and there is no custody order. You can file a restraining order specifically forbidding her from taking the kids out of the country, but that doesn’t mean she won’t do it. Once she has them out of the country, getting them back would be a nightmare. Good luck. I’d get a lawyer now and tell him what she is planning. He will know what to do.
When you say “nor is the real father” do you mean the husband is not the father? Who’s listed as the father on the birth certificates?
Visa applications usually require both parents’ signatures so he can try to get ahead of the mother forging his. Nigeria is not a member to the Geneva Convention.
