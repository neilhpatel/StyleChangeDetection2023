As a general rule, in Florida, you are a minor until you reach 18 years of age, or at 16 years of age you can prove to the court that you are able to fully support yourself.
Now, when we say "fully support yourself," what we mean is that you can live on your own, as an adult, with 100% financial independence from your parents. This includes providing yourself with enough income to provide food, shelter, transportation, and other expenses, while still attaining your education.
I bring this up because when people talk about emancipation, the kinds of kids who are eligible are those who are exceptional - movie stars, music stars, etc., who have large incomes and receive their education via non-traditional school means.
Given that you're not even 16 yet, no, there is no way for you to leave home and live on your own. You would be considered a runaway and a truant.
This is going to be an extremely difficult issue to navigate. Emotional abuse often times does not rise to the level of CPS intervention. In balancing the best interest of the child, protection of the child, and the right for a parent to parent their child, the courts generally take a hands off approach when it comes to things like sexuality, gender, and religion. Even if your parents don't understand you and aren't supportive what your choices and preferences are, the court doesn't necessarily step in to tell them no because the parents have a right to parent. You're also not guaranteed perfect, understanding parents. You're guaranteed a safe enviornment where your needs are met, and those needs are usually classified as very basic things like food, hygiene, clothing, shelter, and education.
Upon turning 16, assuming that you can satisfy the criteria that I outlined above, you can petition the court to have a guardian ad litem appointed to begin the process of emancipation. You would want to work with your business manager to start that process.
It sounds like you have a reasonable support structure in place - you're attending school, you're being provided with your basic needs, you have shelter, etc.
If CPS has been contacted and investigated, it is unlikely that you can seek a removal order from your home based on abuse grounds. Moreover, if you think that your punishments at home are stringent or strict, you will not enjoy being part of the foster system.
Are you currently in therapy and/or receiving mental health care? When you state that you're afraid that you'll be admitted to the hospital again, that implies that you've previously been admitted.
So, in short it's hard to draw that line where a non supportive parent because emotionally abusive so much that CPS and the court intervenes.
I am in therapy. My parents put me into hypnotherapy after I left the hospital. I was originally going to see a sketchy Canadian doctor but hospital staff convinced them otherwise.
The other option you have is emancipation, but that is a severely limited option. Most times the court wants to make sure you can provide for yourself and need to see that before you're emancipated. That's difficult for young adults to do, much less a minor who still has to attend school. You have the added concern for the court that you've previously been in the hospital for self-harm. That will make the court more hesitant to order emancipation because they may not believe you can successfully deal with any mental health issue that arises.
This may be a situation where feasibly no intervention is possible. And if that's the case, you need to come to grips with that and learn to live in the situation you're in. If you leave on your own without a court order allowing it, you may be brought back to your parents by the authorities. You may be placed in foster care or taken as a ward of the state if they cannot locate your parents. While that may seem like a better alternative than what you have now, it may not be. Remember, you're not guaranteed a place with perfect understanding of you and them be supportive. You're only guaranteed the basics and the new place you're put is in worse than living with your parents. Your parents may be mad at you now, but they may give you back your privileges in the future when everything has calmed down. There's a real possibility you won't get any technology, internet, or other privileges in state placement. State placement is also going to be very intensive when it comes to your mental health. If you harm yourself again in their placement, you will likely go to the hospital whereas your parents get to make that discretionary decision. The state doesn't have discretion. They have to follow laws on how to take care of you.
I don't say these things to discourage you or put you in worse place mentally but to give you a realistic outlook for the rest of your time with your parents. You only have 3 years left with them legally. While that sounds like a large amount of time for someone that is 15, I can assure you it goes by quicker than you think. You may need to develop coping mechanisms to deal with the possibility that you'll still be there. But it can also give you the ability to be able to better prepare yourself to move out when the time comes. Your parents might let you get a part time job that you can save money so that moving is a more feasible option when you get that chance. Another alternative you might want to try to consider when your parents have calmed down is to let you live with a more understanding relative. It will still be your parent's choice though.
