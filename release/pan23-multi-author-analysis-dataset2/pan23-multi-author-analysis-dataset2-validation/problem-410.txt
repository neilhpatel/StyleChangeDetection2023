I only have drivers name, other information is blackened out. Sheriff Dept. claims standard procedure. I'm thinking if this was auto accident both drivers would have access to one anothers information. Am I wrong?
I'm considering that. Unless they have a way to get more information, it'd be fruitless. I'd personally like to "sue" the whole lot Sue the driver, the car owner, the individual that was listed on the insurance card along with the insurance company That would weed out the responsible party I would think. LOL.
I didnâ€™t think to ask that question, makes sense though. When I called the insurance company I got the impression they weren't aware of the accident. They followed up with a letter stating: "We have concluded our investigation and based on the facts developed during the investigation have determined that there is no coverage for this loss." My thought is of course you're not.
Ask them if the car is insured or the driver is? And see what they say. The car caused damage, and it was insured by them. It shouldnt matter who was driving.
