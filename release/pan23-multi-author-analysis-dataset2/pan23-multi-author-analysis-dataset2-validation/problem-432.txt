The Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act means the bank has to let you assume the loan, even if you have bad credit.
What you need to do before that happens depends on how the home was titled, if there are other debts in the estate, if you need to go through probate. You should talk to a probate attorney.
If the deed was titled as joint tenants with rights to survivor ship, and you were a party owner then you are the current owner of the home. If the property was part of a trust and you are a beneficiary, that is also generally the case.
In most other cases the home will be part of the estate, go through probate, and until the other debts are settled you won't own it.
There is a distinction in law, between "legal ownership", and "equitable ownership". I'm guessing a bit here, but probably you became the equitable owner as soon as your parents died. (Which is odd, because at that point there hasn't been a legal determination about the validity and contents of the will.).
NAL, but I would say this is not precisely true. As always, we can't speak about your particular situation, because we don't know all the relevant facts and circumstances.
You probably shouldn't pay their other bills until you hire a lawyer and start the process of settling the estate.
You become entitled to the benefits of living in the house, the financial gains/losses, etc. However, actually getting your hands on those benefits can be delayed.
Legal ownership, on the other hand, is the "front man" for the house. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, the legal owner is the (only) owner. The tax authorities and mortgage bank will look to the legal owner to send the bills to. But anybody can pay, they don't care where the money comes from (might raise a few eyebrows if it comes from North Korea, but aside from that ...).
Also, tell the house insurance company and pay those bills (probably paid from bank escrow). If you don't tell them, they can get pretty nasty about paying a claim. There's a grace period, but it can be pretty short. Insurance companies really don't like empty houses.
For real estate, especially a residence, probate is process of handling legal title from the estate Personal Representative to the equitable owner. And that's not going to happen until the PR is 100% sure that all the estate bills are paid.
Then start looking for a lawyer to settle your parents' estate. Meet with a few. They should offer you free initial consultations. Find out how much each will charge you to probate your parents' estate. Figure out who makes you feel the most comfortable. You have to trust your lawyer.
Then start probating the estate. Besides the house, did your parents have any other assets such as bank accounts, retirement accounts, etc? Look through their papers, mail, email, etc. Did they owe any money other than the mortgage? Any other bills?
P.S. Did they have any life insurance? If so, you should file claims. Either way, you'll need to order copies of their death certificates from the country/county where they died. You'll also probably have to pay for an official translation if the death certificates are not in English. The estate will reimburse you for your expenses.
Don't you mean their wills, plural? It's possible that a single document can serve as two wills, one for husband and one for wife. But judges and lawyers don't like it, because they have to untangle which words go with which person, creating the two wills from one set of words. This can be controversial, especially if who inherits what depends on the order of death.
In Ohio (and many other states), if two people die close in time (120 hours = 5 days), then there is a special rule. Tom's will is interpreted as if Betty died first, and Betty's will is interpreted as if Tom died first. That way, the same property doesn't have to go through two probate procedures (dead people can't inherit). The words in the will can override this special rule.
