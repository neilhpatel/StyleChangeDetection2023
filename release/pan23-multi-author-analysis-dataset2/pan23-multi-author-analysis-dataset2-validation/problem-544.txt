Yeah that’s what I assume now. We all paid through apps (I think CashApp/PayPal). Strangely enough, I asked a mutual friend about it in September and he said he invested also but had to cash out early (he said he was ghosted briefly though).
I don’t have a great suggestion either way, but if he’s a financial advisor, he’s probably licensed with the state and is required to abide by certain regulations - that may work in your favor. If he’s just a guy, your options are likely more limited.
Lol very true. Another strange thing was that he mentioned someone was suing him for $1000 when we had lunch in Sept. At that time we had basically doubled up but after the crazy surge from December-Present, it’s a bit more than that.
You said that your investment should be worth $35,000 now leads me to believe you are under the impression it was used to buy bitcoin. But you also said he'd been working in crypto and you were investing in bitcoin with him, which has me wondering whether the intent was to do something other than buy bitcoin (bitcoin futures or any number of things).
Unfortunately, in all likelihood this was a scam from the beginning. A friend you hadn't seen in years. Who created a backstory of working in crypto and appeared to be wildly successful because that's what he told you...and rolled up in a Lambo (that was likely borrowed or rented for the day).
best i can say is file a complaint with the fbi online.. create a paper trail.. your likely not the only person hes doing this to if hes driving around in a lambo.
