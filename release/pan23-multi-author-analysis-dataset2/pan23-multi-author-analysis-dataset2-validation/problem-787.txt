Eid mubarak/Bayramınız mübarek olsun to my fellow Muslims. It's Eid, so here's something about Eid/Ramazan bayrami in the Ottoman Empire.
The end of Ramadan is marked by a three to four days of holiday called şeker bayramı (Sweet Festival), ramazan bayramı (Ramadan Festival), or just simply bayram. After the new moon was sighted, the end of Ramadan was officially proclaimed with cannon salute at the Imperial Palace and elsewhere. The lights and lamps decorating the minarets were extinguished, and drums and trumpets were played in public places and the homes of high government officials and court dignitaries.
At dawn on the morning of the first of Shawwal, people woke up, bathed, perfumed, and dressed in their finest clothing to attend congregational prayer (salat al-fitr). People then assembled inside large mosques or large fields especially set aside for prayer. There, led by an imam, they performed prayers. After the end of the prayer, the imam delivered a sermon. Once prayers had ended, all embraced and wished one another a happy and healthy bayram. After prayer, some people set off for cemeteries, where temporary markets were set up to sell flowers, prayer books, and water for watering the plants around the grave. Families then gathered in silence at the tombs of parents and close relatives. They then returned to their homes, to celebrate with friends and families around them. An important part of the bayram was the restoration of friendship between those who had quarreled or hurt each other’s feelings, so people met with each other and forgave each other.
In many mixed communities, Muslims and non-Muslims also celebrated the bayram with each other. In Smyrna, during bayram, a local claimed "The Turks would flock to our coffeehouses to find ouzo and to celebrate. Generally, we’d only go to their coffeehouses for work reasons, and they would do the same". Another local also said "We’d celebrated bayram with them and enjoyed the revelry through to morning". One Kiriakos Kilitzis from Ankara recalled how both Easter and bayram (both festivals sometimes happened within a week) called for visits between friends: "My father had a friend called Hussein. He’d come to our house for Easter, and for bayram we’d go to his place". Many also said how exchange of gifts during bayram and Easter signaled a gesture of mutual respect: "They would come during Easter and bring gifts. They gave gifts to their friends, to the people that they knew well, to their gardiako \[‘friends of the heart’\], a lamb, and would say: ‘Bayramı mubarek olsun’, ‘may your bayram be blessed’". Simeon Radev from Bulgaria also shared the same sentiment: "Turks and Bulgarians lived together and were good neighbors. On holidays they exchanged pleasantries. We sent the Turks kozunak and red eggs at Easter, and they sent us baklava at bayram. And on these occasions we visited each other". Fotini Tzamtzi of Chios also stated "On Şeker Bayramı, they would give me sweets. These things we ate very happily! And we would give them red eggs at Easter as well as tsourekia. They were thrilled to receive these gifts".
The rest of the day was spent in leisure and entertainment. Ramadan was a month of high spending, and the bayram was no exception. People gave out food and alms for the poor, parents bought new clothes for their children, and people gave presents to families or friends. People went to the streets in their best clothes and go to festivals, shops, and coffeehouses to buy goods and enjoyed various amusements. One of the great attractions from these festivals were the bayram swings, a gigantic swing people could use for a fee. Children, in their new clothes took their pocket money and spent it in great excitement on the big swings, revolving wheels and merry-go-rounds which were set up in festivals in different parts of the city. In some places, boys hired little donkeys and cart-horses, or the little carts which the animals pulled. Here were also sold all sorts of different sweets and candies and foods which children loved. Saraçoğlu described the atmosphere pretty well: "It was above all for the children that the bayrams, şeker bayramı, and the four-day kurban bayramı, of Istanbul in the old days were, in the true meaning of the term, happy periods in which hours of pleasure, gaiety, hope and joy chased after each other. School holidays, new clothes from head to foot, pockets full of shiny, new kuruş and 50-piaster coins like horseshoes". Other forms of entertainments included Karagöz shadow-play, janissary marching bands, and in the late Ottoman Empire, various concerts, plays, and theaters.
Before the Nation: Muslim-Christian Coexistence and Its Destruction in Late-Ottoman Anatolia by Nicholas Doumanis.
I'm going to split this answer into a few parts, one detailing Norse paganism, one Christianity in the early Middle Ages, and finally the process of conversion.
Norse religion is an oxymoron. There was no canon, no dogma, no clerical hierarchy, no organization structure, no infrastructure to support priests or sacred sites, and no popular participation in the pagan "religion". Instead I think it is far more apt to describe "Norse religion" as a religious tradition, which I will shorthand to just Norse paganism. Now this is ultimately somewhat Eurocentric of me, with "religion" bearing the hallmarks of Western religions like Christianity, however since your question is concerned with Christianity specifically lets just roll with it.
There are a few other written sources that are slightly more contemporary, such as the Poetic Edda (which predates the official conversion of most of the Norse world, but only just) and Saxo Grammaticus's Gesta Danorum which was written by a Danish Christian. Ibn Fadlan's account of the Rus people in his own journeys is also often used as a source on Scandinavia, despite the fact that he was writing about Russia and modern scholarship is increasingly nuancing the idea of Scandinavian domination of Russia.
Norse mythology is something that many of us in the western world are broadly familiar with, but only on the surface level. Odin is the All-father, Thor has a hammer, he fights giants, Loki is in there, and so on. However what we "know" about Norse mythology is mostly derived from a series of saga stories that were written down by Christians, and mostly on particular Christian (Snorri Sturluson) in Iceland centuries after conversion. The deities that we know and love, Heimdall, Tyr, Loki, all of whom are actually relatively unattested in place name evidence are common in the sagas, and vice versa, deities such as Ullr rarely appear in the saga literature despite far more evidence of a widespread cult based on place names. How are we to reconcile this difference between the literary evidence and the archaeological, especially in light of the reliability of the literary evidence compared to the archeological?
To be clear though, using these sources to try and reconstruct the cosmology, theology, eschatology, beliefs, practices, rituals, and view point of Norse pagans is a fool's errand. The sagas have about as much to do with the practice of Norse paganism as Disney's Hercules does with Graeco-Roman paganism of the 4th century BC.
So with that out of the way what do we know about Norse paganism and what are our sources? (In the interest of time and space, I'm not going to be detailing each individual practice, ritual, and so on that we have evidence for, but rather detail a broad conclusions that some scholars have arrived at).
We are largely left with archaeological evidence (physical objects such as rune stones, artifacts, place name evidence, and so on), contemporary accounts from outside the Norse world, and extremely curated selections from the surviving corpus of Old Norse literature. So what do these sources tell us? What secrets can they reveal to the intrepid researchers of today?
However there were still some critical differences. Modern practices such as clerical celibacy, private confession, widespread access of communion, and so on were still some time off. However, Christianity had several things going for it at this time that made it stand out among the competing religions and traditions of early Medieval Europe, chief most among these were prestige and infrastructure.
In short, that the old Norse pagan religious tradition was elitist and extremely insular (not to mention barbaric, including human sacrifices and, if Ibn Fadlan is to be believed, the ritualized gang rape of slaves) with little popular participation and little buy in beyond the nobility. Norse paganism was hardly a core aspect of Norse "heritage" if the rapid and successful conversion to Christianity is a useful metric to go by. Indeed the religion likely varied extremely among the vast majority of the population and the paganism practiced in one part of Scandinavia likely bore little relation to that practiced in another. Evidence from across the Norse world shows that there was a great deal of variation in practices such as burial (cremation vs inhumation) and local cult popularity (as evidenced by the wide variety in theophoric place names).
The charismatic aspects of the religious tradition, veneration of Odin, ship burial/cremation, Valhalla, were probably the exclusive domain of the aristocratic elite of the Norse world. The average Norse person would not have been a participant in the same religious life as the elite of society. The average farmer, trader, slave, who lived in the Norse world almost certainly did not share the same conception of their own religious tradition as the elites of Norse society did. What good would Valhalla be to a farmer after all? Instead their worship likely focused around less well known deities with far less ostentatious displays of piety and worship.
But how did this process play out in a specific case and was there resistance to the encroachment of Christianity into Scandinavia?
