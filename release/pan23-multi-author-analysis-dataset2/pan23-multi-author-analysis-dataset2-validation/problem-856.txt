Thank you. I have his Snapchat where he flat out said it from my memory. I’ll have to keep it. He’s spoken of it to other people, does that count? Although I’m just not ready to tell anybody yet. I’m going through a really hard time and I can’t add this to the list.
I'm sorry to hear this happened to you. There is no statute of limitations in Canada for prosecuting indictable offences. All offences involving sexual assault, sexual interference, sexual exploitation etc. are hybrid offences, meaning they can be prosecuted as indictable offences (at any time in the future) if the Crown believes it is warranted/justified.
However, it's generally the case that sooner is better than later for these matters. The more time that elapses between the date of the offence and the date of the complaint, generally the less likely it is for the accused to be prosecuted. This is, in part, because the amount of evidence available (such as records, witness accounts, physical evidence, etc.) tends to diminish over time, making it harder for prosecutors to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.
Your testimony about what happened is a form of evidence, but there may also be other corroborating evidence that could help support your story (and the prosecutor's criminal case).
As another example, let's say he had evidence of the assault on his phone (maybe he was stupid enough to write down what he did in a personal diary or perhaps he even bragged about it to a friend) but he eventually upgrades to a new phone and throws out his old phone before investigators get a chance to collect the evidence. This is an example where critical evidence may be lost because action wasn't taken soon enough. So that's why I was saying sooner is better than later for these sorts of things, though I fully understand your desire to wait until you finish high school.
