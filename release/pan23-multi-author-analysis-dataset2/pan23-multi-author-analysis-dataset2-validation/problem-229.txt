Very interesting. But what I’m curious to know is what level all these taxes were? Local taxes went up 60% from what base? If total taxes went from 1% to 1.6% of average income that’s different than increasing from 50% to 80% of income.
I am unfortunately not in the position to properly answer this question as the minutiae of colonial taxation is not within my realm of expertise. For an in-depth and detailed exploration of this subject, see Taxation in Colonial America by Alvin Rabushka (Princeton University Press, 2015).
I don't think that you address the actual question here, which is around taxation levels. Your answer points out that taxes went up from 60%, but does this mean that they went from 1% to 1.6% or from 10% to 16% or something else?
And taxes on what? Was the additional tax burden purely on excise taxes (which strike me as mostly visible to the merchant, who may have passed these along to his customer), or were there direct taxes on the ordinary citizen?
As I mentioned in an answer prior to yours, my concern is more on the reaction (were they unreasonable for protesting?) rather than the actual taxation levels themselves. I am not in the position to comment on the minutiae economics of that subject, and I will not try to answer them either in full accordance to the rules of this subreddit.
With that said, I can answer your second question, which in turns requires an additional question: Who is being taxed and when?
Starting with the Sugar Act in 1764, this might at best be called a special interest tax that specifically targeted the molasses trade. This hardly had a widespread impact, but the fact that it was levied was enough to cause concern. The Stamp Act, in 1765, was far more direct in its taxation. Here, any type of document or otherwise printed material would require to be printed or written on stamped paper. Therefore, a tax was levied on everything from newspapers, college diplomas, attorney licenses, and bonds to playing cards, dices, and even marriage licenses. This would intrude in every aspect of life in Boston, from the "lesser sorts" to the wealthiest of merchants. The Townshend Acts in 1767 levied further taxes a year after the Stamp Act was repealed. Here we again see tax on paper but also on glass, paint, lead, etc.
But as I am trying to emphasize, this is not a question of economics alone. The social and political aspects of the raising of revenue on the people of Boston is even more important to consider. As I point out in my post above, what did it mean to be taxed by a body that you did not consider to have the right to do so? In a city ravaged by unemployment, what did it mean when your employer couldn't keep paying you because a series of revenue acts? The inter-dependence of the Boston waterfront, for example, can not be overlooked. The taxes did not come alone but were accompanied by a tightening of the customs service as well as an increase in customs agents to oversee it, which included the 'writs of assistance' and even the involvement of the Royal Navy.
In your answer you mention the Tea Act 1773 as an example of taxation without representation, but isn’t it the case that this act actually abolished the taxes on tea? I understand that this frustrated Boston smugglers and led to the Boston Tea Party and Coercive Acts but this seems to undermine parts of your argument about the War of Independence being caused by taxation, and I was just wondering why you didn’t point this out/glossed over it.
The Tea Act need to be considered within the context of the Townshend Acts 1767 that first enforced taxation on tea. When parts of the Townshend Acts were repealed, the taxation on tea was kept and consequently carried on to the Tea Act 1773. So, no, the tax was still there. What really angered merchants, however, was the fact that the Tea Act now allowed for a sort of monopoly in which tea from the British East India Company was given directly to specific consignees (who were often than not given preferential treatment) who would then proceed to sell it directly to consumers in Boston, cutting out the middle man. All of a sudden, merchants wouldn't even be able to access legal tea that was exported from Great Britain without tax (although, again, a tax needed to be paid in Boston).
