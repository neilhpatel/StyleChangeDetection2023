For example, California currently has 48 GW of green energy deployed throughout the state. Do you know how much energy the state has tied up in permitting? 246 GW! California has more green energy tied up in permitting than it has deployed throughout the state.
Manchin is right on permitting reform. At this point one of the biggest barriers to utility scale green energy deployment is permitting.
These regulations were useful at a time when fossil fuels were cheaper than renewables. Now that renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels they are hindering the energy transition and ironically helping fossil fuels.
A lot of people are being very shortsighted in supporting this deal simply because it might speed up permitting for green projects. It also guts regulations and will allow dirty fossil fuel projects to run roughshod over local communities who donâ€™t want this shit in their towns and counties.
His holding back on what is needed to be done to protect voting rights and election integrity as well as to protect the individual liberty of women and their right of privacy within it suggests he is a mugwhump -- or outright hypocrite.
The one practical reason to have made that deal would have been to have enabled Congress to have enacted federal election law that blocked the Republican efforts to move the US away from democracy and toward an oligarch controlled fascist feudal theocracy of the hypocrite flavor. Not doing that means the authoritarians will keep pushing the US toward fascism with no federal brake controls to stop them.
