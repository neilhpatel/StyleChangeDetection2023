If so, there's probably not much to "fight." Certainly a call to the vet informing them of what the dog experienced and asking what (if anything) to do about it and whether a check-up or follow-up care is necessary would be prudent.

Onto the legality issue: you don’t really have a case. Your pet is fine. I would 100% call and explain what you found, and it’s even okay to be upset about it. I would be. You can ask for imaging or diagnostics to be done to make sure there aren’t any more FO’s present, but you will likely have to cover those costs if your veterinarian seems your pet not at risk after a consultation. If he/she is eating normally, having normal bowel movements- there is not a blockage present that will cause further issue. If you are not comfortable using them in the future- then don’t. But if you were to seek help for this incident from another practice or veterinarian- you assume full financial responsibility.
