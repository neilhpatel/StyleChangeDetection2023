What exactly do think the remedy should be? Stop wearing masks? Some men are attracted to women that wear high heels. Should they not wear them at work? Some women are attracted to men that wear flannel shirts. Should they not wear them at work when it's cold? His "kink" coincided with a legitimate work requirement. Unless he was somehow overtly harassing you because of it, I don't see there's much that can be done.
Is there a way i could somehow stop him from writing us up? I have 0 issue wearing a mask, but i am deeply uncomfortable knowing that he chose one that he specifically found arousing and is forcing us to wear it.
He says that we have to wear that specific mask. He writes up people who wear other ones. So he forced us to wear a mask he has specifically told me he chose to fulfill his kink.
Assuming he is authorized in his role to implement dress codes, there isn't anything you can do. It is no different than if he found red high heels hot and mandated all employees to wear them. Most dress codes are steeped in bullshit.
Telling a co-worker you are turned on by them wearing their uniform is sexual harassment. Like, textbook, clear cut, 100% sexual harassment. Doubly so when you're the boss. It's super weird you think otherwise.
There absolutely is. The courts have ruled multiple times that is nothing illegal about requiring women to make their appearance more "attractive" or "appealing" in the workplace. See Jesperson v. Harrah Operating Company for starters.
