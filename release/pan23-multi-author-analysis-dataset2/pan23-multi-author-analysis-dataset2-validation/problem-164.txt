It would be illegal discrimination to remove a religious item from a door, if secular items/decorations are allowed to be hung on the door. Landlords can skirt the entire issue if they do not allow anything to be posted.
I posted it on my door just like people post a cross or an LGBTQ item, or a holiday wreath. Which removal of those items violations the fair housing act in my understanding.
Is your letter from a medical professional that is actively treating you for a disability? Did you move in the animal before letting your landlord know?
Ok fair enough. In the 26 page lease agreement it makes zero mention of anything of the sort. There is nothing mentioning you cannot hang anything on your door.
“Tenants may display religious items or symbols in their units so long as they do not violate reasonable safety or sanitation rules or laws.
If tenants are allowed to display secular items or other decorations on their apartment doors or in windows, they should also be allowed to display religious items or decorations on their doors or windows, such as a Jewish mezuzah (religious ornament on a doorframe) or a Christian wreath or cross.”.
