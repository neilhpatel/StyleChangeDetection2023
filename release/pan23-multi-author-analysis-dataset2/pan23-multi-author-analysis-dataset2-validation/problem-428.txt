Not unless they show the mother is a danger to the child or is outright neglectful. He'll likely get some custody though. He will need to establish paternity and that's going to be a bigger process.
The husband will be deemed the legal father of the child. If he doesn't want custody or to pay child support, he'll need to disestablish paternity. That's going to require a lawyer.
No. Texas has fault marriage that can be granted on grounds of adultery but both cheated. That's going to make the fault basis a moot point. The bigger issue is that the husband's previous marriage may render this marriage void as a matter of law. The wife here needs to get an attorney ASAP and while infidelity isn't a crime, bigamy is. This may impact his immigration status (I don't know that for a fact). He needs to tell his immigration lawyer ASAP.
Bigamy is illegal and is a basis for deportation. Husband both doesn’t have a valid claim to immigrate based on marriage and can de deported based on the crime of bigamy.
He wouldn't be able to render the marriage void. She might be able to, although things get complicated as time passes. This is "attorney now, not later" territory.
He can establish paternity after the baby is born and and then file for custody. The legal definition of an unfit parent has nothing to do medical debt, credit score, being a liar, or a cheater, or medical health issues. Metal health could come into play if it makes her a physical risk to the baby (but again- high bar).
This is major. If you are the husband, speak to an immigration attorney and don’t get your hopes up about establishing legal status in the US.
Not even worth taking a guess on if this would be prosecuted for immigration fraud. Assuming that's what you're talking about when you mention jail time. Because you don't go to jail for cheating.
Thank you for your help. Though I want to ask what would happen to the legal status of the husband in case either of them filed for divorce or the marriage is rendered void. Thanks again.
