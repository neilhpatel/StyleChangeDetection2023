Do not accept legal advice from the people who arrest you. Cops are allowed to lie to you. Trying to get a job with a criminal history of violence will be pretty damned difficult.
You need an attorney. A year of probation may not sound bad but this will have lifelong consequences. This charge will show up on background checks forever. It’s in your best interest to have an attorney help you with the best outcome for yourself and your future.
Get a lawyer. I can tell people I arrest all the time how long they might get. But it’s up to the court and I can only go by what I see on an average. You could get a year of probation or the court could give you the maximum time in jail/prison.
Is there any chance I could get charges pressed on the kids because I sustained injuries? I just got done with x-rays to see if I have broken ribs. Massachusetts doesn't have any stand your ground laws, so I don't think self-defense would excuse this.
You will need a lawyer to navigate this. If you can’t afford one plead NOT guilty and ask for a public defender.
I suggest taking some anger management to help with any kind of anger issues that may lead to punching someone and/or learn to walk away from this kind of stupid stuff.
Most likely not as you threw the first punch. It’s possible the DA could go against what the cops reported but unlikely especially with these being minors.
