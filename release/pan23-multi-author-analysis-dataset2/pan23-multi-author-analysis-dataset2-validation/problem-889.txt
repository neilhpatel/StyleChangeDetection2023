You have to be so naive to actually believe the US has the Ukrainians in their best interests... Plus, it's not like any of this has happened before in history....
Idk if anyone in the upper echelons of US government actually cares aboit the people, but strategically this is a no brainer for the US. The aid indirectly helps cripple one of its geopolitical rivals without risking American lives, it helps shore up security for it's other allies in Europe, it helps promote US weapon sales, it makes the US look like the defender of freedom and democracy it claims to be, and it's probably already dissuaded China from an invasion of Taiwan, which the US would've been treaty bound to protect.
And given that you keep claiming that this war is the US' fault instead of the actual country that invaded, I think it's pretty clear at this point that I am wasting my time.
It's be like a liberal taking a higher paying job at another company. Is he taking that higher paying job because he's a liberal? No, his being a liberal is beside the point, he's just taking the higher paying job because it's in his best interests.
They are imperialists for doing those things, and they do those things because they are imperialists. You could say, however, that the "ideology", or rather production system, that guides these decisions is capitalism. Imperialism is the highest form of capitalism.
