Depending on when and where you were it would have been a sheriff/constable, town watch (at night), magistrate, or (even earlier) your neighbors/the militia captain. If your question is simply "IAmA British colonist that got arrested, so who got me?" it was certainly most likely to be a sheriff (and maybe his posse). An important note is that the colonies all started with slightly different legal structures and their particular colonial struggles transferred, along with mandates from England, into how those systems evolved in each colony. This post speaks in general and to Virginia style law, the opposite being Massachusetts style law. While similar they had subtle differences, like the use of constables. The center of law and order in colonial and early America was the courthouse, which is why they are historically at the center of town and all roads lead there.
The "police" as an organized force/department by that name were created for the first time in London in 1829. The first American police department was started in Boston in 1838 (and modeled after London's). They were started to prevent disorder in society and were the first full time paid group of law enforcement individuals united in a common goal of "stabalizing" urban populations as a result of immigration and poverty creating what was viewed as disorder in the streets/society. They were often brutal in tactics and loyal to politicians (who fought one another for control of them). They were also employed to "end labor disputes" (to put in nicely) in favor of the owners.
Slave patrols go back to the early 1700s in Virginia and the Carolinas. They started not just to capture and return but also punish runaways and generally maintain order of slaves in the area, including putting down/preventing revolts. Southern sheriffs essentially reinstalled this system for Jim Crow enforcement in the late 1800s leading to the modern claim "law enforcement started as slave patrols," which has at least some truth to it, but the history isn't that easy of a simplification.
Sheriffs and constables (a less law/order and more political/civil position similar to a sheriff) started in America in the 1630s (1632 in Plymouth for constables and 1634 in Virginia for sheriffs, which spread quickly as Plymouth also had a sheriff position created in 1634) and magistrates were already here at that point (but more often called justice of the peace, judge, or comissioner). Sheriff's were in charge of jailing, arresting, and generally keeping law and order (including formation of a posse which was volunteer or temporary law enforcement deputies). It originated a few hundred years earlier in England as a "Shire-Reeve," a type of local official charged with a multitude of duties, including tax collection. Eventually the name was shortened along with the responsibilities, focusing more on law and order while civil aspects were given to the magistrate. Magistrates were charged with operation of the courthouse and trials within it. They typically could sentence everything short of life and limb, which could only happen in the original court, or General Court, in the capital. Their civil authority would often have a dollar cap as well. There was no prison, only jail - a simple place to hold those awaiting trial (or sometimes as a "hotel room" for those on a proximity sentence, used for debtors to limit their freedom like house arrest is today). The stocks, pillories, whipping post, and eventually gallows, usually in the yard adjacent to the courthouse, allowed immediate execution of sentencing and punishment to be served letting society quickly move forward. Often the court days, which were a few days per month, were exciting days drawing folks from all around to have what can in some ways be described as an eighteenth century American block party. Street vendors sold goods, street preachers spoke, children played in the common fields and using the walls of the courthouse, gossips gossiped, elites socialized, and farmers discussed.
The first town watch was also in Boston, starting in the 1630s as well. Primarily these groups spotted fires, gambling, public drunkeness/disorderly conduct, and prostitution type crimes - and they frequently drank and/or slept while on duty themselves. These were usually volunteers (think modern volunteer rescue squad/fire dept system of pick a day and shift to cover) and sometimes were assigned watch as punishment (similar to community service sentences for small crimes today). It wouldn't be until the 1830s when police departments started being added that the ward shift (day) would be successfully added to the watch shift (night). These were launched with or combined into many city/metropolitan police departments when (or around the time) they were formed.
A great and easily available resource for early police forces and how they started is Police Science Professor and Historian Gary Potter's PDF titled [The History of Policing in the United States (From EKU School of Justice Studies)] (.
A good and somewhat quick read on colonial courts in Virginia is [The Structure of Justice: The Courthouses of Colonial Virginia, Carl Lounsbury, Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture, Vol. 3 (1989), pp. 214-226,] ( available on Jstor. The author has taught history at schools like The University of Mary Washinon, The University of Virginia, and The College of William and Mary, additionally serving as an architectural historian with the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation for many years. A result of much of that work he published in an architectural book that also details a lot of Virginia's colonial legal system and application of it, The Courthouses of Early Virginia: An Architectural History (2005).

Can you expand on the veracity of the modern claim that "police started as slave patrols"? I came to the sub to ask that, but I figure it doesn't need its own thread.
It really depends on how you define police force but historians do agree there is truth to the claim. According to the linked History of Policing in the United States;.
justice, outside of the law, if they violated any plantation rules. Following the Civil War, these vigilante-style organizations evolved in modern Southern police departments primarily as a means of controlling freed slaves who were now laborers working in an agricultural caste system, and enforcing “Jim Crow” segregation laws, designed to deny freed slaves equal rights and access to the.
The generalization of "police department origin" should - in truth - indicate the city/metropolitan forces that were assembled to maintain elite society and oppress those outside of it. This definition covers the actions of slaves being beaten by patrols, labor disputes being busted, immigrants and the poor being targeted with legislation and over enforcement, etc, which is much more of an accurate summary of the PD origins as a whole.
So if we ask "did those charged with arresting start as slave patrols" then the answer is no. If we ask "did 'police departments' start as slave patrols" the answer is no, but gets an asterisk. If we ask "did slave patrols integrate into and become police officers and departments in certain locations", the answer is absolutely yes, they did. If we ask "is there a history of profiling and over patrolling black communities in the South," the answer is yes, ever since 1704.
So, if I understand you correctly, the claim that the police come from slave patrols is somewhat true in the South, but not outside of it? So if someone in New York, Minnesota, or California were to make this claim, it would be categorically false, without asterisk?
The people that believe they all started with patrols would make no distinction geographically. It was the formation of a group devoted solely to law enforcement (sheriffs, constables, and magistrates did other things in addition to just law enforcement) that they cite as the origin. The fact that, around the time departments were being formed, over 100 policemen were in Charlestown, over 80 were in Savannah, and even 30 were in one Alabama town (while eight original Boston officiers were hired) speaks to the abundance of patrollers in the South. So the South started the policing. Then police departments went everywhere, but primarily to prevent disorder (due to increasing urban and immigrant populations) - which is essentially what slave patrols had already been doing.
The best response to police origins is that they were forces assembled to maintain elite society and oppress those outside of it.
I believe the contemporary claim is that police only in the South started as slave patrols but were strike breakers and union busters in the North, i.e. agents of capital and private property.
