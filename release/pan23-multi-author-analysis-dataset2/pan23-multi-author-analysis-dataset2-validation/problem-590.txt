The loan was taken out in 2017 but I found out in 2019 after I tried to buy a car. I’m living with her right now so I don’t want to potentially be homeless.
2019 when I went to buy a car. I’ve been living with her since then so I’ve been hesitant to take legal action due to potential reprisals. The loans were taken out in 2017 though.
You don't have a lot of great options. Either you accept responsibility for the loan and pay it back, or you report the crime to the police and alert the loan company to the fraud.
Unfortunately this is likely to cause severe legal problems for your mother. But if you don't put a stop to it now you will not only have to pay off the loan, but she will probably do it again.
You should freeze your credit now. Pull your credit report (only use nothing else -- if you don't believe me, look on the FTC's website for credit reports) and see if there's anything else your mother did.
If you dispute the charge, there is a non-zero chance your mother may go to prison for some time over this.
