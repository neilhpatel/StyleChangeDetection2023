Ok… not the right play to posture and blame etc. How about this…. Come out in front of the mic at the podium and happily announce that “The Republican House agrees that these key American institutions should be strenhened for the good of the US during this trying time.” Play it up just a tiny bit. The people want them to work together to accomplish goals. The cynical “us vs them” types can smile to themselves that the “Dems called their bluff”. Both sides make points. Neither wins all the points… the people that vote are old. They can see who got this done. Each side will stick to their old voting habits. Nothing will change on the voting habits. The thing that does change is that “we are better because we actually did something that matters to society.”.
