You committed an infraction, got a ticket, and paid it, the end. Now they are saying that because of your previous infraction, they want proof of 6 months pre paid insurance before they let you register your vehicle. If you don't register the vehicle, nothing happens.
I'm not sure why you think it will be cheaper to buy a new vehicle. You still have to register it and they will probably still want proof of 6 months prepaid insurance.
So my thinking was that instead of paying $600-800 dollars for insurance, registering the vehicle, and getting my title replaced on top of an unknown amount of work needing to be done, I may be better off spending $2000 and getting another vehicle in better condition.
The reason(s) I think a new vehicle would be cheaper is because the clerk at the SoS office told me that the hold is on the plate, not on my license, and getting a new vehicle would mean it would “go away”. On top of that my car needs a fair amount of work done to be road worthy again. She gets me where I need to go, barely, and any day something else could break on it.
You need to save up and get a 6 month policy and pay your fine. Whether you get a new car or not is a second decision unrelated to your legal penalties for not carrying the required insurance.
One of the main reasons I was asking about this is because it seems to easy to be true that changing vehicles would make the 6mo insurance thing go away. That is what they told me, I’m just not sure I believe it.
I don't believe it either. And normally in Michigan when you buy a new car you transfer the plates from your old one. If you want new plates it's considered a new registration and is much more expensive.
No, you will not go to jail if they let you register your vehicle without getting 6 months of prepaid insurance. Jail can be a penalty if you get caught driving without insurance though.
You are literally looking for a loop hole to prevent having to prepay 6 months worth of insurance. That is pretty much the definition of trying to slip through the cracks. Your obligation is to follow the requirements imposed by court which in this case is to prepay for 6 months of insurance and pay some $50 fee. Your friends are trying to help you slip through the cracks which may or may not be within the letter of the law but definetly are not within the spirit of the law.
They did say “I don’t think so”, that’s why I had to come ask the internet. Though I would like to say, Im not trying to slip through the cracks and get one over on the government. Im only asking because I want to be aware of my obligations and my options. I’ve never had to deal with this before, and my friends have all been telling me to sell my car and get a new one. It seemed too easy to me, and so I needed to get some opinions elsewhere.
In your post they said "I don’t think so". so the only person telling you you can get a new car to get out of prepaying insurance isn't sure. They are not an expert and can only give you a guess. Here's the problem, even if you are able to slip through the cracks and register a new vehicle without their system connecting the dots, eventually this will catch up with you and you will have to pay the penalties at some point down the line.
If I have to get prepaid insurance regardless then it would be impossible for me to get a new car. But if a new car would mean the restriction was waived then it would be stupid of me to stick with my current car. I’ll likely be paying for months of insurance that I won’t be able to use because the car isn’t even running. That’s why I didn’t have insurance in the first place, I was only trying to make it back and forth to my job so that I could afford my rent, and afford to get something like car insurance. It’s become a huge problem and I’m really not trying to take advantage of anything I’m just trying to survive.
