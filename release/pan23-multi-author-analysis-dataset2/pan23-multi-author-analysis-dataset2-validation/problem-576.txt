If you don't have anything showing up on your report and aren't behind on any payment to creditors there's likely nothing to worry about. It's entirely possible the collector is looking for a previous owner of the phone number (My last I was getting calls for a few years regarding the previous deadbeat owners) or someone misentered a number or...
I figured it could be a past owner or someone using my number as a fake just because I get a lot of spam text addressed to someone else. However, I've had my number for over a decade so idk.
As of right now there is nothing showing on my report (all 3 of them). Since there is nothing on my report (and hasn't be anything in the past) makes me think if I did miss anything it's new or from this year. But I cant think of anything that would be owing a payment on besides the one bill pending insurance. Which the company already told me is not in collections. I also have receipts/records of payment for anything within the year that could possibly go to collections (utility, rent, medical).
About 6 months ago we had some crazy lady call our main office number (we've had it for well over a decade) like 60 times in a 3 day span because she was convinced that we were a hospital and could schedule a COVID shot. Our auto attendant says "Thank you for calling (our company name that sounds nothing like a hospital) for (list of options that sound not even remotely medical) press (list of buttons).".
It doesn't sound like you have anything to be too worried about so just take a deep breath. If they were really looking for you they would leave a VM.
But if they are looking for me what should I do past that point? Because I'm not giving them any personal information since my service provider marks their number as spam. Although the company is legit according to the BBB there are a lot of complaints about them trying to collect debt that doesnt exists.
When she got to one of our voicemail boxes you can literally hear her talking to someone else in the room after she thought she hung up "they say they're (our company name) but I don't believe them".
Our number is in the same area code as a hospital and is 10 digits long but otherwise has nothing in common with a hospital... yet she didn't get the clue until one of my coworkers called her back. And she still called 2 more times.
That's crazy. I use to work for a company who's phone number was 1 digit off from the local schools so we would occasionally get people calling trying to reach someone at the school.
Again the only reason I know who they are is because I looked it up due to how many time I've been called. If I never did that I would just assume it's a really persistent spam caller since they are not leaving any voicemails. If a voicemail was left I would be more likely to call back.
