No timing alone isn't enough. His testimony is proof. The driving with out a license may or may not be able. It's not a blanket excuse in university that you're not a resident.
/ Does it not apply? Luckily he says if I got my OR license within a few months I could take that part off regardless.
I wouldn't just go off the officer's word it's a fix it ticket. They're not the last word on penalties/dismissing. It'd depend on what you were ticketed for, but if you were required to have an OR license, that means your TX license was invalid and you were driving without a license. Not a minor offense.
does this apply to you? Like I said, it's not a blanket if you go to school, you're exempt. A freshman living in the dorms wouldn't be required to get an OR license. An upperclassmen having an off campus lease/job likely would be.
So what was the reason the officer gave for writing you a citation on that, since your plates weren't expired?
Just looking at the "Operating a Mobile Vehicle without driving privileges part," If you were pulled over in January of 2020, and your plates expired in April of 2020, there wouldn't be cause to pull you over for non expired plated...
