There are some truth to it but it clearly misinformation. The Khmer Rouge era did not have much impact. The economic boom from capitalism after the 1991 Paris Peace Agreement changed more by bringing it global western food. Cambodian Cuisine remained complex but they do not served them in restaurant to tourists.
Look at more at crowded "delis" outside tourist locations, and nearer to traditional marketplaces or streetfood. In places where they are no air-cons, and almost no one can speak English, you see the complex Cambodian Cusine. And there are more that were made at home. Restaurants prefered to sell what is sold not what is unique.
But the restaurants that targeted foreigners' money generally served what foreigners liked. Similarly, if you to a Pizza Restaurant in Cambodia, the most popular pizza are Seafood because Cambodians prefered them. KFC in Thailand are way spicier than the ones in US.
Dried mudfish, prahok, sweetened radish and other Khmer daily cuisine can look disturbing to foreigners. I' m sure you' ve seen insects. (Fried crickets are amongst the most delicious food/snacks I' ve eaten and most foreigners tend to be disgusted by them. ) All these cuisines are found in books at least 500 years old. If the stone inscriptions actually talked of daily commoner food, I'm sure you' ll find them. Iirc, they were in Zhou DaQuan' s records of Angkor.
Lok Lak is more Chinese-influence rather than Vietnamese. It is some meat served with some vegetable. Nothing uncommon but Lok Lak sound like the action when making it. It served with beer and Chinese immigrants prior to 1950 used to make a living serving tofu and arcohol. It was made for drinking or special occasions. So beer gardens had it.
"Amok" is a food that are eaten from the Northeastern part of the country rather than the capital or most of country. When talk of national cuisine, many of the daily food can be attested and asscociated with other countries. "Amok" is what Cambodian government cannot find on other countries and foreigners tend to like. That is how it became sold to tourists.
Try look at rice noodle. It is generally considered a Vietnamese cuisine and sold as "Phò". Yet the name in Khmer is pronounced " Kuy Tiev" which sounded more as Chinese. "Kuy Tiev" and "Phò" is also different but shared similarities. However, "Amok" is only really eaten in a two provinces of Cambodia but it can be promoted as Khmer without attestation.
If the 1950s changed anything, it is the more prevalent Chinese influence on the cuisines due to more merchants families leaving China to escape from the Communists. But that also impact Southeast Asia cuisine and that already happened during the French Colonial era. Overall, Cambodian food had more influences from the French, as well as the Chinese since the 19th century.
The Khmer Rouge removed a lot of knowledge but there are more women survived and so they able to pass most of the traditional cooking. As I said before, many food names are found in books written 500 years ago. However, the histories or origins of some the cuisines or traditions may lost forever because of the destruction of records and intelligensia. Here is an example: a popular household soup in Cambodia is translated from Khmer as "Vietnamese Sour Soup". It is however, not a Vietnamese cuisine. It is used to be made from a fish which resides in Kampuchea Krom that had become Southern Vietnam. The fish name is forgotten and the soup name were changed to location instead. There are books from researchers that track where the cusines originally came from but they tend to be written only in Khmer.
2) The only thing Phở and Kuy Tiev have in common is that both are rice noddle dishes. The broth, seasoning, choice of condiments, and meat choice are completely different. Phở and Kuy Tiev are similar in the same way that grilled pork is similar to beefsteak: in that they're both grilled meat dishes. Or Jinhua ham vs Spanish ham in that they're both ham. Kuy Tiev is a traditional Teochew dish, while Phở was invented in Hanoi during the French colonial period. You were wrong in stating that Phở and Kuy Tiev are the same. I know for a fact that they also exist as 2 different dishes in both Cambodia and Laos.
3) The Chinese influence on Khmer cuisine started a lot earlier. The Ming refugee in the 17-18th century settled en masse in Southeast Asia, including Cambodia. On the Vietnamese side, "Hủ Tiếu Nam Vang" (literally Phnom Penh Kuy Tiev) is considered a merge of Teochew cuisine and Khmer cuisine.
4) I dont know about your source about the story about the sour soup, but a quick google search showed that the Khmer people have many different types of sour soups, and only 1 of which (with fish and shrimp) is credited as "Vietnamese". This puts into doubt against the story that the Khmer lost the dish and readopted it again from the Vietnamese. Another point against the story is that the Vietnamese version of the sour soup in Vietnam traditionally uses common fish that can be found in the Mekong river, such as snakehead fish, catfish, eeltail catfish, and tilapia. None of those fishes fit the criteria of "only found in southern Vietnam and not Cambodia", considering that all those species live along the Mekong river.
The Chinese influences began earlier than the Ming influx and Cambodia is an old country. However, the original question mentioned 1950s as a starting point. I' m not sure how flour production or trade can be made to support fried dough or more common Chinese food in the 16th century or prior. However, refugees from the chaos of late Qing Dynasty and Republic of China were often tofu sellers or wine sellers due to the ingredients are ready made locally. After the 1950s, they are already settled.
On the Vietnamese side, the Ming refugee group already grew wheat in central and southern Vietnam and made their own noodle. I highly doubt that they also could not grow wheat in Cambodia when they were recorded to have done so in Malaysia (Peranakan and their Laksa dish), Thailand, and southern Vietnam. Vietnam's original territory, northern Vietnam, has always grown wheat, there's nothing inherent about the soil or the weather of southern Vietnam that prevents the possibility of wheat growing, and the same should apply to Cambodia. There should be no shortage of seeds from trade either because the Southeast Asia maritime trade route revived under Yongle's reign should still be functioning and never actually died even after the Ming maritime foreign trade ban. On the Vietnamese side, the Ming refuge played a large part in connecting southern Vietnam to the rest of the trade route. By the 18th century, during the Tây Sơn rebellion (around Qianlong's reign in China), southern Vietnam was already recorded as something of a trade hub for the maritime trade route in Hoàng Lê Nhất Thống Chí. All in all, I am not convinced to the theory that the Ming refugee could not grow wheat or have access to seeds in Cambodia before the 1945, or even before the late Qing immigrants arrived, considering that they were recorded to have done exactly that in other nearby Southeast Asia countries.
I concede the point about Amok, but I object to your criteria of using marketing tactics by diaspora in the US to differentiate the 2 dishes, or in this case, saying that the 2 dishes are "similar". What the diaspora in the US does is the diaspora's decision, and you cannot say that "the 2 dishes are similar enough that you might as well say they're the same dishes", as you did in your original post, based on marketing tactics in the US. My criteria is very simple: anyone who has ever tasted the 2 dishes and with a functiong sense of taste would know that they are 2 difference dishes, considering that aside from the common ingredient of rice noodle, every other ingredients are different, and so are the cooking methods. Furthermore, restaurants in Cambodia itself labeled the 2 dishes differently, the mislabeling for the sake of marketing only happens in the US to take advantage of the American impression that "all Asians are the same, and so are their dishes". Yes, marketing-wise, amok makes more sense, but the point you made about Phở and Kuy Tiev in your original comment based on the marketing tactic of the diaspora in the US without taking into the perception in Cambodia itself and how the dishes actually taste like is wrong.
The only way anyone can mistake Phở, Khmer-style Kuy Tiev, and traditional Teochew Kuy Tiev (which is drastically different from Khmer-style Kuy Tiev and should not be considered the same dish) is that that person has no sense of taste and sight whatsoever.
Also, wheat doesnt have anything to do with the discussion about Kuy Tiev. Kuy Tiev is made of rice. Cambodia grows rice. There is no reason why the Ming refugee group could not make it.
The problem is what criteria you used to differentiate between them. Pho were called " Vietnamese Kuy Tiev" in Khmer restaurents while the oriental stores in the US sold Kuy Tiev labeled as "Phnom Penh Style Pho". The point being that if it cannot be promoted as a distinguished Khmer cuisine since it can be considered a Chinese cuisine or Vietnamese. "Amok" being made only in Cambodia is chosen instead.
As for sour soup, the "Vietnamese Sour Soup" is only one type among many, many sour soups. Yes, it can be made from many types fish and it was used only to be made from a type of fish in the Mekong delta. Similarly, the Amok used only made from a type of fish in Kratie province. Some cusines can be made by different ingredients, if they want to but some ingredients are prefered unless it is no optiom. I.e. whiskeys belong to Scottish company being manufactured in America amd sold as scotch. The "Vietnamese" sour soup is never really forgotten on how it was made except for the origins.
