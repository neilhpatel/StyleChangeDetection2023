So it seems you have a basic misunderstanding of loss prevention apprehensions of suspected thieves. He was waiting for you, because he had already been watching you in the store and believed that he observed you stealing. This is why he approached you specifically and immediately took you to the security room for investigation. Once they confirmed that you didn’t steal, you were released. If you call Walmart and complain, they will probably retrain the loss prevention officer and offer you a gift card or something as an apology. Beyond that, there’s not much you can do as it doesn’t sound like you have any damages.
I think you're not understanding where I'm coming from. And as far as damages go I have papers signed psychologist that say I have anxiety and other conditions.
NAL but if you weren’t convicted of anything and there weren’t any damages done, then how would you even have grounds to retaliate? Theft prevention is a thing. If there were questions about your receipt it sounds like it could’ve been handled differently but they were within their rights to question it.
There wasn't any questioning. They immediately sent me to a security room. I called the store manager and they said that wasn't supposed to happen either.
My family member got stopped once and was accused of shoplifting. After being patted down and questioned a little bit they realized nothing was going on. Had nothing to do with race.
Thr grounds of racial profiling. 100% agree to that they had the right to check my cart but does the escalation of the situation not sound like they were a lil extra. I mean once I called them out the guard literally jumped up ( in shock I assume).
