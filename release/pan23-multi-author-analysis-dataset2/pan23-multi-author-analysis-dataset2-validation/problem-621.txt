1. Get clean and completely rid of illegal substances / paraphernalia today. It going to suck but a legal plan requires it.
There are a thousand questions about ownership of the car and legality of the recording but extortion is extortion.
First, people have a reasonable expectation of privacy when driving their own vehicles (including borrowed or rented vehicles not owned by the driver).
Second, tells us that verbal communication between two people believing that their conversation is not being intercepted is justifiable reason to assume it is not being recorded, further establishing an expectation of privacy.
Unless your father is a police officer who was actively investigating you for a crime while holding a valid wiretapping warrant from a judge, for example, then it was almost certainly not legal for him to secretly record a conversation he was not party to that took place in your car, which is a place where those who were party to it had a reasonable expectation of privacy. This would be federally illegal no matter what state you are in.
Now that said, police have the power to charge you for any crime at any time. And per a comment reply below me, the evidence still could be permitted in court even if collected illegally by a private person such as your father.
The GPS tracker however is likely legal if your father owns the car. The owner of a vehicle is permitted to place a location tracker on their own vehicle to ensure its safety and whereabouts at all times, and many manufacturers now build their cars with GPS tracking capabilities and a corresponding mobile app right at the factory.
Regarding removal of the GPS tracker, if you own the car you could pay a shop to find and remove it, and then sue your father in small claims court for expenses related to unauthorized modifications he made to your car. You could potentially also seek a restraining order.
Many states have laws that outlaw putting gps trackers on non-owned vehicles. It would be helpful to know what state you are in. If it is in a state where it is illegal and your father is not on the title of the car, then file a police report.
Any any case, take your car to a shop and ask them to put it up on a lift and give a fine tooth inspection to see if they can find the device.
If the car title is in your name, do whatever it takes to find and remove the recording devices. If the car title is not in your name, that's something to fix since you say you pay for it.
You should probably talk to a lawyer about this. Location and situation details that aren't and shouldn't be put on reddit will be important on what you decide to do. This would probably require someone who deals with criminal defense (for the "legal trouble" part) and/or someone who deals with family law (for the child custody part.).
4. Go to a police station and file a report for the extortion. Do not need to tell them what you think he will reveal, only what he has done and the fact that he has threatened to reveal private, intimate conversations that you did not know were recorded.
Also, have you seen/heard proof that these recordings actually exist? If not, consider that this may be lies and intimidation.
If you haven't seen proof the recordings exist, and haven't been able to find the recording device despite looking for it carefully, I'd be suspicious that he's just lying to manipulate and intimidate you.
