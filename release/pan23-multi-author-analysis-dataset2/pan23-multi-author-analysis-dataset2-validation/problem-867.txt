So the better question would be, what was Jinnah thinking trying to build one country with two parts separated by thousands of miles of potentially hostile territory? It would seem that he wasn't thinking about it too much. He was in a rush to see Pakistan formed because by Aug 1947, he knew he had only months to live. He also was largely both liberal and elitist, so did not quite envision either how horrific partition would turn out to be (though he might have had an inkling after the bloodbath of Direct Action Day). He also might never have imagined India and Pakistan would end up with one of the most hostile borders in the world. He claimed that the fervor of Islamism would eventually cool down (Hindu right-wingers were not a factor in Indian politics at the time. The INC was liberal secularist, though individual members might have had different views) and the two nations would become friendly neighbors coming to the aid of each other in times of need.
The issue of Indian independence was virtually a sure thing even at the start of WW-2 (except for the partition part). Britain put off discussions once the war started (because for Britons it was a war of existence). Indian leaders (mainly the INC - Indian National Congress) did not see it that way. When Japan came invading, Britain needed a major ramp-up of the Indian army, and even made a, "anything you want after the war" offer. The INC though saw this as a chance to kick out the British and inherit a unified India. Gandhi launched the Quit India movement, which unlike the previous non-cooperation movement was not completely non-violent. Viceroy Lord Wavell took advantage of the major military build-up he was afforded, and clamped down hard (most INC leaders were jailed, and civil unrest was forcefully put down). The AIML (Jinnah-headed All India Muslim League) used this opportunity to expand its presence in the Legislative Assembly (which was the premier body representing the Indian electorate), winning every by-election in Muslim constituencies till it had almost 25% of the seats in the assembly. This ensured that when the time came, the INC's claim of also representing all Indian Muslims was weakened further.
In July 1945, with WW-2 winding down, Lord Wavell released the INC leaders and started the process of handing power to an interim government. This was also when the British public voted in a Labor government with an overwhelming majority. Atlee, the new PM, was known to be pro-Indian independence. Parliament itself was largely either in favor of it or indifferent, with only a few imperialists like Churchill insisting that Britain needed to hold on to India. The economics of holding India had long since been working against Britain and debt was a huge concern after WW-2. Attlee puts together a Cabinet Mission to settle the issue, and three representatives are sent to India (in July 1946). This includes Sir Stafford Cripps, who had led an earlier mission in the 30's (which Attlee was a member of).
Britain (Cabinet Mission) wanted to keep India unified. Lord Wavell (last Viceroy before Mountbatten) thought Bengal would stay in India, if India was divided. Jinnah was responsible for East Pakistan becoming a reality. He might have been a little unclear of it's longer-term implications (but that is not the question being asked).
So ultimately Jinnah had to force the issue offering Britain and the INC with only two choices - partition or chaos. As the WW-2 military build-up was winding down, civil unrest had restarted. Soldier mutinies were becoming disturbingly common and "Quit India" graffiti appearing in their quarters. To this Jinnah added the element of communal riots through this Direct Action Day on Aug 16, 1946. The only question then was how the new nations would be formed.
Thank you for this answer. Could you say that the Mindset of Jinnah was similar to earlier colonist mindsets in Africa and the ME - just draw some borders based on maps and some census data, and it'll all work out in the end, ignoring practical on the ground realities? It seems similar, and if he was a member of the educated elite, if also a minority.
Now Britain's primary preference was to leave behind a strong and stable India that would remain friendly to Britain and British interests. The "first gusts of the Cold War were already being felt in 1946", and there were valid concerns of how well a small nation made up of only the provinces in the North-West could hold up against a new Afghan invasion, especially one that was Soviet-backed. This had implications for the security of India as well. Moreover, Labor politicians had good relationships with the INC - something Jinnah was always suspicious of - which made them naturally sympathetic to the INC's no-partition stance.
Lord Wavell's initial vision was that Pakistan would only comprise the Muslim heavy-majority provinces, and not the "mixed" ones like Punjab and Bengal, which would then stay with India. Jinnah on the other hand wanted Pakistan to include some Hindu majority areas to make the new nation "economically viable". For one he not just wanted Bengal, but also wanted it to include Western Bengal (for Calcutta) because it was economically integrated with the East. So a compromise had to be arrived at. This was done on the basis on the census and the religion of the populations of each of the border districts.
Consider the first plan proposed by Sir Stafford Cripps in 1946 that almost succeeded. It would have left a unified India with a weak center (responsible only for defense, foreign affairs and communications), while the provinces would have all the remaining powers. This was seen as a plan to avoid partition, as the Muslim-majority provinces would essentially see Muslim rule. The plan was almost accepted - it was certainly not rejected by Jinnah - but then failed for some other reasons. IMHO, Jinnah probably thought of post-partition India-Pakistan as something similar to this set up just with two centers instead of one.
You're welcome, though I apologize if I gave the impression of Jinnah as having a "colonist" mindset. Jinnah was as much a freedom fighter and considered himself Indian (or later a Pakistani) as the INC leaders. But he was a Western-educated elite who did not understand the masses all that well - you could say he was one of the "brown Englishmen" that Bentinck and Macaulay had envisioned when setting up English education in India over a hundred years prior. For example Jinnah ate pork, drank alcohol and hardly ever prayed. For the average Indian Muslim any of these were enough to be ex-communicated (and to be sent to "hell"). Most of the political leaders were like him to be honest. Gandhi was the exception, not the rule. That does not mean he did not love his country or the people he represented. He just did not understand them (as well as say Gandhi did) and probably because of that could not predict the outcomes of his actions as well.
Unlike the straight lines you see in colonially drawn maps in Africa and ME, the maps of India and Pakistan were very deliberately drawn with the only criteria being the religion of the populations. That it still resulted in more bloodshed than almost any other maps is a different story.
