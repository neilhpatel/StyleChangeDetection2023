How would I handle either case? They aren't letting people in the house, and I nervous about purchasing a property with people attached to it who won't leave and the state of the house.
You would find out if they have a longer-term lease, and then you'd hire an attorney. This could take many months and you'd still have to be paying taxes and utilities and maintaining the property.
The realtor may just be using the term colloquially, I these are people who live here without paying with whom the owner does not have a good relationship. If they have been living in the property for any lenh of time, the police are not going to get involved (they'll just tell you it is a civil matter). In all likelihood, the only way to remove them is through an eviction... during a pandemic. Best case scenario, in your area you can legally give them notice to leave and start the eviction in a month or two, assuming the courts are open near you and are not massively backed up.
The house is cheap because it has a very expensive problem. If you are cool with likely thousands of dollars in eviction costs and not being able to use the house for months, by all means, buy it.
This is why the prices are so low. The people in these properties are likely not paying rent and are difficult to evict right now and possibly for the foreseeable future. The situation has gotten so bad that owners are looking to cut their losses and are willing to sell for well below what homes in the area would go for just to be able to walk away from properties that are probably hemorrhaging them money. You may get the property for a steal, but you're not just buying the property: you're also buying what are likely problem tenants. And who knows when you will be able to get them out and occupy the property, how much that will cost, etc. In the meantime, you will STILL be obligated as a landlord to keep the property in repair out of your own pocket as well as maintain your own residence.
