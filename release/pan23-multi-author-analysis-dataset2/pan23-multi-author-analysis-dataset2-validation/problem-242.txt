You can’t improve someone else’s property and then claim ownership or payment. The addition is no doubt lost.
It sounds like he made an upgrade/addition to a property his grandmother owned. She has passed. His mother now owns that property through inheritance. If I'm understanding it all correctly, then I don't believe he has any ownership or money owed to him.
No unfortunately he just trusted that his mom wouldn’t do something like that. He was very ignorant going into this whole thing. Oh well. Thanks again for your help.
Well that’s a little far out of reach financially for us. A lawyer that is. His mom filed the restraining order because he argued back at her.
I'd get an attorney still. He should have been able to recover personal belongings at some point. Sounds like the Order of Protection was poorly handled on his part.
She didn’t like the guests or late hours. Which I understand. However, she lied in court and said he attacked her and they believed her. I know he didn’t attack her because I was there.
