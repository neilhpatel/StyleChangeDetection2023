post by gives some troop figures split between theatres and gives some discussion of how troops were split up.
thread u/QuickSpore discusses more of the Europe-First strategy and how specific divisions were allocated at the time of the German surrender.
Per the table in u/the_howling_cow 's post, duplicated unless I am reading the table wrong it looks like the cow has double-counted the ETO+MTO figures. I was wrong, the 8.29m was including other theatres.
Looks to me like Europe and the Mediterranean was 3,559,381 and Southwest Pacific, Pacific Ocean and China, India and Burma theatres were 1,452,286 for a total of 5,011,667.
It's not quite the same table, but the statistics for the US Navy can be found . Notably the peak strenh by theater is : European (continental) 49,801 On 30 Nov 1944, North Atlantic (ashore & afloat) 150,046 On 30 Jun 1944, Mediterranean (ashore & afloat) 90,175 on 31 Aug 1944, Pacific (ashore & afloat) 1,366,716 on 31 Aug 1945, CBI (Ceylon, Burma & India)	Not available. As far as Marines go, the vast majority were in the Pacific from what I can find, but there were small detachments and individual Marines assigned to work alongside the Navy in the European and Mediterranean theaters, as discussed . What would become the US Air Froce was then the US Army Air Corps, and is included in the table of Army figures mentioned above.
