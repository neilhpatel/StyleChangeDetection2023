It is possible that ownership should have been transferred (but wasn't legally transferred) to the son-in-law's brother when that sale took place.
I have something similar happen Four years ago and had to pay $8000 in costs for storing a car For at least six months. It was parked over at an impound lot near the airport here. This city had sent me a notice indicating that the car had been sold, it was wrong and the Auction didn’t take place. Sin City moved the car to the city impound lot. And yes I did have to pay it as I was still registered owner. There’s a whole lot of backstory to this but I’m just giving you the details that are relevant. However if the owners are no longer with us, it is arguable that the debt dies with them. So sorry for your loss and I hope that wasn’t too blunt.
Nothing to worry about. The lien saler get to keep the vehicle legally. Say you get an old car off craigslist, no paperwork. Checked it out and not stolen. Find a company that does lien sales. They go through the process to collect storage fees or whatever from previous owner. Previous owner doesn't respond for 30 days or so, owner now owns car legally. That is what they are doing.
