Of course. IANAL but your landlord is only allowed to use your deposit to fix damages in excess of normal wear and tear. If he’s using it to pay for renovations you’ll be able to get it back, and, depending on your location, you may be entitled to double or treble damages.
I’m looking to get our security deposit back in full. The issue is that the house is already really old and is falling apart on its own. I’m expecting them to claim damages on us, when this was the condition of the house when we moved in. They didn’t even inspect the place between us and the last tenant. The old tenant was the one who gave us our keys.
Does not having access to the driveway that we have already paid to utilize breach any housing contract?
I’m extra pissed that they’re asking us to not come in until after Friday because they’re asking us to rearrange our schedule to enter a place that we have already paid for.
If they use your deposit for renovations that’s a big no-no. Sue them in court once the time passes to get your deposit back or if they give it to you less the cost of renovations.
