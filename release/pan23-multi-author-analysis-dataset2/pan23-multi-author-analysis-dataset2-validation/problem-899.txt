If the officer is unavailable, the law is specific about who can attest on your behalf (third party: doctor, counselor, etc). NAL but it appears you need either the officer or a third party to make a written statement PLUS written documentation from you, the tenant including those documents notifying the landlord the intention of breaking the lease.
The landlord can sue for rent to both tenants on the lease unless one of the tenants are exempt, as stated in the link.
Yes that is the law that I found and wrote a letter to my landlord about. The problem is the documentation. The officer didn’t write down that he was called for a domestic violence complaint on the police report so the landlord says I have no proof this law applies to me.
Ok, but did you notify the landlord before you broke the lease? Did you see a doctor, therapist, etc that is qualified to state that it was a DV issue on that date and time etc?
Yes I did notify them before. And no, I didn’t see a doctor or therapist, hence why I am so keen to see if anything can be done to correct the police report as it’s the only documentation I have.
