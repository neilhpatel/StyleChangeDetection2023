Are you asking if there are references within the Pentateuch to the Israelites believing in a plurality of deities? Are you asking if the Israelites worshipped multiple deities, or if they believed their neighbours had multiple deities whereas they had only YHWH, their God?
Two examples in the Pentateuch that illustrate Israelite belief in a plurality of Egyptian deities can be found in Exodus. The context of the first is just prior to the plague of the death of the firstborn, and the context of the second is a worship song right after the crossing of the Red Sea:
“For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods (Elohim) of Egypt I will execute judgments—I am the LORD.”.
“Who is like You among the gods (elim), O LORD? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, Awesome in praises, working wonders?”.
I’m not sure I’ve answered your question, but hopefully this answer gives some insight into the specific Hebrew word you’re asking about!
The word “Elohim” (and it’s short form, “elim”) can mainly be translated as God, gods, or angels/spiritual beings, depending on the context and the translator’s beliefs. It can be difficult to translate, and even modern translations can differ on how to translate specific cases. Michael Heiser (in “The Unseen Realm”) states that Elohim is a term meaning “spiritual being”. Thus it can refer to unworshipped beings (like angels), worshipped beings (the gods of other nations), or THE Elohim of Israel, named YHWH.
An example of a difficult to translate instance of Elohim, although not in the Pentateuch, is Psalm 8:5, where some translations (eg NASB) translates Elohim as “God”, whereas others (eg ESV) translates Elohim as “angels”:
Isn't that just how it's spelled in Hebrew though (vowels not being written in Hebrew), meaning both YHWH and Yahweh are the same just different transliterations of the name?
The proper thing is for that name to be avoided entirely, refering to Him as Lord, God, Adonai, etc. instead.
