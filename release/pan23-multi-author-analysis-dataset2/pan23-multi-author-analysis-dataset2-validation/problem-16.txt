tl:dr --- The US is noticing that some countries are beginning to falter in support for the Ukrainian war, with the majority of the rhetoric behind this decline being that Ukraine is not trying to do peace talks.
Basically this is just the US asking Ukraine to make a diplomatic gesture that Ukraine is trying every avenue for peace, the US knows these talks will not accomplish anything, but it makes for a good optics and makes it harder for people to stop supporting Ukraine since it's doing EVERYTHING it can, even if peace talks would be pointless.
It’s so stupid though, because people have apparently just brain wiped all the times Ukraine tried to negotiate at the beginning of the war only to have Russia immediately go back on negotiated agreements.
It's important to acknowledge that Europe has helped Ukraine and is undergoing discomfort because of that.
Europe has a short attention span for non bureaucratic purposes.. also they seem to love red tape, so they would rather have diplomats tied up in endless and pointless negotiations than have Ukraine just straight up say, get out of our country and no negotiations needed unless it’s to discuss the terms of your withdrawal..
Of course, but they need to make a show of it because people in western countries supporting Ukraine are making a stink of Ukraine not trying to have peace talks enough...I know, it's inane. Just look at the protest that happened in Italy.
How many do you think read headlines only? Based off Reddit, the majority. Most won't realize it's purely symbolic, just read the other replies on this thread or the other clones of this thread that were posted within the last 6 hours. Most are people thinking that the Biden administration is asking for appeasement.
Hah, look around this thread and the other clones that were posted before this one. Nearly everyone who commented directly to the post did not read the article and assumed it was really Biden asking for Ukraine to surrender. Most don't actually consume more than a headline.
Biden doesn't is not pushing for negotiations, but the appearance of negotiations to make people happy, that's it. If you can't understand that, you are either a troll or a moron.
Well afghanistan was far less lethal. 2,456 American casualties and 20,000 injuries over 20 years. Russia has 4x times that in a little over half a year. If this lasted 20 years, Russia would have almost no 20-35 year old males left in the country.
True, but then Russia would have a solid excuse that the "US was arming Ukrainians to invade Russia" and have even more public support from Russians. It's a shitty situation all around.
Moving supplies and equipment and training takes time. There was no way to move everything in from the very very beginning without having spent time before the war started.
Now, I would have preferred to see an even stronger initial volley of equipment, but it's not like there wasn't a fair amount of support from the start.
The US spends literally over 700B$ a year in military, you know, the thing that is meant to be used as an alternative to diplomacy. If we don't use some of that now to hurt one of our greatest geopolitical enemies, why the fuck do we spend so much on it?
Musk basically made a peace plan, not negotiations by the way. He basically told Ukraine to let Russia take everything they want...that's not negotiation, that's surrender.
This is also a symbolic fight for democracy against autocracy, Ukraine losing would be a horrible symbolic loss for the west.
Why do you think WWIII will come from this, or nuclear holocaust? As long as Russia doesn't attack anyone else, NATO will never get involved directly.
And lets say we stop helping Ukraine, and Russia eats it up and makes it part of it's country...do you think Russia is going to be like "all right, cool, got what I wanted time to chill"? Leadership in Russia would be shown that it can literally ABSORB a HUGE European country and nothing bad really happens, sure some sanctions will hurt, but the people in power won't feel it. They will look to other countries to conquer, and if those countries are NATO aligned, THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO STEP IN COMPLETELY AND YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE BAD.
Because Putin will not accept peace without taking all the land he "annexed" and Ukraine will not accept their lands being stolen...so there is literally no wiggle room in their negotiations.
Also Russia raped and tortured hundreds of Ukrainians in Bucha and since then Zelenski refuses to negotiate with Russia since he sees Russia as more than willing to ignore international law, so what good will negotiating do with Putin, who has shown he could care less about deals.
Look at Italy, they had a protest of thousands demanding Italy stop supporting Ukraine...one of their main arguments was that Ukraine wasn't trying hard enough for peace... So to help alleviate idiots like those in the Italy protest, Ukraine needs to pretend that peace talks could accomplish something and demand peace talks often, even if they don't accomplish much because Russia would never leave the war they started without significant gains at this point.
