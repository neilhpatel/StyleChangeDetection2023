NAL, but part of this is gonna depend on which state you live in. If you live in a two-party consent state, that means that it is illegal to even record a private convo/interaction, unless you have the consent of the other party.
If you live in a two-party state and have secret recordings of another person in a private setting, then you have likely committed a crime. As for posting the transcripts, I can't speak to the legality of doing so, but if you are ever sued and have to testify in court, you may have to reveal that you essentially committed a crime.
You're best bet it to report it to the authorities, but maybe talk to an attorney first, because you may have committed a crime by making secret recordings.
If you live in a one-party state and the recording was made in the one-party state, you still have to be sure of what type of recording is allowed without consent... but the person in question may sue you and you may have to spend lots of money in legal feels.
I live in Oregon, so it is a one party consent state. But unfortunately these recordings were recorded in person. I had no idea that it wasn’t applicable to in person conversations.
As far as the screenshots of conversations though, am I free to share them publicly? They obviously show them in a bad light but I don’t think it can be labeled as defamation since all of it is written by them and unaltered.
According to ORS 165.540(8), that's a Class A misdemeanor. Granted, I interpreted the "telecommunication" in ORS 165.540(1)(a) to mean a phone conversation and the "conversation" in ORS 165.540(c) to imply that it would be in-person. Please let me know if I'm correct here or not.
Yeah, that's the weird part. So definitely talk to a lawyer before going to the authorities, because you've likely committed a misdemeanor and you could be sued for civil damages (by said person who you recorded).
OP recorded an in-person conversation with the person, which would have required the consent of the person being recorded.
Regarding the text conversations, I am not sure. But even if they aren't defamatory, the person can still sue you, and even if they lose, you're still having to pay legal fees in defense of the lawsuit. Plus, if it comes out that you made secret recordings in person, you're legal issues will get very complicated very quickly (Discovery is a mofo).
Nah, you're correct; I missed where OP mentioned their location and deleted my comment. OR is a one-party consent state when it comes to telecommunication and radio recordings but all-party consent w/r/t to recording conversations that happen in person. There are a few exceptions to this but I'm guessing that none apply due the lawyer's response.
So basically I have all this evidence that can’t be used and my only real hope is by some miracle a judge believes me without any of that evidence? . This feels so unfair. This all really happened and I want justice, but I don’t have the thousands to pay for it… fuck .
Your situation more complicated than that, which is why you should talk to a lawyer before seeking justice. But you would have to convince a judge with any evidence this (legally) obtained. You may be able to used the text messages because he sent that to you. But the in-person video recording is a no... and you could face potential civil and criminal liability for doing that.
And yes, that means potentially spending thousands. But at a very minimum, see a lawyer about your current situation before going to the authorities. You might have to ask for lawyers who might be willing to do pro-bono work or who will at least charge a lower rate.
I already have spoken to a lawyer about it. But I decided to see what Reddit had to say. The lawyer basically said to just forget about it, it’s not worth the legal fees and time. But it’s hard because I really want justice for the violence and abuse I endured. .
