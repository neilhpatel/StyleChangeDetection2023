It sounds like the lawyer isn't so much valuing the claim at $30k as saying that's the most available through insurance. That's not terribly surprising. Hopefully your friend has some form of insurance of their own that might fill any gap left.
Almost certainly not. Nor, even at this relatively moderate level of claim, would that be likely to be financially viable. Suing Tesla would be expensive and they're quite clear that the operator remains responsible for operating the car on auto pilot.
Insurance isn't the limit of liability of each driver in an accident. If the driver of the Tesla was operating it in a negligent manner, she simply shouldn't accept a settlement for less than her damages from insurance, and instead, sue the other driver for damages in court, and unlike the typical uninsured/underinsured driver, someone who can afford a Tesla is more likely to have the ability to pay a court judgement. It's between the other driver and their insurance company how much of the debt is paid by the insurance company and how much the driver may be on the hook for paying if they didn't purchase adequate liability coverage.
