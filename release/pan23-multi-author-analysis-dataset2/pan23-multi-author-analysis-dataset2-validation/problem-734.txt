Then it sounds like they are multiuse trails and not one direction high speed. So watch our for hikers just like you would on any other multiuse trail.
There are signs at the start and end of these trails that display it is high speed one way traffic, hiking highly discouraged. These trails represent about 4 out of the 30 or so non high speed, non one way trails in the area.
Yoi should assume that the biker will be at fault. You should also contact the municipality and figure out who is allowed to use the trails. You seem to be saying the signage indicates it's bikes only but also that the municipality doesn't allow single use pathways. If the sign is just advisory, as in be careful a lot of people are biking here but also hiking is still allowed, then hiking is allowed and you should stop considering it to be a high speed trail.
Signage generally does not excuse you of your obligation to operate a vehicle, including a human-powered one, with due care. A cyclist who hits a hiker in the trail would almost always be at fault. Exceptions mostly involve situations where the operator has no reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision even when operating safely: hikers throwing themselves in front of cyclists from behind trees, or similar.
A driver is also generally at fault if they hit someone in the street, even if it's the interstate and pedestrians are not allowed to be there in the first place, if you need a point of comparison.

I get where you are coming from. However the signs saw what they say. They highly discourage hiking since they can't technically ban hiking. Trust me, these trails aren't fun to hike on, and it's obvious that you probably shouldn't be.
