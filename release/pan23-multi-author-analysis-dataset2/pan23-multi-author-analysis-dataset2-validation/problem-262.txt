If it gets to this point and you are afraid they will illegaly remove you then you need to make sure to secure anything that cannot be replaced with money (birth certificate, pictures, etc.) just to keep it safe. Make sure you have a copy of the lease in a safe place. Ideally a physical with a friend and a scanned copy in the cloud. This is more practical than legal advice.
You are not required to sign a new lease. The only thing that matters is the person you signed the original lease with had the authority at the time to enter into a contract.
It may be a good idea to get ahead of this and pay a lawyer for an hour or two to write a scary letter to them.
Make yourself familiar with Indiana eviction laws. If they try to do a self-help eviction (going into your place and forcibly removing your stuff) then this is VERY illegal. Keep in mind that an eviction and a notice to vacate are two different things.
