The best possible answer here would be to have brother either voluntarily transfer the property, or pay you and sister for your shares.
When it comes to inheriting trailers - especially when they're situated on rented land and prohibitively expensive to move - there is often real question as to whether the cost of the process is worth the outcome.
He wont, basically his kids got taken away, so we intervened to prevent them from going to foster care, he now thinks its our fault and has branded us the enemy even though all we are soing is following the CPS workers instructions and now he is trying to kick us out in retribution. So, i want to kick the rug out from under him so that won't occur.
It sounds like this is fundamentally a probate issue. If mom's property didn't pass correct through probate you'll need to address that with a probate attorney.
If mom has passed, you don't want the trailer in mom's name. Either the estate needs to sell it or you need to put it in the name of the beneficiaries. All other things equal, the former is preferable to the latter.
