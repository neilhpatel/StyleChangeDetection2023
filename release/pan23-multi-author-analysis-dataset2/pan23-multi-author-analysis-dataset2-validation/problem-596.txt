>The speaker suggested Wednesday that Santos would receive a committee assignment, though he ruled out the congressman getting a spot on the highest-profile panels.
And he seems set to receive a committee assignment. Here's a quote from Kevin McCarthy, the House Speaker.
McCarthy won’t push to have him resign, in fact it’ll be the exact opposite. McCarthy has a slim majority and now has this guy in his pocket. He needs the vote. If santos resigned not only would he have one less vote but he’d also risk the dems picking up the seat in a special election. Unlike the Senate where the governor can appoint someone a house seat would remain open until a special election.
Has anyone seen any coverage or proof this charlatan is a US citizen? How about a birth certificate? With all the falsehoods and the indictment in Brazil I have a hard time believing he is.
If he's not a citizen he should already be behind bars. Even if naturalized, to serve in the House requires US citizenship for a minimum of 7 years.
