No but seriously, sounds like you got bullied into paying some $150 who was annoyed they had to come out. If you didn’t pay him, what did he say was gonna happen exactly?? Lol.
Yeah, I know, I’m feeling pretty ridiculous for it in hindsight. It was the first accident I’ve been in however, so I was panicking and unsure of how to handle the situation at the time. He basically said there was nothing he could do and we had to pay him regardless in cash. I wish I was in the right mind to realize something was up at the time but as I mentioned, I was internally panicking pretty hard.
Just thought of something, I would dispute it with your bank. It’s likely you might win if you tell them what happened. Probably not the first time this guy has done this.
Yes, the police called him before they even arrived on the scene. This is just what he told me but I assumed it to be correct as the officers said nothing at the time (they listened to the entire conversation).
In the future, ask the police directly and don't assume they are listening closely. Pretending that police called, but actually just listening to (tow truck drivers are actually just listening to police scanners).
This is something the police department should be aware of. I presume you were pressured into payment after the police left the scene...? If you have the time and inclination it would be worth writing to the head of the police in your area. Tell them what happened and that you felt pressured into immediate payment.
Well, that’s unfortunate. At least I’ll know better for next time. I am wondering though, if I had disagreed to pay him before he towed me, would I have been in the right?
