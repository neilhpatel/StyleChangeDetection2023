Okay then. Management isn't allowed to receive tips. Your employer can institute tip pooling, wherein tips are gathered and distributed evenly among all tipped employees, but if those of you who earn tips just aren't getting any of the tip money that's an issue.
Meanwhile, you should know it's illegal for your boss to retaliate against you for filing such a complaint. That doesn't mean he won't trump up some reason to fire you; if he does, file for unemployment and appeal if denied. If he's dumb enough to retaliate, you should also report it right away to whoever's handling your wage claim.
Yeah, your boss is breaking the law. The DoL can and will slap him for it and get you back pay. It'll take a while, but it'll happen.
Unless you are in a very unique area, companies are looking for employees like you. Why would you want to keep a job where your employer is literally stealing from you? Now maybe the job is great in every other way, but you don't need to keep it if you feel you are being taken advantage of.
Have you checked your pay check/stub? When I was a server years ago, in a fast casual restaurant, card tips were added to my weekly paycheck and were taxed as income.
NAL, but I’m a former asst manager for Dominos. You need to contact the franchise owner. If that doesn’t work, keep going up the chain.
What happens to the cash tips? My store didn’t make much in tips for carry out so we just put it in a pool to buy things like coffee and lunch, things like that. Could this be happening to cc tips?
