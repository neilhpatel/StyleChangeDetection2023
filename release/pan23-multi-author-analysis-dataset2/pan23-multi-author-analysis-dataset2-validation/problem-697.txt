Since you sent the money through Zelle, you're going to be responsible for that money, plus the money that comes out of your account when the original checks/transactions are removed. It's good that you've already blocked them, and definitely do not continue talking to this person for any reason and do not move any more money.
You can report it to the police, but it's very likely that the scammer isn't even in the U.S. and finding them would be difficult. You can also notify your bank, but it likely won't change your liability for the money already sent.
You should speak to an attorney before doing anything, insofar as you may have been the unwitting pawn in a criminal enterprise which may impose criminal liabiity upon you. I think it's unlikely that you would be charged b/c you are also a victim, but the possibility exists. With your attorney, you should formulate a strategy to notify the banks and law enforcement, as appropriate.
