Physics aren’t even the same it’s fucked. Try to save your friend or she dies. As simple as that. There’s no prison. There’s no jail. There’s no alternative course. It ends in death when it’s at that extreme. The only thing that saved me was I was tired and I ended up calling an ambulance because I was somewhere I shouldn’t have been and I was thirsty as fuck. Then from there I bounced out of that hellish loop.
Honestly it sounds like your friends drug use has triggered psychosis, specifically something known as capgras delusions. A common side effect of meth use is psychosis and she right now needs professional psychiatric intervention aside from filing for divorce.
And I must dispute “highly unlikely.” I was similarly leery, at first, thinking it was a meth induced delusional psychosis. But I’ve seen and compared enough pictures to become convinced. Even accounting for “meth face” and possible haircut/style choices, the bone structure is off. Plus OG T’s hair had always been straight, even when it was long. Whereas new guys hair is a curly mess. And while there’s a close semblance in the nose/lips, the eyes are distinctively different. And he once had a notable tooth gap, whereas this current guy does not. Tooth decay from meth use wouldn’t explain that, I don’t think.
Good luck, but either your friend gets off the shit or she dies. Ignore the husband shit. That’s irrelevant.
