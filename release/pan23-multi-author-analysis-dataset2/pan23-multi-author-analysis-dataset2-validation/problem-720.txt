There is definitely more to be said than this, but I have an earlier (from a previous account) where I go into the general fairness of the proceedings, mostly focusing on the question of whether the crimes were "invented" by the allies (ex post facto) and thus constituted "victor's justice", or were existing crimes under international law at the time. My conclusion is that two of the three categories of crimes have a good legal basis before the trials, crimes against peace being the one lacking a good basis. Furthermore it, of course, is unfair to have selective prosecution, i.e. that the prosecution only went after the axis criminals, even if actions on the allied side also would have fit the crimes as they were defined. That doesn't make the rulings more or less legally correct, but it is a point on fairness.
Do note that my comment does not delve into the individual cases, procedural rules, evidence used, the judges, the conduct of the prosecution etc, all of which are important for fairness in trials as well.
Karl Doenitz wasn’t convicted for unrestricted submarine warfare, because his defense counsel showed that the US acted similarly in the Pacific. The Allies made sure that only those crimes truly beyond the pale, such as Doenitz and others’ involvement in slave labor, were convicted.
I'm not quite sure what you are responding to or asking about, as I don't talk about Dönitz' case in neither this nor the other comment, but i'll talk a bit about his case.
What you are saying is technically true (true in a way), but I think it does need some context or nuance. He was charged with aiding in conducting crimes against peace, for which he was convicted. Furthermore he was charged with War crimes, based on the unrestricted submarine warfare, which the prosecution claimed violated the laws of the time, this included several points, like attacking merchants ships without warning, attacking neutral ships and not saving survivors.
The british response to submarines was to arm merchant ships and often attack on sight, which rendered some of the obligations one normally has towards merchant shipping kind of hard to uphold, so he was not convicted of submarine warfare against british armed ships.
The attacks on neutral ships however was clearly illegal by several agreements after the first world war, and the "attacking neutral ships" part of unrestricted submarine was contrary to law at the time, as established by the tribunal.
A third point was not saving (or deliberately killing) surviving sailors. He was charged with this, but the tribunal did not see the evidence as sufficient to establish that he deliberately killed surviving sailors. They did however find evidence for illegally not saving sailors.
The defence did indeed argue that the allies had also done unrestricted submarine warfare, their argument was probably more used show that no one of the parties to the agreements understood them as restricting such warfare, so it was in fact legal. The line of arguments can also imply a Tu quoque argument or an argument of reprisals, and some see that as the real core of the argument, but arguments like that weren't really legal valid back then either. Regardless, by focusing on the actions of the US and UK as arguments for the legality, he forced the prosecution and judges to - if they wanted a conviction - argue for the illegality of their own actions in the war.
What happened then was that the Tribunal did establish the illegality of the unrestricted submarine warfare (i.e. that Dönitz had acted contrary to the laws of war), but said that "the sentence of Doenitz is not assessed on the ground of his breaches of the international law of submarine warfare". I.e. he had breached the laws, but the allied judges did not feel like they ought to sentence him for the breach, I assume because it would look like a severe case of victor's justice.
This is an important difference as it is mostly not considered to establish tu quoque as a legitimate legal defense, nor is it considered to be a precedent that unrestricted submarine warfare was in fact legal (they clearly established that it wasn't). Rather it can be seen as a political admission that it would be unfair for the allies to judge someone for something they also did. This was similar to the reasoning behind the prosecution for example avoided accusing Germans of indiscriminately bombing cities, even if that was very clearly a war crime or CAH at the time, because such accusations politically looked bad. The case is in a sense both (1) a product of a good defence attorney and (2) a product of the one-sidedness of the court, which meant it lacked legitimacy to give judgement on issues like this.
But, as said, the Tu quoque argument, or arguments from reciprocity or similar, was rejected in other cases at the IMT and IMTFE, and only accepted in this case more as a de facto admission, not de jure.
In Norway there is a concept of straffrihet (freedom from punishment) that can sometimes apply when you have, with sufficient guilt, done something illegal, but still don't deserve to be punished. A concept like that might be a more accurate description of the result of the Dönitz trial.
Various sources do describe it as him being aquitted, see for example Cassese (eds. 2009) , but in light of the above I think that at least needs to be prefaced with the fact that he was found guilty of war crimes related to unrestricted sub warfare.
Documents detailing the proceedings from the trial is available , though I have not used them for this answer.

I'm responding to the idea of "Selective prosecution". Donitz was prosecuted fairly, and obviously the Allies considered it fair to not punish or convict him for something they also did. That's it.
But again, law does not equate morality. Both my answers are just aimed at legal history, not the ethics or morality of it, nor the politics. I'm not qualified for anything of that sort. So "fairness" above is used in a quite legalistic manner.
Only accused war criminals on the Axis side were ever prosecuted, the allies didn't let themselves face the risk of being judged for war crimes. That's all I mean by "selective prosecution". The Dönitz case does illustrate that the allies (judges) thought some sense of reciprocity or fairness was important (whether for moral or political reasons), which is relevant to a moral evaluation, but doesn't change the fact that the procedural rules were very one-sided in only allowing the consideration of axis defendants.
As for the Germans' air bombing, the Prosecution might have just understood that most of the Nazis' victims did not die because of Indiscriminate bombing, and that the Genocide program mostly happened independent of it, and thus didn't prosecute it. Both because they believed they did it too and it would appear hypocritical, and because it wasn't the worst thing the Nazis did or that unique.
It is somewhat remedied (at least it is supposed to be) by the fact that the victors can, and ought to, try their own war criminals in their native military tribunals, but there really wasn't a political climate for that in the post war.
As for his the fairness of the Dönitz case: he was convicted for Crimes against Peace, which as I state above, and in the other comment, is generally considered to be (at the time) a crime the allies mostly invented. Hence the judgement violates the principle of legality, constituting an ex post facto judgement. Whether that is morally justified and fair is a whole different question, but legally speaking, that at least makes it questionable (the principle of legality in IL at the time is another difficult question).
It would have been more legally correct to judge him for unrestricted submarine warfare, which actually was illegal and was something you could be individually liable for.
The Nazi Leadership was put on trial because it was deemed - correctly- that they collectively launched an aggressive war of conquest and deliberately committed mass murder outside of war against various civilian groups. None of the Allied Leadership - excepting maybe the USSR - did anything even remotely similar in the war, and were mostly reacting to Nazi aggression.
I'm pretty sure "Crimes against Peace", just like "Crimes against Humanity", were considered Mala in Se. You don't need a formal law to know that Aggressive war, such as The Nazis' false flag attack that was the excuse for invading Poland, is wrong. It's inherently wrong. Same for the Mass Genocides the Nazis committed.
But in any case, yes. The Authorities at the time did consider them to be "Ex Post Facto", so much that they did the Germans a favor and allowed the New West German Government to ignore the Nuremberg trials and use their own laws to prosecute Former Nazis, resulting in many lenient sentences.
The quote you used is referring specifically to the IMT and IMTFE, which only had jurisdiction over axis war criminals, and was not a claim that no allied soldiers were ever tried for crimes. But the IMT and IMTFE themselves were largely one-sided procedures, and the allied leaders didn't face the risk of having their actions evaluated, neither there or at home.
The comment I initially link to does go over most of these points I think, and illustrates more the nuances of what these legal categories of crimes were and where they came from, and should also illustrate when moral considerations are legally relevant.
