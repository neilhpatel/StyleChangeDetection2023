Welcome to the second edition of the 2021 AskHistorians digest Its been a heckuva week. Just…. What a week. I had TWO fire alarms last night and that was just one night. But we are going to focus on the exciting positive stuff. Like having hundreds of fantastic, super awesome history answers to browse through Huzzah! Especially in this rather draining of times, don’t forget to thank the brilliant authors who put so much work in writing all this.
I had that answer sitting around for months while I couldn't find the post it was for and only now do I realize that I only answered half of the question.
It was a fun very timely question to tackle because we had just been eating and talking about traditional Japanese sweets, while our cat was begging for traditional fish treats.
Welcome back to another installment of "The Real Questions", where we take a look at the wilder side of ! Here, I shout out some of the unique, oddly specific, atypical, amusingly phrased, or otherwise interesting questions of the week, the ones that make me say "Finally, someone is asking the real questions.".
Below are my entries for this week - questions with a ‡ have a link to an older thread. What do you think were the realest questions? And be sure to check out my .
I feel like Zelda was my favorite, but I might be biased there . bias aside, though, I do think video game history is very interesting and oft-ignored topic of discussion.
Beyond that, I really liked the one about PEMDAS, because that’s something we really just take for granted and I love seeing people dig up the backstory to these things. “Just Friends” also wins for addressing something that is very noteworthy but not actually noted as much as it ought to be.
I'm actually kind of surprised we dont get more video game related questions. We have a great couple of non flairs on the list for video game related stuff, but weirdly its the questions that seem to be rare.
As my playthrough of the Zelda franchise finally starts to wind down (assuming it doesn’t take an eternity for me to just play BotW and AoC), I’m probably gonna soon do some more digging into pre-2000 video games—“historical research”, if my mom asks—so I wouldn’t be surprised if that produces at least one or two more questions from me.
But then someone does ask a video game question, and it gets an answer, and then it’s so cool to learn about it and you wonder why this didn’t happen sooner! Like, a few months ago /u/Postmastergeneral201 asked , and that got labeled Great Question and /u/jbdyer wrote an awesome answer, and I’m just sitting here thinking how awesome it is that I was able to learn about one of my favorite video game franchises right here on /r/AskHistorians and… yeah, I’m starting to ramble, aren’t I?
But yeah, especially considering Reddit’s main demographic, you would certainly expect a little more. Though i’m not too surprised. I feel like video games are just one of those topics that everyone knows about but not many people think about having a role in history; like, sure, one might keep track of technological developments or how franchises got improved or whatever, but the idea of finding an actual historian who studies them—a noteworthy cultural and economic phenomenon that plays an important part in history, not merely a nifty toy with a strong hold of the market and rots kids’ brains—is much more foreign, so it doesnt really register for a lot of people that its a valid topic of historical inquiry, and in turn, something they can learn about here. Which is, y’know, a textbook example of a Real Question.
Don’t forget to take the chance to shout out the interesting questions that caught your eye but remain overlooked! Perhaps a wandering expert will take notice, or it will inspire someone else in their question asking.
