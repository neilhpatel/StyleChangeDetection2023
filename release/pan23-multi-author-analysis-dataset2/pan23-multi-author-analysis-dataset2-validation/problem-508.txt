1) it sounds like a standard form release basically waiving HIPAA so medical facilities won’t get into legal issues releasing your records.
If you are asking them to pay your medical expenses they have a right to make sure those charges are related to the accident. They would need to know what you were seen for so yes it is pretty standard.
I don’t think they would be able to limit the scope that way. They would probably be able to say limited to only the body parts they are claiming injury to. Insurer wants to know if they are 1) hiding a previous injury to the body parts they are currently claiming and 2) if the currently injured body parts were previously injured, how much is residual and how it compares to the current injury.
2) Insurance companies will look for any/all reasons not to pay out. Some of those reasons can be nefarious (they don’t want to give up money), other reasons are less so (there are dishonest people trying to take advantage of the system). The insurer wants to make sure you aren’t trying to claim injury to a preexisting condition (i.e. if you were now claiming say back injuries from the current accident when five years ago you may have had a catastrophic injury to your back… they need to kind of gauge if your back was really actually hurt in the current accident and if so, what was still leftover from that prior accident). They don’t care about your UTIs (unless your are claiming it). They care about how honest/straightforward you are being and limiting what they are responsible for. Note, if the matter goes to court (for whatever reason), my understanding is they would be able to bypass your HIPAA rights anyways with a subpoena (again not a lawyer, just going off my experience).
