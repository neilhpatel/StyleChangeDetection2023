How long have you been employed there? Have you worked at least 1250 hours in the 12 months prior to taking leave? Are there at least 50 employees in a 75 mile radius of your work site (all employees, not just drivers)?

I do have proof of medical issues I can provide too the job that they are aware of due too me being off a leave of absence. This is very sad that they fired me while being on a medical leave of absence.
How many weeks off have you taken off in the last 12 months? Include the medical leave you took for COVID and any other medical leave.
If you never provided any proof of having medical issues then you don’t really have a case. Most states are hire at will and don’t need a reason to fire you. And since they fired you and said you apply whenever you’re better, I don’t really see why it’s an issue considering you aren’t working anyways.
Unless you have money, you aren’t going to be able to sue them as they’ll stretch it out as much as they can and you’ll be in debt before you get anywhere with it. Better off filing for unemployment and making them pay you.
