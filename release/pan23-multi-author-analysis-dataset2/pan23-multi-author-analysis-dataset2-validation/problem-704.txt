The Inca empire had extensive networks of fortifications, but they were mostly located on the imperial frontiers by the time of the Spanish invasion. The Inca were also capable of mobilizing large armies (the Chronicles say up to 30,000 men, though thats probably an exaggeration). These armies weren't made up of full time professionals, but neither were most European armies until the 17th century. Inca weapons, largely slings and maces, were simple. They were nevertheless well adapted to a system of Andean warfare that focused on, among other things, prisoner taking and hilltop defensive positions.
It wasn't that Inca forces were woefully underdeveloped or were caught unprepared because they happened to be focusing on other things. The significance of technological advantage in the form of gunpowder or steel, I would argue, is frequently overstated. What was much more decisive in terms of Spanish victory was timing.
Pizarro's invasion happened to be timed perfectly. The Inca were just emerging from a civil war, and different ethnic groups within the empire, including the Chanka, Cañari, and Chachapoyas were eager to ally with the Spanish in order to throw off their Inca overlords. Even then, the newly victorious Atahualpa's forces could've wiped Pizarro and his men out at Cajamarca had the order been given. Perhaps overconfident following a string of victories, Atahualpa made the decision to agree to an audience. Pizarro then followed Cortes' example to the letter, took Atahualpa hostage, and the rest is history.
My primary source in this case is D'Altroy's The Incas, and I can grab you the passages I'm referring to as desired.
Thanks for picking me up on that. This was actually a case of me splicing a few ideas into one sentence and failing to adequately rewrite it. The point I wanted to make in the original post (which I fumbled) was that Inca commanders were as skilled in strategy and logistics as their European contemporaries, and the size of the armies they led into the field was comparable. Allow me to explain.
Is this intended to be 300,000 men? I've seen claims of over a hundred thousand, and I remember at least one figure of over 300,000, so I thought this might be a case of a missing 0.
The 30,000 number refers specifically to Huayna Capac's campaigns in modern Ecuador. The organization of Huayna Capac's forces is described by Murúa as an army divided into three parts. This might be a narrative device, but it also describes a system that would be well suited to a central attack and simultaneous envelopments from each flank.
If we suppose that Huayna Capac's army was indeed divided into three parts, and combine that with the largest decimal division commonly used by the Inca (10,000) you get an army of 30,000 men all deployed in the same campaign against the same enemy.
I think an estimate of over 100,000 men consistently engaged in military service is probably reasonable to man and maintain the Inca system of fortifications and storehouses, with additional soldiers conscripted for specific military campaigns.
I'd definitely agree given estimates of their population, what we know of their institutions, and so on. This is definitely on me, but what I meant by "high end" was the 300,000+ figure. For a total "People Engaged In Military Stuff", I think 100,000 throughout the empire is totally reasonable given the empire's scale.
For specific references on the northern campaigns, I'd recommend The Oxford Handbook of the Incas (2018), chapter 2.4 (my copy is digital and won't give me page numbers for some reason?). For another general look at the Inca military to go alongside D'Altroy, I'd recommend McEwan's The Incas: New Perspectives (2008) 126-131.
I was aware that Incan weaponry wasn’t as advanced as what the Spanish had, but I assumed that made much more of a difference than it apparently did….
First, I should note that discussions of Andean warfare have historically been divided between opposing viewpoints that emphasize the "ritual" nature of warfare to a greater or lesser extent (a careful reading of my contributions and citation history reveals my position pretty clearly). For the history of that debate, see:
It did, thank you! I was worried that D'Altroy's military figures were Very Unsupported, and that I would need to recontextualize a lot of information as a result. Not that that's bad, but it would be involved.
Ah, that totally makes sense. My thoughts were actually some specific quote regarding "350,000" men sieging Cuzco, which D'Altroy stated to almost definitely be an exaggeration, which I agree with.
investigation of Andean militarism: Some cautionary observations,” in The Origins and Development of the Andean State.
It is not however, history attributable to divergences in some sort of evolutionary trajectory. Rather it is history as created by one fateful decision made in a larger context of Andean political instability.
Secondly, I should note that talking about "Andean" warfare at all is painting with a broad brush. It's hard to apply models of violence or conquest that originate on the coast to the highlands (or vice versa) across more than a millennium without greatly generalizing. Still, the disciplinary organization of Andeanists means we do that a fair amount.
Thank you, this is what I was hoping for. I spent a week in the Andes but there wasn’t as much discussion of Incan history as I’d hoped so I was left with the impression I had based on what I’d observed. The landscape itself does lead one to believe that the Incas must have been more advanced agriculturally than many European cultures of the time, because they were able to grow crops on mountainsides at high elevations etc.
We have iconographic and bioarchaeological evidence of prisoner taking and execution in and contexts on the north coast of Peru (Verano and Sutter 2007, Verano 2014). We have bioarchaeological evidence for trophy heads taken from non-local populations during the Wari (600-1000 AD) period in the highlands, though these (Tung and Knudson 2008).
Just prior to the expansion of the Inca empire, small-scale warfare seems to have been endemic throughout the Andes (Arkush and Tung 2013, Arkush 2015, Mullins 2016). Many communities or small chiefdoms were likely lead by cinchekona, who had established their authority through skill in combat (Nielsen 2009).
