No, you are not required to purchase a labor law poster from this company. You are likely to have labor law/employees rights pertinent to your state on visible display if you have employees.
I am going to wager that this is a company using something official looking to scare you into buying their poster. You can buy them a lot cheaper other places.
It's a scam. If you read the fine print on the notice (it may be in a 3-point font), you should see a disclaimer that the company sending is not an official agency.
If you are the only person in the company you likely donâ€™t have to post a notice, but you will if you have one employee.
seems to have PDFs for everything that would be required, if you were required to. if you're worried, print them out, stick them in a clear folder and, I dunno, magnet them to your fridge.
As a business owner, you should be diligent about confirming each and every "notice" you receive in the mail. Usually there will be some very very fine print stating that the notice is, in fact an advertisement. Sometimes it's just a scam/fraud, where the fraudster uses an actual state agency letterhead/insignia, but you'll notice that the address to mail payments does not match any actual state agency.
There are NUMEROUS companies that send "advertisements" internationally formatted in such a way as to appear as coming from an official federal or state agency.
