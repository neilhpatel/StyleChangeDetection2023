It may not seem fair to you at this moment, but if everyone is being held to the same standard, it's perfectly fine. Make sure you get there early next time if possible.
But for labs, there are real safety reasons why late entrances can be a problem. Not only because people may be moving around with breakable or dangerous supplies, but also because if you miss information in a lab, you may not be aware of necessary precautions or instructions. When professors lock the door at precisely class time for labs, they know that everyone in the room has received all the information needed to do the lab safely.
This is actually a very common policy for labs especially. Any time someone enters after class has begun, there's a distraction to the professor and all the other students. Arguably, it's not "fair" to allow one student to ever disrupt all the others, but most professors allow this for lecture classes as the disruption is generally small.
I understand that however, this was not the case for my situation, A, the lab hasn't even started and the professor was still preparing. B, all glassware is situated at your table, they made it clear that glassware or chemicals should not leave your area until cleanup. and C, all information about the lab is provided a week early so you can be familiarized with the situation. All you do in the lab is your experiment (which for this one only contained salt and water), after which you are free to leave. The decision not to allow me in the lab had no backing.
It had all the backing it needed which was a clearly communicated policy by the teacher. And while THIS particular lab may not have had safety concerns, the professor is in a much stronger position if they enforce this policy every time vs having a student complain about access after another student had been allowed late access before. That actually could be a problem.
In general, the first part of a chemistry lab covers safety procedures. Professors and universities have to set policies for the safety of their students due to liability issues. Not being late is pretty standard with chemistry. I would plan future class schedules accordingly.
In general, professors/teachers/instructors can manage their classrooms however they see fit. It's not uncommon for labs to lock the door at precisely class time as late entrances can disrupt class. So long as this policy is approved by the school, there's nothing you can do about a teacher having and enforcing this policy.
If you have a mobility issue or other disability that could cause you to be late due to common unforeseen circumstances like being forced to use a different entrance, you should talk to your school's disability office. You could request a reasonable accommodation to the teacher's policy.
