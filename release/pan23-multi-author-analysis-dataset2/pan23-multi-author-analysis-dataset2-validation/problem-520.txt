If you make an offer in line with the appraisal, under ordinary circumstances the estate would accept it, because the estate has a duty to liquidate the estate at the best achievable price. The potential obstacle here would be whether you're already locked into a contract at a higher price, in which case the estate's duty to maximize the value of the estate may force it to hold you to the over-priced contract. Even so, a gross disparity in value like this would give an ordinary buyer pause, and the potential litigation expense of enforcing the overpriced contract, coupled with the uncertain outcome, could provide an excuse for the estate to climb down on the price. In this case, the executor should be willing to take the appraisal value offer if it clears the estate's debts & expenses.
In other words the executor has a duty to make sure the house sells for a good price. The heirs get more the more it sells. Making someone do something like forcing you to buy the house at the original offer is expensive and it’s not clear they can. So in theory the executor should be willing to come down in price closer to the appraisal.
Monkeyman80 I spoke with the attorney handling the estate today and he said that after speaking with the state yesterday they want to stick with the price of $120,000, if I don’t want to pay that they will take it to the open market. Then when I asked how they got that number to begin with they fed me some bs about having that number from a realtor doing an appraisal and past taxes. I know from my conversation with the paralegal that they did not get the number $120,000 from a realtor but from an online market analysis and the property had been taxed at a value of $77,000. I feel like I am being swindled and I am out of my depth when dealing with attorneys etc. do I just rescind my offer if they are not willing to meet in the ballpark of the appraisal?
Bank appraisals don't always meet up with the nature of the market. It's one reason an all cash offer is superior as they don't have to worry about this issue. Property tax values certainly don't.
What you should do really depends on how much sentimental value you have in the property. In a strict black and white scenario, that's a serious premium over the appraisal and not a smart financial decision. If they're really stuck at 120k and that is well over market having it sit for a 6 months - 12 months might change their mind. But this risks losing the house. This is also something a real estate agent can give you their professional opinion.
Have you done any personal market research? What are houses in the area selling for vs list price? How long are they sitting on the market? What are comparable houses listing/selling for? You can hire a real estate agent to help you do this and give you a realistic idea what a realistic price for the house is going to sell for and see what's going on.
It is hard to find good comparable properties in the immediate area. The market seems to be neutral, but most listings in a 20 mile radius are under contract so I guess stuff is selling. I am going to offer to split the difference evenly between 94k(the appraisal) and 120k(their market analysis estimate) at 107k and make up the difference for the bank.
If that doesn’t workout I have been maintaining the property and dealing with burglars/police for nearly three years is there any value in negotiations in that? With no realtor involved we are saving the estate a good chunk of money, right? I would think that 120k with realtors is a lot like 113k without their fees. If I get rejected with my offer to split the difference would the lack of realtor fees and the compensation I would want for time and expenses be worth bringing up as a last ditch effort to close this deal?
