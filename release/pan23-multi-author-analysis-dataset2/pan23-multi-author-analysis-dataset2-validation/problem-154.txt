Did he lock you out by bolting it while you were gone or lock you in by bolting it from the outside while you were inside? Did she give a reason?

From our room to the main house. I don’t know if we were home and asleep (fiancé keeps crazy hours and I usually drive him to/from work to avoid him driving exhausted).
She said it’s because we won’t get the covid vaccine so she doesn’t want us “infecting” the rest of the house. I don’t go anywhere. My fiancé only goes to work. All our friends except for maybe 5 live out of state and the ones that live in state we rarely see cause their schedules are hectic.
Tell her your lease guarantees you access to the house in exchange for the rent, and if she is barring you from the house then she's in breach of the lease. Look at the lease terms to see anything about giving her notice of default, an opportunity to cure the fault, declaring her in breach, etc.
Look into your rights to withhold rent until she cures the problem. Note that if it's a month to month lease, she can terminate it on thirty days notice. But she shouldn't be able to collect full rent then deprive you of access guaranteed by the lease.
