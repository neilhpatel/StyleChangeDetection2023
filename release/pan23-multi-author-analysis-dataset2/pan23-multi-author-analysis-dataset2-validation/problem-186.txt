For some reason I can't view the other comments on this post, so apologies if I'm doubling up things that have already been written. I'm a historian of the 4th and 5th century Roman Empire and I've also written and researched a fair bit on the history of psilocybin mushrooms in European history, so I feel I've got relatively good background to give a well qualified answer on this one.
It's boring, I know - it would be fun to think that it was otherwise, but on the basis of the evidence we possess the answer just has to be no: until the 1950s, no one outside of traditional communities in Central America had any idea that these mushrooms could induce visions or be used as medicine.
It was contact with one of these groups that allowed Europeans/Americans to 'discover' that magic mushrooms really existed. Reports of such things existed from the early period of European colonisation of Central America, because Central American societies used them widely. However, these reports (recorded mostly by 16th century Catholic priests writing about native cultures) were largely dismissed as fictions or misunderstandings, since no one had ever been able to find these 'divine' mushrooms. A man called Gordon Wasson travelled to Mexico searching for them, and after a number of unsuccessful attempts over a period of years was able to find a healer in Mexico who was willing to give him some of the mushrooms and perform a mushroom ceremony for him. This happened in 1955 and you can read the original article he wrote about it in 'Life' in 1957 here: . From there the whole thing blew up, the compound was isolated, hundreds of psychoactive mushrooms were discovered worldwide, and shrooms became part of the hippie counter-culture. But there had clearly been a continuous use in Central America from Aztec times right through to the present day, despite attempts by European settlers to stamp the practice out. That practice had continued underground and undocumented by westerners from the colonial period until 1955.
This is somewhat of a minor point, but the identity of Teonanacatl (the Aztec's sacred "flesh of the gods") and its contemporary use by indigenous Mexicans was documented by westerners a bit before Gordon Wasson's Life article.
The botanist William Safford claimed in 1915 that Teonanacatl was never a mushroom at all, but rather a name for the buttons of the peyote cactus, which in pre-hispanic drawings might appear to be a mushroom. He reasoned that the 16th century Spanish writers had been deceived by Indians who didn't want them to know its real identity. This theory was largely accepted at the time, since, as you noted, no Western researchers had been able to find the mushrooms since those early writings.
In the 1930s, an American undergraduate student of ethnobotany named Richard Evans Schultes, who had already done field work on the peyote ritual of the Native American Church, was skeptical of Safford's theory--peyote buttons don't look very much like mushrooms and grow in a completely different climate, and the early Spanish writers who described Teonanacatl actually possessed extensive knowledge of botany and would have been unlikely to have made such an obvious mistake.
In 1936, Schultes came across a letter from 1923 in the National Herbarium at the Smithsonian, addressed to the director of the herbarium from an eccentric Austrian physician living in Guadalajara named Blas Pablo Reko. In the letter, Reko claimed that Safford had been wrong, and that Teonanacatl was a mushroom that grows on dung heaps, which is still used by that name in the rituals of the Indians of the Sierra Juárez mountains of northern Oaxaca and eastern Puebla. In fact, Reko had already written about this in 1919 in a small journal of the German-speaking community of Mexico City called El México Antiquo. Schultes wrote to Reko, and Reko was able to send him a sample of mushrooms obtained from the Mazatec indians of Huautla de Jimenez, Oaxaca, by the Austrian anthropologist Robert J. Weitlaner. The sample was in poor condition, but Schultes could at least tell that they probably belonged to the Panaeolus genus.
I'm afraid the answer is "no, they weren't". Andy Letcher's book 'Shroom' is a FANTASTIC read and much the best thing out there on psilocybin culture, and as he points out there is simply no evidence that Europeans ever practiced magic mushroom use before the 'discovery' of the practice among central Americans in the 20th century. Plenty of psilocybin mushrooms are native to Europe, but there is simply no evidence that anyone knew what these mushrooms were capable of. Obviously, people would have ingested them from time to time, but then as now people were cautious about fungi and anyone who had eaten magic mushrooms would presumably have believed that they had simply been poisoned. Early scientific literature on mushrooms from the 18th and 19th century shows absolutely no awareness that there was anything special about the 'magic' species, though they are occasionally listed a poisonous. So whilst we can - and lots of people do - hypothesise that they will have been ingested before the C20, there is literally zero evidence to build a case for any kind of systematic and intentional use of these mushrooms as drugs. Anyone claiming different is generally getting very creative, and suggestions (for example) that Viking berserkers used magic mushrooms are based on no evidential foundation of any kind. Likewise, books like Robert Graves's 'The White Goddess', which find 'evidence' for ancient magic mushroom cults and for a long tradition of European magic mushroom use are almost entirely works of imaginative fiction by people who really love magic mushrooms and want to give their hobby an exciting cult history to go with it.
In 1938, as part of his doctoral research, Schultes traveled to Huautla with Reko, making the final leg of the journey by mule, as the isolated Mazatec town was not connected by rail. There he ran into, by coincidence, a team of Western anthropologists including the Berkeley student Jean Bassett Johnson, as well as an American missionary named Eunice Pike, who was already familiar with the mushroom and its role in indigenous religious practices. Schultes collected an extensive set of mushrooms specimens from which he was able to make a proper botanical identification (Panaeolus campanulatus var. sphinctrinus), and Johnson and Schultes were able to witness ritual use of the mushroom by a Mazatec (curandero) healer. Schultes published his and Johnson's findings in 1939 in the journal of Harvard University's botanical museum, the Botanical Museum Leaflets.
It was Schultes' 1939 paper that led Wasson to Oaxaca in the 1950s to eat the mushrooms with the curandera María Sabina.
So then, there were actually several westerners knowledgeable of the use of psilocybin mushrooms by indigenous Mexicans in the early 20th century, and it received full scientific documentation in 1939. Still, this knowledge was restricted to obscure academic circles before Wasson's 1957 article in Life, and Wasson claims to have been the first Westerner to have actually participated in the mushroom ritual rather than merely observing one, although I don't know whether or not that is true.
Yes, Amanita muscaria has been known to mainstream European science since at least the mid-19th century and possibly well before that. Oldest reference I know of to it is mid C19 - Mordecai Cooke's 'Seven Sisters of Sleep' - though if you dug about I would not be surprised to find earlier. They contain a very different chemical from what we'd generally think of as magic mushrooms, however - muscimol as opposed to psilocybin. And yes, usage of it very common in Siberia and other northern regions, and because of that more widely known of than psilocybin mushrooms, whose use was concentrated in central America until the last 70 years.
So "the west" as we know it has only integrated shrooms since 1950? That's so crazy. Were the Europeans aware of the use of Amanita Muscaria or anything like that? I heard that it was more common in eastern Europe and the slavic/Baltic/Balkan areas (my geography sucks, one or more of those terms might be wrong).
When speaking on antiquity was there any more research into the Eleusinian Mysteries and what the Greeks were ingesting for the underworld like visions reported? We now know the Delphic temples were built above gas that affect the Oracle somewhat. Curious if anything else was discovered on other events.
Yes this is a tricky one, but I think it seems like more of a big deal now that we know the mushrooms exist. There are 15,000ish mushroom species grow in the UK alone (where I'm from), and of these only a handful, maybe half a dozen, contain psychoactive chemicals. They're utterly unremarkable looking, and what's more look like a number of other species, including fatally toxic ones. They're small, so they don't particularly encourage hungry people to eat them, and they taste foul. They're also fairly hard to find unless you know you're looking for them, and as you point out tend to be found in places including fields full of manure, not necessarily an obvious place to go spotting for food. They also grow only in very specific seasons and conditions, and can't be farmed or grown artificially without any ease (unlike fruit and crops). You would need to eat more than just the one to feel an effect, and without a cultural prism in which to put the experience you would also likely find it exceptionally unpleasant and scary, particularly in a religious context where visions and so forth might well be a sign that the devil was after you. So for all these reasons, whilst doubtless people would, on occasion, have accidentally experience the hallucinogenic effects of these mushrooms, there were a whole series of powerful factors that could perfectly naturally keep hallucinogenic fungi from being discovered, enjoyed/used, and disseminated within a wider culture.
