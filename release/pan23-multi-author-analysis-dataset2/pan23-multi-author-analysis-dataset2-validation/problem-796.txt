Its an interesting problem, you would essentially need dozens if not hundreds of officers on stand by in order to hold everyone accountable. Or they just go in shooting a few times and see if that's an effective deterrent to future gatherings.

Curious that Abbott cares about this issue now. I remember seeing this happen multiple times over the last few years in Houston, and the state government didn't care. I hope the police can stop these events. Street racing is very dangerous.
Dallas here, there's so much street racing. We just try to not drive past 10PM. Even at my place in the suburbs, we can hear the same crew going down the same road every single night and its been that way for the three years I lived here. Same time every night, so its pretty clear the cops aren't even trying.
