Continue to call the police and then call to have it towed every time they block you in. Talk to the police and ask them to speak with them about not parking there.
Thank you very much. I just made a huge 7 foot banner that reads “don’t fucking park here. Seriously it’s illegal and inconsiderate” with a little cartoon cat on it. I plan on ordering it and hanging it up along the fence in the alleyway.
No, what’s immature is them refusing to comply with a basic request of not blocking my car in. I’m matching their level of immaturity while trying to extend an olive branch and make them laugh.
Very mature. That sounds like you’re just going to cause drama. Just keep calling the police, and have them ticketed/towed along with politely asking then not to park there?
In my county they have to be ticketed before they’re towed. They move only when authorities come to tell them that they need to move. When I tell them, my boyfriend tells them, or our landlord tells them, they won’t move. Unfortunately, it can take hours for anyone to respond to my calls.
