The hospital and the surgery center most likely have a non-solicitation agreement as a part of various contracts that exist between them. While neither party can stop you from applying, they very well may be able to stop each other from poaching people away. The fear of a lawsuit may very well make it such that neither side will hire the other’s employees, and yes, that is probably enforceable.
They've hired from the hospital before, about 5 years ago, but a surgeon got mad about it and cried to the CEO of the hospital and that's when they stopped. I don't know if that makes a difference or not.
Maybe, maybe not. The unfortunate reality is that the surgery center and hospital can pretty much agree not to poach each other’s people, and unless it somehow results in some kind of crazy anti-trust scenario (insanely unlikely), or they are engaged in illegal discrimination, it is acceptable.
Non-solicitation is one thing, refusing to hire someone because they work for someone else is something different. That’s what it sounds is happening here, not an issue with solicitation.
They can’t stop you. Any agreement between the two to not hire each others employees could be an antitrust violation (this was most recently seen in the tech industry, where companies agreed to not poach each others employees - this resulted in a multimillion dollar settlement).
They may threaten to sue the other company for violating a non existing agreement or something similar. This may rise to tortious interference (which would require a lawsuit by someone impacted).
The tech settlement is not analogous. That was anti-trust because it was collusion between competitors in the marketplace. The situation OP described is most likely a contract between the hospital, and it’s tenant, the surgery center. Unless they are direct competitors in a small market with no other options for nurses to work, it is highly unlikely to rise to an anti-trust violation. Non-solicitation agreements between companies up and down supply chains are bog standard in all kinds of industries, and generally enforceable.
From a purely academic standpoint, maybe it could be anti-trust, but from a practical reality, unless this hospital and surgery center are the only medical employer for a looooong way, it is not.
Non-solicitation is always the general term I have heard for these kind of agreements. What is the “something else” for a company refusing to hire someone for a non-discriminatory reason like being employed by your landlord or the hospital where you have attending rights)? I do not see a claim here.
Fair enough. It would also be a different circumstance if the surgery center had induced hospital employees to leave, then withdrew the offer of employment. That would open a reasonable reliance argument.
