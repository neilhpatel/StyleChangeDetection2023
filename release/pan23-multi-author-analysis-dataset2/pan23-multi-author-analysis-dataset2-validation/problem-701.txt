Welcome one and all to another episode of the Sunday Digest. I’ve collected and compiled a list of organic, luxurious threads for your perusal. From a host of topics and from flairs and non flairs alike. Don’t forget to upvote your favorite threads and contributors. Show them your appreciation!
There’s also a number of special features this week, as well as the usual fare that’s always worth checking out.
Thanks for the mention! I rarely post anything, but the fact that even comments on an obscure post like that are noticed and appreciated is always nice.
The thread was a fascinating look at the evolution of technology, and a rebuttal of the classic ‘tech tree’ that video games tend to do. There was a great answer from /u/Iphikrates which grew to include other points and debate from others such as /u/restricteddata, /u/jschooltiger.
There was a great reply from /u/Khwarezm as well as interesting follow up from /u/maniacalbrain in .
Thanks for the shout-outs. I quit Reddit a while ago, and only just come back, with more books under my belt. I was real happy to see so many Oz questions being asked within the first few weeks of returning.
Had a great answer from the appropriately named /u/rockhistory, as well as a fascinating follow up from /u/Hillsonghoods.
I want to point out that if there is anyone interested in further reading into the life of late Imperial Chinese bureaucrats, Voices from the Ming-Qing Cataclysm and Vignettes from the late Ming are great reads as well.
