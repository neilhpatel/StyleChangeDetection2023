Firstly, as to why Elizabeth didn't produce an heir - it would have been almost impossible for Elizabeth to marry an appropriate person and therefore birth an heir. After all, what man was fit to marry the queen? Marrying a royal from another realm raised the question of foreign interference (think Mary and Philip of Spain) , marrying anyone of lower political status within the realm (i.e. everyone) would have seemed debasing in a way that it didn't for a king to do the same. The gender dynamic is really important here, as it would have been perceived as bestowing kingly powers upon a commoner not necessarily worthy of them. Almost any marriage would have likely been politically destabilising for Elizabeth and would have created further faction at court. For Elizabeth, the best way of consolidating power was not to marry, and then to outlive her rivals for the throne. We can only assume from her actions that this was her priority This was not criticised in the way the question implies in terms of 'preserving the Tudor bloodline', but was certainly chastised at least privately by the political elite for being politically imprudent.
Through the first half of Elizabeth's reign, it made sense politically for her not to name an heir, as doing so would run the risk of providing a figurehead for those disenchanted with Elizabethan rule to rally behind, which could spark rebellion. Yet Elizabeth had the advantage of outliving the two biggest threats to her throne, Catherine Grey and Mary Stuart, and in the last years of her reign it would perhaps have been prudent to name an heir and thus save any political complications arising upon her death. The level of uncertainty around the succession even led some of Elizabeth's Privy Council (chiefly Robert Cecil) to enter into secret, treasonous, correspondence with James VI of Scotland, in order to try and ensure a smooth succession to the throne if the queen were to die without naming an heir.
By the 1580s when it was clear no heir would be birthed, the question then became: why didn't Elizabeth name an heir?
Elizabeth, unlike her father Henry VIII, refused to try and legislate on the succession via her will or via Acts, and instead pursued a course of silence on the issue, other than to declare by statute that it was treason for anybody to deny Parliament's right to settle the crown. Robert Cecil, in writings after the Queen's death, sought to defend his somewhat duplicitous approach to succession politics (specifically his secret correspondence with the king of Scotland) by suggesting that 'if Her Majesty had known all I did... her age and orbity, joined to the jealousy of her sex, might have moved her to think ill of that which helped to preserve her.'.
Thank you! I've just answered another question on why Elizabeth I did not name Mary Queen of Scots as her heir if you're interested in hearing about other aspects of this.
As her life drew to an end at the start of 1603, there was an atmosphere of great uncertainty and fear surrounding the death of the queen. As Elizabeth lay on her deathbed, there were reports of her doppelgänger being sighted turning around corners at Richmond Palace. Two ladies in Elizabeth’s chamber reportedly discovered the queen of hearts playing card nailed underneath her chair, which was considered a sign of witchcraft. A few days after her death, a rumour spread that Lord Beauchamp, the elder son of Catherine Grey, had taken Portsmouth with ten thousand men, that he had French backing, and that Catholics had risen in his support all over the country. The succession question was by no means certain, even at this late stage.
The succession story of 1603 thus gives a fascinating insight into the lasting changes that the Tudor monarchs had wrought on English politics. A more meritocratic political system had developed, whereby men such as Robert Cecil were able to vanquish earls in political battle. It demonstrates a move away from feudal systems of government, to one in which the highest ranking members of government took precedence over nobles regardless of their rank. This was no democratic decision, but never before had the choice of monarch relied so heavily upon the personal preference of his subjects. James, with his years of political experience, his even-handed and consistent diplomacy, his awareness of the need for religious compromise, or at the very least ambiguity in rhetoric at a time when religious faction starkly divided English society, had demonstrated himself to be head and shoulders above the rest of his competitors, and it was from this position that he took the crown of England in 1603.
This question is particularly interesting in the broader historical context, because Elizabeth's refusal, first to provide a successor through the traditional methods of marriage and birth, and then later to name one when prospects of marriage had passed and age had rendered her fertility doubtful, meant that the contemporary political elite were forced to engage with the notion of what gave any candidate the right to become king of England. Anne McLaren has written compellingly on the idea that the protracted period of female rule under Elizabeth ‘inaugurated what proved to be a conclusive move away from belief in kingship as embodied essence to its abstract conceptualisation as an office of state: one that was, in the last resort, divorceable from both the blood and the person of the king.’ In McLaren’s model, there is a fundamental rethinking of what it means to be king throughout the Elizabethan years.
Furthermore, in a mere seventy years, the religious Reformation that had seemed so contentious when first set in motion by Henry VIII had cemented itself to the extent that England had become a state where a Protestant monarch was eminently more desirable than a Catholic one to most elements of society. Here, again, James stood out as the most qualified candidate for the English throne. The turmoil of Mary I’s attempt to reassert Catholicism as the dominant religion of the realm was still relatively recent in the memory of many, rendering the idea of inserting the Spanish Infanta on the English throne as a Catholic monarch as dangerously divisive. Those Protestants concerned with succession in England recognised that it was important to place united support behind one candidate, and as a result Lord Beauchamp became largely overlooked, as James Stuart emerged as the most qualified, and indeed, the most determined Protestant candidate.
This new English Protestantism had vastly wider reaching implications than might initially be assumed. Anne McLaren has demonstrated how, for patriarchal Protestant figures in Elizabethan political life, a female monarch alone was not enough to fill the conceptual role of ‘king’ of England. While Elizabeth, through what was most probably the result of some shrewd manoeuvring of her own, had retained against all precedent monarchical autonomy by refusing to marry and to birth the heir that would give her husband the right of rule, she had also forced those Protestant politicians deeply ingrained in patriarchal models of authority to create new and innovative methods of ensuring that a bodily person other than the titular monarch whom they perceived as ‘king-like’ held authority. McLaren suggests these figures were firstly Robert Dudley, the Earl of  Leicester, and then his political heir, the Earl of Essex, though perhaps William Cecil, Lord Burghley, is a more pertinent and enduring example of this sort of power distribution.
For me, it ignited a new curiosity about the evolution of the British monarchy, & especially the disruptive and transformative evolution from Henry VIII -.
Under Elizabeth, then, perhaps the role of ‘king’ had transformed irrevocably. James could proclaim to Parliament all he wanted that ‘precedents in the times of minors, of tyrants, or women or simple kings [are] not to be credited.’ This could not, and indeed did not, invalidate the fact that the monarchical republic that had existed under Elizabeth had paved the way for new forms of power distribution and new modes of governance in England that eventually found full expression in revolution in 1640.
There's a LOT of history there in a short window -- Elizabeth reigned until 1603; Charles I's fight with parliament ended in 1649. The Restoration came in 1660.
King Philip II of Spain was married to Mary I of England. He was proclaimed King of England upon his marriage to Mary. The _current_ prince Philip is not king because there is no such thing as a King Consort. Any King (Like Philip II) would automatically outrank a Queen. This was fine for Philip and Mary as co-rulers in the 16th century but not ok for Elizabeth II in the 20th.
Leanda de Lisle, After Elizabeth. If you can read articles, Anne McLaren 'The Quest for a King: Gender, Marriage, and Succession in Elizabethan England.' Need to go more deeply through my notes to find out more sources which I can definitely do but not just now - I am actually meant to be packing to move today, which probably explains why I'm wasting my time talking about Elizabethan England here . however this does mean I am likely to turn up many more notebooks on early modern England and maybe answer some more questions soon!
It's a novel, but if you want some well-regarded and SUPER gripping backstory to Elizabeth, you could do a lot worse than to read Wolf Hall.
By the early 18th century, England was well on their way to the sort of Monarchy they have now -- limited in power, beholden to Parliament, and subordinate to a Prime Minister.
If you loved the machinations in GoT, I mean, wait to you see the shit that went down in Henry VIII's court -- and you get a courtside seat through the eyes of Thomas Cromwell, who was a super interesting guy. It was basically ridiculous that this son of a blacksmith & brewer ended up being the second most powerful man in England, and yet there he was next to Henry VIII.
