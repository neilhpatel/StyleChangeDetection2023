That was amazing! The form factor struck me as very much like the modern serialized comic book; and the ability to pull one over the viewer, meander in the middle of the season, and respond to their feedback during the show's run, is very similar to the modern TV shows.
Dickens in particular wrote stories specifically for a serialized format. While it is probable that he, and most other authors of the time, at least came up with a general outline of the story and plot and would write some of it in advance, concessions had to be made because of the publishing format. Each issue of the Pickwick Papers, for example, consisted of 32 pages of text, two page wide illustrations, and a coloured cover covered in advertisements. They cost one shilling each. There would be twenty issues in total, of which the last two would be published simultaneously. This meant that the whole novel would come to exactly one pound and would be published over a time span of nineteen months. (Voogd) This means that, if nothing else, the story had to be tailored to fit in that specific amount of text.
Hey, something I can actually sort of answer! Not all of this is specific to Dickens, but I hope it answers your question about the effects of serial publication in general.
With serialization also came a whole new way of writing novels. Since the story was to be published as a serial, all the separate issues had to connect with each other and the reader had to be able to remember what had happened in the previous issues. This meant that the story was told mostly in chronological order, with very little flashbacks or diversions from the chronology. Serial publication also meant that the ending became seperated from the rest of the text. This meant firstly that authors had more freedom to explore subplots before ending the story. This contributed to the many very complicated plots of stories published in this era. It also meant that the ending could not negatively influence sales of the previous issues, unlike with novels that are published in one part. Negative reviews based on the ending could mean lower sales figures for the whole book in that case (Hughes & Lund). This often meant that especially in issues nineteen and twenty the author would generally take little notice of the wants of the readers (Voogd).
Another direct consequence of serial publication was the emergence of the cliffhanger. The next issue still had to be sold, even if sales for the previous issue had been good, so the reader's attention had to be engaged. Ending the issue "at a point of unresolved narrative tension" would keep the readers in suspense and would entice them to buy the next issue in order to find out how exactly the tension would be resolved (Hagedorn). In order to build this tension in every issue, serialized fiction often contained masses of characters, longwinded plots, murders, thefts and other sensational plot elements. It was also important to have certain recurring themes and features in these stories so that readers could easily remember what had happened in previous installments. After all, there was a month long interval between issues and other texts were read in the meantime (Voogd).
It was a French writer, Eug√®ne Sue, who "established the pattern of writing at the same rate as the novel was published" in the early 1840s (Hagedorn). This was a style of writing particularly suited to serial publications, because it was the only means of publication that allowed authors the receive immediate feedback on what they had already written, before writing more. This meant that it was possible to alter characters or change the course of the narrative according to reader response (Voogd, Hagedorn). For example, in 1866 Anthony Trollope was writing The Last Chronicle of Baset when he overheard his minister say that one of his characters, Mrs. Proudie, bored him. Trollope killed her off in the next issue (Voogd). A more drastic example is William Thackeray's The Newcomes, published serially from 1853 to 1855. During the course of its publication, the author received countless letters begging him to marry Clive Newcome, one of the main characters, to his cousin Ethel. Thackeray had not planned to do this, but eventually gave in, saying "What could a fellow do? So many people wanted 'em married." He had to change the course of his plot to make this change happen (Voogd).
