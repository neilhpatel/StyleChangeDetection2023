Keep working with your insurance company. As others have said, talking to your states’ insurance regulatory authority could help move things forward.
This does not affect your credit or financial standing in any way - unless you try to sell the house while the lien is active, then you would have to resolve the lien to deliver clean title to the buyer.
It’s not uncommon for contractors to put a lien on a property. This only means that their interest is secured against the physical property (instead of just having the right to sue you, they could theoretically foreclose your house).
Depending on the response we receive from our adjustor tomorrow, a call to the insurance regulatory authority may be in tomorrow's agenda as suggested by you and sirwired. Thank you all for the help.
I'm happy I asked here because that will certainly give us piece of mind. Obviously since we've heard and knowing very little about it, we've been pretty panicky but knowing this is somewhat of a standard operating procedure does help.
