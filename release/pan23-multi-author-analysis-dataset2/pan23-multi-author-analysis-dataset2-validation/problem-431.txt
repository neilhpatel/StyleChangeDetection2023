As a preface, I think it is important to understand that "mostly translating" ancient texts was in fact quite important - Scott Montgomery's Science in Translation is a good, albeit slightly dated, introduction the history of scientific translation, and does discuss Golden Era translation for Greek astronomy.
As for more direct scientific accomplishments, Avicenna's The Book of Healing and The Canon of Medicine were essential medical texts until the 16th century. Aristotle and Galen are central to these works, but in addition to preserving them Avicenna reinterprets and updates them with contemporary knowledge. al-Razi similarly made direct contributions to Galenic medicine. Averroes and Avenzoar wrote extensively as well on medicine, and al-Khawrizmi is quite famous for his work on equations that would become the basis of algebra.
Much later, Ibn Khaldun's Muqadimmah is a very rich, expansive text covering everything from historiography to evolution. This is a very loose sketch of Islamic contributions to science, but Golden Era scholars did both preserve Classical authors and make influential contributions themselves.
I'm afraid I can't speak richly to the florescence and decline of Golden Era science - Jamil Regep is a historian of science at McGill/Max Planck who has the edited collection Before Copernicus that might be of interest (there is a lot of emphasis on astronomy, much like Montgomery).
Ahmad al-Hassan and Donald Hill were historians of technology with a variety of texts on Islamic science and technology that present a little different view than Lewis for the decline; one question here is the premise (did it actually rapidly decline? if so, when?), another critiques the actual impact of religious change on scientific output. Bernard Lewis' What Went Wrong is a very different kind of book but might be worth exploring.
Thanks, I ordered the book that you mentioned. Basically I am trying to understand why science in Islamic golden era suddenly flourished and seems to have withered away suddenly as well.
Jamil Ragep wrote an article on “When did Islamic science die? (And who cares?)” for the British Society for the History of Science. It’s a short read and covers the basics well. Some scholars in Islamic science attribute the decline of natural science in Islam to the shift in mindset caused by Al-Ghazali when he wrote about the classification of knowledge (sciences) and how religious science is superior to natural sciences (see In the Shadow of Modernity by Ahmad Dallal, the chapter on “On Decline” page 151, 152). Others argue that this decline is caused by the inherent characteristics of Islamic science itself (Dallal covers this briefly on the same pages).
Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam (by J. L. Berggren) is a good introductory book specifically for mathematics. It was a prescribed reading from an undergraduate course from the Islamic department of the university. The book goes over the different fields and theories of mathematics that were developed as well as the names of the mathematicians who developed them. The fields range from arithmetic to number theory and combinatorics.
An interesting fact about Islamic science is that it also actually contains the science of the Quran and Hadith and other forms of religious science. I am assuming you mean natural science in your question, so I won’t go into much details on religious sciences. If you are interested to learn more on the classification, I would advise Al-Ghazali’s The Revival of the Religious Sciences.
