IANAL If a lawyer abandoned you afterwards, depending on your written contract, you should bring this up to a new lawyer, file a motion regarding ineffectual respresenation in court (its possible that this issue is a part of the original matter instead of separate matter) and/or file a complaint with the bar association.
But this type of issue should best be handled by an attorney or if you can't afford one a public defender. You don't want to risk years in jail on representing yourself. Even with a copy of the transcript it may not be simple. Lawyer up since it sounds like no lawyer was involved in the first place.
While it's not a hard limit, it does make it harder afterwards. A error in the sentencing is within the courts power to correct at any time.
