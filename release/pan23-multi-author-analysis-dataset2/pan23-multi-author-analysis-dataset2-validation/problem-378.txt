I might get tarred and feathered for this but you should call your local police non-emergency line and ask them the process for surrendering firearms that were left by the previous tenant. You don’t have to identify yourself during the call and I know NYC has programs for no questions asked surrender of unwanted firearms. Sometimes they even have buyback events. I’d steer clear of going into too many details about the past issue with your uncle.
For anything that she doesn’t want to surrender, you’ll need to dig into local gun laws. I’m not familiar with NY but someone else linked to the NY gun subreddit. They may be able to help you.
I agree. The local police department will be glad to help you with this and no one will get in trouble.
You want to keep your grandpa in the dark about this, so have your sister call the police station, explain that these were found and you want to do the responsible thing, keep the specifics to a minimum, and arrange to bring everything (that she wants to get rid of) to the police station so the police don’t upset grandpa.
This is the correct process, however a quick consult with a criminal attorney would absolutely be in your grandparents favor as they could possibly be held criminally liable if this isn't handled properly. It would be well worth the money to surrender any illegal firearms, ammo, or other weapons through an attorney.
Personally, I wouldn’t keep any of them, especially a pistol grip custom modified sawed off double barrel shotgun. Give that to the police.
This - just talk to the police. Most jurisdictions will be happier to have you turn them in then anything else.
As for the others, you should be able to get a license and register them as historical weapons. Talk to a local dealer first - they might be most familiar with the process.
If op wants to spend their money on an attorney for peace of mind, there are much worse things to spend a couple hundred bucks on. I don’t think it’s necessary in this instance.
If they cared about the uncle then they absolutely should but as it is, they’re probably safe to save their money. Obviously if they are arrested, they can and should retain an attorney at that time.
Sure there is the (small) possibility they could be arrested but no one is interested in creating a precedent that responsible citizens safely turning in found guns, while following police instructions are held criminally liable for that.
