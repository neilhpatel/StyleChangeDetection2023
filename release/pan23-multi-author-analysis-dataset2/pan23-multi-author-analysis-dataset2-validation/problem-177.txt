and the US helps the young to be turned into mush by a drone strike and praises what they did as the right thing.... soooo everyone is guilty and you won't do a thing to fix it in the end....

I think you’ll find he was taken out of prison to fight. They get an offer of freedom if they fight - and survive - for a certain lenh of time.
My point still stands. There are differences, but they are not "entirely different". At least not to the same degree as what that other commenter was talking about: failing to prosecute versus decriminalizing. One is a failure of the justice system, the other is a society outright saying it's not a big deal. Or at least the people in government intended to represent that society feel that way.
I wouldn't say "entirely" different. Both determine the consequences, if any, of committing certain acts. If you decriminalize something, you will see more of it, and if you legalize it, you will see a lot more of it.
