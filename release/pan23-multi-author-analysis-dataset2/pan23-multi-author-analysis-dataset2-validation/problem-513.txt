What do the terms of your probation say? If they're testing you then it is likely they include no drug use.
This isn't up to your probation officer, it is up to the judge that put you on probation. You'll have to look into changing the terms of your probation, if that is even possible. Your best bet is to speak to a lawyer.
I have $13 in my bank account. I have absolutely no funds for a lawyer. The only paperwork I was given for my probation just relates to its lenh and the fact it's under HYDA. It doesn't say anything about the terms. All I know is what my probation officer told me over the phone.
OP, I’m not here to doubt what you’re telling us, but you PO and judge has likely heard similar stories 100x as an excuse to get high. Like u/squashedTarget said you will need an attorney. Beyond that: do you have legit medical documentation, from a legit Dr (not a pot doc) that this is the only treatment for your seizures outside of pure CBD? Your pediatrician recommended this at 11? This could all be very helpful in your case, but not a guarantee.
Many lawyers will do a free 30 min-1 hour consult, it wouldn't hurt to go check out a few lawyers for free and see what they have to say, and how much they charge.
Edit: by “pot doc” and “legit” I’m referring to my state (CA) where it’s absolutely a joke to get a med card through an MD that just prints these out all day for like $150. A judge would see right through this.
Yes I have life-long documentation of my epilepsy from 3 months old onwards. I was on several medications up until I was 11. None of them were very affective. When I was 11, I took part in an experimental study on using CBD on children with drug-resistant epilepsy. It was the only thing that ever worked for me. I've been taking it ever since. I've never seen any kind of "pot doc." All of my recommendations for CBD use have come from my family doctor. I've never even smoked actual weed.
I don't have an attorney, and there is absolutely no way I can afford one. I literally have $13 in my bank account, and my parents have told me in no uncertain terms I'm on my own with this. Also, I've told all of the above to my probation officer, and he says it doesn't matter.
