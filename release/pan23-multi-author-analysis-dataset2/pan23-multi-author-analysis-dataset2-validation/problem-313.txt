Agreeing to general terms of liability wouldn't necessarily protect the stadium in cases of gross negligence or criminal activity, but in general you are right. If OP could prove the sandwich was contaminated with rat poison or something, then they might have a course of action no matter what they agreed to when they bought the tickets, but if it's just a bad sandwich, you're completely right.
You're welcome to contact a personal injury lawyer, but it's hard to imagine how a baseball team or stadium would be at fault for you passing out and hitting your head. I think you would have a difficult time proving that the sandwich was directly responsible.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
even if it was, iâ€™m sure that you agree to some terms protecting the stadium when you buy your tickets. i doubt they would be held responsible even if you could reasonably prove the sandwich was what did it.
