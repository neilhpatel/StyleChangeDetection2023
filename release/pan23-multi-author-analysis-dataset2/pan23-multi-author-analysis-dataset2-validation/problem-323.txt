If you were 20 and they were 16 that is statutory rape. You should consult a criminal defence lawyer, not knowing their age is not a defence.
I have no idea how you got full custody but you also need to consult a family lawyer if you are charged to understand how that will effect your custody arrangement.
That it might not be statutory rape, because the 16 year old might (depending on the state) legally have sex with anyone of any age barring teachers or other people in positions of power. So the entire top half of your comment doesnâ€™t apply depending on state.
It's being charged in Louisiana but I've been living in Texas for two years. She is under supervised visits at the dro every other Saturday for an undetermined time if. she does right she can get supervised visit with me. But that's if she isn't charged with any crimes against me and my son. Wich I have press charges for assault and attempted kidnapping. On me and him and it's still in the process.we are trying to get it down to a misdemeanor and I am supposed to turn myself in. I am working on lowering the bond and hopefully get all the paperwork in order. I've just been a mess.
I'm trying to get a attorney right now. She was 16 I was 20 and she claimed during our custody case that there was two other possible fathers. So I had to take a DNA test. She said that on the record in court. She was accepting child support from two other people. Not surprised but he is mine. I can't deny that what was done was done. But I stayed because I knew he needed better. He deserves a better life and he's my world. She's posted on Facebook how great of a father I am in the past of pictures with me sleeping with him fully dressed. Even though she called CPS saying otherwise. She's called CPS on me multiple times for stuff that is easy to prove otherwise. She has stated that I was putting cigarettes out on him, locking him in the bedroom where he had to crap in the corner and throwing him scraps of food every once in a while, beating him, if you can imagine it she said it. I have records of her during an attempted kidnapping, child endangerment and assault and she has court on June the 8th.
She was 16 and I was 20 and all happened in rapides parish. But when rap hits parish was calling around asking about it they called her brother which also stated that she has blackmailed me and all sorts of stuff and they said that they were not going to pursue it. Now they're trying to pursue it in avoyles perish. I don't know if I'm being too specific but that's just one parish away. I swear this isn't a joke and I'm not reposting this. The mom and great grandma have so many arrest records and history with drugs and it's crazy. Also the great grandmother and her husband were first cousins. I just said that because I'm upset and figure somebody should know. They kept the baby mama on a bottle till she was 12 this came from her mouth. They took him to the doctor constantly for every single thing including ant bites.
