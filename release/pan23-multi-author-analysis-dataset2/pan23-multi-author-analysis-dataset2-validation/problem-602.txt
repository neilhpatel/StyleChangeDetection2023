Your first move should be to call the police in the town where your parents live and charge them with custodial interference. Secondly, I would get together with a Jag officer in your command and see if there is any way they can help you navigate between commands and the civilian police. Lastly, I would call whoever did your custody agreement and retain them to go after full custody with no visitation for your ex as she doesnt seem to care where your child is during her visitation periods and willfully abandoned the child with people who are unsuitable to care for the kid. Do not play nice in this situation. Be a bastard. This is your kid they are screwing with.
Just got off the phone with the local police. Sime how in the middle of the night or early today my son was driven to his mother's. I told them I wanted to press charges and they told me I need to contact the police locally (where I am) to do that. No one can tell me who took him, when he was taken, and how he got there.
In this situation, I had no idea how to fight back and felt defeated until I read your reply. I've contacted the local police and they said they're going to do a welfare check but didn't think they could charge my mother since this crosses multiple state lines. I've put in a message with my lawyer and have been in constant contact with her and my leadership.
Your accusation about custodial interference is what got the local PD to actually do the welfare check. If your parents refuse to produce the child, then it will escalate the case into a missing child situation. If they do produce your child for the police, then you have a location and can move to get him back. If the child is there, but in a dangerous situation, then child protection services will step in to remove your kid and return him to you. The simple welfare check has put a bunch of potential wheels in motion and all of them help you with your ultimate goal of getting your kid home safe and sound. Good luck, brother. This isnt an easy thing to go through. Please keep us informed about how this all works out.
No they definitely did not. I'm calling the MPs where she is at. Her chain of command was supposed to get back to me today and hasn't. Enough is enough.
You can ask them too, but you might get slow walked by them. You already have the MP's on it and you may need them to go back and start asking hard questions if your son is not home yet. I expect that the MPs will be right on top of this.
So did the police confirm that he was actually returned to his mother? That seems like cop work 90. Confirm the story they are being told. But on the other hand, I would also call the cops or MP's, whichever one is appropriate to conduct a.welfare check also.
Thank God you know where he is. Now it is time to to make to make sure it can never happen again. The only question that I have is why didn't the mother tell you that he was back with her? Thats some seriously cruel behaviour.
Anywho, the mother isn't the brightest and obviously is manipulative. But whom and I to say that since I'm the one with the flimsy child custody agreement.
What really hurts the most is that my own mother would withhold information. The dispicable thing is that I'm willing to bet if I called my mother phone and offered her cash for information she would probably do it.
I feel dirty and taken advantage of by my own ignorance, my lack of understanding of the law. I will never feel this way again or subject my son to this type of behavior.
It sucks when your own family will disrespect you and abuse you so. I had to finally write my father out of my life when he refused to meet his grandchildren after they were born for reasons he would never speak. I finally gave up because I couldn't play his game when it involved my kids.
I found out today my son isn't with his mother may be in Ohio again. Again, the mother is giving me elusive information, my son isn't picking up the phone and according to the parenting plan I have the right to unimpeded telephone conversations with my son at least twice a week at reasonable times for reasonable durations which haven't happen again.
Contacted the local PD will not charge grandmother or mom with custodial interference because technically mom is still in custody of the child until her six weeks is up, regardless of how I feel about the situation, mom is technically correct even though I have concerns with my parents being career drug users. There arguement is that it's not written in the parenting agreement that my son is to contact me or I am to be informed of any moves outside the state.
I also have a right to an itinerary which shall included his planned dates of departure and return, intended destinations, modes of travel and telephone number where he can be reached. You were supposed to provide this information to me in a reasonable time frame which hasn't happen a second time.
Now that you can finally unclench a little, you should document this entire episode from start to finish to the best of your ability so you have a record you can refer to rather than having to count on recall alone. Good luck. Please keep me updated how this whole mess plays out.
