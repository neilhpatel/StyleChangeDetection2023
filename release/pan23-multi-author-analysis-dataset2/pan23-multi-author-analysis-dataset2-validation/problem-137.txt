There is zero reason for an adult to be doing this. Start your own account at an entirely different bank or credit union, then transfer your money into it. This should have been done four years ago. You do not need a lawyer to open a bank account.
Legally this is shared money. You should withdraw your money as a bank/cashier's check and open an account a different bank. If it is still at the same bank then it can be messy.
What you're thinking is correct. Either one of you could completely drain the account there would be basically nothing the other person could do.
If you do decide to move your money to a different account, I'd suggest that it's at a completely different bank.
Yes, either one of you can legally withdraw all the money in that account. The other might be able to sue for "their" share of the money, but it would not be a crime for either party to withdraw it all.
You should withdraw your share of the money before your mother has the chance to do so, and open a new account at a different bank.
The bank may or may not allow you to remove her from the account, but you should be able to at least close it without her being present. If you leave the account open, you may be liable for overdraft or bounced check fees if she empties it in the future.
