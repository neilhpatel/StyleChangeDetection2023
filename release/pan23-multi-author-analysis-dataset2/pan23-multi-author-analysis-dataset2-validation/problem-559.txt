Yeah that’s the plan at the moment is to look into getting a fence. I don’t know where the parents live I only know the general apartment complex where they come from, but I’m going to see if I can figure that out and talk to the parents. If she were to get hit though what would happen?
That totally makes sense, but what about in the meantime? It’s going to be at least a few weeks before I can get a fence installed. I just don’t want to see her get hurt.
Make a temporary fence. get some 2x4s, drill out some holes and get some rope. Thread the rope through the holes and line you’re front yard with them.
If you do this, make sure to tie flags or something to the rope to make it plainly visible to kids on bikes. If it is hard to see, you could end up liable for their injuries.
You would more than likely have to take the kids parents to small claims courts to get your vet bills covered or god forbid costs to cremate and “replace” the dog. I would definitely get a temporary fence/barrier up until you can put a real one in if you choose to, and work on finding out who the parents are and speak to them no matter what you do.
