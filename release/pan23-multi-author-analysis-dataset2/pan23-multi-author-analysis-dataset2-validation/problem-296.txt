When someone (e.g., original owner) entrusts property (e.g., guitar) to a merchant who deals in that type of goods (e.g., pawn shop), the merchant can transfer good title to a third party (e.g., you). UCC ยง2-403(2)-(3). \[1\] This can happen by accident or on purpose and both happen all the time. By that rationale, title to the guitar is yours and no one can take it from you.
In this case, however, the pawn shop sold the guitar accidentally and is now liable to the former owner for the value of the guitar. And I mean the fair market value of the guitar, not just what they sold it for. That is probably why the store wants the guitar back, because the fair market value exceeds the price they sold it for. If you don't give the guitar back, they're on the hook for the difference.
The guitar was probably "forfeitable." That means that the pawn shop could legally sell it because the owner was behind on payments. That's baked into the contract between the pawn shop and the borrower.
In practice, a pawn shop might want to give the borrower a break, especially if the borrower has paid multiples of the initial loan.
I once had a guy who was almost a year behind on a musical instrument, but he had paid nearly 10x the initial borrow amount that the store was loathe to "pull" the instrument from the back and sell it. (I sort of wish we could have just returned it).
Within discovery in a legal proceeding, yes. However, the law views pawn shops like something akin to a bank, and that means that they can't legally disclose information concerning another borrower's loan to you.
IF the guitar was truly not forfeitable, as I believe the pawn shop owner told me on the phone, and they made an honest mistake in selling me the guitar, I would feel an ethical responsibility to return the guitar and would accept the owner's deal to bring it back.
IF the guitar was forfeitable, meaning either the original owner was behind on payments or the pawn shop owner is otherwise lying to me (due to realizing the guitar's higher value, allegiance to the original owner, or anything else) I would feel less ethical responsibility to bring the guitar back.
So my question to you is: is there any way that I can verify or ask the pawn shop owner to prove that the guitar was indeed not-forfeitable when he sold it to me?
I came to say pretty much the same thing about it being forfeitable. The guitar had a "voidable title," and upon selling it to you the pain shop created a good title for you as the owner of the guitar. It 8s not theft at all. The vender might have violated their contract with the pawnee, but it's still not theft. The vender is just responsible for damages, and only if the pawnee actually finished paying off their loan in the time explicitly allowed by the contract between the vender and the owner.
If you really feel an ethical duty, I'd recommend offering to sell it back for it's actual value. If it goes for $4000-5000, ask for that on top of the $2000 you paid for it. That would be fair because the venders error is technically costing you $4000-5000, plus the extra effort of the initial purchase and the return. And then if they don't go for that you can offer a compromise of $4000 ($2000 back for what you spent, and $2000 extra for the actual profit lost).
Even if the vender made an error, it's still not unethical to keep the guitar. You've already arranged some of your existence around the purchase. The purchase was fair and legal.
You can ask the vender for some sort of proof, but they have nothing definitive to offer. Contracts can be forged easily. The only real evidence would be from the courts or police.
Despite the relative simplicity of this comment, it's really helped me crystalize the issue in my mind. I have some peace of mind knowing that I legally hold a lot of leverage in the situation and am probably legally in the right.
Morally, I think it's important to me whether or not the pawn shop is being honest with me. If they are, and they legitimately messed up and sold a guitar they did not have the right to sell, I would probably bring it back. If the guitar was truly forfeitable and they regret selling it for whaterver reason (be it they found the value was higher than they sold it for, or the previous owner is upset with them for selling) I would feel less morally obligated to return it.
For it to be fair you either have to be compensated with a duplicate guitar (same model and same condition or better), or you have to get the full value of the guitar ($4000-5000). If you don't, then you come out behind.
