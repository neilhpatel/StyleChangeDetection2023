It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
Generally reviews are allowed to use references back to original work provided they use the "minimum necessary" amount of the original work.
While this sounds strict, it is normally interpreted fairly liberally - an example of a violation might be a review of a movie that shows the entirety of the movie footage with a short review appended to the end. An acceptable amount might be a series of several clips followed by individual critiques about the specific clips.
Ask yourself if your review actually covers the thing specifically referenced in those photos, or whether you're simply adding the photos as additional backdrop. While neither of these specifically make it proper or improper (there is an enormous amount of nuance), if it is the former it is generally easier to make your case that you only used the minimum amount necessary for your review.
