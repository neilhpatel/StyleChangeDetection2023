If you don’t have this discussed in the agreement, then you can discuss this when getting the permanent version. I would temper your demands as it’s unlikely to be granted a full background check of every single person he dates until the kid is 18.
It’s the new reality you’re going to have to face. You can’t control who’s around him during dads time. Just like he can’t control who you date. You can have reasonable conversations about your concerns. You’ll have much better success if you keep it to just know Who the kid is around vs her criminal record. Look at this if the shoe is on the other foot. Would you want him to dictate your love life? Have him approve when it’s appropriate to move in with the next significant other?
I hear you, and I understand. If he was just dating her, no problem. My kid shouldn't even know his dad is dating at this point imo. But he's moving into a strange woman's house!
If I was moving myself and his child in with a man I met on the internet last month, he would have called the damn police! I also would never make a decision like this. Children change what's appropriate to do in life. This isnt appropriate. I've dated, my son hasn't known.
You're going to have to get used to there's another person who can make decisions just like you can. You're not going to like everything, and for some important things like school/medical you can have your lawyer argue for final call.
That's certainly an opinion you're entitled to. There's no one right answer. And you have no idea how you'll react if you meet someone you know right away they're someone you want to spend the rest of your life with despite not knowing them. That type of thing exists.
