The attorney said nobody was injured, but you are clearly describing injuries. Have either of you been to see a doctor? It's much, much easier to negotiate with an insurance company about things like injury, pain, and therapy by being able to demonstrate actual loss and a need for care - which means having medical paperwork to back up your claims.
I recommend you go see a doctor about your injuries - and stop downplaying them to the people you talk to, whether it be the doctor, a lawyer, or the insurance companies. If you're anything like me (and let's face it, as women we get told this...), you "don't want to complain" or "don't want to cause problems" so you don't mention or severely under-represent what's actually afflicting you. People are going to take you at your word: if you say that you're fine and there's no injuries, that's going to be the truth going forward, and changing your story later doesn't look good.
And again: When you are talking to people be very very honest about your injuries and the amount of pain you're in.
The problem right now is that your negotiating position is weak. You say "I am still in pain and my son needs therapy" but all you have to back you up is your word, to the point where the attorney you called agreed with the insurance company - nobody is injured.
My son went to children’s hospital and was released that same day. He complained of little back pain but was jumping and running around once we arrived home. Should I go ahead and take my son to a therapist? I haven’t gone to any chiropractor or doctor. Financially, I can’t afford much atm.
I'd call around to other attorneys. Specifically, read reviews online, ask friends for recommendations, or contact your state bar for referrals. Don't go with the ambulance chasers you see on billboards. We can't recommend lawyers here, but even just google reviews are a good place to start.
