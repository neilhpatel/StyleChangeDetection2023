…Listen, if you want to emigrate to a new country, I think that’s great. Bring your culture, your food, your language and religion with you, that’s a wonderful thing.
My society ranks in the top 10 for gender equality in the EU, worry about your own patch. No one is being forced into religious marriages here my friend, but thanks for the “both sides” approach to this.
I’m not Catholic, so swing and a miss my friend, our country’s relationship with that church changed a lot when the abuse scandals broke.
having said all of that, if Catholics are forcing girls to marry against their will as a systematic abuse, I’ve missed that scandal. Choice whataboutism though!
But you know what? The bs that’s illegal in your new home, treating women like chattel? Leave it behind or go back to where that shit is acceptable. You can’t have it both ways, you can’t move to a new home to flee bad conditions, only to create those same conditions in your new home.
I shouldn't have to tell you this, but modern European countries are not identical copies of the USA. Your original response to u/WexfordHo is ridiculous because you clearly don't have an understanding of this situation in the context of Switzerland. You're just projecting your Amerocentric viewpoint.
