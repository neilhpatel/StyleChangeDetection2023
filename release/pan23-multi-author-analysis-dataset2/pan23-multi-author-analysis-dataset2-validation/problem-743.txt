If they cannot afford an attorney, they can be assigned one. Public defenders are as good as a birthday regular hired attorney.
There are three individuals involved and my family member isn't one of the bigger ones involved. So I don't know. We know for a fact that the crime wasn't committed so it is all confusing.
Public defenders are better than not having a lawyer at all. People give public defenders a bad rap, but often times they're more versed in criminal law than other attorneys because that's all they do and they do a lot of it. Having said that, they are constrained because of their massive work load. You don't get the individual attention you would receive when you pay an attorney to do so privately. Their defense of you can be just as effective but there are some aspects that you have to be more proactive about than say a private attorney. Like compiling evidence to prove your innocence. A PD isn't going to hold your hand through that process and follow up behind you to find it. They may have an investigator in their office that can help but that part is largely on you. When you pay for a private attorney, they can hire a PI and bill you for the cost of it. A PD doesn't get that option.
