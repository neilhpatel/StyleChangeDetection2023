The item was sent to the OP and delivered into the hands of someone who signed for it as (in essence) OP's agent. At that point surely the shipper and the seller have done all that they are duty bound to do, given they have no means of finding OP and putting the package in his hands personally (seeing as OP chose to live somewhere with this kind of front desk system).
The seller and/or shipping company may also be able to put pressure on the apartment complex that OP would not be able to. For example, they may not be willing to deliver packages to the complex if there is a high risk of theft.
This is ultimately an agency problem. Was the front desk authorized to accept delivery on OP's behalf? Even if the front desk is not OP's actual agent, could the seller rely on apparent agency? Did the seller and/or shipper complete performance by delivering the product to OP's agent? Or was the front desk acting as an agent of the shipping company to complete delivery?
It's also a customer service issue. The seller and/or shipping company may be willing to eat the loss to keep OP a happy customer.
The seller’s responsibility is to deliver it to the shipping address which presumably includes an apartment number. That didn’t happen. It was delivered elsewhere. It doesn’t matter if that elsewhere is 40 feet away or 40 miles.
That’s due to a choice the seller made when contracting with the shipper. That’s beyond the control and responsibility of the buyer. You are correct in that the shipper isn’t liable in this case because the contract between the seller and the shipper includes indemnity from the seller.
The buyer may have agreed to use the apartment management company as their agent and to indemnify them in their lease; if so, then it’s on the buyer.
We already have a quality contributor saying essentially the same thing a few comments up in the same thread. /u/ohio_redditor please correct me if I’m misunderstanding your statement.
For anyone else who doubts me, I invite you to google “is the buyer or seller responsible for a lost package.”.
As someone that actually works for FedEx, you are incorrect UNLESS the package is a Direct Signature (DSR), Adult Signature (ASR), or if the shipper has their account set for No Redirect, IE being rerouted to Walgreens/Walmart etc.
We (the couriers) are able to deliver packages, especially in Apartment/condos, to the leasing office or whatever, there is an option in our devices to select Indirect Delivery, this is common for Leasing Offices with different address in the complex etc. When shippers use us to ship its in the contract agreements when they use us to ship.
How could a contract from which the buyer is not a party assign responsibility to the buyer? It can’t. The buyer isn’t even allowed to view that contract without consent of either the shipper or seller.
In this case, the seller chose to accept certain risks to save the seller money. When those risks are realized, it’s on the seller.
That depends on who made the agreement with the building manager. If the buyer did, then it’s on the buyer. If the buyer didn’t, then that agreement was made between the shipper and building management and thus the responsibility rolls up to the seller.
Absent an agreement between the buyer and the building management, this is akin to the shipper leaving the package with anyone other than the buyer. Neither the existence of another, unrelated agreement (lease) between the building manager and the buyer nor the buyers physical proximity to the building manager are relevant.
The seller subcontracts their responsibility for shipping to the shipper, but ultimately, it’s the sellers responsibility.
The seller has a responsibility to the buyer to deliver the package. The buyer paid the seller. How the seller accomplishes that is of no concern to the buyer. When the seller hired the shipping company, the shipping company then had a responsibility to the seller. When the shipping company crated a bailment with the building management, the building management then had a responsibility to the shipping company. If the lease contains a indemnification clause for packages (as would not be uncommon), then the buyer assumes building managements liability for the lost package to the shipping company, which ultimately puts the liability totally on the buyer.
