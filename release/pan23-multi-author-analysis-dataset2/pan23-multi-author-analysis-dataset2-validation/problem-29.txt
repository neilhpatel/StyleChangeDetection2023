Call your insurance and let them know what's going on. They'll probably take care of it. If the provider is out of network your insurance might decide not to get involved, in which case the provider will probably send the debt to collections and you'll have to dispute it like any other invalid debt.
Similar questions get asked a lot on this subreddit and the generic answer they tend to get is "if insurance doesn't pay for it you're liable for the bill hurf durf." Since someone will eventually come in here saying that and it will get upvoted to the top (since it always does), its wrong and here's why:
Whether or not balance billing the patient for the unpaid amount is legal is something that varies from state to state, and federal laws also come into play. There are also clauses in many insurance-provider contracts that forbid providers from balance billing the patient under certain circumstances, including timely filing. If I were you, I would contact my insurance provider first to determine if such clauses exist in the contract they have with the provider, in my opinion. They may then reach out on your behalf to the provider and quash the charges. If insurance doesn't have such a clause, then it is likely time to talk to an attorney licensed in your state.
1) If the provider is in network then their contract with your insurer requires them to bill within a certain time period. If they don't then the bill becomes invalid.
2) If the provider is out of network then there isn't a contract specifying how long they have before submitting a bill to your insurance. However, in a contract dispute (which this is) the provider still has a duty to mitigate their damages. That means that the need to submit the bill to your insurance within a reasonable amount of time.
11 months is outside the time period that insurance companies generally set for submitting a bill. In other words, they waited an unreasonable amount of time to submit the bill. Because they waited so long they failed to mitigate their damages. Had they mitigated, their damages would have been $0 and that's ultimately what you're responsible for.
You need to contact your old employers insirance provider you had. Let them sort it out as that's what you paid them for. Just keep documentation.
