I would talk to, and probably hire, a criminal lawyer. Seriously. There are a lot of ways this can play out. You’ll want someone who can help you navigate the process. You can provide an anonymous tip. You might be able to have the lawyer turn in the evidence for you. Your lawyer might encourage you to take the evidence to the police directly and show them the specific files you are concerned about (so that they meet the private search exception to the Fourth Amendment).
But, because you are concerned about it being twisted on you, it’s important that you speak to a lawyer. Not saying you’ll get blowback, and you probably won’t, but it is worth being cautious.
Call one up, ask if they do free consultations, and go from there. Lawyers are humans, and they know not everyone is going to be able pay. Be open and honest with them. They may work out a payment plan for after your divorce. Ask if they know any family lawyers you will do the same as well. You aren't the first person who is in a situation like this.
If you need help for yourself, I’d suggest talking to the family services office on base, a chaplain (100% confidential), or Military One Source. There are a variety of services that can help you get on your feet.
Thank you. To update, I did not confront him. I called the MP's who upon investigation have turned it over to CPS and the federal crime scene unit.
