Yes they can sue. In some places they could sue for pain and suffering, but I don't see that in Mississippi law at first glance. But whatever happens, let your insurance handle it.
Mississippi is an ordinary "at fault" auto insurance state, unlike MI or FL which both have some type of "no fault" insurance where your own insurance always pays for your own damages.
Because you have liability insurance, your insurer would defend you in that lawsuit, up to offering to settle for the maximum amount of your policy.
Some states have a "no pay, no play" rule where an uninsured driver can't collect some kinds of damages (usually pain and suffering damages associated with personal injury). But that usually wouldn't apply to an ordinary low-speed collision and related property damage.
Missouri and Louisiana have similar harsh and regressive "no pay, no play" laws that apply to actual economic damages. that has such laws only applies them to non-economic "pain and suffering" damages, with NJ (injury only NP/NP) and Michigan (No-Fault PD) and Florida (vetoed this summer by DeSantis) being special and specific.
