To give a bit of general backgrounding first, it is important to treat the Qing, particularly the early Qing (but still also the rest of it), not as another iteration in a long succession of Chinese states, but as an Inner Asian state with consequently Inner Asian political traditions. One key thing to consider is that Inner Asian polities were broadly less concerned with an unbroken chain of patrilineal rulers, and more with the overall integrity of the ruling clan. The Shunzhi Emperor's eligibility to rule did not derive from being the son of Hong Taiji, but rather from being the grandson of Nurgaci; his being the son of Hong Taiji was simply one of the main reasons his candidacy was particularly preferable. We can say the same for the Kangxi Emperor, and indeed all further successors. When the Tongzhi Emperor died childless in 1875, the Dowager Empresses Cixi and Ci'an simply cast their net across the Aisin Gioro clan to find a successor, rather than going by the European primogeniture approach of tracing up the prior line of succession and then back down to a successor-by-default.
Which leads to an important point, which is the practice of designating imperial heirs. Being the eldest son of the emperor was not an automatic qualifier for becoming the heir apparent, although typically only the emperor's sons were expected to be in the running (much to the consternation of the Qianlong Emperor, who seems not to have liked any of his four surviving sons very much by the time of his abdication in 1796). The reigning emperor reserved the right to select which of his sons would succeed him, if he indeed made such a choice – two emperors, Hong Taiji and the Kangxi Emperor, did not – as an outgrowth of traditional Inner Asian practices whereby election or civil war would be used to determine which of the eligible successors to the mantle of leadership would finally succeed. As such, under normal circumstances a would-be ruler was someone who had already proven themselves worthy for the role, something that naturally ensured significant continuity of agenda and of imperial authority across reigns.
In the event, however, that there was no heir at the age of majority, that doesn't mean the imperial line was compromised. As noted, what mattered was not the direct line of succession, but the overall integrity of the ruling clan – or, indeed, in a conquest context, the ruling people. Although none of Oboi, Sonin, Ebilun, and Suksaha were from the Aisin Gioro clan, they were all Manchus, and so owed their power, their status, and their very identity to the Aisin Gioro clan heads; they also recognised that the basis of power would lie in the continuity of Manchu structures of rule, and for the time being that included Nurgaci's bloodline remaining on the throne. While that did not preclude them from seeking to aggrandise themselves within the Aisin Gioro ruling structure, their interest was not in seeking to fundamentally destabilise Manchu rule.
So then we move to the particular circumstances of the two successions. Firstly, why did the Shunzhi Emperor succeed Hong Taiji in 1643? The answer is actually quite simple: the succession was being disputed between Hong Taiji's younger brother Dorgon, and his eldest son Hooge. The basic issue had been that while Dorgon actively favoured the mantle of rulership passing to one of Hong Taiji's sons, he opposed the selection of the highly prominent Hooge. The selection of Fulin to become the Shunzhi Emperor, done by a deliberative assembly of the Manchu nobility, was a compromise between the general agreement that a son of Hong Taiji ought to succeed, and a placation of Dorgon to prevent an outright civil war between him and Hooge, by placing a much weaker son on the throne with a dual regency of Dorgon and Jirgalang (one of Nurgaci's nephews). Fortuitously for the Shunzhi Emperor, Dorgon's death in a hunting accident in 1650 prevented a dispute between a full-majority emperor and his regent, as Dorgon's clique, ironically unprepared for a sudden death without a succession, cashiered their only other viable candidate, Ajige, fatally weakening the regency and allowing the Shunzhi Emperor to assume full power soon after.
As for the Kangxi Emperor, again his accession resulted from the sudden death of a young predecessor, the Shunzhi Emperor having died of smallpox – or, quite possibly, assassination – at the age of 22. The ascendancy of Oboi (of the Gūwalgiya), Sonin (Hešeri), Ebilun (Niohuru), and Suksaha (Nara) can be understood as an attempt by the great Manchu clans to retaliate against the consolidation under the Aisin Gioros that had been achieved under Nurgaci and Hong Taiji, as well as the conciliation to Han Chinese interests held by the Shunzhi Emperor, which was seen as having compromised the integrity of Manchu authority within the empire. The supposed 'will' of the emperor, a blatant forgery by the four regents-to-be, denounced the late emperor's behaviour, designated a successor, and appointed those said regents, who went on to remove the old emperor's favourites and several of the institutions he had established within the Han bureaucratic system, while expanding Manchu entities such as the Imperial Household Department, the Department of Colonial Affairs, and the Deliberative Council of Princes and High Officials.
The selection of Hiowan Yei (Xuanye) as the successor to the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661 had more or less three principal causes: firstly, his mother was a Manchu (much of the rest of the Shunzhi Emperor's issue had Chinese mothers); secondly, he had survived smallpox in childhood and would be unlikely to die like his father had; thirdly, as an otherwise unfavoured son, he had no particular power or any powerful backers. It would be due to infighting among the regents themselves, as well as the effective intervention of the Kangxi Emperor's grandmother (Dowager Empress Xiaozhuang of the Bumbutai clan), that the regency collapsed. Xiaozhuang masterminded a plan to effectively ally with Sonin against Oboi, by having the young Kangxi Emperor marry the daughter of Sonin's eldest son, the imperial chamberlain Gabula, sowing distrust between Sonin and the other regents. Although Sonin died of illness on 12 August 1667, the damage to the regency had been done, and the Kangxi Emperor assumed personal rule on 25 August, Suksaha retiring two days later. A week after that, an inquest began into Suksaha's activities that concluded in the execution of himself and his eldest son, along with many of his family members, the enslavement of many others, and the demotion of many of Suksaha's supporters in the army. A political contest over the course of the next two years, much of which hinged on Oboi's attempts to discredit the Jesuit astronomers at the capital, concluded in the Kangxi Emperor deposing and imprisonig Oboi in 1669, while Ebilun was given a commuted death sentence and quietly shuffled into the background.
It is worth noting that neither succession conflict interfered with the Qing conquest of China by very much at all. The initial thrust into China in 1644 took place after Dorgon had secured his power; the Kangxi Emperor's accession was roughly contemporary with the rounding up of the last Southern Ming claimants in 1661, and the regency crisis had resolved well before the opening salvoes of the Three Feudatories revolt in 1673. To some extent this was just fortunate timing of course, but still, the regency struggles just did not happen at the right time to get in the way of the critical phases of Qing expansion and conquest.
A follow up question: I'm reading more about Shunzhi in wikipedia, and in the page, and there is a quote from the Cambridge History of China (The Shun-Chih Reign) that says:
I'm curious, what metrics do historians use to judge imperial dynasties (Chinese/non-Chinese)? What specifically do they mean an "imperial edifice of awesome proportion?" Imperial consolidation has happened multiple times in Chinese history, what made the Qing so unique?
What specifically did the Qing do to garner such high praise, like "one of the most successful imperial states the world has known." When compared to other imperial states throughout history (e.g., Rome, Persian empires, Muslim Caliphates). Even within China itself, the Tang/Ming dynasties lasted longer in China for example.
Wakeman did subscribe to the idea of the Qing as an iteration in Chinese history so this point doesn't help contextualise his own position, but it is worth noting that the Qing ought to be understood as in at least some part discontinuous from prior state formations in China owing to their compound Inner Asian origins and priorities. Unlike the Tang, whose ruling family practiced their nomadic traditions in private, the Qing had quite a public Inner Asian image in many respects, even if many of the traditions they associated with that identity were in fact inventions of the eighteenth century. The Qing may not have lasted as long in China (the Qing in China were around for 268 years, compared to 276 for the Ming (well, 292 if you count the Southern Ming) and 289 for the Tang), but only by a couple of decades, and they built an empire whose foundations have proved far more lasting, for better or for worse – well, to be precise, largely for worse.
Why were the Qing so successful at consolidating rule in such far-flung places where older Chinese dynasties failed? (Sorry for taking up so much of your time, but thanks again for answering so many of my questions! I swear to god this is my last question.).
What are some of the reasons you say this? Is it related to the modern-day policy towards Xinjing? Is it related to Qing-era suppression/genocide of the Dzunghars?
Is this an Inner Asian custom? I recall reading about a bunch of shenanigans like that in the Han, Tang, and Song dynasties. If I recall, they tried for a more strict primogeniture in the Ming, but that broke down pretty quickly.
