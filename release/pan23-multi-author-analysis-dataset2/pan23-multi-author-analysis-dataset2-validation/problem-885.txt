The article seems to be comparing tank warfare from 1917 and the 1940s to modern tank warfare. Theyâ€™re hardly the same. M1s and Leopards are amazingly advanced and possess HEAVY firepower, as well as HEAVY armor. They will breakdown and need maintenance, yes, but they could also create a major turning point for Ukraine.
And as a country that was heavily vibing through the Hussite wars I highly recommend using discarded tanks as barrier/wall.
His tactics involving static tanks ceased being effective when Allied forces started shelling them with artillery. Static weapon platforms are even more easily targeted and destroyed in modern warfare, so the problem more prevalent now.
I remember when we were being taught about Rommel tactics in Afrikakorps. He took old shitty tanks provided by Reich and burried them in the sand as stationary cannons. Skilled commander can make use of stick to fight an army. And since they are "old" tech, they can freely dispose of them since western world is on its way to upgrade their arsenal.
Western tanks offer higher survivability for their crews and can be rapidly refit or stripped thanks to their modular designs. They are also much less likely to be destroyed beyond usability thanks to features like blow-out panels.
Static vehicles are just a death trap, it's not like a trench with soldiers dotted along a wide area, a single hit can end the thing.
Would have been better if NATO countries had agreed ahead and standardize one tank to simplify logistics but ended up sending hodgepodge of tanks complicating logistic and maintenance for Ukraine.
