Yes you are right, extended stay hotel. Each unit has its own set of breakers in the electrical panels. The breakers for this unit are popped, they short immediately when reset. I know not to hold them on incase there is an active short, fist thing my dad taught me about electrical panels. I think as long as we keep that breaker off it should be OK, I'm going to have the electrician give it all a once over next week. Just don't know if this guy will let us in to fix the short, if not the breaker just stays off.
Cool so show up with an electrician and if they turn me away or refuse reasonable access I'm in the clear or it gets fixed. I guess they will have to live in the dark until the electrician can come out next week since they refused the hotel.
It sounds like this is a multi-unit building (since it's a studio, and...well, there aren't many free-standing studios). So it seems that makes this a safety issue for ALL your tenants. A short in one part of a building can cause problems in other areas of the building. To say nothing of the fact that SOMETHING is going on electrically in the studio, which could lead to a fire, which puts EVERYONE in the building at risk (as well as any pets, and all belongings of all tenants). Sure, everyone ought to have renter's insurance, but as the owner/manager, won't you bear a substantial liability if something happens? (NAL).
