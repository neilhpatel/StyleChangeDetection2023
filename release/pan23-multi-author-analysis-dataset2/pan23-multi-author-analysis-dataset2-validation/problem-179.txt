You'll likely also be on the hook for part of June if you give notice now, while your original lease is still active. 60 days would carry you to June 23, and you'd have to pay for that time, pro-treated against the month to month rate.
If you're only required to give 30 days under the month to month arrangement, wait until that becomes effective the day after lease expiration and give your written notice then. Do this by email as well a sending a physical letter via certified mail so you have proof of delivery.
Edit to add: Alternately, you could send notice now expressing your intent to let the lease expire and then vacate at the end of the May month to month term. This would address both items in the lease.
So wait until April 28th to send the email? Then they'll only have me for 30 days right? Also while it wasn't written the property manager said she remembers our conversation where I gave verbal notice, does that matter at all?
Mainly with question 1, it seems like they should give you an opportunity to reject the new lease terms (rent increase) before they are automatically accepted.
I'm not sure exactly when the notice of the rent increase was but it was a couple months ago. And it was through a note taped to my door. As for the rent increase, if I remember right my base rent is normally 986 and then extras like pet rent, washer and dryer, trash etc ends up being 1086 and the month to month rent is 1300 something. I no longer have that note unfortunately. The lease says it automatically converts to month to month if I didn't give 60 days written notice. I spoke to them verbally and told them I was moving on February 4th. I did not send an email or text, which is where my mistake is.
