Like, there’s audio, of him threatening a state official to falsify election results. It’s REALLY clear cut. He doesn’t say it like “I think there is fraud so I want you to recount and that should tip the scales.” He literally says “find me exactly 11,780 votes, which is exactly how many I need to win.” 11,780, exactly. Just say I got this many, and if you don’t then I will expose you.
This is kind of flying under the radar this morning. We will see a charging decision reached on Trump very soon - in what could be the best criminal case against him.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Yes, hopefully. I imagine the House Committee report will be very valuable in proving Trump's mindset.
Unfortunately it's less clear cut, legally, than it seems. Technically his words do say something more like your first statement: his defense will argue that he said he believed there were hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes, and he just wanted Raffensberger to find enough of them to prove the election was "stolen" from him.
Of course we all know what he really meant, but the burden of proof is on the prosecutors to demonstrate that he meant something different than what he said. Proving intent is a requirement for the Georgia law, so if Trump's defense can convince part of a jury that Trump really believed there were 11,780+ fraudulent/fraudulently discarded votes, then they can argue that he did not willfully pressure Raffensberger to commit election fraud, but merely to investigate it.
I wouldn't want to be the prosecutor who has to prove Donald Trump didn't believe a crazy conspiracy theory.
That said, the House Committee report mostly demonstrates that a lot of people told him the conspiracy theories were false. It doesn't necessarily prove he believed them. And it doesn't address what his defense will undoubtedly address: that there were just as many people feeding him false conspiracy theories as there were telling him they were false. If the case comes down to whether he believed the people telling him what he wanted to hear, or the people telling him he was a loser...
I do think the House Committee report--and presumably the Georgia grand jury findings--has enough to convince any reasonable jury that Trump knew he was lying, and therefore knew he was pressuring Raffensberger to commit a felony. So I'm cautiously optimistic. But I can't be 100% confident about any case that rides on proving Trump believed a reasonable thing over a crazy thing.
But this one is open and shut, has documented criminal intent, testimony from the governor, Secretary of State, State Congress members, Trump’s own lawyers, and a dozen others - and GA state charges are particularly unfavorable for Trump’s actions.
Pardons in GA don't work like a Presidential blanket-pardon would (a la Nixon), or even some other states.
They aren't granted by the Governor, but rather decided by the Board of Paroles and Pardons, and only after a sentence has been served.
They are both damning cases, but the main piece of evidence is the Raffensperger call, which is an hour of smoking-gun evidence and a Secretary of State potentially testifying against him - and the GA case also involves the correspondences of John Eastman, who is central to the fake electors scheme and conspiracy charges.
Also, a state prosecution may be easier than federal in several ways - less worries about executive privilege claims. The GA governor can't pardon Trump, and more.
The documents case is more complex than it seems, too. Reality Winner was convicted for transmitting a classified document by mailing it to a newspaper, not just for having it (I think she had clearance to have the document anyway). She was charged because they could prove the document was printed on her personal printer.
If Trump has given/sent/transmitted any of these documents to an unauthorized party, that is not something we're aware of at this time, and it's not something he'd be likely to do personally. Motherfucker doesn't know how to use a printer. If I were the DOJ it would be my highest priority to determine whether these documents have fallen into adversarial hands, and I wouldn't want to blow my load by going through discovery to charge a lesser law of merely possessing the documents.
Part of clause (d) involves failure to return mishandled documents on demand. I think they can get him on that, because they gave him plenty of time to return the documents, and when he finally did, they had surveillance footage of his staff hiding the rest of it. If it weren't for the DOJ taking time and patience to do it right, Trump's lawyers could argue that the law doesn't define the timeline for "on demand," and that he was merely delayed, not refusing, on returning the documents, due to the sheer number and the complications involved in hiring staff to sift through top secret materials. That's a lot harder for them to argue because of the methodical way the DOJ approached it.
They could get him on clause (f), which is basically that he allowed the documents to be mishandled through gross negligence. But this is the most softball charge of the bunch, and could potentially result in no more than a fine. If the DOJ is investigating full fledged espionage charges, they're not going to prematurely prosecute a lesser charge that would involve revealing their sources and investigative methods, giving everybody involved the info they need to cover up their crimes.
Fani Willis still ultimately has to make a decision whether or not to pursue an indictment at a regular grand jury. She can even do so if the special grand jury doesn't recommend anything.
Right, that's how the special grand jury operates. They issue a final report and recommendations. It's noteworthy that the investigation is essentially over now and Fani Willis can make a decision on whether to seek charges from a regular grand jury, which won't take long.
Most of the serious charges that could apply to Trump under 18 U.S.C. Section 793: Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information require either: proof of his intention to use the documents to harm the US, or proof that he transmitted the documents to someone unauthorized. There are also potential complications if he was still POTUS when he ordered the documents taken: he can't be convicted of the laws regarding taking them illegally if it wasn't illegal when the taking took place. And another long-shot complication is that his defense could potentially argue that the law explicitly excludes the POTUS, because some of the laws he could be charged with involve failure to notify a superior officer of the document mishandling.
Not long - the evidence has already been gathered and would only need to be presented to a regular grand jury for a majority-vote on a charging decision. Could be a matter of weeks.
