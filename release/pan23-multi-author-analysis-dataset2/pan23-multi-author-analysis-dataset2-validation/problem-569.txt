How would I know? I have to wait until I go home, I thought on the paper it made it seem like I could either pleas guilty or not guilty, I am pretty sure on the paper it said if pleasing guilty I can pay the fine on the paper and sign that I am guilty and not have to go to court is how I took it, but maybe I'm wrong.
I skimmed over it before I had to go to work and I know it had a cut out slip where I can pleas guilty and pay the fine I think? I'd have to go back home and see it. I'm not worried about paying the money, I'm worried if I'm going to get screwed by it being something criminal.
You should consult an attorney that practices traffic/criminal law. There is going to be more than a fine if you are convicted of 36 over. You risk license suspension also. PennDOT will take departmental action against your license if you accumulate 6 points for this ticket.
I'm at work so don't have the paper, all I know is the fine was def under $300 and was something like $250-$290.
That's dirt cheap for that speed, at least in most states. Can you confirm what the statute you were charged under is, and that it's not a type of criminal speeding?
It definitely said on the paper that I can pay it online and pleas guilty that way instead of going before a judge.
