NJG Pounds' An Economic History of Medieval Europe and The Fontana Economic History of Europe: The Middle Ages ed. by Carlo M. Cipolla are the two best introductions to the medieval economy after the 11th century, and I'd suggest taking them together. Pounds covers the whole period, from Late Antiquity to the Late Medieval period (although anything before the 11th century is very dated now), while Fontana's offering focuses almost exclusively on the 11th-15th centuries. Both works cover areas that the other doesn't focus on to any great degree or else offer a different perspective, and both are still reasonably solid.
A more recent offering is Steven A. Epstein's An Economic and Social History of Later Medieval Europe which is, admittedly, more up to date for the period between 1000 and 1500, but it's half the lenh of either of the older offerings and the basic scholarship underpinning the earlier two books has not changed significantly for the second half of the Middle Ages.
"Women Waging Law in Elizabethan England" by Tim Stretton (2005) would be an interesting one for Early Modern England. Also Pauline Croft and Linda Levy Peck have a lot of great articles about that period.
If you want medieval economics rather than economic history, there's Diane Wood, Medieval Economic Thought. It's the Cambridge Medieval Textbooks etnry on the matter, so it's comprehensive and foundational, though a little dry.
I’m interested in reading about energy in past societies, or some sort of civilizational metabolism I guess. I’m interested in climate change and renewable energy transitions today, and I recently read Andreas Malm’s Fossil Capital. I enjoyed it, and I’d like to dig more into some of the historical background touched on. Things like examination of the energetic basis of societies and the natural limits faced.
Also "Women Waging Law in Elizabethan England" by Tim Stretton (2005) is a very thorough look at a lesser known aspect of history; women litigants in patriarchal culture.
