Good morning friends! I see we have our daily tire fire of off-topic comments and very strange guesses about the intersection of gifts and law and family, so I think it best I drag out the firehose-slash-lock-button now. OP, I sincerely apologize that I need to close your thread down now, but it appears we have given all of the helpful advice we are able to responsibly give in this medium, but the drive-by commenters from /all or /popular are getting pretty far into imaginationland and general shitposting that it's becoming too much work to moderate, and distracts too much from your actual legal question. Best of luck.
Then I do. Always, if unresolved by then. I will never make such a statement unless I do intend to follow through.
Protip: People who say "I am going to sue you" never do, the people who do, do so by serving lawsuits.
Go ahead and get a few names of the types of lawyers recommended in other comments here, but I wouldn't spend money on them until you are actually sued.
It is very cheap and easy to threaten to sue, not so inexpensive to actually do so. In general, the vast majority of threats never materialize into lawsuits. Most because people were never serious about suing in the first place, and many other because when they actually sat down with a lawyer they found that their case was weak or the cost was too high.
I think the difference between a respectable attorney who cares about their rep and most of the general public is that we follow through.
