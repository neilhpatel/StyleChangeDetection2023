You can request a charge back. Whether or not that is successful isnt a legal question it just depends on the card company policy. The camera company could then choose to sell the debt to a collection agency. The validity of that debt will depend on the terms you agreed to by purchasing the camera. I would expect based on most retailers terms of service you likely would be liable for the GoPro cost if it is never returned but would be able to argue the cost of the upgraded shipping.. but if we're to look at this practically.. you're not going to be successful there. Ultimately if you do the charge back you should be at peace with the fact that you may have a collections account on your credit at some point in the future. The least headache inducing option is to get a friend to pick up the package and return it.
A successful charge back does not mean you are not liable for a debt. If you tell your card company you paid for a GoPro you never received they can say ok cool goods/services not rendered and pull the money back. But then the GoPro company can say well actually see here in these terms and services that you agreed to when you bought the GoPro it says we're not liable to any shipping delay except for the cost of upgraded shipping and you still were sent a GoPro to the address that you listed and we never got it back. And then the debt goes to collections and you're not able to dispute it because they did send you a GoPro and they have proof they sent you the GoPro.
I do see what you’re saying. I guess I’d have to check what their terms actually say. It just seems like this isn’t a “shipping delay” caused by a third party or some unforeseen circumstances. It was a direct result of a contracted service not rendered.
Thanks for the context. How does that work, they can send it as a debt to collections? Is a successful chargeback not a successful argument that agreed goods/services are not rendered?
At the end of the chat, they were trying to claim it was delayed because the memory card it came with was it out of stock—after we had already established it had been shipped out on time, and it was shipped using the wrong method. I wondered if that was some precursor to him telling me the delay was within their terms..because it was due to an item being out of stock, rather than their negligence.
Edit: I did read their terms and shipping policy. Really, the only thing they say that mnight be applicable in this situation is that the shipping times are estimates based on the service (ie ground vs 2nd day air) that you select at checkout. Naturally, nothing about when they ship it using the wrong service. I know it sounds a bit ridiculous, but I think I have a right to complain here.
But what am I supposed to do? Send them another $425 to buy a camera and add on next day air? In the hope they don’t screw up the second time? And the hope I can recoup the original $400?
I did not edit the post, it was in there originally. I also did not delete the reply, I just added to it.
Edit: sorry, not trying to be rude or short. I’m just a bit high strung, because I’ve been talking in circles with these people for hours.
