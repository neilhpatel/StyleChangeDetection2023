I don't know whether an answer of this nature is accepted, so please feel free to remove it if it is off-topic, but I feel that more people should know about Manuela Saenz, a legendary and brave South American woman who led an exceptional life that ended on a tragic note.
Manuela Saenz is one of the national heroes of Ecuador. Born in Quito, in 1795, she was barely a teenager when a revolutionary wave swept the continent, starting at Quito itself. There, a group of notable people, including the equally interesting Manuela Cañizares, declared the formation of a Junta that would rule in the name of Fernando VII, recently deposed by Napoleon. The Junta was broken and its members arrested; one year later, they would be massacred.
The most dramatic episode in Manuela's life was when she stopped one of the various plots to assassinate Bolivar. In a desperate attempt to stop the dissolution of Gran Colombia, Bolivar declared himself Dictator, despite the fact that any political or social support for the union had already disappeared. A group of men, believing that tranquility, democracy and independence would not be achieved until Bolivar died, started a conspiration which finally took place in September - hence, "Conspiración Septembrina.".
Saenz did not take part in this events. As a creole lady, that is, white people born in the Spanish colonies, she received a through but strict education. In 1815, even as Venezuela was engulfed in bloodshed, Quito remained in peace under Royalist rule. Apparently seduced by a Spanish officer, she fled the convent where she was being educated. In 1817, she married an English merchant, Thorne, but never really loved him. They moved to Lima, Peru, just in time for San Martin's Patriot army to invade and take the city.
Saenz, affectionately called "Manuelita" by most, was known for being a free-spirit, who spoke up and was not secretive about her patriot sympathies, something that horrified the conservative societies of Quito and Lima. During San Martin's brief rule, she acted as a good patriot and earned the appreciations and high stem of the Argentinian, who even condecorated her. In 1822 she returned to Quito, leaving her husband behind, just in time to receive another liberator, this time El Libertador in the flesh, Simon Bolivar.
After a grueling campaign against the Royalist insurgency in Pasto, Bolivar had finally triumphantly entered Quito. The city had actually been taken by his second in command, the future Marshall Sucre, but most of the big celebrations were held in Bolivar's honor. They met in one of this galas, and started a love affair.
It seems like one out of a romance: Bolivar had been married only once, and the death of that wife had profoundly affected him and perhaps led him to the path of being a patriot. He had had numerous mistresses, but he never had really loved anyone again. Manuelita was married to a man whom she didn't love as a result of the strict, paternalistic system of the age. A system she often challenged openly. And now here comes the man who was bringing down that system. They fell madly in love, and spend several idyllic days together, until duty called for Bolivar.
Even as Bolivar's health and dreams crumbled around him, Manuela Saenz remained a constant presence in his life and a loyal supporter, sometimes against his wishes. He adored her, but she scandalized the people of high society with her opinionated and spirited behaviour. She rode around town in men's clothes, lived with Bolivar while in Lima despite the fact that her husband was in the same city not far away, tried to poke her nose in politics such as the legendary and bitter conflict between Bolivar and his vice-president, Santander. When Colombian troops in Lima mutinied, she went down in person with a pistol to try and quell this revolt.
More than thirty men forced their way into the Presidential Palace. Saenz was there, and she awakened Bolivar. Ever reckless and brave, he jumped to action with his pistol and sabre, but she convinced him to leave for his own safety. After that, she personally confronted the would-be assassins, being pistol whipped for her trouble. But she saved Bolivar's life that night.
The general had hidden under a bridge until regular and loyal troops could be called. In the cold of the night, you get the sense of a man whose dreams and aspirations have miserably crumbled around him. Something broke in Bolivar that night, and the spirit that had led him through almost two decades of tireless work for independence left him. In his final, pathetic moments, which hardly befitted the hero of six nations, Bolivar would sadly declare that all of his work had been for naught: "I have plowed the sea, and sowed in the wind.".
What about Manuela Saenz? She did not accompany Bolivar in this final trip, and the why must remain a mystery. It's possible that he did not want her to, and for once she listened. Then Santander, whom she hated virulently, triumphantly came back from the exile he had been condemned to due to his supposed participation in the plot to assassinate Bolivar. Saenz was soon exiled herself. She could not return to her home, to Quito, because Bolivar's enemies were in power there too.
Bolivar and Gran Colombia would survive for three more years, but by then everything was a foregone conclusion. His friends were dead, or had turned into bitter enemies. With nothing left to do, Bolivar said his final goodbye to Saenz, and took a boat up the Magdalena. Like the other disgraced Libertador, San Martin, Bolivar planned to retire to Europe. He had had to sold his silverware to finance the trip. But he ended stuck in a small island, waiting for an English boat that came too late. Destitute, sick and depressed, Bolivar died there, hated by the people he had liberated. And with him, Gran Colombia died too.
So she settled in Peru, as close to Ecuador as she could, though she would refuse to come back even after a new Ecuadorian government allowed her to. There she lived in solitary poverty, refusing to go back to her husband in Lima. Her only company were some dogs, whom she named Santander, Paez and Padilla, the names of Bolivar's enemies.
Like with most protagonists of the Independence of Spanish America, Manuela Saenz's story ends in tragedy. Her memory was reinvindicated in the later half of the XXth century, when feminism led to a resurgence of female characters of this time, and a reevaluation of their role. Now, she is seen as a heroine, and widely known for the nickname Bolivar bestowed upon her: "La Libertadora del Libertador." She could also be considered a precedent to the many hardy and brave women that appear in the history of Latin America, such as the soldadetas of the Mexican Revolution. Indomable, bold, brilliant, her life can be summarized as a romantic tale with a sad ending.
My main sources for this are Chasteen's Americanos, Latin America's Struggle for Independence (which also features the tales of many other exceptional women!), Bethell's The Cambridge History of Latin America, and Bushnell's The Santander Regime in Gran Colombia.

I'm a bit busy to post anything very long here, but I actually run collecting (and illustrating) stories of such women -- including the aforementioned Manuela Saenz (who is fabulous)! I will add that Red\_Galiray neglected to mention two of my favorite bits of Saenz trivia: she reportedly scavenged a man's moustache for her personal use, and that she at one point had a pet bear.
I'm not entirely sure how they first met, because the only book about her is in French, but at some point in Vienna in 1933, Madeline Bihet-Richou encountered Colonel Erwin Lahousen. The two became close and a year after meeting began a love affair. While the story of an affair between a French teacher and an Austrian Officer might not seem all that noteworthy, later developments would turn it into a fascinating tale of espionage and heroism.
Understandably, the French Intelligence Service are very interested in Bihet-Richou and her high-placed lover, and recruit her as an operative. She is found a job at the French institute in Berlin, and travels there as a fully-fledged secret agent, with instructions to meet Lahousen, now head of Sabotage at the Wehrmacht's Intelligence Service.
, a pregnant woman stranded on a Canadian island in the 1500s who survived for 2.5 years and then hitched a ride back to France on a Basque fishing boat (my entry on her is only in one of my books, not the website -- hence the wiki link).
Unfortunately there's almost nothing in English about her. is the book I mentioned, and I think there's a documentary that was made about her, but unless you can speak French it's not much use. If you're interested I can send you the two pages of Lahousen's interrogation where he talks about her.
My citations for each entry are listed at the end of the entry. Sorry, have to get back to work now, but I hope someone enjoys this.
Fast forward to the 15th of March 1938. It is three days since German troops marched into Vienna. Colonel Lahousen, now the head of Austrian military intelligence, has rushed into Vienna ahead of the advancing German forces. His objective is to prevent his communications with the head of German Military Intelligence, Wilhelm Canaris, from falling into the wrong hands. Canaris has many powerful enemies, and if Canaris' warnings of the imminent invasion were known to them, it would spell his downfall. Along the way, Lahousen sends a message to Bihet-Richou, asking her to tell the French military attache that he would no longer be able to keep in contact with him. Bihet-Richou delivers the message and the two spend the day together before she leaves Vienna, while Lahousen is summoned to Berlin.
