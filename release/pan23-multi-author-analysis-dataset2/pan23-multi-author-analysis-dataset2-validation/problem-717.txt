It may not be considered a fire arm but it's probably still against the schools policy. They may be classifying it as a firearm since it could be used as a weapon or malicious intent.
You probably signed a form agreeing to abide by their rules, which means if a blowtorch is on their list of firearms then for the purposes of school discipline it is one. I would review any documents you signed at the beginning of the year, as well as your student handbook. I would bet that somewhere there is a clause about things that are not actually weapons but can still be used to injure people or cause damage.
No, a blowtorch/lighter is not a fire arm. But it's rare that specifically firearm are banned. Likely something in the ed code for your district bans firearms but also explosives in the same code. Your lighter probably falls into that category of explosives, and you are in a good deal of trouble here.
