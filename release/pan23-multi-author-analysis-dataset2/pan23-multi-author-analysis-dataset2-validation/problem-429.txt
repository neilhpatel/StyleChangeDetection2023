Yeah, but it’s not just the Presidential elections because at the national level it takes the House and the Senate as well and those margins are extremely narrow at this point. Democrats may own the largest populated states but as a country we are fairly equally divided. Besides even with majorities in all three branches of government the majorities the Democrats had were not enough and they still needed Republicans in the Senate to pass any legislation. Now with a bit more breathing room in the Senate that still wouldn’t be enough because it takes 60. But Hell, since they narrowly lost the house nothing is going to happen for the next two years. Hell, there’s a good chance they default on the debt. The fact that Biden was able to get an infrastructure bill when the had the majority which was decades overdue was a feat in itself And you would think bridges and roads that work would be popular with both Democrats and Republicans.
Regardless either way whether he actually believes in it or not the same holds true that he's actually done it.
DeSantis appears to me as being more of an opportunist. Somehow I get the impression it's not so much what he believes as what he is willing to do because he believes it benefits him.
The bottom line is this guy is unfit for office and it really shouldn't take much to recognize that fact. In America it's extremely unfortunate that way too many just don't understand that and that he overwhelming won re-election as Florida's Governor.. When you take political revenge on Mickey Mouse because he spoke up and criticized your policies and you transport immigrants from another state to Martha's Vineyard as a pure political stunt these both on their own make you unfit not to mention trying to outlaw various subjects and books from school. Add into it his stupid Covid Vaccine investigations and you really need not have to dig any further.
I just think all of these policies are to turn Texas and Florida redder. Make almost movie villain policies as an act of histrionics and shock, disgust liberals into leaving and encouraging conservatives to move to.
Problem is the way our system works and due to the fact our Presidential election isn’t based on popular vote that can work against us and it has. Especially considering the extreme right now has a stranglehold the Republican Party. Not sure how much the average Republican agrees with the more extreme crap, but it hasn’t stopped them from voting for this sh\\. Hell the Republican may not have a large majority in the House but they were able to win a majority and look what they have done so far.
And there would be no problem with that if it were not for how extreme the Republican Party as a group has gotten. Well, that and the fact they ended up supporting someone who not long ago attempted to be the first dictator of The United States. True, there were a few Republicans who voted to impeach and convict but that was few and of those few not many are left.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Well, that’s how values work in politics. To treat every issue as though it is of equal importance would be disastrous for democracy. Individuals do not vote for the politician who shares the majority of viewpoints; they vote for the politician who shares the views on the policies they feel are most important. It’s far from perfect, but it’s the political system that we have.
Thing is when your Party on the whole supports someone trying to be a dictator in a Republic that Party can no longer be trusted to govern in a Republic.
Unfortunately the Republican Party has been extremely effective at not only gerrymandering but discouraging as many voters as possible. They've always seen it in their best interest to make sure the least amount of voters actually vote with numerous different tactics which make it much more difficult to vote. If not we would have internet voting by now or at least universal mail in voting which would make it much more easy to vote thus many more voters would actually cast their ballet by now. There's really no other excuse except for them knowing even more voters would vote for the opposition.
That’s what I am saying. It’s to win presidential elections. Electoral college is about moving the same populations to states that need votes. It’s how a conservative population can stay competitive despite there being far less voters.
I would add they are opportunist but there’s a reason they made the choice to go with the a Republican Party. Democrats would never vote for some one like Trump. So that opportunity just doesn’t exist. Besides these people being racists and not working with the Democratic Party is that you have a much more uneducated, ignorant, and conspiratorial bunch of people in the Republican Party. That’s the Party which had much more for opportunity’s for opportunist just has it’s always been in history when it comes to want to be strong men like Trump and DeSantis.
I agree to a point, but for one you probably included some of the worst examples of people in your group that one could imagine being educated. DeSantis maybe the others not even close. Although the Republican Party has some intelligent people which even includes a highly educated Cruz the ones you mentioned are more performing artist and con men Which really doesn’t require as much education as the willingness just to perform gimmicks and political theatre.
I get what your saying, but I’ve seen no evidence they believe it’s an issue and it doesn’t appear that most Republican talking heads agree with you either.
Thing is this same sort of thing has been occurring in more than just the United States. Often we fail to see what’s occurring right outside or borders or recognize what is happening elsewhere. It’s not just the United States, in the UK withdrew from the EU for some of the very same issues we have been experiencing.That’s one of the very reasons they find themselves experiencing financial difficulties right now.
We really need not only Democrats and some moderates and independents reject this but a more unified rejection to include many more Republicans as well.
It's been a long time but I have to imagine that was only because it was politically advantage to do so. But Wallace is yet another example of real piece of work. What a real sorry POS he was.
