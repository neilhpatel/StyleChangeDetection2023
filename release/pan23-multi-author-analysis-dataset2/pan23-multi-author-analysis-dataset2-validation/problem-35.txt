That is why the best tactic to deal with bullies is returned force. Bullies thrive on others cowering to them without a fight, because on a deep level, they are deeply insecure and try to gain a feeling of security by trampling others. This is why I do not discourage my kids from defending themselves in such a situation. The school may expel you, but if you are purely defending yourself, you’re in no trouble with me.
I wonder who is manning the Patriot missiles in Ukraine. US contractors, US military or Ukrainians. That I think is the bigger question Russia is trying to figure out.

The Tony Stark stuff has not come out yet. If full war broke out with NATO all Russian military assets would be in ashes within 48hrs. No nuclear weapons needed.
