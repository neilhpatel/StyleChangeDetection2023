I'm having a hard time reconciling a 100 mile difference here considering the volcano is on Russia's eastern 'coast'. Frickin spheres man, how do they work?
What do you think that new Air Force mini shuttle is for? The one that just landed after being in orbit for what 500 plus days?
Yes, my understanding is that Los Angeles is roughly 7,246,666 bald eagles away from this volcano. Assuming that I got the numbers right and based on the average lenh of typical bald eagles.
In a male-to-male comparison we can measure that 1 half-giraffe(in height) == 11/8 bald eagles(in wingspan), which means the distance from Shivulech volcano to Los Angeles is 5,270,303 half-giraffes.
Assuming you use US gallons per half-giraffe as your preferred metric for lenh, the distance from Shivulech volcano to Los Angeles is 829,790,989 gallons of water.
In the 1997 movie Conspiracy Theory that starred Julia Roberts and Mel Gibson, one of the conspiracies was the space shuttle was carrying an earthquake generating weapon.
