Thank you so much! As always the story is much more layered than I expected. And stark. I didn't realize that the new Greek state had opted for a highly centralized administration. Somehow I imagined, until the ethnic cleansing/population exchanges, Thessaloniki and other cities plied along as they always had with different tax collectors.
Also this question lets us examine difficult questions about refugee integration, parallel traumas processed and state ethnogenesis linked with ever present anti-semitism.
Initially I would like to illustrate of how the Jews reacted to the Greeks taking over the city in 1912 because it provides better contrast with the arrival of the refugees in 1922/1923.
סלוניקי, Θεσσαλονίκη, سلاني was not a minor European city. It was as big if not bigger of the other balkan capitals while it was on the political forefront with the proto-communist Federacion and the Young Turk movement. One of the principal theaters of WW1, at 1917 it was at the cusp becoming a major european city.
The Jews boasted a continuous presence since before the Common Era and were the majority since 1492. But the important thing were not only numbers or economic/cultural output; it was that Jews felt indigenous and acted as the indigenous majority.
Despite some early violence, the Greek government leaned heavily and censored any anti-Jewish behaviour even though the initial reception of the Jewish community was cold at best, (the reasons being Jews being Ottoman subjects but also the Empire appearing as a better solution to a fiercely nationalistic Christian state).
This was even more surprising if one would take into account that the Jews did not simply act as mere political pawns to be traded but demonstrated their own political agency. There was talk of Salonica becoming a neutral port or a self-governing city under Jewish supervision as a compromise between Greek, Bulgarian and Ottoman demands. This was also heavily favored by the AustroHungarian who would finally find the final tap of its Drang Nach Osten politic.
There was a letter sent to that intent by leading members of the community to PM Venizelos also signed by members of the Muslim/Donme community. Interestingly enough also co-signed by some local influential Greek Orthodox merchants, indicative of the fears concerning the future of the city.
At the same time the Jewish Community sent a delegation to the Zionist Congress asking to examine the city as a possible zionist homeland; a move eventually dismissed. Also there was the intent to sent a delegation to the Versailles, also shot down, although there is evidence that there was some international discussion about it as manifested by a two page spread in New York Times heralding the "Jewish colony of Palestine" and the "Port of Salonica" as the solution to the Jewish Problem.
The answer of the Greek Government was, surprisingly for a contemporary reader, not of suppression but a recognition of these efforts as legitimate and trying to win the Jews over. Prominent Jews were introduced to the court, while Venizelos introduced an extremely favorable legislation and finally equating the Jewish communities in legal status with the Greek Church, (which no other denomination enjoys even today).
I mentioned the reasons before but I need to stress that almost 10 years afterwards the fate of Greek conquests was not a fait accompli as Venizelos knew. For example the Bulgarians were always ready, although any kind of support of Bulgarian interests was never taken into consideration despite Bulgarian advances.
The answer of the Jewish Community to this charm offensive was positive and always working under the principle of dina d'malchuta dina, meaning the Law of the Kingdom is the law. Jews refrained from any negative expressions and the status quo remained even after the catastrophic fire of 1917 which destroyed half the city and mainly the Jews. Although later literature blaims Venizelos for a re-construction aimed in destroying the Jewish grip on the city, the reality is any kind of re-construction after a major fire would result to that plus that actually the new owners still were Jews albeit not the multitude small owners but a handful of big ones.
These 1,2 million refugees were hastily led to settle in areas where the expelled Muslim minority lived, although this meant that in some cases these two populations co-existed for a very brief period of time since Muslims weren't expelled yet. The main areas of settling was rural Macedonia and the major urban centers mostly in the north but also Athens. Settler's Offices/Γραφεία Εποικισμού were founded almost everywhere and still exist today.
But the refugees-to-come were not the only influx of Greeks in the city. A huge number of civil servants, soldiers and people eager to make money came from the South which was called Old Greece/Παλαιά Ελλας. This was needed because of the completely new state apparatus that the greek government wanted to establish but also from the political decision to follow the french colonial example as how to rule these New Countries/Νέες Χώρες. General Governments were founded while any degree of autonomy was abolished. It is indicative that both the Jewish and the local Greek Orthodox community employed the use of non-Salonicans as political candidates in the elections, to be used as intermediaries with the athenian government.
The arrival of the Asia Minor/Eastern Thrace christian populations after a decade of Greek rule by itself is not something unique. Salonica had seen Jewish refugees fleeing from the russian pogroms or Muslims fleeing from Bosnia. But it was the first internationally decided mutual ethnic cleansing and, while it seems abhorrent today, garnered international acclaim. These populations were partly transferred ordinarily through the provisions of the Lausane Treaty but for the most part they were refugees who were trying to escape Turkish massacres after the defeat of the Greek invasion of Asia Minor. This transfer was done initially against the wishes of the greek government who did not want politically or could not afford economically of them becoming refugees. But even afterwards it was done in horrible conditions which led to tenths of thousands of deaths due to disease, lack of housing, clothing and food. As some narrate: _"[mothers] had to spit to the mouths of their babies because there was no water"_.
Ok, buckle up because this is going to be long one albeit a month later ain't so sure. But first I need to address on why the question is important:
This was necessary for a variety of reasons. First Greece needed to prove that it was a responsible small country which could be trusted to play with the bigger countries in the game of imperialism while the Ottoman Empire crumbled, (thus the Ukraine Campaign against the Bolsheviks but I digress). Second Greece based its claims on the right of self-determination of the indigenous greek populations of the Ottoman Empire; it would be not a great PR move not becoming another tyrant to other indigenous populations which was how the Ottoman Empire was portrayed. And thirdly Jews not only controlled but _were_ the economy of a city with a vastly greater economic weight that one would imagine by looking at her today.
It should be noted that their reception was often bad by the local populations fearing for loosing their part of the turkish assets left behind. This was augmented by the fact that often they did not speak a common language but also in some case of the refugees being used as political tools in order to displace the unwanted indigenous population, eg the Chams in Epirus.
In Thessaloniki settlements were created at the outskirts of the city, (check the map at page 16 - the dark gray are Refugees settlements and the black ones are Jewish communitarian ones).
Suddenly the crippled Greek economy, (10 years of war, 1912-1922), needed also to meet the huge needs of the refugees. This coincided with Thessaloniki losing its commercial hinterland and becoming practically a border town led to downward economic turn. Unemployment was rampant and there was a flight of major economic capital eager to re-locate to more promising grounds. Also the lack of political representation led to a systematic approach of promoting Old Greece interests, especially in case of the Pireaus port over the Salonican one, eg Salonican imports had to pay duties even in the 20's as if it was still a foreign port (!) despite protests by the local Chamber of Commerce.
The biggest and most important change came with the institution of Sunday Rest in 1924. Although marketed as a Blue Law, the discussion at the salonican Chamber of Commerce is pretty clear that it was seen as a matter of national interest albeit this definition arriving from local interests and not from Athens. This created huge problems for the Jews who would either need to lose 20% of their income by closing for the Shabbat or stop exercising their religion. This is more obvious when examining that the initiative was enforced by the Government but requested by the locals, mainly refugees who could not easily accept of "Jewish privileges". I take this harsh assessment because of minor details like the insistence that Jewish butchers are not be given some leeway since they would need to prepare for the Sunday meal, while not competing with Christian butchers since their clientele was completely separate due to kashrout laws. In any case these were also the justification used by the athenian minister towards the Jewish delegation who was protesting.
This created a huge backlash by the entire political specter of the Jewish political community which united in a rare moment of collective action, as it was divided among the assimilationists, the zionists and the communists.
At the same time it struggled to fit in the new state, with three different political factions forming.
