Turn the voice speed of the computer up to a thousand words per minute and leave it running overnight any time they try to play that card, with a vote to not consider any business other than reading things on the floor until morning. That won't slow it down much.
Not sure why that’s a problem for us here on the east side. It is nice having a place in both Idaho and Oregon though, if 114 stands I can still buy whatever firearms I want with my Idaho ID and bring them back to oregon since no one on the east side will enforce it. It’s the best of both worlds.
