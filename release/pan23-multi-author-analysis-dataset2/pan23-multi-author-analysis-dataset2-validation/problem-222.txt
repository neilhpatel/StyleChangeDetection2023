So, on to homosexuality. Homosexuality was not entirely a hush-hush affair in the circles that Tharpe traveled in, although there were certainly significant taboos. Little Richard, who Tharpe discovered 14-year-old singing before one of her shows, is widely known to have engaged in homosexual/"queer" activity. He is also well-known for due to his religious beliefs.
First off, the idea that "churchgoers were shocked by her mixture of gospel lyrics with secular music" is ahistorical. Mixing the sacred and the secular is an old tradition, and musicians didn't have to stay on a single side. Mahalia Jackson, the other powerhouse gospel singer of Tharpe's era, stayed fairly resolutely in the "gospel" lane. Even then, she collaborated with musicians who were not gospel musicians, including popular jazz artists like and Others, especially less commercially successful musicians, played both types of music depending on what audience they were playing for.
Tharpe has been having a well-deserved moment of late, bringing her from the realm of "musicians' musician" and interesting historical figure into a much, much wider consciousness. However, as with any rediscovery, many of the people who listen to her do so out of her original historical context. She certainly was a fantastic musician, and her playing ignited a passion for blues and gospel among many who listened to her. She was the first gospel singer many secular people heard, especially in Europe, where she was a popular touring artist for a time. However, she wasn't as entirely unique as the blgo post above makes her out to be. That has some implications for framing how we view her life and legacy overall, and shows some of the mythmaking that she has been subject to in her rediscovery.
I don't have a great background in queer history, so I hope that someone can delve into your general question. What I'd like to do is put Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and some of the claims made about her, into a broader context.
Closer to Tharpe, the genre of "gospel blues" was a thriving one. and were both successful and influential musicians who, like Tharpe, paired blues-style guitar and singing with gospel lyrics. By the way, if you don't love "Oh Glory How Happy I Am," regardless of religious persuasion, I'm not sure we can be friends. It's one of my all-time favorites.
This was not just true in "black" music, by the way. The Carter Family, who many credit with creating the mold for the commercial country music industry, played a mix of and So too did the "Father of Bluegrass," and gospel songs form a large portion of "bluegrass standards." Finally, if you look at the songs sung by the "Million Dollar Quartet," a chance metting of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, you'll find a substantial number of gospel songs. By the way, listen to Jake Hess sing "hold my hand all the way, every hour of every day" in the Statesman Quartet's version of and tell me that you don't hear Elvis' voice. Hess was one of his favorite singers, and Elvis listened to a lot of gospel.
There's a great album, Good Morning Little Schoolgirl, by blues player Mississippi Fred McDowell that illustrates this well. The first half is secular songs, many with bawdy lyrics. The is as sexually charged as you'd expect. Then, just a few tracks down, you're listening to still bluesy but definitely not bawdy!
The more accurate sentence in the blog is "Tharpe was revolutionary in the sense that she performed gospel music in front of a secular audience and in nightclubs." There was absolutely a taboo among gospel musicians against playing in dens of iniquity like nightclubs and bars. Gospel singer Eunice Waymon went so far as to change her name to when she started playing secular music in nightclubs. But she still played gospel music during her career as a "secular" musician. Aretha Franklin's biggest-selling album, in a career of soul and pop superstardom, was 1972's Amazing Grace, a.
Why did I go on a long ramble about mixing gospel and secular music? To illustrate some of the pitfalls of "rediscovering" an artist. Taken out of context, you can start hear claims being made that make sense to current ears, but are divorced from the context that they occurred in. This is especially true for someone like Tharpe, whose relative obscurity in the years since her heyday is in large part due to hot-button political, cultural, and societal issues.
Recently, a lot of attention has been given to seminal blues singers like Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Lucille Bogan and their potential queerness. The heights of their careers came just before Tharpe popped onto the scene, and they lie on the other end of the "sacred-secular" spectrum to Tharpe, with often-lewd and barely euphemistic lyrics. Of the three, Bogan provides us with the strongest evidence of homosexual attraction with her "BD" stands for "Bull Dyke," a common term for a lesbian. There's little euphemism here; these lyrics are pretty straightforward:
Rainey and Bessie Smith are rumored to have been in a relationship at one point, and while Smith doesn't have any lyrics that are nearly as obvious as the two I posted above, there have been plenty of academics reading between the lines of many of her songs.
Ma Rainey is also rumored to have had many homosexual relationships. Her song is often cited as her flaunting her sexuality, with lines like this:
Now, looking at the lyrics I posted, you can see that even while seemingly singing out loud and proud about homosexual behavior, the lyrics leave some wiggle room. The "low-down dirty man" theme is a common one in the blues, and the idea of staying away from men isn't confined to songs by supposed lesbians. "Bull Dyke" doesn't take any more syllables to say than "BD," yet Bogan decides to use the initialism for the recording. And notice that Rainey says "ain't nobody caught me," alluding to the idea that there was something to hide.
There's also an element of just straight-up absurdity that blues singers, especially the bawdier ones, liked to traffic in. If you want, you can read the various references to dressing like a man as an extension of that absurdity. They also didn't stop at mere euphemism, and weren't too prudish to just come out and say what everyone was thinking. Take Bogan's "Shave 'Em Dry," which starts out.
That's just about the cleanest part of the song, by the way, and you can listen to the rest of it It's shocking, it's absurdist, and it's delightfully funny. It also talks about her having a "cock" made of brass, which could be an allusion to a dildo, some form of "trans" identity, or simply her playing the part of a man for a verse.
So, we know that the concept of a black woman singer being homo- or bisexual was not unique to Tharpe. However, Bogan et al. all were on the secular circuit. Given the general aversion to non-heterosexuality in many Christian circles, a gospel singer like Tharpe could not have been nearly as open and explicit about her sexuality. This is as true today as it was then (I don't want to venture into recent events, but Jennifer Knapp's story has some modern parallels).
The concept of Tharpe as a bisexual, as far as I can tell, comes mainly out of a which came out in 2007. It takes up a relatively small amount of the book, and focuses almost entirely on one woman that Tharpe supposedly had a relationship with. Marie Knight was a singer who shared the stage with both Tharpe and Mahalia Jackson. Knight and Tharpe toured together as a musical act for years, and also lived together when not touring. Ward cites rumors and a few sources, none of which provide a detailed account of Tharpe and Knight's supposed relationship.
The most specific account is from a man who said that he walked in on Tharpe, Knight, and a third woman having a sexual encounter. However, he is recounting this decades after the fact, and does not seem to have had a longstanding relationship with the women in question.
It's hard for me to take those anecdotes and go straight to "she was bisexual," if only because we don't have her say on the matter. Even if the rumors of a relationship with Knight are true, Tharpe may still not have identified as "bisexual." She could have had a somewhat tortured relationship with her sexuality. Knight could have been a fling. She could have been a lesbian, not attracted to men at all but still feeling some kind of societal pressure to get married to one (or three). Knight certainly didn't seem to want to be "outed," even if the rumors were true. Whether we can ethically "out" a dead person, potentially against their living wishes, is an interesting issue. She almost certainly didn't "lived as openly as she possibly could in that period," as other singers lived more openly and actually sang about potential homosexual experiences, even if they still shrouded their lyrics in a bit of euphemism.
The danger in wanting to see Tharpe as a trailblazing "Queer Pioneer" is that, like the gospel audiences that may have overlooked any rumors about her, we may see what we want to see. Ultimately, what we know about Tharpe boils down to the fact that she was rumored to have had at least one homosexual relationship. Based on the fact that this wasn't uncommon at the time and we have multiple sources that speak to this potential homosexual behavior, we can say that there's a reasonably good likelihood that she was actually in some kind of romantic or sexual relationship with Knight. However, since Knight denied the relationship, and the accounts we have are mostly either fleeting and recounted decades later or based more on second-hand inference rather than first-hand knowledge, it's tough to assign her the specific label of "bisexual.".
Thank you for such a thorough response. Would you mind providing some additional sources for some of the things you mentioned? I know this sub is very strict about the quality of the sources they require (especially having so many Youtube links in your post).
