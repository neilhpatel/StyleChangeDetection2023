From what you wrote: you arenâ€™t thinking clearly. These people are using you and lying to you to get you to build their company for them basically for free.
It sounds like you're one of five owners of a five-person company. If you're acting like an employee, it's by choice, or at least by the lack of a realization you have options.
No, I don't have a contract. It was a verbal agreement saying they will pay me a salary and they did that for just 3 months but there is no proof that anything was agreed upon. I'm the person doing paperwork as well so I've created a salary slip for the months they've paid me and they signed that. I've done 9 months of free work before that and now I'm back to doing free work. Sometimes I feel bullied when they push me into a corner.
The only value I thought they had was that they have good contacts, but so far I haven't seen anything materialize.
In the absence of such an agreement, you're pretty much free to take your talents and walk, which provides a handy backstop for negotiation. You'll probably lose your shares, but you'll lose them anyways if the company goes bust, and right now they're not worth anything to start with. You don't need to be overly aggressive about that, and saying "do X or I'll walk" is a great way to make your co-founders dig their heels in, but having the option of walking away in your back pocket may take the edge off your own stress as you navigate this.
Normally, as a part-owner of a business partnership or a private corporation, your rights and responsibilities are set out in either an operating agreement or a shareholder agreement, or both. Certain rights and responsibilities are presumed by law, but your operating agreement with your co-founders should at least cover responsibilities, compensation, and termination.
Your cofounders don't have a lot of basis to recover your compensation from you, regardless of your operating agreement, unless they can show that you breached a material term of that agreement or that you acted against the business's best interests while acting as its owner. (What you do on your own time is your problem.) If you have acted to damage the business, they may be able to recover actual damages from you, but it doesn't sound like the company has much of a budget for lawyers.
If you have been successfully doing all of that, you don't need your co-founders. You _absolutely_ should not start a competing business while you're still part of this company, but unless you signed a noncompete, you're free to leave and start your own. The only thing you're really haggling over is the terms of your exit, not whether you exit. Don't carry clients over and don't carry any proprietary data or inventions over and you've got a much stronger footing if your former co-founders believe they've been wronged.
One way out of this might be to offer to give up your shares free and clear in return for walking away from the company completely. It's clear your co-founders don't trust you any more than you trust them, and I doubt you'll fix that. A mutually-agreeable separation might let everyone save face, and the shares aren't really worth anything to you, so you lose very little by giving them up.
Yes, technically I am an owner of the company because when we started, I thought everyone would be putting in some time into the business. I had no idea I would be the one doing absolutely everything. They insisted I should be a shareholder because they don't know anything about software but they've always treated me like an employee and I didn't think they'll use this to strongarm me into investing also into them so they can continue to sit on their ass.
They also used my past work history from my freelance jobs that they had nothing to do with, and used that in their company's portfolio. I felt it was unfair but they said it's needed for a new company to start business and that it's okay because I'm now part of this company. I needed to keep this job so I didn't make a fuss.
