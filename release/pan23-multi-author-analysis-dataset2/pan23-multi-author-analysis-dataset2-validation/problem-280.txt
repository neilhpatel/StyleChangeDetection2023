You would need a real estate lawyer to advise you. With the holiday weekend I doubt that you could have any sort of resolution before 6/4. If the buyer does sue you it could "muddy the waters" and delay any further sale.
A home purchase contract is a very lenhy, very technical legal document. If you drafted one without using a real estate agent or a real estate attorney there are a lot of places things could go wrong.
If you do try to cancel the sale, the seller could sue to force the sale. This is a lenhy and expensive process and would likely keep you from being able to list and sell the property until it was resolved.
You need to have a real estate attorney review your contract and determine whether or not the buyer's delay warrants canceling the contract outright. The title company isn't there to provide that sort of advice. A few hours of work would likely cost less than $1,000 and you would have a more definitive answer. You are well beyond DIY on this (in fact, this was never a DIY to begin with).
The title co can give you pointers. They can also recommend a good RE attorney to you if you are looking to cancel the purchase.
Yeah the buyer is saying they will sue to force the sale if we try to cancel. I’m just irritated because the only reason we went with this person is she said she could close by 5/31 (which it mentions on the contract) and has now said we can’t close until 06/04. I will reach out to a reputable real estate attorney, thank you.
Did you have an attorney prepare the contract? If so, contact the attorney. If not, get one. Call a RE attorney today. Who is closing the sale? Which title co/RE attorney? That should be your first call.
A 2.5 week turn around from 5/14 is extremely aggressive. If you had a lawyer work on the sales agreement there would likely be clauses that would allow the buyer to continue in good faith.
Tip: If you show up to close on the date scheduled and the buyer fails to close, they are in default unless you have signed an extension. However, it could be entirely different in your state/in your contract - that's why you need a RE attorney. For example: NY has some weirdness in their contracts that their closing dates are fluid up to 30 days beyond the stated date in the contract. That's why you need an attorney local to you/the property. I don't know your contract or any local standards and INAL.
