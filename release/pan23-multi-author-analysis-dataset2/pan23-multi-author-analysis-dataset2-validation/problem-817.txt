Investment = influence. If the US wants greater influence over one of the most resource rich parts of the globe, it will need to a invest more into it. The Chinese have realized this for roughly a decade.
The west has been extracting resources from Africa for centuries and not paying Africans a fair price and we're mad that we gotta share the exploration with China.
Though it has to be said that China isn't stupid and definitely knows the odds of loans being paid back. And those debts definitely have a negative impact. Whether you consider that evil or not is up to the individual.
Eh, what they do could be called debt trapping. Having debt repayed by being given control over certain infrastructures or resources, such as ports and mines. Though there's debate on the front of whether it's accurate to call it debt trapping. Mostly regarding the fact it's a country's own responsibility to pay back loans to China, and China doesn't actively cause the debt.
There's also talk about China promoting corrupt politicians in those countries to take more loans and reduce the chance of them being paid back in order to secure more influence. If that is true then I would label it as malign.
