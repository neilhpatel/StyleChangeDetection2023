You definitely need an attorney, and if there's any chance your former employer was able to access any files belonging to your new employer, you'll definitely want to inform them as well; they may be very interested in the potential for corporate espionage or other malfeasance on the part of a competitor against them, which may amount to a serious criminal matter for whoever was involved with making the decision to access your laptop. What you describe is a computer trespass, any data destroyed or "stolen" just adds to the severity of the crime.
Another thing you likely need to do is change every single password you have from a different device than the laptop. If they had that much access they likely have some/all of your passwords. While you do this, please turn on MFA/2FA everywhere you have the option to.
Also, if you are able, stop using the computer immediately, just shut it down. Hold off on taking your laptop to a random strip mall computer place. Your current employer may wish to use a forensic data investigation service to identify the remote access software and who controls it. The longer it's used and the more folks mess with it, the more difficult it will be for the forensic investigation to gather definitive proof.
I know the clock has been ticking on this but I want to say this is 1,000% the right move here. Computer off, battery out if it's removable. A forensic service will be able to get a boat load of Intel off that drive if they don't have a chance to cover their tracks.
For the future though, please do not use a personal device as a work device. If an employer requires you to supply your own hardware make sure it is fully erased and install a new OS on it yourself. But better yet is making them expense a device for you and disposing it after or using theirs.
They likely have access to any other devices they own as well. Especially if any remote control software has been used. Not to mention routers, phones, etc.
Are you a super secret hacker-agent? But uh, seriously, was any of that legal, and do you have any insight on how much trouble OP's former employer could be in?
