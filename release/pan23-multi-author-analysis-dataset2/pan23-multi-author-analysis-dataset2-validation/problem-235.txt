Licensed Electrician here. It is Carbon Monoxide, not CO2. Just CO. And those devices detect the remnants of combustion rather than a gas leak.
Next, you need to get firm with him and let him know there is a gas leak and he needs to deal with it right now. Thar you want a licensed gas plumber over there immediately because he already missed it once. If he refuses, let him know that you aren't trying to be difficult here, but this is very dangerous and you will call code services over it. That you don't want to be difficult, but will.
You do mean the CO detector ? Bc I hope the gas detector does work better. Wouldn't have much of a point if that only worked when combustion had happened lol.
I'm sorry for what I had previously wrote. I just re-read your post. And yea, you are correct. It just detects that dangerous byproduct of combustion. It doesn't detect natural gas, as it hasn't been burned yet.
Honestly though he's kind of a senile old man and idk if I would trust him with the repairs. Or he's just dumb. Doesn't know the difference between co2 and gas like I said. I can get shit fixed in a day because I know where to go and apps I can use to find repairmen. So honestly I feel safer with the maintenance being my responsibility. I just think it's unfair that I inherited the issues already here that would have been clear with an inspection probably. So I would like to get an inspection at least and hopefully that's not an issue.
Oh sorry also I got the leak fixed, the guy came and saw the issue immediately and tightened it. I'm getting a second opinion on Monday to be sure. I told him I was right. I will see if he allows me to have someone the check the other ones... Seems something was installed badly and/or loosened when being moved for renovations before I moved in. But I would like the whole system checked.
You can ask for inspections and such, but it seems pretty apparent that the landlord does not care to do those things. You could consider reporting the incident to your jurisdiction building and or code enforcement office, but I would not be prepared for a quick response. If you believe that the gas is an immediate health concern for you or other tenants, call 911.
An option you have is to withhold rent, as some of the items you've described would be a breach of habitability. You should review the applicable statues (38-12-503), and make sure you are doing everything right on your end before you withhold rent. Here is a that can provide some basic information that might be helpful to you.
Thanks. Honestly most things about the apartment are stellar and it's in the best location I could find, plus I can't afford to move again so I'm trying to not get him in serious trouble, although I could, but also not take responsibility and most importantly keep myself safe.
