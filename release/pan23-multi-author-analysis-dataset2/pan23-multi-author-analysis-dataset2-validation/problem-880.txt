Thanks for the reply - currently no. Most of the business places I have in mind are almost ‘strip mall-like’. Sounds lame, but there’s a few hidden gems. Wouldn’t even know how to go about that. Those would most definitely just be us, no fans, etc. (adding on after the fact) one of the places I have in mind is between two businesses, and has a really amazing echo-chamber like tunnel/ hallway/ alley, etc. it’s outdoors, obviously, but has a roof over it.
You'd normally need permission from a private business to play on their property. Even after hours a private business could be concerned about potential liability, guests leaving trash, etc. That being said, if the police were called on the type of gathering you describe the most likely outcome is that they would tell you to move along and that would be it.
Just curious - what would be the difference between us quietly playing, and us just being there? They’re in fairly populated areas where people typically just walk anyway. It’s a more populated area in town. Thanks for the reply!
That’s kind of what we figured. We definitely would pick up any trash before we left. We probably wouldn’t even bring anything considered ‘trash’ anyway. Maybe a water bottle or two, but probably not even that, ha.
