Armed uprising was the last stage of the French resistance. When D-Day happened the resistance was re-designated the French Forces of the Interior, becoming officially a branch of the regular French military. FFI units conducted sabotage and attacks against Germans to help the Allies land, and then supported them as they advanced into France. One of the most notable actions was the delay of the 2nd SS Panzer Division "Das Reich." The Das Reich division was a battle-hardened tank unit which was stationed in the south of France when D-Day happened. The division was ordered to Normandy, a journey that would take three days. However, FFI groups ambushed it constantly along the way, holding the division up for eighteen days, and by the time it arrived in Normandy the Allies had pushed far beyond the beach. One group of Spanish maquisards played an especially important role, chopping down trees to block the road and firing on the German column with Sten guns wrapped in wet blankets, which made them sound like heavy machine-guns and gave the Germans the impression that they were fighting a a larger and far better-equipped force than they actually were, which caused them to be more cautious and take even longer.
Despite the romantic/Hollywood/Gaullist image of the French Resistance blowing up bridges and ambushing German columns, in reality these sorts of paramilitary operations were rare, at least until 1944. Most resistance activities were much less dramatic, if no less important. It was only after D-Day that resistance groups were able to wage open warfare against the Germans in a real capacity.
Resistance was seldom and sporadic in the first year and half of the German occupation, and categorically non-violent. It consisted mostly of individual displays of defiance and contempt for the Germans - daubing a “V for Victory” on a wall, or deliberately working poorly on factory orders bound for Germany. A woman in Paris supposedly went around carrying two bamboo poles – in French, deux gaules, a pun signifying support for Charles de Gaulle.
When it came to striking back directly against the German war machine, the most common strategy was sabotage. French factories played an important role producing equipment and war material for Germany, and owners and workers who opposed the Germans could hamper their efforts merely by working slowly or poorly on purpose. For example, the chairman of Citroën directed his workers to set the oil indicator of trucks a little higher than it was supposed to be, so that the gauge showed an incorrect amount of oil. When the trucks were sent to the Eastern Front, they would run out of oil unexpectedly and leave German troops stranded. Workers themselves organized resistance, with Lyon being a notable center of blue-collar networks who could harm production through botched orders and strikes. Workers could also supply information to the Allies to make their bombing raids more destructive, although of course this came at a terrible price in civilian lives, since 68,000 French people were killed by Allied bombs in the course of the war.
Once they had been organized, there was the question of what resistance groups would actually do, which depended on their location, their composition, and their politics. But combat was always the exception rather than the rule. Printing underground newspapers, radioing intelligence to the Allies, and helping downed airmen escape France were more common activities for resistance organizations. A good example of both the work and the risk ran by resistance cells is the Groupe de musée de l'Homme, a network created by a number of academics and the first resistance group in Paris. They printed and distributed an anti-Nazi broadsheet titled Résistance, filtered information to the American embassy in Paris, and helped British soldiers stranded in France after the 1940 campaign to escape. In early 1941 the Germans broke up the group thanks to a Gestapo informer and arrested its members. The men were all shot and the women condemned to slave labor in Germany. Prior to 1944 this was the sort of activity conducted by (and often the fate of) other groups as they sought to build organizations and find ways to hamper the occupation. Some of it was very effective, such as the Comet Line, a very large network of resistors in France and Belgium who saved over 5,000 downed British and American airmen from capture and got them safely back to Allied territory.
Over time, underground resistance networks began to coalesce from the most disaffected. These were mostly small groups, independent of one another and politically heterogeneous. For an example of how diverse resistance movements could be, one can compare two major early groups like Henri Frenay's Combat in the south of France, composed of conservative army officers who supported Pétain initially but hated the Germans, and the Paris FTP-MOI (Francs-tireurs et partisans main-d'œuvre immigrée) led by the poet Missak Manouchian and composed of Armenian, Italian, and Eastern European communists and Jews.
Additionally, resistance cell conducted sabotage directly against targets like rail lines, mines, communications and radar installations, etc. This avoided the collateral damage caused by air raids, and was often more effective than crude saturation bombing. One notable success was Harry Rée's sabotage of the Peugeot works at Sochaux, which were pumping out parts for German panzer divisions on the Eastern Front. Rée was an Englishman born to an immigrant father and an agent in the Special Operations Executive, the British organization tasked with helping the French Resistance. SOE operatives agents were sent to France, usually dropped in by parachute, with money and equipment to organize sabotage. They were also a political tool for the Allies, since unlike the myriad of squabbling resistance groups, SOE agents were loyal directly to London. Rée linked up with resistors and made contact with workers inside the Peugeot factory, supplying them plastic explosives. The workers used them to blow up the factories turbine compressors and electricity transformers, putting its production lines out of work for months. Rée was particularly pleased because he was a pacifist and worried that an RAF attack would cost hundreds of lives, reflecting that it was "‘a wonderful job for an ex-conscientious objector to stop bombing by blowing up machinery.".
I hope that answers your question. I wanted to provide a brief overview of all resistance activities rather than just their paramilitary tactics, but let me know if I overlooked what you wanted to find out. For a good glimpse of what life looked life for an average resistance group, I really recommend Jean Pierre Melville's film L'armée des ombres/Army of Shadows. It follows a cell of urban resistors and is remarkably unsentimental about their operations, which consist mostly of things like smuggling typewriters and radios, sending signals to the British, finding a traitor. Most of what they do is unglamorous and mundane, about staying alive rather than hurting the Germans, who they seldom encounter. Melville's chief theme is the unrelenting paranoia that follows these people who face betrayal and torture every day, and who will never know if their actions will have any payoff.
Violent resistance grew in frequency over the course of the war as well and stemmed mostly from the communists and rural groups called the maquis. French communists had already been driven underground prior to the war by the government, but initially they did not oppose the German occupation because of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. After the invasion of the Soviet Union, however, the communist resistance became very active and was the first to commit violence acts against the Germans, the first of which was the assassination of a German naval officer on board a Paris train in August 1941. Such actions came at a steep cost, however, because German policy was to execute scores of innocent French hostages for every German who was harmed. Because of the German policy of vicious reprisal - for example, the killing of a German officer in Nantes in October 1941 led to the execution of 48 French prisoners - most groups avoided violent acts and both De Gaulle and the British opposed, preferring that resistance groups wait until the landings in France to spring into action. The price for killing Germans was simply too high for most people and this alienated the communists from other groups to some degree, as well as the Allies, who rarely helped communist organizations as they did others. Communists had to rely on what they could find themselves to hit back at the Germans - one tactic was to loiter near train stations and steal rifles when German soldiers leaned them against the wall.
Army of Shadows provides a good look at the quieter, more common side of the resistance, but there's also plenty of good primary sources you can read featuring more daring exploits. Lucie Aubrac's memoir is a great read about the author's experiences of, well, outwitting the Gestapo in Lyon. I also like this short account by Robert Kehoe, an American agent who was dropped into Brittany to help the maquis, which you can read online:

Mon papy me disait sur les Espagnols ayant fui Franco étaient tous gentils, mais qu’ils avaient tous des armes de cachés chez eux. Est-ce vrai, malgré l’exagération?
