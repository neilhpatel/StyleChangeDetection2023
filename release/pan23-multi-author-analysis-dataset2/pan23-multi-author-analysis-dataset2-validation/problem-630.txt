Yes, but the phrase," Need To Know" applies so much to this. Once you leave office and you are no longer part of the governmental process, you do not need to know.
There’s a decent case to be made for former presidents having some need to know. What they say and do after leaving office can still carry great weight purely because of the position they used to hold.
Say, for example, there are secret negotiations ongoing with a coutnry with which we have a historically tense relationship. A former POTUS might go on record disparaging that nation on issue X (or just generally), which could damage the success of those negotiations. It therefore might be prudent to let that former POTUS know about the negotiations to withhold from making such comments publicly.
