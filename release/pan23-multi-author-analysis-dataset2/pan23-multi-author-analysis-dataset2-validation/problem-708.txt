It all comes down to who owns the equipment. Do you have a renters insurance policy that may extend coverage to your property? Time doesn't matter, it's who owns it.
Who owns the damaged equipment? Homeowners coverage will only cover items owned by the homeowner him/herself. Friends property damage and such wouldn't be covered by that policy. Each of you would need to use your own renters insurance or otherwise for your own property.
Okay, his parents own the house, however the band equipment is split between 3 of us. Would each of us need to be using our own insurance? Is there any grace period where my stuff has been at his house over a year and therefor covered?
His equipment would be covered as a dependent of his parents. The rest of the stuff may have no coverage. Also note that insurance fraud by lying about who owns the stuff can put you in a really bad position.
Edit: this would be flood coverage, it all depends if they have flood insurance. There may be no coverage for damage from flooding at all. The homeowners need to review what coverage they have.
