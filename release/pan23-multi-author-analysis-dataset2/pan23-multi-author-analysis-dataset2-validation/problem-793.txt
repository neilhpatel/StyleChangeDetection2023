Makes sense. We are really good for exporting our armoured vehicles. Unfortunately, we have this terrible habit of selling them to the Saudi regime to be used to kill Yemeni.
I was about to say it’s probably more like ammo than any particular weapons systems. Or possibly refurbishing damaged Russian weapons collected in the field.
Not sure, but modern weapons would need a different metal composition (?), so youd have to melt them down, split the different metals and then remake these into new weapons.
I think they are better off using these broken tanks as spare part supplies or as decoys. Just plaster a fat white + on the top of the tank and Russia may strike it over other targets. The fat white + takes only a few seconds but it could help.
A tank isn't a piece of metal though, it's a mix of many materials. So you have to disassemble it into individual parts and recycle those separately. And many of the parts are full of odd alloys and compounds that make them really hard to reuse. Contamination that's hard to remove, basically.
"Copper in steel causes metallurgical problems, but is pervasive in end-of-life scrap and cannot currently be removed commercially once in the melt. Contamination can be managed to an extent by globally trading scrap for use in tolerant applications and dilution with primary iron sources.".
The commenter above you is flat out wrong. Mixed metals are not viable to separate in many cases, and in some cases the process is absurdly difficult. It's far cheaper to use ore.
The recycled inputs at a steel mill are mostly industrial scrap. So they know fairly well what's in them, chemically speaking. Almost all of it's some grade of plain steel. At the other end of the spectrum, most copper wire scrap gets tossed if it has insulation on it, the cost of removing the insulation is higher than the value of the copper. And if you put enough copper in the steel? There's no practical way to remove it, and the steel is basically unusable.
Another idea is using the tanks armor to build smaller defensive installations alongside a road and similar, or using them as storage by putting spare ammo or winter gear inside them. An armored supply cache, so to speak.
It wouldn’t break my heart if a plausible rumor started going around that Ukraine has now developed their own nuclear bomb. Tell me Putin wouldn’t shit a brick.
No, it isn't. Because the first thing your have to do is completely dismantle the vehicle to separate all the different components. You can't just toss the tank in a furnace and expect there to be any way to use the results.
