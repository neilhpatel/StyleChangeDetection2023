You can make a police report that explicitly draws their attention to the correspondence between the two, which might be useful to the medical examiner and the police investigators who are assuming, probably correctly, that your friend died by suicide.
You're probably thinking about the two recent Massachusetts cases that resulted in homicide charges against women who actively participated in encouraging their partners to kill themselves. Those were extreme cases and are very unlikely to be used by prosecutors in South Carolina as a guideline for filing homicide charges based on speech, even speech as awful as the messages you describe.
The two cases in Massachusetts included a more extensive degree of harassment (hundreds of messages per day for months) and a very close in time relationship between knowing about the peril their partner was in and attempting to convince them to go forward with the suicide.
To my knowledge, literally no one has ever been prosecuted for such a crime in South Carolina. It's not impossible that your county has a prosecutor eager to build on Massachusetts precedent; after all the conviction was upheld against an appeal, then turned down for hearing at the US Supreme Court.
I made a more detailed post above, but want to reiterate that I am truly sorry for your loss, regardless of the potential crimes or potential lack thereof involved here.
Again: I am not telling you that your anguish and anger are not valid. I am just advising you that you should temper your expectations of criminal prosecution.
You mentioned a very close time relationship, do you mean the woman knew her husband was suicidal at that moment and still continued to harass him until he did it?
In at least one case, the sender had knowledge that the suicide was in progress and failed to act. She also provided specific suggestions for completing the suicide during the act.
The so-called "Conrad's Law" in Massachusetts never passed; it was re-introduced in the legislature this week.
Most states have a law against assisted suicide. Most of them don't attempt to criminalize speech, instead drawing a bright line at the method or act. Some arose during the Kevorkian era, others (like SC) in opposition to death-with-dignity laws, threatening the licenses of healthcare professionals.
I have been unable to find any convictions under South Carolina Code 16-3-1090(b)(1), the section that makes it a felony crime to:
I recently read a Georgetown Law Review article on the topic, and those researchers could not find a US case in which only verbal communication, or coercion by a person who is absent from the scene, resulted in a conviction. These laws don't get tested against the 1st Amendment often because they are so uncommonly used. Virtually all "inducement" homicide convictions involve literally giving the decedent a loaded gun.
But I doubt that they will find that solely verbal encouragement to suicide is criminal in South Carolina.
Sorry if I came off rude, it wasn’t my intention. I’m not well aware of what happened in Massachusetts so I was just wondering what could be different.
I obviously haven't read OP's friend's correspondence. It's possible that it contains a threat to him or his children so clear and present that it constitutes duress. OP can certainly encourage police to investigate that venue and point them to the law.
Again, OP, I am so sorry to hear of your loss. If you're feeling desperate in your sorrow, go talk to someone you trust, and if they're not around, call .
I personally don’t have the screenshots, but my friend’s sister had all of his phone records pulled. I was made aware of the texts Friday night by him, two days before he died. He texted me Friday night telling me she was leaving him and he wanted to kill himself. We talked Friday, on Saturday we made plans to see each other this week and on Sunday he died.

There was a very controversial manslaughter conviction in MA for something similar, only in that case, there was a key difference in the text sender having knowledge of the suicide being in progress and failing to act, IIRC. (This — omissions, or failure to act — is also generally allowed in the U.S. with some specific exceptions.).
It’s just so suspicious because she was the only one there when he died. She just happened to go to their home at 4 am when he was drunk and alone. She knew he was suicidal, she saw him texting his friends for help. She undoubtedly pushed him to take his life, she took advantage of his emotions and now no one will listen….
I’m not a therapist, but I think the most important thing you can do right now is get support for yourself. The reality is your friend made a decision I very much with they hadn’t made, and it likely involved many factors. The law isn’t always equipped to deal with terrible situations, and this sounds like a case that might be outside of the scope of what the law covers.
It’s possible the police believe you about the texts, but don’t think they rise to the level of a crime. What your friend’s girlfriend did was terrible, but your friend isn’t alive to testify that the texts contributed to the suicide. Suicide is complicated and generally involves lots of factors. If the texts did play a part in your friend’s decision, it’s unclear what part they played and how a court could assign liability to the sender without being able to determine that. The texts would probably be grounds for a harassment complaint, but your friend isn’t able to make that complaint and say they felt harassed. Others have pointed to an SC law that criminalizes one compelling another to commit suicide “by force or duress,” but texting another person nasty messages is unlikely to qualify. (Your friend was not held at gunpoint and told to hurt themselves, nor threatened with specific harm if they did not hurt themselves, etc.).
