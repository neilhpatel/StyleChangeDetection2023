I'd go through my insurance and let them subrogate, it's going to be much easier than suing the mechanic yourself in small claims court (an attorney wouldn't be worth it, probably). But you're owed the actual cash value of the Ranger, not work that went into it, nor any mental anguish. Your GF should monitor her injuries and make sure nothing gets worse in the days or weeks ahead, and handle that separately if something does develop.
More than insurance? Maybe. You'd need to prove the mechanic didn't put on the lug nuts. Did they already admit that in writing, how would you prove it in court, what's the evidence, does the police report indicate that the lug nuts were removed? The judge will have to be convinced, but judges are also not dumb, they can connect the dots. Can you prove that there were no lug nuts on the car? If so, then that may lead back to the mechanic convincingly enough. If you win a case against the mechanic, you'll have to allow for an appeals period, them start the process of collecting, which can take time. So much time in fact that the law gives you ten years to collect, and then you can usually renew it for another ten years. You might also be able to get insurance to handle one aspect, and sue the mechanic for another aspect, but be mindful of the mechanic signing something with insurance agreeing to not be liable for anything else. You you can just sue for your deductible.
If I went the small claims route with self representation could I get more back? It just seems like this is a way bigger deal than a car crashing. Like tightening down lug nuts is probably the most basic thing that a mechanic needs to do.
The only evidence I have is a receipt detailing the work that was done and then 1 week and somewhere around 100 miles later the accident. The lug nuts by necessity were off at the time of the crash, otherwise the wheel would not have come off. In the police report my gf told the officer that she had just picked the truck up from the mechanic and had work done in the area of that wheel. Is that not sufficient evidence?
Also, are you saying that even if I do win the case, it could take 10 or even 20 years to ever see that money?
Right, but you have to prove every element. You have to prove the lug nuts were left off ("more likely than not" or 51% chance). You have to prove the wheel came off, etc. At least 51% likely. And yes, once you win, you have to .
At first I thought you were joking, but no my girlfriend did not check it. I've never heard of this being a recommendation and certainly my mechanic never said anything about it.
I would suspect this would be the mechanic's standard response. It's been stated aby time I've ever had work done and is usually on a piece of paper as well when I've picked up. Maybe they don't all do that but most I've been to have.
I'd say most people don't do it but most of the experiences I've had they recommend it and if they did and it wasn't done that may prove difficult for you.
