Could file a wage claim for the difference that first wage period because they never notified you of this lower wage, but it would be legal going forward.
Meh, I usually make $20 an hour working construction during the summer and I turn 18 in two months so I can make that mor permanent once school is out of the way. Not to shabby if you ask me 🤷‍♂️ and who said I was “that angry”? I’ve been on my own for a year and half now, working for $8.50 isn’t enough for anyone to be happy. $10 isn’t. Just saying we could do better as a country.
I know for a fact I was making more before that. I actually put my two weeks in almost two weeks ago and already have a different job but I was just pissed I wasn’t getting paid what I thought I was getting and thought I was getting bellow minimum wage.
Although in MN it is uncommon for minor to be paid less than the states minimum wage it is legal to paycheck at a lower amount. Minors under q8 can be paid as little as 8.21 an hour. However if you were told a different amount bring it up to the manager.
