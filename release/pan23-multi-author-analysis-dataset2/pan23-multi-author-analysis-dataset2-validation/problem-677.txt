Anyone know how China handled the spread in the beginning? Currently 18% of the total Chinese population have been infected in the past 20 days. Seems as though they have no herd immunity whatsoever.
They handled it by completely locking down any and every city that showed a single positive case. Literally welding shut apartment blocks.
I know you aren't going to believe me (on account of my actually living in China) but they didn't weld shut apartment blocks.
Everybody thought that 1 million number was bullshit, and it was much higher, but with how hard they locked down before, combined with how fast it's spreading now, like they're first dealing with it, maybe it wasnt.
They closed things off (often in stupid, ugly, counterproductive ways) so that there was only a single controllable access point.
One of the tipping points to the opening up was nationwide protests over a fire in Xinjiang which killed something more than 10 people because the emergency exits which are usually blocked for dumb ass reasons like "thieves will use them," "it's winter," and "where else do I store my large pile of flammable recyclables until the price is better" were blocked for Covid controls.
