Depending on your state, you may be able to drop off your excess to a local pharmacy that accepts unneeded or unnecessary RX medication.
I think a 90 day supply would be about the most "reasonable" you could stockpile, if that's the max a pharmacy can distribute.
CALL AHEAD to ensure they have a secure drop off box before you go. Most you just drop off in the rx bottle and leave. It's anonymous as they don't follow up with you as it's a "safe" location. You don't want to be transporting then illegally either.
Better question: how much of your 18 month supply is past it's expiration date? Meds like Adderall will lose their potency after a time and you're better off ditching the excess and not risking potential consequences (both legal and medical/behavioral).
But I, personally, am unaware of any potential legal consequences for you possessing excess drugs prescribed to you. That being said, it doesn't prevent the state from believing that you possess such a large quantity for the purpose of distribution. They'd probably need more than just the quantity to convict, but that's little consolation when you've been arrested and charged while it's figured out.
