If we want to keep things concise and simple, Richard White’s The Republic For Which It Stands, is unquestionably the best one-volume analysis of the American Gilded Age on the market, at least as far as I’m aware. White is an excellent writer, as detailed as he is concise, and skilled at weaving together all of the pieces of American culture and history that made the Gilded Age a reality. If you’re crunched for time or don’t feel like embarking on the following odyssey that introduces all of the pieces and trusts you to put them together yourself, stop reading here and check out Richard White; I promise you won’t be disappointed. If not, read on and buckle up.
Edit: Sorry it sounded like I'm brushing off what you wrote, you've given me several books to add to my reading list. I didn't realize that the causes of it reached so far back into history so I can't wait to learn more about that.
If you want to follow the theme instead of the chronology, skip to the next paragraph and then double back to this one, as you’ll see in a moment. The second substantial event in the 1840s was the Mexican-American War, which I’ve written about at lenh on this sub before, and this is relevant to our discussion because it established the United States as a military power in its own right, capable of scuffling with other sovereign nations that it neighbored. While the War of 1812 saw some rather humiliating losses, the Mexican-American War, while not without its downsides, was a decisive victory for the United States that both expanded territory and demonstrated military superiority. It would also be the dress rehearsal for the Civil War, where men like Grant, Lee, Sherman, and Jackson learned to be generals, but that’s more of an ancillary study than particularly relevant to our discussion of the Gilded Age. For an analysis of the Mexican-American War, I recommend Robert Merry’s A Country of Vast Designs, which looks at both the war and the President who waged it, James Polk. If you want a more thorough study of President Polk, who more or less embodied the spirit of Manifest Destiny with his clear political goals and his “my way or the highway” attitude, Walter Borneman’s Polk is one of the best resources on the man. Additionally, if you want to fill in the gaps between the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican-American War, there’s no better book that I’ve ever read than Daniel Walker Howe’s What God Hath Wrought.
To really understand the Gilded Age, you first have to start with at least a basic understanding of Manifest Destiny and the idea that the growing United States had an obligation to continue growing geographically, economically, and as a national power. Considering America’s rocky start as an offshoot of the British Empire and their role largely being that of a pawn in the tussle between European superpowers, it’s easy to see how generations of young American men felt that their own nation needed substantial growth and it was their responsibility to lead the charge.
The absolute latest you can start in your understanding of the Gilded Age is with the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which first introduced Americans to the concepts of A) buying and selling territory on a global scale and B) expanding the borders of their nation to exploit the resources within. An excellent and accessible book on this is Stephen Ambrose’s Undaunted Courage, which explores both of these concepts, starting as a study of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and analyzing it in terms of its immediate and future impact.
Next, let’s examine the westward expansion that followed the Mexican-American War in the California Gold Rush, when countless miners and fortune-seekers moved to the West Coast in order to strike it rich. Again, this is where we see the personal excellence and prosperity beliefs that embodied the Gilded Age come to life, as men left their father’s trades and set out to earn vast riches in a hostile, unknown land. The best book I’ve read on the subject - admittedly, the only one since I was 10 - is Richard Lingenfelter’s Gold Lust and Silver Sharks. While occasionally bogged down with details about the mining towns and the politics therein, this is still an excellent resource that examines the California Gold Rush in the years between 1848 and 1884. There’s also a companion/sequel entitled Copper Kings and Stock Frenzies, but it more discusses the specifics of the mining industry and I wouldn’t call it necessary for your study. Fascinating and worth a read, yes, but not quite necessary. While you’re in this time period, Paul Andrew Hutton’s The Apache Wars is an excellent, if rather depressing, overview of the United States’ complicated and violent relationship with the natives.
Strangely enough, we’re actually going to skip over the most significant event of the 1860s, the American Civil War, and focus on the second most significant event - the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, which linked the two halves of the United States and opened the West up to unprecedented growth and prosperity. For this event, I’ve read two different books and recommend them both, the first being Stephen Ambrose’s Nothing Like It In The World and the second being David Howard Bain’s Empire Express. Ambrose is more concise, Bain is more detailed, and both are excellent. I would probably recommend starting with Ambrose and if you want more detail and you’ve got the time, check out Bain’s.
Okay, we’ve finally made it to the 1870s and the proper beginning of the Gilded Age, but it’s important to remember that no one of the time looked up from their newspaper at breakfast and told their wife “honey, we’re living in the Gilded Age!” Instead, it was simply a continuation of the ongoing growth and prosperity of the United States. I digress.
Which of these talks about what life would be like for an average person at the time, or do all touch on it? Also, do you have a reading recommendation for Muckrakers? Hearing about them always inspired me and I'd love to learn more.
That’s a fair question, and I didn’t get that impression at all! I’ll be honest, nothing really comes to mind for me on the question of life for an average person at the time. That’s a gap in my knowledge, for sure. For the Muckrakers, I would check out Doris Kearns Goodwin’s The Bully Pulpit; she contrasts the consecutive presidencies of Roosevelt and Taft, both Progressives who dealt with the Muckrakers to varying degrees. Highly, highly recommend.
