I'm not familiar with Georgia, but it's likely that they will offer you a chance to meet with the prosecuting attorney to negotiate a resolution. They have plenty of incentive to make this easy for you, they don't want to have trials for every traffic summons.
They can offer you a plea deal which will be lower than the maximum penalty. You aren't obligated to accept this, and they aren't obligated to offer one(they almost certainly will).
So I guess when I go in I will just see what they ask for, but this is giving me a much better idea of what to expect. Thanks!
Don't get too worried about the court procedures. Most people are new to all of it. It's a little intimidating, but people a lot less smart than you have managed to go through it.
Before you talk to the prosecutor, you won't be pleading anything. Plea bargains are only for people who are willing to admit to (at least) sufficient facts to find a guilty verdict. The prosecutor won't be asking about your guilt, and you shouldn't offer that information.
Do they offer plea deals after I say I’m guilty or is that something else? Sorry, never been to court before and don’t know how this works.
If you accept a plea deal, it'll require you to either plead guilty, plead no contest, or admit to sufficient facts to find you guilty. I don't know which they'd use for this, it'll depend on the court and possibly the prosecutor. The judge will receive the agreement, and walk you through the plea process(it's just a bunch of questions).
If you are unsure of what's going on, and you are asked for your plea, it's safer to say "not guilty". You can always change your plea.
What county are you in? What is the timeframe of when you got the ticket/when your court date is? Some counties in Georgia offer an option to get a standing order that can reduce this down to an ordinance violation... but the timelines are strict if I remember correctly. I’m not sure the frequency of these violations being treated as “fix it tickets” in Georgia. (IANAL).
Thank you for your reply I am in Floyd county. I got the ticket at the end of December and my court date is in a few days. I’m probably out of that timeframe, but I’ll take a look.
