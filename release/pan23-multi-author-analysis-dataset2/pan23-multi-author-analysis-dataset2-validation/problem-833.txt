Stuff like this shows up on QI or in encyclopedias of “weird facts” or whatever, which always make me suspicious that it’s just made up - but in this case it’s real, more or less!
The phrase shows up on the tombs of two physicians: Khouy, from around the 28th century BC, found near the pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara; and Ir-en-akhty, from the First Intermediate Period (around the 23rd century BC), in the “Giza west field”, west of the pyramid of Khufu.
I’ve been able to find pictures and discussions of Ir-en-akhty’s tomb so I can talk about that one. The title has been transliterated in various ways - neru phuyt, neru pehut, or the more academic transliteration nrw phw.t. Egyptian didn’t record short vowels, so Egyptologists mostly just guess what they might have been or leave them out entirely.
Ir-en-akhty’s tomb was discovered and transcribed by Hermann Junker, who wrote about it in German, but fortunately the hieroglyphs have also been described in English by Richey L. Waugh. There are transcriptions of it in Junker’s book but it looks like he switched two of the glyphs around…Nunn’s book and the article by Viso and Uriach have photos of the actual tomb. I can’t embed an image in this post, and I don’t think I can type the whole thing in Unicode, but here is a screenshot of the transcription in the correct order in Waugh’s book:
Hieroglyphs can be ideograms, where a picture represents the thing it’s a picture of, but they can also have phonetic values, and sometimes they just combined all of them together so there are three or four glyphs for one sound. This one starts out with a combination of glyphs representing the sounds nr, followed by a vulture, which also has the phonetic value of nr. As a verb, nr can refer to being a master, being victorious, being terrifying; they’re followed by the glyph of a bull, and the whole combination means a master of herd animals, a shepherd or a herdsman, or a guardian in general. These three glyphs are then, of course, followed by the ideogram of a shepherd!
The next glyphs represent the verb phw meaning “to arrive at the end of a journey”, and in the middle they’ve included the glyph for “hind-quarters of a lion or leopard”, which also happens to sound like ph. So the verb for “arriving at the end”, combined with a glyph that both sounds like that verb and looks like a butt, means it’s the noun “anus”. Altogether, it means shepherd/herdsman/guardian of the anus (just anus, not "royal anus").

ḥt (or khet, as Nunn transliterated it) is the stomach, so a swnw khet is the physician of the stomach (i.e. "physician of the stomach of the great house" = court stomach physician).
So is nrw phw.t. just a more poetic way of saying khet per aa? Bowel shepherd vs gastroenterologist? Or was it more personal like the English Groom of the Stool?
"per aa" is pr a, the great house or the royal court, which is actually where we get the word "pharaoh".
𓈖𓂋 are phonetically n and r. They should be combined into one glyph (the n on top of the r) but apparently you can't do that in Unicode. 𓅐 is a vulture, the word for which sounded like "nr", so it represents the phonetic sequence. "nr" also meant master, etc., so combined with the ideogram of the bull 𓃒, it means shepherd, followed by the actual ideogram for shepherd, 𓀸.
I think I found all the glyphs in Unicode, but I didn't want to mess up the formatting of the initial answer so I'll put them here in a reply:
Two final caveats: whenever someone asks about getting a tattoo in a foreign language on Reddit, everyone warns them that they should really really make sure it's correct; and relatedly, this is far, far beyond my usual area of expertise, so if I’ve made any mistakes, hopefully a real Egyptologist will correct me.
𓊪 is phonetically p, 𓎛 is phonetically ḥ (with a dot underneath in a more scientific transcription, like Arabic ح and Hebrew ח, not like English h). 𓅱 is phonetic w, and 𓏏 is phonetic t (here a grammatical ending for a feminine word). Add 𓄖 in between and it means "anus" (or perhaps all the intestinal tract in general).
Why did they use nrw instead of swnw for the other end of the intestinal tract? I don't know. I don't think it's meant to be like a Groom of the Stool since it's clearly a list of medical titles. I want to guess that it's sort of a metaphor for making sure things come out that end properly, like a shepherd directing his flock, but I honestly have no idea.
