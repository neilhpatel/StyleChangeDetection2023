Raising livestock of any kind for commercial purposes such as food production is a messy business and herds have always been susceptible to outbreaks of various diseases throughout history. These risks are acceptable because food production is necessary, and people eat meat.
Of course there’s always a risk when you have large numbers of animals living close together but the squalid conditions and the way they’re kept literally on top of each other is another pandemic waiting to happen.
Even worse, we've also had several confirmed cases of avian flu spreading to wild animals in Montana recently, so the minks are not a one-off mutation.
Then I realized Minks are mammals. It is worse and creating a environment for easier adaptation. It's the intermediary selecting a virus, ensuring it is suited for infecting us.
The current avian flu outbreak is on track to be that largest in history, just counting domestic fowl, and now it's jumped to multiple mammal species in the Americas and Eurasia.
Right now, human civilization is extremely vulnerable to zoonotic viruses. If we don't change the underlying conditions that make us vulnerable, we're rolling the dice every year.
We don't know that it will. If birds can infect mammals, that's bad for agriculture, but it won't reach pandemic level in humans unless mammal-to-mammal spread is also easy.
The US and Canada weren't able to get good data on mammal-to-mammal spread in the Montana outbreak in wild animals.
I don't know what the protocols in Spain are; Can they study spread in those minks, or do they have to euthanize and incinerate all of them ASAP to limit the risk of further spread?
Also alarming is that the article referenced hemorrhagic pneumonia in the Mink. There are flu variants that cause hemorrhagic symptoms such as petechiae but generally in the severest cases only. It's not inconceivable that the flu could mutate both for adaptability in humans but also in other unpredictable ways.
If it did go full pandemic, it's likely the mortality ratio would come down some, especially in countries with robust and modern health care. Sometimes, a virus will trade some mortality for mobility, but current data suggests a roughly 50% mortality ratio worldwide, so even if it reduced to half of that, it would still have the ability to challenge for the deadliest pandemic in history as well as decimate our world as its currently constructed.
