“The Service may link to, integrate with, or incorporate third party content, sites, services, or platforms, including advertisers, online merchants, and social networks.” refers to THEM being allowed to use third party services, not you. They have no obligation to let you play the game.
No, technically they would appear to be correct, based on what you've described. Your emulator is likely the exact sort of third party tool they do not permit for their game.
And if you read the context around the provision you cited, it likely outlines that this applies to their side of the contract. That they can link the game to other services, but that doesn't mean you can.
Also if there are plenty of other players using this emulator and posting on social media platforms and YouTube surely they should get suspended too and not just me a single player.
