This is somewhat common with temp/placement/service provider agencies -- the contracts they have with their client companies to provide manpower/personnel frequently prohibit those clients from directly hiring those placed through the temp/placement/service provider agency for some period of time.
If they didn't have these clauses, the clients would simply use the MSP to find them qualified personnel, then cut out the MSP entirely and hire the personnel directly for much cheaper than they're paying the MSP, effectively exploiting the MSP as an employee screening service, and making it difficult for the MSP to make any kind of profit and stay in business.
This doesn't have anything to do with you, directly, though -- those clients are free to directly hire you, it's just that they may have to shell out a bunch of money to your employer for doing so, as per their contract with the MSP.
The places you apply to might be under contract with your former employer saying that if they directly hire you, they owe the MSP some sum of money. But you're not a part of that agreement -- that's something between the company you're applying to and the MSP.
Certainly there are companies you could apply to that are not clients of your current employer and therefore not bound by such a contract clause?
As /u/Aghast_Cornichon said, you can ask your currently employer if they would allow the prospective company you want to apply to out of their contract (or waive that particular clause in their contract). A setting of expectations would be appropriate, as that indeed would be lost money for your employer -- they'd no longer be able to sub you out to that company and generate the profit that helps keep them in business.
It is completely standard for contract providers of technical or consulting services to put "anti-poaching" clauses into their agreements with their clients.
You can ask your current employer to release your potential employer from that contract obligation, or go to work for one of the companies your current employer has no such agreement with.
