Numerous details point to this being the real thing and not simply a mock-up. This represents the second (disputed, could actually be 1st) known 6th generation aircraft development to date after the US NGAD project which is rumored to have already taken flight. Although this aircraft has not yet flown, it will begin ground testing and flight tests next year. There are reportedly up 6 others already under construction, probably there are more. The design of the plane allows for modular enhancements to take place seamlessly in the future to accommodate new weapons, and to overcome future threats. The radar cross section of the older b-2 spirit is highly classified, however it is likely around or slightly above 0.0001m^2, the average size of a bumble bee, likely no bigger than a locust. This aircraft will reap the benefits of over 50 years of stealth technology, and will leverage these advancements to a degree never seen before.
I think the lack of shots of the rear are because the bigger changes/advances are back there, but again, I'm probably wrong because I'm the opposite of an expert in any of this.
