Watching c-span today they said something along the lines of 3 republicans(not confident all are Republicans) had medical/family stuff come up and might not be there for any more votes, does this make it to where Jeffries would be closer to becoming speaker?
Giving seats (Chairs, specifically) to Democrats would not go over well. First, because trading them to Democrats means they don't have control of those committees (a major issue if they want to actually produce agenda-driven legislation), but also because every committee they give away is one less to bargain with among their own members.
Because they would have to bargain with Democrats. Democrats would want things in return. They wouldn't be stupid enough to take IOUs or future promises (we promise to raise the debt ceiling cleanly... hahaha not) which means that they would have to sacrifice the only thing they can actually give away - committee seats.
A subset of republicans would refuse to vote for whoever democrats voted for thus nullifying the number anyway.
Democrats don't want to help republicans look good. The American people need to know what a disaster they are.
All of that is potentially solvable, but there's always the optics problem at the end of the day. You can be damn sure that if certain Republicans bargain with Democrats to get elected Speaker, Democrats will make damn sure the public knows what went down and Republicans will be punished for it, the same way those who elected to convict Trump were punished (all but 1 lost their seat).
I mean, if the far right nutters, like Boebert's group of 19-20 looked like they were going to hijack the house, there might be a secret deal in place to elect someone a conservative.
