OP, I am sincerely sorry, but I have to lock this post now because you're starting to get poor answers and a lot of off-topic commentary. You've gotten as much advice as we can give here, as like u/agirlbrushedgray states in the top comment - Medical malpractice is very fact-dependent. It's not possible for us to assess here to any degree of certainty.
Medical malpractice is very fact dependent (and can be difficult to prove), so consulting a good one that practices in this area is important. You can Google or ask other lawyers for recommendations.
It will likely be difficult for litigation to proceed until the actual existence and extent of any birth injury is known. You said that the child is receiving neuroprotective care to “prevent or mitigate” damage and providers think if any damage exists it may be “minor.” A key element in litigation is damage/harm/injury. Until that is known about this child, it may be difficult to proceed with litigation.
After the child’s treatment ends, your family may request the the mother’s complete medical record AND the child’s complete medical record (these will be two separate records) from the hospital to have a documentation of all the care received there. They may also save any assessments/evaluations/care completed and provided now and in the future by professionals for the child. However, it may be a year or two (or much longer) before a professional could reasonably ascertain whether the child is developmentally on track, if any developmental or neurological issues exist and are a result of birth (and not some other genetic or other health condition), long-term effects, and treatment options. Birth-injury claims can take a long time.
In the meantime, your family has already filed an internal complaint at the hospital. However, they can contact the hospital’s patient advocate/ombudsman for resources and support, birth injury support groups for resources and support, and file complaints with the medical board in Texas against the licenses of the child’s providers who they believe gave poor care.
Hijacking the top comment to say I’m a medical malpractice attorney, but not in Texas. I would certainly talk to an attorney sooner rather than later and would NOT wait until the child starts to develop the injury. Although the statute of limitations for the child may be longer, personal injury statute of limitations in Texas is two years.
I handle all the wrongful birth and baby cases at my firm. These cases are litigated for, on average, two years. I see plenty of cases filed while the child is young and records regarding the child’s progress are added into the record as the case proceeds.
I would not wait and would google plaintiffs attorneys in your area who takes only medical malpractice cases—they’re more likely to know what they’re doing. Good luck!
IANAL but am a labor and delivery nurse. It seems like you misunderstood some of what happened. While they are devastating, poor outcomes don't necessarily mean malpractice. Giving birth has so many risks, and even if the doctor does everything by the book, bad things can still happen. Having a baby in the NICU is emotional and stressful, so that may be influencing your feelings about your wife and baby's care.
Edit to add: some County hospitals do have sovereign immunity in certain states. Most doctors in hospitals are classified as independent contractors—therefore they are not employees of the hospital and can still be sued. The doctor and his group will have their own medical malpractice coverage separate from the hospital. But this is a question for the attorney you consult.
I'm assuming you mean during the delivery. If that's the case, elevated heart rate during delivery are normal (mom is pushing and baby is being squeezed). If there was prolonged tachycardia of either mom or baby during the laboring process that was not addressed, then that could be negligent.
This is not malpractice, but is understandably disappointing. Obstetricians are also surgeons and have many patients. It is possible that your wife's doctor was unable to be there because they were not able to drop what they were doing because they were in the OR or attending to another patient's emergency.
Amniotic fluid aspiration is another inherent risk of giving birth. This does not mean malpractice unless they didn't take measures to resuscitate the baby. Since the baby was sent to the NICU, they most likely were taking those measures.
None if this post is meant to discount your experience, but to offer another perspective on what occurred at the hospital. I wasn't present, so my interpretation of events could be wrong. Having your baby be at risk for brain damage is stressful and traumatizing, and I'm sorry the hospital staff are not being more supportive to you. I wish you and your family the best.
