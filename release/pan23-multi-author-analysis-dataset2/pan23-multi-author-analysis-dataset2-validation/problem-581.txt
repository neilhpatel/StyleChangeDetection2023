Your only legal options are to either go to trial and plead your case in WI or take the deal and do the time that the deal is based on. All other "options" are not legal and out of scope of this sub.
Yea I know those are my two legal options..just getting desperate since my court date is getting closer. Going to trial isn’t an option from this point in my case. I’ve just been reading around on Reddit and people not getting extradited for misdemeanor charges. I know that’s a terrible mindset to have and it’s easy to say “don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time. “ I’m most likely going to take the deal and do the 5 month sentence I just wanted to know what’s the worse that can happen? Just so it can help me not be irrational with my decision making.
So I couldn’t afford a lawyer and I was appointed an public attorney in Wisconsin and he leaves me on read lol. so that’s why I’m on Reddit asking questions but anyways thanks for the advice have a great day.
Second, forget extradition for a moment. If you fail to turn yourself in, you could be charged with felony Escape, which would hang over you until you came back to deal with it. And while they may be touch and go with extradition on misdemeanors, they're WAY more likely to do it with a felony charge.
Reach out to and let them know your situation and your attorneys lack of response. They may be able help you with getting a new lawyer that will be more active in helping you. Also try calling, email, and certified mail to contact your current attorney if necessary.
Also they offered me another deal witch is two years probation but I plead to a felony since they can’t transfer misdemeanor probation state to state. I know the other offer is a lot better just wanted u to know what I’m dealing with.
Third, in response to your comment: I don't know where you're getting the idea that they can't transfer misdemeanor probation to a different state. Probation is probation under the Interstate Compact, and as long as Florida is willing to take it Wisconsin is generally willing to send it along. I've had clients with misdemeanor probation transferred to Florida specifically within the last year, so I know it can be done.
First, most judges around here are requiring in person appearances when jail or prison is on the table specifically to avoid scenarios like this.
Also he’s a public attorney so there’s that. Big thank u for letting me know about the felony escape charges I needed someone to tell me something like that so I can erase my irrational thinking. It’s my first case and it’s all pretty nerve racking. As for the misdemeanor probation transfer my own lawyer told me that since the beginning of my case. I even have screenshots of him telling me it can’t be done which is kinda disappointing. I just feel like he’s not trying at this point and I was worried I’d be in this position. As for my misdemeanor probation maybe Wisconsin really won’t transfer over my probation idk I’m not a lawyer. Thanks for actually taking the time out your day for me you don’t know how much it genuinely means to be I’ve been dragged for the last year with this negativity hanging over my head and I feel like a failure kinda hard to have a great mindset through it.
