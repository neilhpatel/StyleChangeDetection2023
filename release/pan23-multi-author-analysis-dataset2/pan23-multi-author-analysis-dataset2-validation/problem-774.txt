Like many funny and interesting quotes, especially blunt such among men (and women) of high rank, I fear no-one would actually note it down, but rather report perfectly polite conversation in the interest of diplomatic relations. Unless we have some diary or other source that someone believed would be private, I doubt we will ever have an absolute confirmation.
The incident you are referring is, at the very least, not a modern invention. It supposedly took place in the summer of 1881, when the Hawaiian monarch, King Kalakaua, was visiting Britain in the course of a round-the-world tour organised as part of an effort he was making to encourage the recruitment of indentured labour in order to boost the local economy. The exchange between Prince and Crown Prince has been cited and analysed in a number of books, perhaps most notably by David Cannadine, a very well-known British constitutional historian who is currently both President of the British Academy and a professor of history at Princeton. So there is a prima facie case to suppose that the encounter did actually occur, and that the exchange you are interested in happened.
You ask two questions: did Edward actually refer to Kalakaua in such, to us, unacceptable terms, and – if he did – what does this tell us about his views on race and status? I'll answer the second question first by citing Cannadine, whose Ornamentalism offers up the anecdote very early in its first chapter as part of a setting out of Cannadine's core thesis – which is that race was not a significant issue in the British empire, and that class, rank and status all mattered more. Hence, Cannadine argues, so far as Edward was concerned, Kalakaua's position as king was far more significant as an indicator of his status and of how he ought to be perceived than was his Polynesian heritage.
Cannadine goes on to describe the encounter between the king, the Prince of Wales and the German crown prince as "essentially pre-racial", calls the quote you cite a "pithy and trenchant justification" of Kalakaua's presence at the function, and comments:
It's worth pointing out a couple of things at this point: that the quotation itself appears with variations in the various sources I have traced it to – Cannadine's version is: "‘Either the brute is a king, or he's a common or garden n\_\_\_\_\_; and if the latter, what's he doing here?" –  and that the precise circumstances in which it is supposed to have been said also appear to vary somewhat. This is not very encouraging, and Wortham's credentials were those of journalist and satirist, not historian. Still, on the basis that the earliest version of the quote is worth putting on record, Wortham gives it as follows (spelling out the word I have blanked):
So much for the likely meaning of Edward's comment. But did he actually say any such thing? Cannadine offers a footnote revealing that he drew the story from an earlier biography of Edward VII, Magnus's King Edward the Seventh (1967), but this book, when checked, gives no source for the quotation. With a little bit of further searching, though, I have pushed the investigation back a further few decades – the earliest version I have been able to uncover appears, also unreferenced, in another biography, Hugh Wortham's Edward VII, Man and King, which was published in 1931.
What's interesting about all this is that I've been able to find no mention that Kalakaua was on the guest list for the Spencers' soiree, so it appears that the version of events you have heard cannot be quite correct; the story, as told, requires, at the very least, that the King and the Crown Prince were present together at some other, and formal, event during this period. The complaint that Frederick supposedly made to king, I suppose, could well have been made later, and it is not obviously impossible that the two royals did encounter each other, and discuss the king, at the "South Kensinon Museum." But for that conversation to have happened as reported, there must have been some earlier event that summer attended by both the Hawaiian king and the German prince, at which Kalakaua was ranked and placed ahead of Frederick in a formal order of precedence.
The first of these was the Volunteer Review of 9 July, an assembly of some 50,000 British militia troops held for Queen Victoria at Windsor Park. Further details of this event can be had from 'Letter no.53' of a series written by a member of Kalakaua's entourage to chronicle their round-the-world voyage, in the Pacific Commercial Advertiser of 3 September 1881. No.53 records that.
Wortham does not say much about his methodology or the way in which he researched the work. He concludes it with a three-page bibliography which mentions only one primary source, the Campbell-Bannerman papers, , and seem unlikely be his source for this exchange; other than that he cites "the files of The Times", Sidney Lee's multi-volume Life of King Edward VII (1925-27) and 30 or 40 other published works. Lee's work appears to contain no reference to Kalakaua. Quite a number of the others referenced by Wortham might potentially be his original source, or perhaps none of them are – it's just not possible for me to say at present, with all research libraries closed. What I can offer, though, are some further thoughts on the time, the place, the people and the function at which the comment you are interested in was supposedly said.
Cannadine, let's note, appears to differ from Wortham on this matter. His version of events suggests that the event in question was "a party given by Lady Spencer," while Wortham refers to "a party in the Victoria and Albert Museum." But these two events were, in fact, one and the same. The Graphic (16 July 1881) reports that Edward called on Kalakaua on the afternoon of Wednesday 13th, and that same evening "went to Earl Spencer's conversazione at the South Kensinon Museum." The Pall Mall Gazette of the 14th notes that the Crown Prince and Princess were present at the same party. So Edward and Frederick were indeed both present at the function that Cannadine and Wortham say they were. And the fact that the two authors describe the event accurately, but in different terms (that is, one version is not simply an edited-down version of the other) does suggest that there is an ur-source for all this out there somewhere, by the way.
We can say, then, that the King of Hawaii and the Crown Prince of Germany were both present at a military review on 9 July 1881 at which the king was apparently acknowledged at an early point by Queen Victoria. However, a review was not the sort of place where a formal series of presentations, in ranked order, would have been made, and we need to turn to the second meeting of king and crown prince to find a more hopeful reference to an event at which, possibly, Frederick may have taken offence at the order of precedence that was drawn up. This was a royal garden party given for the Queen by the Prince of Wales and his wife at Marlborough House on 14 July. Letter No.54 in the same sequence as that cited above contains an excerpt from the official Court Circular – which was nothing if not a stickler for precise form – and this recorded the notables attending, in order of precedence, in the form.
>at 5 o'clock punctually the artillery salutes announced the Queen's arrival and as her carriage passed by the King, both sovereigns exchanged bows... The Prince of Wales... came up to the Royal standard in his scarlet uniform and bearskin cap, and after shaking hands with King Kalakaua, entered into a short conversation... A little later the Crown Prince of Germany, who looks very fine in his white cuirrassier's uniform, advanced and thanked His Majesty for the hospitality he had extended to his son, Prince Henry of Prussia, when at Honolulu two years ago...
Finally, on 15 July, the King and the Crown Prince met again at a "grand ball" held by the officers of the Second Life Guards at Hyde Park barracks in central London that was also attended by Edward and the two princes' wives. The Court Circular published on 16 July mentions the ball but, as it was not a British royal function, offers no order of precedence. There seems to be no doubt that the Prince of Wales's garden party was the event most likely to have involved some formal display of precedence, and the Advertiser comments that the "invited guests... comprised the entire diplomatic body and their ladies, all prominent members of the aristocracy, the army, the navy, bar and church etc.," whose names "filled four columns of small print in the Morning Post.".
To begin with, Kalakaua was in Britain from 6 to 24 July, 1881. He was very active while there, accepting numerous invitations to social events, and he met Queen Victoria at Windsor and was also received by, and received, both Edward and his wife, and the German Crown Prince, Frederick, and his wife Victoria – who was the eldest daughter of the British queen. There were other encounters as well in what seems to have been a very busy summer, but the activities of notables of such rank were, thankfully for our purposes, very widely reported at the time, which makes it possible to narrow down the possible times and places at which the remark might have been made quite nicely.
On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence that the King – while received very positively in Britain – was the subject of racist discourse at the time. Here Askman notes that.
Is there any evidence of such a gathering? Well, yes – the newspapers of the day do refer to Kalakaua's attendance at least three public events alongside the German Crown Prince that July.
... and he cites a number of contemporary newspapers in support. For example, the London Evening Standard listed a number of Pacific island nations and their rulers, who were dismissively described as “brown-skinned Sovereigns of Kingdoms with unpronounceable names.”.
