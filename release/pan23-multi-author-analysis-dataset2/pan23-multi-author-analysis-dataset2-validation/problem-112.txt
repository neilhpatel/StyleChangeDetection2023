The court order might be an ordinary small claims lawsuit, which the creditor needs in order to make claims against his assets or wages.
Or, it might be (or could eventually turn into) a "debtor examination" hearing, in which he will have to appear and provide some evidence of why he cannot pay and/or that he has no non-exempt assets.
Failing to appear for those debtor examination hearings is the usual reason why you hear of people going to jail because of unpaid debts. In some places the creditor can demand that they appear as frequently as every 90 days or so.
The big problem is that when you owe money like this and don't show up, the court can rule that you are "in contempt of court", issue a "body attachment" warrant for your arrest, and make your bail the amount you owe.
Thank you, granted it will be hard to convince him of this since he always says “you don’t get it people on parole have a different set of rules” and right now he’s saying “they will violate me for not being a good citizen”.
People on parole DO have a different set of rules. The government can intrude into their lives with surprise searches of their homes or blood or urine. They sometimes are restricted in who they can associate with, or where they can travel. If they owe the government money, the government can lean on them very hard to pay it.
If he's worried about getting violated for some other reason, he might be telling you a story about why he doesn't want to go near a courthouse, because they tend to be crawling with Sheriff's deputies.
The biggest issue that might occur besides the loss of money and time is a probation inspection or similar at the same time as the civil court hearing.
Probation officers and judges aren't exactly the type of people that normally compromise very easily.
Unless the plaintiff withdraws the lawsuit, yes. One would show up to court and show receipt of payment in full and the judge should dismiss the case.
I can't tell you what stage his debt lawsuit is at. With just 3 months in arrears, they probably don't have a judgment yet and are just suing him in small claims.
