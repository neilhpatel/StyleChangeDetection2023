So I did attempt to do that of which she despised it and had to leave and go home. I did pick up a small claims packet from court, it’s a bit confusing and I’m not entirely sure it’s the correct paperwork. Do you have any advice on steps to sue someone regarding this. What would it qualify for? Like a small claims, civil lawsuit, breach of contract?
I don't see a state in your post. You'll have to look up if your state allows claims for property (called replevin) in small claims to see you you can sue there.
So last year (October 2020) I gave birth to my son and was moving houses and needed to find a temporary home for my mini horse while I’m moving and getting settled. I wanted to find someone who would temporarily Home her with a signed contract I created stating when I’m settled I would be allowed to have her back. And a woman who used to work for the original breeder where I bought my mini from reached out to me and agreed and signed the contract and the time came where I’m I no position to have her back and she says she never signed it and the horse was never mine and I’ll never see her again.
