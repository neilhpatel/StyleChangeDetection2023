No, we definitely do not know its wind speed. What we have is Michael Rowe's estimates of tornado strenh on the TORRO scale, based on his reading of chronicle accounts in assorted journal articles from the 70s-90s. He puts the 1091 London tornado at "perhaps force T8." This is an F4 or EF5 on the Fujita/Enhanced Fujita scales you might be more familiar with.
This was translated by M. W. Rowe in Extreme Weather: Forty Years of the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation, ed. Robert K. Doe (2016).
I just can't believe Rowe is STILL getting mileage out of the same, like, six stories. I just looked at the bibliography from his chapter in Extreme Weather (I have...kind of an obsession with meteorology)--he cites himself eight times, all articles dealing with historical tornadoes in Britain. "Tornadoes in Medieval Britain." "The Earliest Tornado in Ireland." "The Earliest Tornado in Scotland." "Tornadoes in the British Isles to 1660.".
On the other hand, yes, it was VERY medieval to attribute any kind of disaster to God's wrath upon the wicked (i.e. all people)--either as a warning of what would happen if they did not repent, or as the first step of people having ignored said warnings for too long. The most famous parallel here is probably the 14th century flagellant movements, especially connected to the Black Death.
The foundational account of this tornado (turbo--whirlwind) tracks back to the chronicle attributed to Florentius (Florence), a monk at Worcester. While his actual role in the Chronica is debateable--most scholars assign the actual text to another monk named John--the relevant data here is that the account was placed in the chronicle long after the fact and not in London. (Although if the actual monastic writers were working from earlier notes/a lost text is, well, lost. William of Malmesbury gives a very, very similar account to 'Florentius', which might support the existence of a shared earlier account).
According to the account (), a strong "turbo" marauded through London, damaging or destroying six hundred houses and many churches. Rowe takes the 600 number literally--which he should not--and assumes "destroyed", leading to his high estimation of tornadic strenh.
Additionally, two people died in St. Mary's church, presumably from the roof collapse/destruction. The Chronica attests that several of its beams were sucked up into the whirlwind and flung back to the ground so hard they were reportedly driven several feet into the earth. ("Several"--the account actually claims, oh, 20+ feet, which Rowe also seems to take literally.).
There is a recent translation of William of Malmesbury's Gesta Regum Anglorum (trans. R.A.B. Mynors, Rodney M. Thomson and Michael Winterbottom, Clarendon Press, 1998), but I don't have access to it at the moment.
I'm skeptical of Rowe's estimates of the strenh of various premodern tornadoes. However, it's fun to read about the different storms, and intriguing to see what he--mostly based on the work of Charles Ernest Britton--interprets as "tornado" based on medieval accounts. I admit, sometimes it seems a little bit like modern-day fundamentalist Christians looking at Bible apocalypse accounts and saying, "See? That's DEFINITELY a helicopter!).
Yeah that's what I was thinking too! I'm sure they would have rotted away by now, but archaeologists can always see the remains of wood in the ground, right? The church was destroyed again by the Great Fire in 1666 and rebuilt by Christopher Wren, so I wonder if he would have seen anything during that work...assuming the beams were really blown twenty feet away...or as you say, maybe it never really happened after all...
I'd start with Rowe, "Work of the Devil: Tornadoes in the British Isles to 1660," Journal of Meteorology 24 (1999): 326-38.
Medieval accounts of the 1091 tornado don't say anything about the devil, demons, God, or magic one way or the other. In the Chronica, the story follows immediately on the heels of one about a thunderstorm at Winchester. There, monks perform rituals involving holy water and prayers afterwards, but it's not entirely clear whether they're doing this to ward off the devil or to make reparations for God.
However, plenty of later accounts of tornadoes--and other natural disasters--link them to evil spirits or to divine wrath. The Historia Anglicana outright calls a 1323 tornado in north/east England a "demon" who tore apart a manor house with his talons or claws.
To add onto what makes this kind of reassessment so difficult - I can speak methodologically but I can't meet the sub standards for a top level post - early North American settlers from Europe used the term tornado for hurricanes at times. There's a few references to tornadoes lasting hours, as well as other phenomenon that suggests they're referring to what we'd call a hurricane.
Yes, great point European colonizers do the same thing with animals new to them--equate them to similar Eastern Hemisphere beasts. I've talked about before, if you're interested.
The two main sources are William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester, neither of whom were eyewitnesses, but they're the earliest information we have.
They differ on the day but otherwise they're very similar - maybe one was copying from the other, or they were both using the same earlier source. There are some other later sources as well, but they were just copying from William, and have no additional details.
Neither William or John actually call it a "tornado" since that concept didn't exist yet, but based on the descriptions of the wind and the damage, modern researchers have concluded that that's what it must have been.
Dude is a model of how to sustain a publishing career--and proof that you don't need a fancy professorship to research and write medieval history. .
