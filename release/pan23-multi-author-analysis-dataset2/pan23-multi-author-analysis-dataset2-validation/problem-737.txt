Mueller had no say in it. It was up to Barr and he refused to prosecute a sitting President. This is vastly different. He was caught with highly classified documents. He refused to hand them over and there is proof of him handling them. He IS going to get indicted and prosecuted for that.
I wouldn't underestimate the GOP when it comes to coalescing around a single ticket. That's what happened in 2016. Trump is somehow immune to prosecution and if he gets on the same ticket as desantis than Dems have a lot of work to do.
