That just isn't how the law works. You are misunderstanding something. If you are not a part of the case then they may have already terminated your parental rights. Because the state doesn't take a kid from just one parent. Both parents have their rights limited because the state takes them. So if your have zero standing in the case they may have already terminated your rights since you didn't want to be involved in the case when it happened.
Why were the children removed? Why were you not able to protect them? What was the custody order? Have you been to court? What did they say?
You replied to a bot. But either way, your mental health history is likely part of the problem as well as being looked at as unprotective since it seems like you knew the abuse was happening.
