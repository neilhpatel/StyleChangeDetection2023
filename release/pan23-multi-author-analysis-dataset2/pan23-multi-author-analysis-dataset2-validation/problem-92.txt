Also reference , you might have standing under the "Charge for work done or parts supplied in excess of the estimated price without the knowing consent, orally or in writing, of the customer" with an emphasis on KNOWING consent and not just consent.
I'm not a lawyer, but I used to work in a dealership service department that wasn't a dodge service department. First I'd run this up through the dealerships management ( service manager, general manager, owner). From my understanding the service advisor didn't fully explain that some components may get damaged during the removal of the repair. If that's the case then the dealership should be eating the cost of the repair. I'd still contact your states attorney general and report this. But the easiest solution may be escalating it up the chain of command at the dealership.
You might get more leverage with a case number from the AG to reference. You can also consider contacting corporate if it's that sort of dealership.
The Michigan Motor Vehicle Service and Repair Act provides for reasonable attorney's fees as well at damages. So suing may be worth your while.
If some random person had damaged your car to the tune of $5000, what would you do? You'd call your car insurance provider and put in a claim. I recommend doing the same and letting them work on your behalf. At the very least I'd give them a call and ask for their advice.
IANAL but had to do something similar in a different state. Consider contacting the Michigan State Attorney General's office regarding Consumer Protection complaints. Start .
