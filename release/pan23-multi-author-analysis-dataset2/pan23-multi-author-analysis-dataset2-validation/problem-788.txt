I am part of the union but they are closed weekends unfortunately, so I haven't been able to discuss this with them.
I have meetings with the managers about all the bullying and how there is a colleague going round saying he is going to cut me up. And they just don't care, as I said they make it out to be my problem.
So because I was being bullied it caused me a lot of pain and I ended up having really bad depression to the point I was going to kill my self and I've told management this and it is all documented.
Or they end up making it seems like I am in the wrong by me coming forward, they just talk to me in a disrespectful way making it seem like I am the problem.
I am starting to get better with my depression as I am just trying to focus on other happier things in my life. And focus on hobbies and stuff to keep my mind occupied.
Yes as I was of work for about 2 months and they prescribed me with anti-depressants. This has all been documented at work.
Just hard at the moment with lockdown, so can't really do anything. However, I have just been focusing on other things and hobbies and having fun with my girlfriend.
Glad you are getting help. One thing I have learnt over the years is by saying the words about what's bothering you can have a positive effect on how you cope. You have. I trust your health will continue to improve.
