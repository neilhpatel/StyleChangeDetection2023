It’s a commercial photography studio. If they don’t, what recourse do the staff have? And that’s exactly my gripe, the staff have to pay taxes and my SO is consistently there more than 8 hours every day.
Never sign a non-compete unless they're paying for the time you won't be able to compete. Like if they've got a 2-year non-compete then they've got to give me 2 years worth of salary.
A labor law violation report has fewer rules, and is likely to effectively spawn off wage claims automatically for all relevant employees if it succeeds. As there is a group of people affected, this is likely the better option as it also minimizes the risk of retaliation.
If you decide to try and fight it, the place to start is to (individual) or a (group). There are also you can take (this site has a lot of details and is specific for misclassification).
Thank you for this information! I will discuss with my SO. Do you know if the name of the reporting party for labor law violations is kept confidential? Or will the employers know who reported it?
I would suggest planning around the risk of retaliation, despite it being fairly unlikely. As I mentioned before, if the claim succeeds, retaliation, including termination, is definitely illegal and the status change is predated to even before the claim is filed.
For a wage claim, you can go back up-to three years in California, claiming overtime, payroll taxes, unemployment insurance premiums, worker's comp insurance premiums, and any other employment expense.
Do not be surprised if the company retaliates, though such retaliation is itself illegal in California (under California's whistleblower laws) and you can file for such retaliation, presuming that California law says they should be employees - independent contractors have no such protection. If the company is smart, they will structure the retaliation to make it hard to prove, however keep in mind that judges have seen most forms of retaliation, and it will still be illegal retaliation even if they terminate the contract before a final determination is made in the case.
The government is supposed to try and keep it confidential, unless it becomes specifically relevant to the case, but identifying data can easily be leaked by accident or by a malicious official. Specifically, from the site linked:
Check with your state labour authority. Here in Canada businesses used to call employees independent contractors to avoid paying proper wages or benefits. The government caught on and set a legal definition of a contractor so businesses could not use a loophole to cheat employees. It’s possible your state has done something like that.
No, they are all photographers at the studio, so everything they do is what you’d expect from a photography studio. The employer claims they will make my SO an employee, but they’ve been saying this for a few months, so I don’t believe it. They should have made them all employees from the beginning, but this has been the work arrangement they’ve had for the last 2 years. All 5 photographers are “independent contractors“ according to the employer.
Plus if they're independent contractors then they shouldn't sign a non-compete anyway because they're "independent".
In practical terms it sounds like they got themselves a new lawyer, or one of their employees threatened to sue, and now they're trying to lawyer up really extra hard plus cash grab all their employees rights for free.
