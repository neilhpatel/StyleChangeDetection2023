She owns a house and will inherit some profit shares when her parents pass, things I shouldn't be a part of. I have a large retirement fund growing that she shouldn't have. We have agreed to no alimony, and to keep our possessions, amassed prior to marrying, separate. Also I have student debt that I don't want her responsible for.
If you want an enforceable prenup agreement you need at least one lawyer involved, ideally you want two because one lawyer can't represent both parties. This isn't DIY territory. DIY prenups get tossed almost every single time if they are challenged. If you can't afford the costs of getting a proper prenup, you don't a prenup.
Your retirement fund and her house are two big ticket items that would behoove you to do this as meticulously as possible to ensure the prenup would be enforceable should it ever go south. While the house isn't marital property, it's very difficult for couples to not end up commingling marital assets into a house. As for your retirement, she would be entitled roughly half of whatever is contributed and earned during the years of your marriage. All that can add up to a lot of money getting tied up into a divorce. The best route is you both get representation. Seems like a lot of money now, but you're securing a lot more for the future.
