But where? How fast? What statute? How much jail time are you facing? Are you prepared to have a criminal record for the rest of your life, that will pop up whenever you want to get a new job or a new apartment? You need to hire a lawyer and let them try to plead it down to an infraction, so you don't end up convicted of a crime. In many places you can make the criminal part go away, if you do everything right.
I’d rather not say where. I swerved and was booked for a dui but I was under by 0.038. Idk what statue it is because it’s not on the paper. All it says is reckless driving. I am a civilian and I was arrested by military police. Is the criminal record of reckless driving so severe that you cannot get a job?
You need a criminal lawyer, full stop. You can still be charged with DUI, 0.08 is merely the (statutory) limit. You can lose your license, have to get SR-22, etc. And criminal records show up on job background checks, but how and when depends on the state.
So I was going less than 20 mph because we were approaching the gate to the military compound. No one was around me. No property damage. I swerved and they booked me for a dui. My mistake was one that someone stone cold sober could have made.
There are no "would have" or "could have" or "if only" defenses. Your lawyer will work to get the charges down, by telling the DA that you'll fight it at trial. The DA will hopefully say "I don't have time for that, here's what I'll offer." That's how it generally works.
Probably not. They'll care if you don't have any previous speeding tickets, reckless driving charges, or DUIs. They'll care that you could have killed someone, you had been drinking and were swerving. None of us get a pass for being active. But your lawyer can argue you're a good guy, sure.
Yes, and I also say retain a lawyer depending on the circumstances. I gave the example of what happened to me when I was lumped with the DUIs, driving on a suspended licenses, etc.
