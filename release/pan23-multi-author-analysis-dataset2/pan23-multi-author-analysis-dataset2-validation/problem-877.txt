A great article that logically breaks down what is known about Russias nuclear doctrine, both strategic and tactical, and their processes for using such weapons. The article reinforces how unlikely it is that they would be used, but also how it could happen and at what points in the conflict.
Oddly enough, I was surprised that the US gives the president more unilateral decision making over nuclear weapons than the Russian counterpart, but it makes sense when viewed through the logical lens of the USSR and the threat that could be posed by an aging and possibly deranged dictator.
and also, its fair to assume many of russia's claimed nukes are either fictional, sold, or unopperable. and a lot of their delivery systems are old....
It's not going to get to any of that. Nobody's going to use nuclear weapons. Hopefully Ukraine gets all they need to evict Russia. I totally agree with what you said about China and the world at large. Using nuclear weapons would be blatant and unacceptable. They would become toxic in all corners of the world. Even their closest allies would back away I think.
while certainly true, dont forget the many links in the launch chain who have families and know exactly what they are about to do.
on the flip side, china would have an insane fit if russia even uses tactical nukes. and the US has made the consequences of MWD use clear.
now. a nuclear exchange will got the west dearly. anyone who thinks we can shoot down all of whatever russia manages to launch before it explodes in the silo, some warheads WILL get through, especially as in the EU countries are taking down their own air defense systems to send to Ukraine... a single nuke on a capitol would be catastrophic, even if russia is a glass crater from east to west... its not worth it.
lastly, Ukraine has already struck russian nuclear deterrence airfields... with no response except russia claiming a few guys happened to smoke next to and set off several explosive objects within a few minutes.
If there's a reliable nuclear deterrent that exists beyond a limited attack, it doesn't exist publicly.
The article says it involves at least one other person just to make the decision, let alone press the button, so that's a good thing. I think there's alot of people in the Russian military who want to live in a non radiated world.
Russia modernized a lot of their nuclear arsenal. Land based and sea based. They are still strong in that department. Reddit seems under impression they haven't made a new missle in forever, but it's not the case. From 2010 they put alot of missles into active service.
One crisis at a time my friend. It did make me feel better knowing that it's not a unilateral decision for a guy who's already gutted his own government. The president may appear to have more latitude in the US, but there's alot more checks and balances in the US government in general.
And who the hell knows what Shoigu and Gerasimov think about this whole thing. I mean, sure, they aren't breaking ranks right now, not wanting a short fall a long ways, but if push came to shove, are they really about this Ukraine is nazi crap they have sacrificed thousands on thousands of soldiers at?
Well, that article didnâ€™t make me feel better, considering the radical right is really pushing toward fascism in the US. Its only a matter of time before one of them becomes president of the US.
