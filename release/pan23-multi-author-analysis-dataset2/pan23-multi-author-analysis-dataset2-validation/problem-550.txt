The reaction to Three Mile Island was large because of several factors. One is because it had the _potential_ to break down more catastrophically than it did. There were real fears that a hydrogen bubble had formed and could detonate at any moment and break containment (this is what happened at Fukushima that caused the contamination, ultimately). This was a real fear, and took several days to get under control. So it is important to keep in mind that while Three Mile Island was _not_ catastrophic, it did have the real potential to be.
Lastly, in retrospect it is easy to say, "oh, we know what happened and it turned out OK." At the time it was not at all clear what was happening, not only inside the reactor, but in terms of policy guidance. It turned out that there were insufficient guidelines in place to dictate who was in charge in the event of such an emergency — the plant operator, the state of Pennsylvania, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the federal government all appeared to have overlapping responsibilities and duties. They each gave out conflicting information about what was happening and what ought to be done. Pregnant women and children were evacuated from 20 miles around the reactor — not exactly a confidence-building exercise. Ultimately the public takeaway was that all of the people who said that they were in control were patently _not_, and that this supposedly well-run industry was in fact not. Indeed, it took years to actually find out what had truly happened inside the reactor, and there were significant inquiries afterwards that documented all of the many failures — technical, human, and systemic. It also turned out that there had been a very similar issue at another plant (Browns' Ferry) only a little while beforehand.
All of which is to say, the public takeaway from Three Mile Island was that nuclear reactors were far more dangerous than they had been led to believe, that the authorities were at best ignorant and at worst liars, and that they had barely missed out on a major catastrophe.
The second is because for several decades the nuclear industry, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor organization had assured people that nuclear reactors were entirely safe, that the chance of a catastrophic accident was essentially zero, and that people who worried about such things were off their rocker. There were legitimate concerns about nuclear safety raised prior to Three Mile Island, by such groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists (which was not made up of NIMBYs or hippies, but people with PhDs in physics and related subjects). There were concerns also about the "regulatory capture" of the nuclear industry — that there was a revolving door between the regulators and the industry they were supposed to regulate. When the accident happened, it appeared to vindicate these fears in a major way, and served to discredit those sources of official authority that had for years downplayed the risks. (The film _The China Syndrome_, which by chance debuted less than two weeks before the accident, was reflective of these kinds of concerns.).
I like the formulation that J. Samuel Walker, the former official historian of the NRC, gives of Three Mile Island:
Now, one can, with the benefit of hindsight, say that some of these fears were overblown, or at least that they did not anticipate that significant reforms could be made. We have not had anything similar in the United States since Three Mile Island. There were significant changes made to how reactors were operated to avoid similar kinds of accidents happening again. The case of Fukushima though gives some considerable pause, because these were similar reactors to the ones we operate in this country, and run by a similar sort of organization and regulations, and came up once again with a failure of imagination that led to an extremely dangerous situation. (Chernobyl is less applicable given its Soviet context and reactor design.).
The last sentence is I think an important one. The reaction to Three Mile Island was perhaps overblown. But so, proportionately, was the over-confidence that the nuclear proponents had about reactor safety prior to the accident. A loss of faith in expertise seems proportionate, to some degree, to the amount of hubris said expertise had prior to the loss.
I am not sure, ultimately, if the response to TMI was roughly the same as Chernobyl. Chernobyl and Fukushima both resulted in major reactor shutdowns. TMI did not. It did contribute to a hostile environment for nuclear power in the United States, but new orders for reactors had already gone to zero _before_ the accident, for economic reasons. TMI exacerbated those, adding decreased public interest and higher chance of lawsuits. But many new plants were constructed after TMI, and the US still has the largest nuclear fleet in the world. So I would not say it is really exactly the same.
To add a bit to this, it's worth pointing out that Chernobyl and TMI share a lot of similarities. Both involved reactor operators in a state of not knowing what was happening in the reactor (see also, Windscale), and both involved partial meltdowns of the reactor. The difference in ultimate severity of impact comes about partly due to fundamental design differences (Chernobyl's RBMK design being graphite moderated with a high positive void coefficient and no proper containment vessel, basically a recipe for disaster) with TMI being designed a bit better, but also a little bit to luck (e.g. lack of a hydrogen explosion).
Define potentially dangerous- Last I checked, EBR-II is still one of the few reactors to be subjected to coolant pumps being stopped or loss of power at the station and not melt itself into oblivion. You want an example of interesting historical quirks? The ability of EBR-II to withstand those events (the latter scenario being similar to that at Fukushima) was tested in early April of 1986. Chernobyl happened latter that month.
Everything has trade offs. Do you want to get the absolute most out of your nuclear fuel? If so, a breeder reactor is your best bet, which carries the downside of creating plutonium to use as fuel. Do I want nations such as Iran or NK making reactors of that type? No. At the same time, for nations such as the US with limited Uranium supplies and a whole lot of spent fuel rods, such reactors would fill a useful niche.
Anyway, the most balanced history of TMI is J. Samuel Walker, _Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004)_ — definitely worth checking out!
In any event, the fact that TMI happened at all was a major warning sign of the deficiencies of the entire nuclear industry at that point, from design all the way up to regulatory oversight. That the health impact was negligible doesn't change the level of concern. And, indeed, with the later Fukushima disaster the TMI disaster was a harbinger of a potential for great tragedy with nuclear reactor design and operation as they had been. The fact is that even western 20th century reactor designs have inherent weaknesses that can lead to tremendous release of radiation under specific circumstances, and TMI exposed that possibility to some degree. Those circumstances are fortunately rare, but the potential for long term harm from radiation release should put the bar at a higher level.
Edit: One more thing to add is that even though the 1970s were well down from the high water mark of "nuclear mania" of the 1950s there was still a considerable amount of wild-eyed enthusiasm about nuclear energy which lead to many questionably valuable and questionably safe projects floating around then. One particular example being the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) program which had kicked off in 1970 with a very high priority. These would be expensive, potentially dangerous, and would be trivial to use for production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Contrast that with the direction of nuclear reactor technology in the '90s and after with Gen III/III+ and Gen IV reactor designs which specifically optimized for better safety, more cost effectiveness, reduction of high level waste, and greater proliferation resistance. In between those two eras it's clear the nuclear industry in the US took a huge direction shift. A good chunk of that started early with the reaction to the Three Mile Island accident, which brought a great degree of criticism and skepticism (especially from the public at large and the popular media) to nuclear technology and industry in general.
Now, while the liquid sodium coolant is something that is notable and certainly is a potential hazard, as a consequence the loops had no need for the coolant to be under high pressure, and even operated at close to atmospheric pressure.
It's easy to have a small research reactor that demonstrates one particularly noteworthy characteristic as a flashy demo, it's another thing entirely to develop a fully mature system. Many countries have worked on fast breeder reactors, dumping tens of billions of dollars into R&D before abandoning the technology.
There are numerous fundamental problems with the technology. For one, using liquid sodium is hugely problematic. It makes maintenance and reconfiguration enormously onerous, resulting in most prototype full scale fast breeder reactors spending very little time operational and the vast majority of the time undergoing maintenance or recovery. Additionally, it seems to be extraordinarily difficult to prevent liquid sodium from leaking from these systems. Given the extreme hazards entailed by such leaks this classifies as a capital-P Problem.
The proliferation risk is also a huge problem. Nothing special needs to be done to breed weapons grade plutonium in such a reactor other than to reduce the amount of time U-238 is allowed to be irradiated.
