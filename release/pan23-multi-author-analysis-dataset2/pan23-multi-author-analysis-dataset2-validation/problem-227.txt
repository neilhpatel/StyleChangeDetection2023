Aside from all the other problems, if the car doesn't have an insurance rider for delivery work (or even if it does and he's using a false identity) the insurance will not pay out in the case of an accident. So suppose brother accidentally hits another car, totaling both. And sending someone to the hospital. That's bankruptcy for your family.
The IRS would in your father's name, so it's your father who will be required to report the income and pay taxes on it at the appropriate tax rate. Presumably he has a higher non-delivery-driver income than your brother and pays a higher rate.
Your brother would have to mis-report his income in some other way, so he's committing some light tax fraud. It's not the sort that is often prosecuted, or it's resolved with a fine and repayments, but there's nothing fun or affordable about an IRS investigation.
If they designate him as the primary operator and pay the insurer for commercial-use coverage, then that's likely OK.
If they don't, they are exposing themselves to unlimited civil liability arising from his operation of the car. The delivery company's umbrella coverage won't apply because he is intentionally and obviously breaking their terms of service.
Follow-up question: how would his insurance know if an accident occurred during commercial use as opposed to personal use? I would think that if they just didn’t say they worked for the delivery service that they could just bill their insurance without the commercial coverage.
Because it's really hard to successfully lie about it, lie to the police, lie to the customer, lie to everyone, and also, lying about it is insurance fraud, a felony. Don't commit crimes.
Thank you so much for this This makes me feel better. My brother will need to understand he’s paying a higher tax rate than he needs to by pursuing this setup instead of another job, my parents make good money. I don’t even understand the draw of this path since there are so many other job opportunities right now that don’t involve depreciating your own assets and covering your own operating costs, but my parents have likely not helped him weigh the pros and cons of this eyeroll. I will mention the commercial use coverage, that seems to be the highest risk issue that they also likely have not thought of, and try to make sure he understands how the numbers shake out.
I’m not advocating for committing crimes in any way, I just know what my family will say to dismiss the risks and I want to be able to paint an accurate and convincing picture, since they’re clearly so off in their judgment.
