Yes. You can work as a non-lawyer at their firm. However, because you are not barred in New York you cannot operate in the capacity as an attorney. This means you cannot give legal advice to clients or appear in court proceedings in New York.
I have many friends that are barred, but enjoy being a paralegal or even make more money doing that.
JUD section 476 is the statute for unauthorized practice of law. It's a misdemeanor, but just note that ethical violations in one state can used against you if you're barred in another.
There isn't really anything in the code of the ethics that is going to support this notion as the code of ethics on applies to individuals that are barred in that jurisdiction.
All that, plus the standard ethics rule present in every state saying you can't commit a crime that reflects on your honesty and/or trustworthiness as a lawyer, which for sure getting caught practicing law without a license would count as. Plus, if you ever wanted to practice in NY, OP, you'd have a hard time applying for a law license with that on your record.
