Procopius says nothing more about Britannia, but (long before his ghost story) describes Brittia as populated by 'three very populous nations [...] and one king is set over each of them. The names of these nations are Angles, Frisians and Britons (who have the same name as the island)'. The fact that they are 'very populous' is relevant, for population pressure apparently drove some of each nation to continuously (or, literally: 'annually') migrate to the land of the Franks in large numbers. Procopius then, remarkably, links this to contemporary European power-politics [Wars VIII.xx.6-10]:
There is extensive evidence of direct and indirect commercial contact between Britain and Byzantium during the sixth century. The contact, however, was mostly between Byzantium and the Brittonic-speaking peoples of western Britain, rather than the Anglo-Saxons. Byzantine coins and ceramics are found in large numbers around the Irish Sea; isotope analysis of skeletons from some burials might indicate that they were born in Byzantine-controlled Carthage; and there is some evidence of Cornish knowledge of Byzantine saints worshipped specifically in Constantinople, and of Welsh knowledge of the dates of Byzantine consulates (by that point, an honorary title used for an Emperor’s regnal dating). Considering that your question seems to be mostly about England, I will skip over the detail of this. Those who are interested should see these blog posts ] by Caitlin Green, which summarizes and provides bibliographic references to most of the recent scholarship on this matter. But for England specifically, we should turn to the written sources, which essentially just means Procopius.
I can perhaps shed some light on the relations of pre-Conquest England and Byzantium. I'm not going to really discuss the post-Conquest relations, for a couple of reasons. I'm not as familiar with the relevant English or Byzantine sources of that period. And in those which I do know, the Crusades occupy a dominant space. My understanding is that in non-Western sources, the Crusaders tend to be generalised as Frankish (or in Anna Comnene's terminology, 'Celtic'; an antiquarian reference to the pre-Roman peoples of north-western Europe as represented in classical Roman and Greek sources), and that, faced with large groups of tired and hungry French-speaking men bristling with arms, the Byzantines perhaps had more pressing concerns than figuring out which individual Crusaders were from which ancient Roman province.
Procopius of Caesaraea, hailing from Palestina Prima, served as a bureaucrat accompanying the army of the Byzantine magister militum, Belisarius, during the early-mid-sixth century, coinciding with Justinian's wars of 'reconquest'. This privileged position makes his descriptions of campaigns, policies and the court generally trustworthy (in his Ὑπὲρ τῶν Πολέμων Λόγοι, 'History of the Wars', at least; less so in his scandalous, slanderous and dubious Ἀπόκρυφη Ἱστορία, ‘Secret History’). He also made extensive independent inquiries of his own, which are particularly evident in his descriptions of northern Europe. His enquiries, however, relied on hearsay, and his descriptions are consequently hopelessly confused; he attempted to synthesise vague, dubious and contradictory information into a coherent picture.
If we push Procopius’ testimony further, we can tentatively come to two conclusions regarding views of Britain in the sixth-century Byzantine Empire.
This led him to discuss two places which might correspond to Great Britain, in whole or in part: 'Brittia' (Βριττίᾳ) and 'Britannia' (Βρεττανία). Procopius discusses a war between the Varni, a ‘German’ tribe, and 'soldiers who live on the island called Brittia'. 'Brittia' is apparently an 'island', which lies not far (200 stades; a stade is roughly 185m, so this means about 37km) across from the Rhine Delta, and crucially 'between Britannia and the island of Thule [i.e. Scandinavia, which is of course not an island at all; such was Procopius' grasp of northern geography]'. He goes on to clarify that 'whereas Britannia lies towards the west, opposite the extremities of the land of the Spaniards, separated from the mainland by about 4000 stades [i.e c. 740km] and no less, Brittia, on the other hand, faces the rear of Gaul, the parts of it facing the ocean - clearly to the north of Spain and Britannia.' [For all this, see Wars VIII.xx.1-6]. Brittia apparently is widely known for a large wall, running north to south, east of which lies fertility, plenty and 'salubrious air', and west of which lies snakes, 'wild creatures' and poisonous air which kills all newcomers instantly [Wars VIII.xx.42-46]. Procopius also records another story which even he was too sceptical to believe: that Brittia was literally the Land of the Dead, whose living inhabitants were merely a few subjects of the Franks who, in lieu of paying taxes, ferry ghosts from Francia to Brittia. [Wars VIII.xx.47-58].

According to Gaitlin Green, they also seem to have founded a New England in Crimea, 500 years before the one in America! English remained their languagr till middle of 14th century.
Also Manuel Paleologus the Second, visited England in 1400 and was greeted by Eric the Fourth. Whole court and intellectuals were impressed by his presence. Unfortunately England did not provide any aid. He also visited Paris next year and met with leaders of Aragon, Portugal and Castille but got same result.
