More or less. NATO armies tend to use pull logistics, where you more actively requisition things. The main benefit of this is that you're more adaptable and can more easily react to the situation on the ground, but in exchange, you also need better communications. Meanwhile, Russia tends to use push logistics, where the highers up decide what they expect you to need and send that. The benefit is that if, say, MAD happened and destroyed comm lines, you can still attempt to get things out because you don't need as extensive of communications. But in exchange, it's less adaptable. If they miscalculated, or conditions just change such that you need different materiel, you're out of luck. You have to make do with what you have.
No, it actually makes sense. Russia uses push logistics, where the highers up decide what equipment they expect you to need. It made some amount of sense in the Cold War, because it would help in the event that MAD destroyed comm lines. But nowadays, it just means that their army is nowhere near as flexible as NATO armies that use pull logistics.
As another example of the difference, part of the problem Russia ran into in the opening days of the war was that they don't have NCOs who are able to decide things on the fly. So when they failed to establish air superiority, they still had to go through with the plan as if they did, since they didn't have the flexibility to adapt.
I'm a basic civilian and even I realize that this isn't working for them. Unmitigated disaster is looming.
