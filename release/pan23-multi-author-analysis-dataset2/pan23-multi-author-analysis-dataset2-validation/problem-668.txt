I presume OP meant simply "airplanes" and not specifically "jets". Based on a rash assumption slight understanding of the ranges and uses of the few WW2 jet aircraft, I suspect that none of them flew over, and none were shot down over, enemy territory. Would this be correct?
Over the course of the war, there were some extraordinary cases. Sergeant Bob Merlin of 175 Squadron was shot down over France in August 1943; he managed to make contact with the local Resistance and, being fluent in French, assisted them in gathering intelligence on the V1 launch sites being built in the area, acting as driver for a civilian sub-contractor. He even met the crew of the flak battery who shot him down in a café on his travels! He took the information to Switzerland in November 1943, where he was interned, passing it to the British Air Attaché; getting bored of skiing he then escaped again, back to France, in spring 1944, and joined up with the Resistance again as they assisted with the Allied invasion. In September 1944 175 Squadron were based at Vitry, and were somewhat surprised when a mysterious bearded figure arrived, driving a German Kubelwagen with an Alsatian in the back. It was Merlin, who subsequently re-joined the squadron, only to be shot down again on Christmas Day 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge, fortuitously surviving again to see out the war.
Likewise Allied aircrew over Germany faced a hostile populace, particularly later in the war as the combined bombing offensive dramatically increased in scale, up to 1,500 being killed by lynching or mob violence. Few evaded capture, and though there were escapes from prison camps (as popularised by e.g. The Great Escape) less than 30 RAF personnel reached Britain or neutral territory after being captured.
The best chance for Allied aircrew was if they landed in occupied territory (e.g. France, Belgium, The Netherlands), where a number of operated, assisting escapers and evaders (often aircrew), at enormous personal risk. RAF aircrew were given instruction on escape and evasion, and issued with an "Aids Box" containing "compressed food, Chewing Gum, Halazone, Benzadrine, Matches, Safety Razor and Soap, Needle and Thread, Surgical Tape, Fishing Line and Hook, Water Bottle and small compass". The kits were issued by MI9 along with silk maps, purses containing foreign currency, and more than two million compasses of various designs including ones designed to be hidden . The aim was "to give the evader sufficient nourishment for 48 hours and so enable him to lie up or move from his original location without the necessity of obtaining food", with the maps then offering the chance to find a town where help could be sought. MI9 reported that 4,657 British Commonwealth personnel evaded capture over the war.
Pretty much; the RAF's Gloster Meteor jet fighters never operated over enemy territory, to avoid the possibility of one falling into German hands, though one squadron did deploy to Belgium and Holland in 1945 as the Allies advanced. The Luftwaffe did employ both the Messerschmitt Me 262 and Arado Ar 234 for reconnaissance and bombing missions (including Ar 234s flying reconnaissance over England), a small number were shot down around the front lines (the first Ar 234 recovered by the Allies was shot down in February 1945 after attacking troop columns around Aachen, its pilot escaped but the area was overrun by US troops two days later allowing the wreck to be salvaged), but the vast majority of losses were over friendly territory (either accidental losses, defensive operations, or being attacked at their most vulnerable during take-off or landing).
