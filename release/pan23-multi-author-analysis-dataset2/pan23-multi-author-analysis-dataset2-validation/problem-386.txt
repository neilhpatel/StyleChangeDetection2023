First, realize you may not be getting the full or actual story. Secondly, the lawyer has zero duty to you or your family. He never has to speak with you or your family. He represents your BIL -- that is the only person he needs to communicate with. Ethical duties actually prevent him from telling you most things.
Then you can have your BIL seek another attorney. Realize that you would then be on attorney 3: if this keeps happening, it's probably not the attorneys but the common denominator (your BIL).
The best thing you can do here is set a boundary: tell BIL if he is not happy with his current representation, he is free to seek counsel he is happier with. Tell BIL what you would be willing to pay towards his legal fees. And then step back. Because there is literally nothing more you can do than that.
It may be best for you to step out. Paying for someone else's attorney is a bit of a tricky situation because it's one of the rare situations where the person you are paying doesn't actually work for you. Any attorney you hire for your BIL isn't going to treat you like their client because you are not. They are not (and cannot, in most cases) going to discuss the case with you. They are not going to provide you with updates. They have no obligation to communicate with you and call you back. That all needed to go through your BIL, and your BIL should be the one driving this because he is the client. It might be time to hand BIL a check for a reasonable retainer, tell him to find representation he is happy with and handle his legal affairs on his own, and back out.
Attorneys have an ethical duty to communicate with their client. It is possible all these attorneys are terrible. If your BIL has an issue, he can file a bar complaint and/or ask for the unused portion of any fees paid to be refunded.
However, as a criminal defense attorney, this is filled with red flags. (I'm a public defender so I get to avoid the tricky ethical situation of when people pay you but don't understand that your ethical duty is to the defendant, not the holder of the purse strings.) People charged with sex crimes lie to their loved ones more than any other kind of defendant, by a very wide margin. It is way easier to lie about your attorney than admit that you committed a sex crime. The attorney DOES NOT work for you and if one of my client's family members tried to demand I speak with them, I would probably refuse to do so because they're already showing that they are unreasonable. There is zero reason the attorney needs to talk to you. I don't talk to family members beyond an overview of the process unless I have good reason to. It is also usually extremely unhelpful to have family members actively involved because those people are usually a very vocal peanut gallery that are trying to convince our clients to do things that will harm them and their case. Attorney-client privilege is real and important and the attorney can't tell you, well your family member is completely guilty and needs to take a plea deal unless he wants to die in prison. So if you are only getting his side of the story, I would not be surprised if he's lying to you. Clients charged with sex crimes lie more than anyone else and the best way to support them isn't to insist they are innocent but explain that you'll still love and support them even if they plead guilty. (Also, it's not generally the attorney's responsibility to tell grown up adults when to be in court. My clients claim I didn't tell them their court dates after I gave them the date in writing. People lie to try to get of jail. All the time.).
This is so difficult. I truly do not mind the no contact with me and my husband but the lawyer(s) has failed to even communicate with my BIL. This one we have now keeps claiming that he cant find my BIL, but he found him just fine last week to give him a plea deal without going over charges or discovery with him. Everytime my BIL asks for the discovery, he is told he will get it but it has been months and he has already had 2 court dates without once being presented with the evidence or charges against him. And not to dive too deep here but he also is being told that he will be looking at a life sentence (multiple, in fact) if he doesnt take this plea deal even though Arkansas state law states that sexual based crimes is a maximum of 10 years. It's so hard not to get involved. I'm sure you understand that.
I do understand that. But I also understand that there are strict limits on what someone else's attorney can tell you, which means that all the information you have you are getting through your BIL. And while you believe him to be truthful, the fact is that we are on the second attorney now who suspiciously had the exact same issue as the first, so to an unbiased third party, there's something to suggest that you are not getting the whole story.
I would tell BIL that HE (not you) can ask for a refund of the unearned fee and file a bar complaint for lack of communication if this is really and truly an issue, but he'll need to be prepared to get another attorney. Beyond that, it is not your case and you don't need to be doing anything with regard to the case. The attorney works for the defendant, not for you.
