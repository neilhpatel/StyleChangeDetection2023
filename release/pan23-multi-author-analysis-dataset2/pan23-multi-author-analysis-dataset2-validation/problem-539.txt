There was no Japanese attempt to surrender before Hiroshima and Nagasaki. What there was were "feelers" put out by some aspects of the Japanese government, to see if the (then neutral towards Japan) Soviet Union might be willing to negotiate an end to the war between the Japanese and the United States. The idea was that there could be a negotiated, conditional surrender, but again, this wasn't any kind of real offer yet, this was a probe to see if the Soviets were at all interested.
The US was very aware of these "feelers," both because they could intercept the foreign communications between Tokyo and their ambassador in Moscow (the decrypted intercepts were known as MAGIC and played a big role in deliberations at the Potsdam Conference), and also because the Soviets eventually told the US this was going on.
One can say that this did open up an avenue towards the end of the war that didn't involve atomic bombings or invasions, but you again have to realize how tentative the whole thing was. It wasn't a concrete offer to consider — even the Japanese weren't totally sure what their "conditions" were. And it wasn't at all clear this was really some kind of official decision on behalf of Japan. The Japanese Supreme War Council, which governed the war effort, was dominated by militarists who weren't interested in this kind of thing. The people looking into this as an option were a minority on the council — an important minority, to be sure, with some support from Hirohito himself. But the US was aware of these dynamics.
I think you're confused about what I'm saying, and what the documents say. They reject "unconditional surrender" and introduce conditions. What they are looking for is a "conditional surrender" though they don't say that — they say they want an end of the war with conditions, which is the same thing. That is what their "seeking a peace" means above.
As I said, they weren't seeking a surrender, but they were putting out "feelers" for the Soviets as a possible mediator for discussions. The discussions never happened, so what they would or wouldn't have accepted is unknown. All we know — and again, this is the point that the US policymakers at Potsdam paid close attention to — is that the one thing they all agreed upon was that the status of the Emperor was a huge stumbling block towards any peace agreement.
The US interpretation of this information was that the Japanese were not yet ready to surrender unconditionally. Some members of the US cabinet (notably Stimson, and some military analysts, with support by Churchill) thought that this meant that the US ought to lessen their request for unconditional surrender in the one area that was clearly serving as a hinderance to the Japanese — the question of the Emperor's status in the postwar. They thought that giving an indication that they weren't planning to imprison the Emperor as a war criminal, or destroy the imperial office altogether, would grease the skids a bit. Truman (and Byrnes) rejected this. But anyway, that's as "positive" an interpretation as the US took from MAGIC — not that the Japanese were trying to surrender, which they weren't, not really.
On all of the above, see Tsuyoshi Hagasawa's book, _Racing the Enemy_, which is entirely about US-Japanese-Soviet relations at the end of World War II, and covers these "peace feelers" and the US reaction to them extensively.
As for the binary, there were certainly other options than "drop two atomic bombs on two cities in three days" (as I like to frame the specific actions taken), and "fight an endless invasion that would have casualties on par with Okinawa and Iwo Jima" (which the JCS didn't think was going to be the case anyway with a land invasion). I've , without arguing that one is better than the other, or that one can say with authority that the road chosen was not the "best of all possible worlds," because I genuinely don't know. But the framing of it as a binary choice is a rhetorical move that is meant to justify the atomic bombings; it is not a reflection of the historical choices made or the options taken.
Except the MAGIC diplomatic summaries showed that Japan was not ready to accept surrender even with the retention of the national polity (Imperial system) at this time. Ambassador Sato had already proposed the acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration with this additional term in his message to the Foreign Ministry on July 18:
Certainly Togo would have accepted Sato's suggestion, but he was also faced with the reality that any decision had to be a unanimous one by the Japanese Cabinet, and having sat in the SWC meetings with Anami and the Chiefs of Staff (the COS weren't actual Cabinet members) and realized this was impossible at that time.
Japan would have definitely agreed to a peace that kept the Emperor, had a limited or no occupation, involved no war crimes trials, and allowed them to disarm themselves. After nearly four years of brutal fighting, the US wasn't going to simply take their ball and go home. The goals for the war for the US as outlined by the not only called for the defeat of Japan, but also:
There is no indication as to what terms, other than preservation of the imperial system, that the Japanese would or wouldn't have accepted. They never codified them. And it was only one part of the Supreme War Council that was offering this up. As I said.
Well, again, it's impossible to know what they would or would not have asked for. I am not suggesting it would be one way or the other. They never made any kind of formal determination of what their "conditions" might be, other than — again — the preservation of the imperial house, which was clearly the sticking point for _everybody_.
Certainly no one can say for certain how the discussions with the Soviets would have played out since they refused to give the Soviets an idea of what they were asking, but it's hard to believe that what was unacceptable to the war faction on August 9th after the Soviet entry into the war and two atomic bombs would have been acceptable in late July before those events. In Shigenori Togo's own words on the 11am meeting of the 9th:
