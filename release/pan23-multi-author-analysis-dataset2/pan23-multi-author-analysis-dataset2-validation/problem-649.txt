You can ask for that and see what they say. If you're working your standard schedule you'd be taking intermittent FMLA to eliminate the overtime. Your first step is getting the paperwork completed by your doctor. If she suggests eliminating overtime as an accommodation, that's when you'd take it to your employer.
Essentially, I have a standard 8 hour schedule. And once I come to work, I can be ordered to stay over for 4 hours and/or to come in 4 hours early, with on rare occasions of staying over 8 hours or coming in 8 hours early.
This is why you'll need the paperwork from your doctor ahead of time, documenting that the overtime is exacerbating your condition.
Well, the reason there is so much OT is due to severe short staffing. However, a few other employees do have such exemptions. Is shortstaffing an acceptable reason to deny it even if it was approved for others? Also, I was told by HR that I donâ€™t need to share the medical reason behind FMLA to my supervisor.
It's not necessarily at their discretion as in they have carte blanche to approve or deny whatever they want. If they want to deny it, though, there has to be a solid reason why that accommodation would be an unreasonable burden on the business. Intermittent time off is rarely considered unreasonable, but you might expect them to push back and offer you half as much overtime as you're currently getting.

I can't tell you whether they'll use that or whether it will fly if they do. Your HR person is right, though - it's nobody's business what your diagnosis is. All you're required to provide is the statement from your doctor that accommodating you in a certain way is recommended.
