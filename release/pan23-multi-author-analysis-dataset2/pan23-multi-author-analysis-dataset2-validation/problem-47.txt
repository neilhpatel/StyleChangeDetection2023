The woman and the family member may be judgement proof (the woman almost certainly is if her mental disability is so severe she just attacks random people unprovoked). If the hospital is liable, it's likely OP's s/o can recover damages, but if they aren't, the chances aren't as good. I'm both not a lawyer and definitely not a personal injury lawyer, so I have no idea if the hospital is liable.
Well you can't know just from this post that the woman isn't mentally competent. Maybe they are impecunious but a PI lawyer where OP lives would be the only one able to give proper legal advice. I am a lawyer but not in OPs jurisdiction.
You might start by calling the hospital ombudsman. They are responsible for patient complaints. If you are lucky enough or persuasive enough, they may acknowledge their responsibility here.
If not, then you'll want to contact a personal injury attorney. Many will do an initial consultation for cheap or even free, to advise you on whether it's worth filing a lawsuit in this situation.
Also, did you file an actual police report, or only talk to hospital security? You will want to do both.
