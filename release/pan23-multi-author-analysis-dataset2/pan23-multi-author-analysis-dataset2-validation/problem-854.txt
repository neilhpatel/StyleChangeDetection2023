What's interesting about the Mauryans is how little we actually know about their empire. Most of our insights into the Mauryan state is tangential, from Greek Sources to texts such as the Arthashastra which are prescriptive rather than descriptive.
One of the long running debates in Indian history has been about the degree of control the Mauryans actually had on their empire. Traditional maps of the Mauryan Empire show you a massive blob of colour covering most of the Indian subcontinent and upto large parts of modern Afghanistan. For the longest time historians believed the empire to be relatively centralized, with a complex bureaucracy which was the model for the Arthashastra.
More recently though this attitude has shifted, and we're increasingly coming to the conclusion that the empire was very likely extremely loosely knit, likely comprising of sundry political units owing loose fealty to the central Mauryan state centered out of Bihar but otherwise likely to have been relatively autonomous in their functioning. The states which emerge in the relatively rapid disintegration of the Mauryan state are likely not new polities but simply entities which began asserting more overt independence as the central power decayed. There's a lot of links to the Mughal Empire in historical analyses of the Mauryan.
In our school history books, we always moved on from the Mauryas after Ashoka. Could you perhaps shed some light on when the dynasty started declining, and commonly accepted reasons?
The reason most history texts move on after Ashoka is because of the scarcity of our information for the Post-Ashokan era. We really don't have much by way of contemporary or direct sources for that period. We do have later commemorative poetic texts, but these were written centuries after the fact.
The general story is what you see in Wikipedia. There is a short succession of weak rulers in Ahsoka's aftermath\ is supplanted by the Sunga dynasty through a coup. For the most part we have little corroboration on the information about these post-Ashokan rulers, and the reasons for their decline. Which makes it difficult to theorize about causation. To the best of my knowledge the general presumption is that the central authority was weakened (whether due to Ashoka or not is unknown) and this led to the regional states asserting themselves more strongly. And in the capital territories, the Mauryan dynasty was supplanted by the Sungas. Its important to note that most of this material comes from Buddhist sources. They were extremely pro-Mauryan and equally hostile to the Sunga Dynasty. The idea of the fundamentally anti-Buddhist Sungas is something scholars such as Thapar have challenged.
If you'd like to explore these details for yourself, a relatively recent broad-scope work is Nayanjot Lahiri's Ashoka in Ancient India is a good resource. Her final few chapters should give you insight into the the world that succeeded Ashoka. If you'd prefer some idea about how scholarship has evolved, start with Thapar's Ashoka and the Decline of the Mauryas. Make sure you pick up a recent edition, since Thapar has updated many of her ideas over the years. The main text is now somewhat out-dated (I'm a Modern Historian by training, so I'm not fully clued up on the latest thrusts of scholarship here) but the prefaces and introduction sections of the recent editions should address your questions about evolution in scholarship.
Is the lack of information about the Mauryans due to them not writing anything down or is it because later rulers didn't do anything to preserve older texts? Oh, and was there any continuity between the several Magadha kingdoms and empires, by which I mean, would it have been seen as the same kingdom or empire but with different dynasties by the people at the time?
All things considered Ashoka is probably an ancient king who left the most writing of his contemporaries. We know considerably more about the Mauryans than their predecessors and we probably know a fair bit more about them than their immediate successors too.
Second question: There's a huge degree of continuity between dynasties. Right up to the Guptas, Pataliputra and the kingdom associated with it remained the regional imperial power. There were certainly powerful imperial entities to the North West and South of it, but even so the Magadha territory remained a major Imperial center for a very long time. Dynasties wouldn't necessarily originate in Pataliputra, but it was routinely the Imperial capital for the power which ruled Magadha, and it was more often than not the core power-base for empires centered in that particular part of the world.
You could very likely draw a relatively consistent throughline in terms of Magadhan imperial continuities from Bimbisara and Ajatshatru of the Haryankas all the way down to the Guptas. Pataliputra appears to have been a major imperial center for over a Millenium.
So another question I have is, were the three crowned Tamil kings actually vassals alongside the king of Sri Lanka, and the king of Assam, or is that just a modern myth?
We have an indication of the religious debates, both within Buddhism and likely between Buddhism and Hinduism\ based on Ashoka's edicts speaking to questions such as on the killing of Animals.
We have indications about the strong political identities of Tribal, semi-nomadic groups at the time again looking to sources such as the Ashokan Edicts.
\An outcome of his "peaceful" policies to some. To stress, there's zero evidence for this, and Ashoka's edicts warning forest tribes are the basis on which historians have argued that he likely maintained a relatively solid military machine regardless of his peaceful intentions. To me personally the attributions of peace to Ashoka have always seemed like successful propaganda. A sort of Ancient analogue to the United States' championing of democracy and liberty all over the world; fair words backed by a perfectly solid steel fist.
That's an area I'm not fully familiar with honestly. To the best of my knowledge its a bit of a myth. As I understand it, the rock edicts mention suzerainty. But the references to the deep south are about their acknowledging Ashoka's dharmic superiority. long speculative content short is: we don't really know. You could see it as a form of vassalage. But you could just as easily it see it as propagandist spin and no evidence of actual suzerainty, and merely an ambassadorial acknowledgment.
There is evidence pointing to large-scale pan-regional investment by the Mauryan state. An example of this is the artificial Sudarshana Lake in Saurashtra, which per later edicts, was constructed on the orders of the Mauryan Regional Governor. This information coupled with evidence of Ashoka serving as Governor in Taxila speaks to the role of regional authority in the Mauryan state, atleast in some zones. We cannot know the exact details of-course, but the authority of the Governor in local matters is an important part of the whole "How centralized was the Mauryan State" debate.
The religious identities of Indians before the British showed up, looking for neat categories for the sake of administrative convenience and the need to enumerate the vast colony they conquered, were extremely layered and complex. People could easily have more than one religious identity, and a lot of questions on religion are deeply contextual.
To the first question I'd say its a little of all of the above really. Its also important to remember the climate of the region isn't particularly conducive to preserving writing material. Leave a piece of paper out in the open and see how many monsoons it survives.
What we know of Mauryan spread comes largely from the location of the Mauryan rock edicts. We also have the evidence of the rock edicts themselves. Thus for instance the rock edict found at Bhuvaneshwar (That's the modern name, I forget the site name of the rock edict) mentions Ujjain as one of the regional capitals. And obviously its been a reasonable bet that the location of the Rock Edict is territory under the suzerainty of the Mauryans.
Now based on these you project the extent of the Mauryan Empire. Basically historians have simply assumed that territory between the various Rock Edicts (ad other places explicitly recognized as Mauryan in some literature, such as the Edicts themselves) is all Mauryan.
The simple answer is that Hinduism is a vastly complicated creature because it doesn't really fit well with the word "religion" which comes from a European root and carries it with an understanding loaded with its own history. The word itself applies poorly to non-Abrahamic faith systems outside the Mediterranean world.
