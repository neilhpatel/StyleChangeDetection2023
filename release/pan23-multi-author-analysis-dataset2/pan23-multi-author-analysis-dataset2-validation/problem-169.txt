Did you sign anything agreeing to be a director of the corporation? Anything at all? Have you ever exercised any of the powers and prerogatives of a director of the corporation, such as receiving dividends or directing the business of the corporation?
If not, your father committed a series of provincial offences in reporting that you were a director of the company when you weren't. You have never been a director of the company, in spite of his assertion to the contrary, as he cannot make you one without your consent, and he did not have your consent.
Nope, I haven't once acted as a director, received any parments or dividends, directed the business, nothing at all.
Basically, this is a legal corporation and I discovered it 3 months ago when I Googled my name. Three sites related to corporations showed a company my dad created and that I was a director. I asked him about it and he said he was planning to use it but he didn't and that was inactive. I Googled my name again and I'm still a director on it, 3 months later.
That's the thing, man. I really don't know, it has been well over a year and I have signed all sorts of documents for school, official stuff, employment etc so I don't know if I signed something related to corporations but I would assume not..
You can report fraudulent business registrations through Service Ontario. Your father may face some fairly steep fines, and SO can correct the registration with or without your father's consent, or direct the corporation to be dissolved if appropriate. You can also report it through the OPP, if you prefer.
I can't offer you advice via PM. If you don't feel comfortable discussing this in public, see if your school has a legal clinic, or get a referral through the Law Society of Ontario for a private consult.
Oh wait I just saw your profile, you're a moderator so I can understand why you don't take PMs or chat messages. Fair enough.
Yes - as I said, get in touch with Service Ontario. They're the front end for Ontario government services, including corporate registration. Their website has a form for making appointments, or you may now be able to go in without an appointment to talk to them.
No no actually I can discuss this publically because I did create a throwaway for this. Are you alright with telling me how to proceed on this thread?
But seriously though man, thanks a lot. I know where to start and I'll be doing some research because I've moved out from my parent's place and yeah. Hopefully this process isn't too expensive, I'm a busy 19 y/o with barely any money. Regards.
Hey man don't know if you'll see this reply but I wanted to thank you for your suggestions that you gave me a while back. If you're somehow curious about what happened to my case, I sent my dad a resignation letter shortly after and 2 weeks later he removed me as a director from the corporation without issue and filed the form 6 notice of change.
Tell them your father listed you as a director for a corporation, provide them with the information you have, and ask them what to do. They'll be able to take the complaint and investigate, or refer you to the OPP to file a police report, as appropriate. They may also direct you to another government office to proceed.
hm okay then so I'll have to contact Service Ontario about this and tell them I want to be removed as a director from this corporation. Maybe get an appointment or talk to them online/on the phone.
For the record, I am listed as a director of the company so legally speaking I am considered one, just in case I may have confused you. And truth be told, while I highly doubt I signed anything agreeing to be a director, I'm not 100% sure I didn't either.
If you tell them you want to be removed, they'll almost certainly tell you to resign and to have the corporation file to update its records. That's an option, if your father is willing to cooperate with you.
If he's not, you need to be clear with SO that you were named as a director without your consent. There's an important difference between resigning and noting incorrect information.
Complaining about fraudulent or incorrect information in a corporate registration is unusual, but not unheard of. You aren't the first person whose family has done this.
That's the thing, our relationship is not that good and I told him to remove me months ago. He has not done that. Doubt this is an option.
Yeah well I can't be sure that I gave consent or not so maybe I did accidentally without being aware and I forgot.
It's not something that happens "accidentally," though you should read the things you sign and should ideally be keeping copies for your own records. Even if your father stuck a corporate charter or operating agreement in a stack of other documents, and you signed it, that's not conclusive, incontrovertible evidence that you agreed, and an explanation of the circumstances might still support that you did not agree in fact, even though your name is on a document you signed.
On a relevant note, I went to ServiceOntario but there's nothing there for corporations but I'll contact them tomorrow by phone and ask them questions regarding this becauase I'm sure ServiceOntario is literally about situations like mine.
Yeah I know, it makes me liable for tons of things like employee wages and other stuff as you mentioned which is why I brought it up. It's daunting but I do plan on starting the process as fast as possible.
I understand that this process is daunting, but those are broadly the options. Given that directors _are_ liable for things like outstanding wages, correctly filing the corporation's tax returns, and other critical (and potentially expensive) things, I would strongly encourage you to start the process even if you're unsure of how it will turn out.
