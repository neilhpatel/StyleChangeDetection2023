My understanding is Q Score is more about likability than name recognition. Media and marketing execs will panel test personalities to see how well they are received. I’m not an expert on this, so if I’m wrong, please educate me.
This is so true. Walker may be among the dumbest, but Roy “Banned-From-Malls-For-Creeping-On-Teenaged-Girls” Moore was a terrible candidate and had no fame… just allegiance to Trump.
Republicans are willing to dispense with celebrity in exchange for abject and complete subservience to Trump. Pity for them that only works in primaries.
There's a boatload of projection flowing in this thread. Imagine where we might be if Democrats didn't spend decades fighting against civil rights. And we are only a decade past a very racists Democrat Rep and Senator that spent 60 years in office after becoming involved in politics by founding a chapter of the KKK. There's always so many privileged white people crying racism by the GOP, while minorities are steadily leaving the party. So again. As Democrats love to say, if a party is constantly yelling about something in politics, it's always projection because that's how they really feel. Very very true in this instance.
