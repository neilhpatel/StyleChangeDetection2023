In MA your employer is required by law to provide you with 1 hour of sick time for each 30 hours worked, no matter if you are a part time or full time employee. That sick time can be used at your discretion, without your employer's approval being necessary, for recovery from physical/mental illness or injury; to seek medical diagnosis, treatment, or preventative care; and a few other things. Your employer is prohibited by law from preventing you for using your sick time for those reasons, and is prohibited by law from punishing you for using your sick time for those reasons. Your doctor's appointment is certainly covered, and your boss gets no say in it. I would go to HR and let them know that your boss is preventing you from using sick time for an allowable reason, and likely they'll take care of it.
If you work for a company that is smaller than 11 employees the time can be unpaid, but they're still required by MA sick leave laws to grant the time off without reprisal.
Then they're required to pay you for your sick time and they get zero say in how it's used, as long as it's used within the confines of MA sick time law.
Your boss also does not get a vote in who are your medical providers, nor how you select them. "It worked for me" means buttkiss; you don't have to do the same.
