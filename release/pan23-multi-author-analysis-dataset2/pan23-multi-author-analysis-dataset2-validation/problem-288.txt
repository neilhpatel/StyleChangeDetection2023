Europeans conceptualized a link between climate and the body. It was thought that certain changes in climate could create imbalances in the humors (fluids in the body). This disequilibrium could cause illnesses or an alteration in mental and emotional states -- at least in their world view. Even from the early voyages of Columbus and the Spaniards, their letters and other writings often express how the heat, humidity, and "air" was taking a toll on their bodies, which were not accustomed to the climate. One way to help restore health was to eat more "European" food such as bread, wine, and pork rather than corn and other foods native to the Americas. (see Body of the Conquistador by Rebecca Earle).
If you wouldn't mind expounding... is there any data on how the West India Regiment fared? How did the British think they fared? Did it have any noticeable impact on the conception of scientific racism?
When the British colonized areas in Africa (specifically Sierra Leone in the nineteenth century), the military higher ups knew that their troops were dying of diseases at a very high rate. They often blamed "the fever laden swamps" and "bad airs" of the region to which their European bodies were not accustomed. Hence, they often called Africa, "the White Man's Grave" (see Philip Curtin). So, what did they do? With the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in the early 19th century, the British began using troops from the West India Regiment (former slaves from the West Indies). Since these men were of African descent, the British believed they would fair better in African climate and help them with the colonizing process in Africa. Thus, by the nineteenth century, we see a close link between scientific racism and understandings of climate and disease in the colonization of Africa.
Subsequent European colonizers in other tropical regions (such as SE Asia and India) utilized other means, specifically hill stations. These stations, as the name suggests, were built in higher, cooler elevations. European colonizers retreated to these areas to "restore health," get much needed R&R, and avoid the "diseased" towns and villages of the colonized. But, these areas weren't simply to chill out. The building of hill stations was closely tied to European understandings of climate, body, and spaces. In their world view, the European body was not meant endure the beating sun and humidity. By escaping to these hill stations, equilibrium could be brought back to their bodies.
Not only did this post enlighten me about how Europeans perceived the world during that period, I now have an excellent excuse not to go outdoors since I live in Australia.
To give a specific Dutch-Indonesia example: "Bandung, capital of Indonesia’s West Java province, is a large city set amid volcanoes and tea plantations. It's known for colonial and art deco architecture, a lively, university-town feel and – thanks to its 768m elevation – relatively cool tropical weather."(source: Wikipedia).
Unfortunately, I don't have any formal writing on that topic. Most of my writing and presentations have been on the sixteenth century. I only discuss 19th century disease, empire, and race when lecturing, and most of my knowledge in that field is from PhD exams -- not archival research.
The colonial authorities found the death rate of European troops to be unacceptably high in west Africa in the early 19th century, so they pulled them out. The West India Regiment replaced those troops; however, the date rate among the WIR was virtually identical to European troops even though they were of African descent.
The issue was that most of the men of the WIR were NOT from Africa; many were former slaves of the West Indies (some were captured from foreign slave ships), so they had not been exposed to the disease of west Africa as children. Thus, they did not have the same immunities as those in west Africa and succumbed to yellow fever and malaria at the same rate as Europeans.
Even though knowledge of diseases increased tremendously in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (germ theory of disease, understanding vectors of disease transmission), the colonial policies did not always reflect the scientific changes. For example, the British would not use all-European units in Africa until World War II. This shows -- and lots of other examples can back up this claim -- that even though the scientific consensus had changed about the etiologies of diseases, attitudes and colonial policies did not adapt as quickly, especially in regards to race and beliefs about how climate affects the European body. Hill stations continued to be used in the colonized world in the early 20th century, and prejudices of the "diseased bodies" of the colonized peoples still lingered.
However, there seemed to be another reason as well, and apparently the primary reason, for the Dutch to have moved the capital from Batavia (now Jakarta) to Bandung: "The city lies on a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains that provides a natural defense system, which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's plan to move the capital from Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung.".
Why? Infant mortality was very high in 19th century west Africa, largely because of yellow fever or malaria. The children who survived yellow fever developed immunities and were protected in adulthood. As for malaria, getting it a second time is not as bad as the first. So the adults in w. Africa are protected from yellow fever and malaria, although many children died. It has nothing to do with race, which the British would later learn.
A good place to start though is Philip Curtin's Disease and Empire: The Health of European Troops in the Conquest of Africa. It's not exclusively about race, but early nineteenth century theories on race are discussed within the chapters.
