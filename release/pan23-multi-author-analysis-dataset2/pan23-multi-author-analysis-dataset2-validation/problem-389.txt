Bring this to the attention of payroll, it may be an oversight. If they do not give you your wages, you need to approach the labor board of your state and complain against the company.
Also by digital stub do you mean getting a pdf of the payroll? It may be a cost saving/ environmental move by your company, and may be unrelated to your shortfall in wages. You should be able to take a print out if your payroll if needed. If you cannot, then it's another problem.
I'm fairly certain it's because of their new paperless system. Because I noticed the loss of time is directly correlated to overtime. On days when it's straight time and half they deduct 45 mins for lunch and days when it's double time they deduct 1 hour for lunch. We only ever receive 30 minute lunches. And sometimes no breaks. 12 hours with only a 30 minute lunch because "that's all their required to give us".
Not being paid for time you spent working is illegal. (If they're saying it was break time, they can fire you for working through breaks but they can't not pay you if you were working.) That'd go through the labor board.
Having a digital system for pay stubs and time off requests is not illegal. Why do you/your coworkers believe that it is difficult to access this information?
The digital pay stubs were just brought up because that's when the discrepancies started. Our employer has made it exceedingly difficult to access this information. Frequent forced password changes and random lockouts are the primary cause. We don't "believe it's difficult" we are having difficulty accessing these resources. Our management and HR seem resentful and unhelpful with our complaints. It's only because I just today obtained access to this information that I've discovered the issue. Again nobody has been able to gain consistent access to this information and I will probably be locked out again soon. I'm not saying going digital is the problem, however their inability to provide us with stable access should be.
