So, this is a really interesting question and you've already pointed to a few of the contributing factors (age of the country being the most important). London and Paris are also outliers, to a degree. They were incredibly important not only as manufacturing centers, which is the primary way that population was driven up in the late 19th century, but they were also the hubs of global empires. No other countries had comparable empires, in terms of geographic extent, population, and level of penetration into their colonial territories. All of this is significant because while those empires existed, Paris and London drew people from around the country and the world to work for those empires. And when they collapsed, Paris and London became the destinations for post-imperial populations seeking work in the former metropolitan country. This also helps to explain why New York or LA can't be models for Germany. The US has long been a target of immigration and that's resulted in the development of cities that really don't look anything like those in the "old world," with the exception of London and Paris.
So, Germany doesn't have mass immigration or a major imperial collapse to deal with (on par with Britain and France, at least). But as you noted, the age of the country is important too. Paris and London became national centers in the 17th and 18th centuries, and had largely achieved their position at the center of political, economic, and cultural life about a century before Germany was even unified (1770s-1780s). This allowed them to develop extensively as centers before the arrival of Germany onto the scene. Interestingly, another city worth comparing to Paris and London would be Vienna. It never became the hub of a global empire, but it was on par with Paris in terms of continental importance during the latter 18th and early 19th century, and it remained culturally central for Europe until World War I. And like Paris and London, it had no other cities of significance to compete with in the Austrian (later Austro-Hungarian) Empire, until Pest was rebuilt and united with Buda (Budapest) in the later 19th century (1873).
All of this growth was spread out, though, because there were as yet few established centers of industry, on par with London or Paris, to become the focus for migration. Berlin and Munich served in this role well enough, but this points to the other novelty of German political geography. While France, and to a lesser extent Britain, spent the 18th century centralizing their administrations and wresting power from their provinces, Germany remained a semi-federal state right up to the present day. Even when the German Empire is established in 1871, the constituent states maintained their autonomy, keeping not only their titular heads of state, but maintaining control over education, policing, administration, and even parts of the military and economic policy making apparatus. While this waxed and waned, it never completely disappeared. Even today, Germans are as likely to see themselves as coming from a particular state (Bavaria, Hesse) as coming from "Germany.".
Those two points clear the deck for the more important answer, though, which I alluded to above. All of these cities, including New York and LA, get their biggest boosts from industrialization and the mass migration of people that came with it in the 19th century. In the US, we usually think of immigration as this constant part of our nations history, but with the exception of the Irish and the Germans who came in the 1810s-1840s, the really massive movement of people didn't start until the 1870s & 1880s, in response to economic crisis. At the same time, especially in Germany, people were moving around a lot within countries. Germany went from less than half of its population living in towns before 1850, to well over two-thirds being town dwellers in 1900. This caused a huge boom in urbanization, growing old cities and creating new ones. In the Ruhr region of Germany, the village of Hamborn grew from around 7,000 inhabitants to more than 100,000 in the course of twenty years, just to give an example.
This internal fragmentation meant that urbanization developed differently than elsewhere, with jobs that might have been predominate in one city in another country being spread out to different parts of the German polity. Berlin was the political capital of Prussia, the Empire's dominant state, and capital of the Empire as a whole, but it wasn't the center of much else. It was important in industry, but the Ruhr region was much more so (this includes one of the largest urban landscapes in the 20th century, stretching from Dusseldorf to Dortmund). Culturally, Munich was much hipper than Berlin, at least before World War I, while Hamburg was better situated to develop into a London- or New York-style shipping center. Frankfurt had a long history as a banking hub, which changed during the Empire, but not so much that it couldn't revert back to being a dominant European center of finance after World War II.
So there are a lot of reasons that Germany doesn't develop cities like Paris and London, but I think its cultural and political decentralization, something which was true even during the German Empire, goes the furthest to explaining it.
How does different zoning laws in different countries factor into this? The City of London is a tiny little area of about a square mile, but when people(from other countries) say London, they usually mean the greater metropolitan area with 9 million people. Similarly with Tokyo, Japan has changed it's zoning laws so much I don't really know what's going on there, but it's very different at the end of WW2. It seems some countries just change their zoning law and there's suddenly a big city.
This is already a stupid long response, but I want to drill down on the Ruhr for a moment, because that's what I do research on. The Ruhr Region, which today has a total population of 5.1 million people, is organized into several cities including Duisberg, Essen, Bochum, and Dortmund. In modern Germany, around half of the largest ten cities are in this region. But a history of independent municipal governance and the continued cultural and political dominance of Rhenish cities like Dusseldorf, Bonn, and Cologne means that these cities never unified meaningfully. Also, the Ruhr was built to essentially be a huge factory. So despite being a huge population center, there was little impetus for it to become a political or cultural center.
During periods of industrialization, this is definitely one way to cope with increased population. In most European cities, the working class live/d in a “red ring” (so-called for their tendency to vote socialist or communist). Paris is famous for this, but you see it elsewhere, like Berlin or Barcelona. By absorbing the industrial suburbs, the tax base of the city is increased and more importantly, a potentially disruptive element is contained. As you point out, though, local conditions could modify this. In Germany (at least in the Prussian part before 1933), cities with more than 100,000 become self-governing and autonomous from the local Prussian county-level administration. In the Ruhr region, this meant that areas which are today suburbs became independently governing. Hamborn, discusses above, is a good example. Today, it’s basically an incorporated community within Duisberg and you couldn’t tell where one ends and the other begins without reference to some cadaster maps. But for several years, the town was large enough to run its own affairs. So this is another example of a German peculiarity seeming to limit city growth. Duisburg can’t get larger if it’s surrounded by other self-governing cities. After the 1970s, reforms are made to combine some of these (now deindustrializing) communities, and my guess is that you saw population growth in cities in just the ways you’re asking about then.
