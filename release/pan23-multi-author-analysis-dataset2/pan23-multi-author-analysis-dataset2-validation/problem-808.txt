Well, the problematic thing with Andreas Palaiologos' claim to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire was that he already sold it once, before to Ferdinand II of Aragon; He sold it first to the King of France Charles VIII in 1494. This has been attested to by Étienne Lauréault de Foncemagne in his letters.

As for the French claim, it has been truly invalidated due to Extinctive Prescription, leaving the claimants to the ERE being the Spanish monarchs and (dubiously) the House of Osman.
However, it is a moot point on whether Charles VIII or Ferdinand of Aragon has the real claim; According to Potter, in 1566, Charles IX disdained and let go of the imperial claim to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire partly due to the principle of Extinctive Prescription (whereby a claim is rendered expired due to prolonged inability to claim the inheritance named) and partly due to his focus on the wars of religion.
As for the claim that Ferdinand II purchased, it can also be considered to have expired under grounds of Extinctive Prescription, though since the Spanish constitution that governs the rights and titles of the King and Crown of Spain does not have provisions for E.P., it is more accurate that it should be labeled as a "dormant claim", though there is (at the point of this writing) any attempts to use the claim since it was purchased.
So regardless of who became the rightful heir, the claim has been invalidated? That's very interesting. Thank you for the prompt response. As a dormant claim, does that mean it's technically still valid? I would assume that if it was sold twice Charles IX's disdain of the claim would make Ferdinand's valid.
EDIT: Though the "legality" of the Spanish claim can be challenged by E.P., in the Spanish perspective, it is perfectly valid.
On the Spanish side, yes, the claim is still valid and in a truly technical setting, can be used a rightful claim; If Felipe VI (current King of Spain) chooses to do so, via virtue of Article 1 of Royal Decree 1368/1987, he may use the title of "Autokrator", "Basileus Rhomaion" or "Imperator Rhomaion" due to his dormant though still valid claim to the ERE.
Do note that I did say that their claim was dubious since it does not only rest of the right of conquest but also in the concept of Translatio Imperii, which essentially means that if you control parts of the former (Eastern) Roman Empire, you essentially are the continuation of the (Eastern) Roman Empire.
The claim of the House of Osman was indeed through right of conquest, specifically when Constantinople fell in 1453. Specifically, their title of pretense is Qayser i-Rum, or Caesar of Rome if translated roughly.
Wow that there even is still an heir to the Roman Empire is truly astonishing. How can the Ottomans hold a claim, though? Surely right of conquest is weaker than right of succession?
Ok one final question. I've heard that many Russians claim that they are the successors to the Roman Empire and that Moscow is the Third Rome. Where did this assertion come from, and what is it based on?
Ah, the source, or should I say sources, of the Russian claim are actually very fascinating, if I may say so.
Essentially, there are three tenets of the "Russia is Third Rome" concept, and they are Religious, Familial and Imperial tenets.
For the Religious tenet of the Russian claim, it essentially posits that after the fall of Constantinople, as the sole remaining protector of the Orthodox faith, the Russian Czars are the heirs to the long-standing responsibility of the Greek Imperatores / Autokratores to protect and preserve the Orthodox faith.
As for the familial tenet, there were multiple marriages with the Grand Princes of Kiev and Muscovy with the Imperial families from the ERE. One of these early claimants was Vladimir of Kiev, who, in exchange for the marriage with Anna Porphyrogenita, daughter of Emperor Romanos II of the Eastern Roman Empire, converted him and his entire state to Orthodox Christianity, as well as helping Romanos against the Bulgarians.
However, the most vocal proponent perhaps of this tenet as basis for the claim is Ivan III the Great of Russia, whose marriage with Sophia Palaiologos, niece to Konstantinos XI, last actual emperor of the ERE, gives him a substantial claim to the title of Roman Emperor, as marriages to the relatives of the current emperor has been the sources of multiple claims to the title since the reign of Octavian (Augustus) with Julia the Elder and Tiberius.
The last tenet, Imperial, was actually a late addition; It was formally set in writing in a panegyric by the monk Philotheus of Pskov to Vasili III of Muscovy, stating in the speech that "Two Romes have fallen. The third stands. And there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian Tsardom!".
Ok that makes sense, thank you. On the subject of selling titles, though, I recall that there were numerous occasions where the title of ruler was auctioned during the existence of the Empire. Isn't that similar to how the Spanish monarchy got its claim?
Yes, it doesn't automatically pass the title to him, but it gives him a claim, where he may dispute ownership of the then "holders" of, if not the title, then the seat, of the "Roman Empire", which were the Turks of the House of Osman at that time.
This panegyric was taken in by the Rurikids (and the Romanovs that followed them) as an official proclamation of an official within the Orthodox church stating that with the official consent of the original church of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Grand Princedom of Muscovy, and the Russian Empire that had succeeded it, is the true successor to the title of Roman Empire.
When it comes to medieval claims in the Eastern tradition, there are a lot less set-piece rules on what a "claim" entails and provides (unlike perhaps in the Western Tradition), but essentially, if you have a claim, you have a legitimate reason to fight for a title (and the land it therefore represents) aside from outright conquest.
If we take only tradition in mind, then one can also say that the Spanish claim is also invalidated since Roman tradition did not provide for selling of claims to other potential monarchs, since by tradition, inheritance to the throne are governed by either adoption, (starting from Augustus' adoption of Tiberius), marriage to the previous monarch's wife (Nikephoros II's marriage to Theopano, widow of the previous emperor Romanos II, or Romanos IV's marriage to Eudokia Makrembolitissa who was the previous emperor's widow), or by outright conquest alone, as seen by the myriad of palace coups that led to the reigns of Isaakios I Komnenos, Nikophoros III, and a lot more emperors.
