As noted in the little article you cited, the modern Saudi government does not want serious archaeological investigation, because it will invariably contradict their religious beliefs. Nonetheless, we are not completely ignorant on this topic. If you were hoping for aliens, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
You are asking in particular about the "kites," the circular cairns with what you call "tails" (often now called pendants). They were termed "kites" by British RAF pilots during WW2, who continually noticed them dotting the landscape. Examples in Saudi Arabia are not well known, but examples in Syria and Jordan have been thoroughly investigated. They are generally understood to be "kill traps," or in other words, constructed features that serve to corral animals which are being chased, so they can be run down and killed. Large assemblies of herd animal bones have been found in association with them. The "kites" of the north area are thought by some to differ from the "pendants" generally clustered further south, and their compositions sometimes differ (as you note). It is not clear exactly what the implications are.
The structures in your linked images are not a unified group. They are not even all from the same time period or region. The ancient Arabian landscape was dotted with various constructions, including tombs, cairns (piles of rocks basically), walls, megaliths, et cetera. Most are from the late Neolithic and were constructed/carved/piled by nomadic hunter-gatherers as they crisscrossed western Arabia. Like all megaliths of this time period throughout Europe, Africa, and the Near East, they are somewhat enigmatic. We don't know precisely why they built them, or why some groups built them while others did not.
The heyday of megalith construction in western Arabia is the end of the "Holocene Wet Phase," about the middle of the 4th millennium BCE. At this time there is a mixture of sedentary agricultural/herding communities existing alongside nomadic hunter-gatherers. It is widely assumed that the latter group are responsible for the majority of the constructed features, constructed sporadically over the next two millennia, down to the end middle of the 2nd millennium BCE. Although there has never (to my knowledge) been any sort of real investigation, photographs, drawings, and notes from the pre-war era have been meticulously studied. Arabia is also not the only place such rock art installations have been found (Yemen and Jordan also have identical structures, e.g.).
Thank you so much for this response and for the recommended reading. I will definitely "dig into" these books. Sorry that the best I can offer you in return for such an informative post is a bad pun.
Photos of threatened sites are precious, especially the high res photos we can easily snap on our phones these days. Palymra is gone now thanks to ISIS, and we do not have as complete a set of documentation as we probably could have had, given the right interest and funding. Comprehensive photo sets, with inclusive angles and frames of reference (or even with a little yard stick for scale!) are always valuable.
