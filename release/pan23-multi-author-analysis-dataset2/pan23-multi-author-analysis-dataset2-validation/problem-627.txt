The assumption that people who don't produce what you consider to be important advances must therefore be lacking in intelligence is at best narrow-minded and Eurocentric, and at worst simply racist. We do not allow such attitudes to set the tone for our sub. There are plenty of other ways to ask about this without jumping to the conclusion that people who are not building marble colonnades must be dumb. All of those would start from the question what Native Americans were actually like in their own right, rather than holding them to some imaginary and totally irrelevant standard. For instance, "What was the status of technical skill in Pre-Columbian American societies? Were there architects or inventors?".
We don't allow bigotry and racism on our sub. You're welcome to read the links posted below, but your question will not stand unless you remove the racist language from the body post.
But i still do personally see them as a lesser civilization , they had access to oceans , marble etc but they never used it they seem sooo far behind most every other culture at that time . When i look at most all other civilizations they had a similar structure of city's , towns , roads , laws , govenment .
