Lying about your insurance status to get a discount you are not entitled to can be criminal fraud. Just do the proper, legal thing that is not going to create a legal issue and pay for your vaccine and stop asking if it is OK to lie, cheat and steal.
You can just tell them that paying out of pocket with the discounted price would be more cost effective for you as opposed to using your insurance plan. Even if you have health insurance, you have the option to not use it if you don't want to. Or does this clinic only service the uninsured population?
it says free vaccinations for those that are uninsured, lower cost options for those whose plans don't cover the vaccination. Even though I have insurance, it explicitly states that I can't use it for vaccinations outside of my primary doctor's office if I am under 19.
I would also suggest logging into your insurance plan's member portal (you can google your insurance carrier's name and "member login" to find the website and create an account if you don't already have one) then navigating to the member handbook section and see what it says under vaccine/immunization coverage. Your local pharmacy may be considered an out of network provider so that's why you have to pay full price out of pocket. You can also call your insurance plan's customer service to verify your eligibility and benefits for vaccines and also ask them to help you find an in-network provider so you're not having to scramble to find one on your own and you'll know what you can expect to pay in advance before going. I hope this helps.
Oh no, that wouldn't mean that you're not insured. Most insurance companies are actually required to cover the cost of immunizations as part of preventive care, and I was just suggesting that you should verify your current health insurance plan's vaccine/immunization benefits so you can make sure that you're going to the right place (i.e. an in-network provider/doctor or pharmacy) that can bill your insurance plan directly so you're not having to pay for your vaccines out of pocket.
But it sounds like since you're under 19, you can only go to your primary care provider in order to have your vaccines covered under your insurance plan. Did your doctor's office explicitly tell you that they're no longer administering vaccines or did they give you any explanation for why they're no longer offering vaccinations for their clients?
My current doctor has been having lots of problems since she was diagnosed with cancer, I don‚Äôt know the real reason but I do know they were firm.
I was thinking about going to another clinic, but I wasn‚Äôt sure If i had to switch my plan. Can I go to another place without switching and still be covered by insurance?
Do you have your insurance ID card on you do you know the name of your carrier (for example, Regence, United Health Care, Aetna, Cigna etc.)?
That sounds a bit strange to me. I would call their offices just to double check and make sure that this information is accurate. You can always change your primary care provider if your current one truly isn't administering vaccines anymore. Just go to your insurance carrier's website and use the provider search tool to find a new primary care provider that's in your network/area and see if they're accepting new patients and then request an appointment for your meningococcal vaccine.
I am looking to get the vaccine I need, i just don‚Äôt want to pay the full price for it. My question is in the legality of saying i have no insurance in order to get a discounted/free vaccine.
it‚Äôs the booster shot for meningitis that became required by colleges in 2016. I was not going to college when I was 13, so my doctor thought I should wait to get vaccinated.
Not sure why this came across as anti-vax to you, when i didn‚Äôt state that in my original post and also tried to cleared it up in my reply to you. Thanks for helping me out though üëçüèª.
