I think you mean interpretatio Romana, as interpretatio Graeca was what the greeks did with egyptian and middle-eastern gods in their earlier history in particular. But if I understand what you mean, you're asking if the romans actively tried to integrate Christianity as a form of religious syncretism or explain the monotheistic God as some of roman gods, like what was done with Jupiter Dolichenus or Sol Invictus Elagabal.
The issue with Yahweh is that it's a explicitly monotheistic religion same as with its Jewish origin (though some would argue early judaic traditions were more a sort of henotheism, where you worship but one god but not necessarily exclude that there are other gods) -- and the romans at the time of early christianity saw the christian worshipers as nothing but a sect of Judaism. Therefore it made no sense to integrate an already existing sect that was incompatible with the religious traditions of the Rome into their own and worse yet who refused to worship the Imperial Cult or acknowledge it. Suffice to say, the history of early christianity and Rome was fairly antagonistic.
There are some scholars who would say that late stoicism was influenced by Christianity though others would say it was the other way around.
Christians did indeed become influenced by roman culture and traditions, but it was rather on the administrative and political side of things - emulating much of the territorial reforms and spreading throughout the Roman empire by keeping a very orderly and maintained religious structure.
So by the turn of the 4th century Christianity and their Yahweh was already fairly Roman to begin with. Hope that helps.

Geoffrey Nathan, ph.d, writes very succinctly: As Rome became more Christian, Christianity became more Roman.
Forcibly introducing gods into the pantheon is an incredibly rare and absolutely not the norm of the Roman Empire and its religious history.
Was there no inclination to forcibly integrate Yahweh into the pantheon to de-legitimize Judaism and Christianity, perhaps in the pre-Constantinid period? Wasn't the original Palmyran Elagabalus cult monotheistic?
Upon arriving in Rome he proclaimed Sol Invictus Elagabal as the "king" of the roman pantheon, effectively dethroning Jupiter. Though his rule lasted only 3 years and his theological decisions were immediately overturned by the senate and he was proclaimed damnatio memoriae -- effectively forbidding his likeness to be displayed, his memory to be erased and so on.
Sol Invictus Elagabal as you mention was a type of religious syncretism or you could even call it a religious coup performed by the 14 year old priest-king Elagabalus/Heliogabalus (or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus as he was named upon becoming Emperor) -- who was born and raised in Syria (Emesa) and by the machinations of his syrian-born grandmother and Empress Dowager Julia Domna.
Sol Invictus Elegabal was Elagabalus' implementation of an already "syncretised" god based off Syria which was called Elagabal, which was most likely a mix of the greek Helios, the roman Sol and armenic Shams and had gotten greater popularity in Rome during the Severanian dynasty's rule (as they married to a Syrian noble family which has strong religious ties to Elagabal) -- it was also popular among traders and soldiers stationed in the Syrian provinces.
It is quite possible that Heliogabalus is somewhat a victim of very viscous propaganda that came after his death -- most we know of him comes from the Historia Augusta which was written and compiled during the time of Constantine the first.
You might be refering to the Sol Invictus that came with Emperor Aurelian's reforms during his rise. But there is an on-going debate whether or not that had any monotheistic tendencies as all. Aurelian made Sol Invictus (which most evidence points towards being the roman god Sol, not the syrian Elagabal) the official god of the Roman state which was something entirely new, he even created an entirely new council of pontiffs for the god. But there's newer work being done there that suggests this was more a political show of unity and re-strenhening the authority and legitimacy of the emperor by Aurelian, the great unifier, rather than actually trying to throw out the rest of the pantheon.
Even some of the chroniclers in the Historia suggests that some of the tales and ideas of Heliogabalus are overdramatized for effect and was more made in order to show him in a negative light for political reasons which was absolutely not unheard of at that time.
According to these texts Heligiobalus did many things that angered the gentry of Rome, he even audaciously allowed women (!) into the senate, albeit his grandmother and mother. He also apparently only wore eastern clothing which was definitely not very popular among the ruling or even popular class.
The historian Warwick Ball in his book Rome in the East writes about this and postulates that while Heliogabalus' religious ideas were certainly not uncontroversial, they weren't the sole or defining factor to why we have had this image of a heathen and 'crazy barbarian' as very influential classicists of the 20th century like Franz Cumont and Jean Revielle has described him as.
Cumont in his works about the oriental religions in the Roman Empire describes Heliogabalus ascension to the Roman throne thusly:
Most of this we know is not correct now and many modern scholars would point to that these works of the earlier 1900s are filled with orientalism and negative view of all things not Graeco-Roman. Having read Cumont's Oriental Religions in Roman paganism one definitely get the impression that the eastern religions and civilizations are not painted in a very positive light.
Yet still if you're interested in the historiography of roman/ancient religions you'll note that classicists like Cumont are still very much brought up to this day.
Sorry for this rant-y text, but seeing as you professed a fandom of Heliogabalus I supposed you might've enjoyed a bit of additional info You see my thesis was about Sol (Indiges, Invictus & Elagabal) and its historic development and how 20th century and modern historians have interpreted them - so I can profess I'm fairly read up on the likes of emperor Heliogabalus.
