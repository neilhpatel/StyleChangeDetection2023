I know the whole process sucks, but what I am putting out here is some of the stuff you will need to go through if you truly want to get SSDI. So you will want your lawyer to know you some what and be more then just words on an email. I am sure you could try that route, but I would be surprised if one did what you are looking for.
The goal is to never ever have to have a live conversation. Ever. I’d really like to provide as thorough as possible description up front in order to minimize emailing. One suspects that all lawyers have similar goals for the information they will need. If it means calls then I’m ducked.
Sorry, this doesn’t help. There may not be a template, exactly, but I’m sure there are general questions that they would all ask. And calling a few means reliving trauma.
All I did was either called or emailed on there website the situation. What you are trying to get SSDI for. You will just give them minimal right now as they will as you a lot more questions if they get in touch with you or even more so when you hire them.
ok.. there are no templates of questions the lawyers will ask (each attorney will have their own list). contact a couple that you see advertised -- social security is a volume business and the firms tend to advertise heavily.
