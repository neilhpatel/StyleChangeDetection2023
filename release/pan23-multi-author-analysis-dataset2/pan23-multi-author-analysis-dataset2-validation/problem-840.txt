Does the lease require a specific payment method? Your friend should contact code enforcement and have them inspect the property. No, the landlord can’t break lease at her whimsy and if she has grounds to evict them, like for nonpayment of rent, she must first serve them a 10 day notice to pay or quit. Some reasons for eviction may require less or no notice, like breaching a specific clause of the lease. You can read about it . Here is a landlord tenant handbook produced by your state which discusses how to effect repairs if needed :
It sounds like your friend has already signed a lease. What does the lease say about how the rent should be paid? Your friend should stick to the payment method specified in the lease. There's nothing inherently illegal about using CashApp for rent, though your friend should make sure they will be able to prove they paid on time each month, if necessary.
Hindsight being 20/20, they should not have signed a lease with provisions to which they do not agree, and should not have taken possession of an uninhabitable unit. However, now that they have, they should probably consult a local landlord/tenant lawyer in their area (there may be a tenants' association that can provide legal assistance) to determine whether their lease provisions and living conditions are legal, and their options if not.
Her reason provided was that they wanted a different way to pay rent and were arrogant. It’s in texts where she said that as her reasoning. There was not anything in the lease about a specific method payment should be received. They have already signed the lease and had not moved in yet. This was their first time seeing the property and previously had only seen it through pictures where everything looked like it was in working order. The landlord had renovated by herself and it was not ready by the agreed move in date. It was a fixed lease (year long).
Is this a fixed-term (e.g. one-year) lease? If so, their landlord cannot break the lease without cause. Did she provide a reason for terminating their tenancy? If it is a month-to-month lease, either party can terminate the agreement with just one-week notice, unless the lease specifies otherwise.
