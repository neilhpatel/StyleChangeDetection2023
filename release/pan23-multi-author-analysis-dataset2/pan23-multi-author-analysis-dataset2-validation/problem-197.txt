Unless he's breaking the law, it's unlikely that the police will do anything. She's allowed to have guests. As are you, she can't ban anyone you want over by (for example) calling the police to remove your mother, if your mother were visiting.
If he is breaking the law then yes, you can call the police on him for breaking the law and he could be arrested, and/or you might be able to get a restraining order in court that would prevent him from coming near you, which would effectively ban him from the property for the duration of the order. This needs to be done in court.
Your roommate, and fellow tenant, has a right to have guests. You do not have a right to restrict that unless they've agreed to it, and someone who enters against your wishes but with your roommate's permission is not a trespasser.
A joint lease is not a majority-rules situation, and in general every tenant has equally a right to use the place as they see fit. I understand why you'd want to have some say over your roommate's guests, but you don't unless your roommate agrees to it.
Would that have to be an agreement written in writing? Prior to this, we all had a verbal agreement that we would not bring anyone into the residence unless everyone was okay with it. However, I know that those aren't typically very reliable in a legal sense.
No, but in practice it'd be easier to pursue if it was, marginally. The issue with an agreement like that is that a breach of the agreement would still only be between you and your roommate - it would not enable the police to remove their guest as a trespasser, for example.
If you believe you had a binding agreement, then you can sue over it even if it's only verbal, but I strongly doubt you will achieve anything of value by doing that. Even if you are able to show that, all you're likely to recover are actual damages - and you have none that I can see, unless you paid something to your roommate to secure their promise to get your permission before having guests.
Title: What are my rights after I've told my housemate that I do not feel comfortable with their SO in our shared residence?
I would never sue over something like this. After she left, she did refuse to pay her last month's bills and also withheld something like $60 from the last set of bills she DID pay (essentially her charging me for vacating the room a couple days before the lease was up). I did think about filing against her in small claims court for this as it was close to $200 that she had stolen from me at that point, but I was unaware of her new address and had no way to serve her.
