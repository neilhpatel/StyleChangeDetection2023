What laws could it be and what can I start to show in public to find support? I don’t want anything getting thrown out in court but I need to gain support and attention. I didn’t ask or want any of this. At all but the loophole is dangerous. The ease of abuse with no checks and balances on it.
You accidentally created the filter when you were moving stuff around. I've done it before by accidentally clicking the wrong thing while cleaning up my inbox.
Based on what you're describing, the most coherent explanation of the events you've described is that you accidentally deleted or moved an email message. Your wild theories about customer service agents applying "black filters" to your account are ridiculous.
I checked there are no filters on my end at all recoreded everything i could think of thats the problem plus they admit to it after looking. Its a nightmare cuz it sounds insane but idk i guess the FTC will have to look into it. But i have to look into that more.
Yes I have heard this claim repeatedly yet I have hard drives backed up showing a filter or something was added. Delete only from my view as a consumer from all devices. Yes the call after I figured out a filter was added they can be restored. But I was told forget it it’s impossible so many times that I had to have every answer correct and turns out it can be restored.
I get it this is the problem i assure you i didnt wake up that day after using them for 12 years n say i want to start thiswhoch sounds insane. N no im not 85 i can use a computer.
