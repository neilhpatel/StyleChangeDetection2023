USA's chip ban, while slightly underplayed in the press, went after China's jugular. It wasn't an 'oops' by Biden to say they will defend Taiwan in conjunction with the CHIP Act AND cut off China's access to US technology (and forcing Americans to either come home or give up their citizenship).
For all Trmp’s bluster, his “trade war” tariffs were predictably ineffectual and their costs were ultimately borne by Americans.
This is how you fight a real trade war. The Biden administration has targeted a strategically critical industry for the Chinese with a sanction that actually stings - not something that they can just pass on to consumers.
