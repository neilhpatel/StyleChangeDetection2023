You include recovery, so were you symptomatic? Did you have to go to the hospital? How long had you been employed there? Are there at least 50 employees in a 75 mile radius? Have you worked at least 1250 hours in the past 12 months?
So you used your sick days for each day of quarantine/recovery, or you used them later on for some other reason?
They gave me a ten day quarantine period as per CDC guidelines, they scheduled me to come in on the tenth day but I still had a temperature and still showed symptoms, they told me at this point I had to use my sick days so I did. I am guaranteed three sick days every month, and once I was up I continued with work. I work at a franchise that has multiple locations within the area, some of which is owned by the same individual.
Only count the ones that are owned by the same franchisee. Would you guess more or less than 50 employees in a 75 mile radius?
I see, I feel like there being 50 employees under the same owner could be hit or miss, but going by the employee list at the location I worked at it would suggest it’s just over 50, but I’m really not sure. I’ve only been there for a couple months and I have not been hospitalized.
They don't have to give you any hours presuming at will. They aren't employing you. So you don't have any employment. So you need to file for unemployment.
