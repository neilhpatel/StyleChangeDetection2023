To be honest I've noticed an almost complete lack of World Cup advertisements this year in my home city in UK. We're usually rammed with sponsorships on crisp packets, fizzy drinks, chocolates. Your usual convenience store would be themed in the hosting country's flag etc.
But this year it's eerily silent, I think they must have made the advertising decision half a year ago.
I don't get to look at the quadratic formula and say "that's legit", and then proceed to call the Pythagorean theorem "allegoric nonsense".
Most religious people, regardless of religion, find ways to have their faith and have beliefs not of that faith and still lead happy lives that doesn't hurt anyone.
Sunnis see Shias as non Muslim and visa versa. It's all bullshit at the end of the day. You either belong to one club or the other and if your not in our club then you deserve to die. Religion is a cancer.
Personally, I'm against cherry picking in religion. If your beliefs don't align with your religion, quit. All religion is fucked up, it should be abolished.
The fact that Christian homosexuals want to get married in a church is baffling to me. Why would you want to manifest your love in the house of a religion that has spent the past 1500 years persecuting you? It's crazy.
Why? Because I don't think you get to pick and choose what aspects of the Bible or whatever you believe in?
Noâ€¦you said all religion is fucked up and should be abolished. That is an extreme view as that is equivalent to saying not believing in religion is fucked up and made to believe.
If you can't determine the difference between empirical evidence based on the scientific theory, and a 1500 year old book based on a 3000 year old book reiterated, retranslated and rewritten hundreds of times, then... Well...
