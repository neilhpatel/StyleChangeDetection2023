There's always the fact that your landlord doesn't have to let you add someone to the lease at all. ...Some states limit how much a landlord can charge for a security deposit, . You can read the relevant law by starting and clicking to the next section about 3 times.
The only thing I could find on the paperwork is that the rent will increase by $400 for every new tenant added to the lease but nothing about another security deposit.
Still, your landlord doesn't have to let you add another tenant to the lease. If your desired roommate won't pay a deposit, your landlord won't agree to amend the lease. As a separate matter, you should be sure your landlord is compliant with the terms iterated in the NOLO article. If he isn't, he might forfeit the right to withhold the security deposit when you move out. Be sure there is a record of the full amount of the deposit paid...when you pay the second deposit, get a receipt and keep it safe. It would be best to have an amendment to the lease detailing the second deposit. You don't want your landlord to say a second deposit was never rendered, or for him to sell the property and the new landlord to have no record of the second transaction.
