That doesn’t mean his admin hasn’t contributed to it. Policies can make it worse or better, which is why every country doesn’t have the exact same inflation rate.
In terms of G20 countries, we’re pretty much in the middle. We’ve been more effective than a lot of countries, but that doesn’t mean it’s been effective. It’s just less bad than others.
So many people fail to understand that many of our problems and/or successes are the delayed result of the previous president. Trump took tons of credit for Obama’s economic success because the effects were still unfolding in 2018. At the same time the GOP release their “tax cut” which only cuts taxes for the working class for the first two years before raising taxes again when a democrat is in office.
Republicans use this delay effect to ride the successes of their democratic predecessors and deny the blame for their own disasters.
Biden taking “no blame” on inflation is entirely wrong, and it’s not “intellectual deficits” to point that out. If anything, the people in this thread seem to be the ones who are trying to find excuses.
They can point to inflation numbers -- that much is true. But what Biden policy caused bird flu to ravage the chicken population? What Biden policy caused Putin to not have any of his shit together on Ukraine?
That would be true if corporations recorded their input costs at current values, which they don’t. It’s why profits and profit margins usually rise when inflation does, with a slight lag.
Because corporations are reaping record profits. That's profits, not income. If the prices they were paying were rising commensurate with their costs, then their profits wouldn't be at all-time highs even if their income were rising.
How is it that unfunded spending under Trump didn't cause inflation, but unfunded spending under a Democratic president automatically leads to inflation?
Unfunded spending under Trump (CARES act) did cause inflation. TCJA probably didn’t, or at least the CBO didn’t predict it to at the time, since it also increased productivity and labor supply.
Inflation was 1.2% in 2020, it wasn’t “already here”. Policies in 2020 definitely contributed to later inflation, but policies under Biden did as well. It’s wrong for Biden to take “no blame”, because Trumps policies alone didn’t cause 8% inflation.
I'm using the wrong terminology here. It's not that Republicans can't argue what they're arguing -- it's that they can't argue it credibly.
Read my comment, I said the CARES act contributed to inflation. Your entire comment is arguing against a point that I didn’t make, and haven’t defended.
