This is a sensitive topic that gets to the roots of the biggest ideological schism in Marxist thought. Marx’s ideas are open to interpretation and have been interpreted many different ways. I’ll strive to present as close to an unbiased interpretation as I’m able but please feel free to point out anything you think is unnecessary commentary here. I’ll be providing sources for the Soviet union’s policy and disposition but not for what I perceive as the basics of Marxist theory.
In short, the Soviet Union was ideologically communist, or more specifically Marxist-Leninist and was ruled by the Communist Party. The government of the Soviet Union practiced what they called socialism, which they believed to be a transitional form on the road to Communism. Other communists have challenged the validity of their gameplan for establishing communism and some even went so far as to challenge the idea that they practiced socialism at all, most famously Leon Trotsky, who believed them to be what he called a “degenerated workers’ state.”.
Communism as Marx and Engels defined it is a classless society where a state is no longer necessary and collectivized production is able to provide such a surplus of all life’s necessities that money becomes obsolete as a medium of exchange and everyone gets everything they need. They believed the establishment of such a society would be a natural consequence of the same historical processes that developed out of feudalism and capitalism.
In their view, the globalization of the bourgeoisie created a single common interest for the proletariat, who, comprising the vast majority of industrial society, had only to realize their power and assume control worldwide. The workers would then establish “lower state communism” (or “socialism” as Lenin and other later thinkers have called it) where state power and money or a money like medium of exchange would still exist and a “dictatorship of the proletariat” (most commonly read as not a literal dictatorship but a contrast to the “dictatorship of the bourgeoisie” that was republican governance) would restructure society to eliminate all class divisions and make all people equal. At the end of this project the state would simply “wither away” as humanity would have no more need for it.
Trotsky on the other hand believed that the historical process was better viewed globally rather than nation-by nation. The time had come for revolution worldwide and Russia could play a key part in it alongside the industrial countries. As long as the rest of the world stayed on their path to revolution, Russia could achieve and surpass the benchmark of bourgeois liberal revolution and jump into socialism all in one step.
Several schools of thought emerged among Russian socialists during the waves of unrest from 1905 onwards. The orthodox school of thought was that Russia lagged behind western Europe in their historical dialectical progression and would thus need to have a bourgeois liberal revolution to overthrow the Tsar, establish a republic, and industrialize the country. Only once they were “caught up” to this part of the process would the workers truly have the potential to seize power and implement socialism.
Towards the end of the First World War, Russia’s government was on the verge of collapse and the Bolshevik vanguard was able to overthrow the Tsar once and for all. But the global revolution never came. Socialist and communist movements that seemed poised to enact their own revolutions fell apart or were crushed or fizzled out abroad. The communists were in uncharted territory. Beset by a world full of enemies and without a single ally abroad, party leadership practiced a kind of hybrid between these theories in which the workers’ state established industrialization programs designed to catch them up to where they needed to be to establish socialism, while at the same time turning inwards and focusing on protecting their dominion over Russia rather than expending resources to try to bolster other revolutionary movements.
The political realities in early 20th century Europe problematized these predictions, however. Revolutions across the industrialized world fizzled out or were successfully repressed. In Russia, which had not fully industrialized under Tsarist rule, would-be revolutionaries struggled to reconcile Marx’s predictions of revolution among the industrialized urban proletariat with their own desire to establish communism at home in a society that was still largely made up of peasants or peasant-adjacent workers who farmed the land with little mechanization or modern technology.
For the "withering away of the state" as viewed by Marxists, it's worth remembering that their definition of the state is a little different from more common definitions. One of the most common definitions of the state for people outside the Marxist tradition is "the entity with the monopoly on the legitimate use of violence," but that is not the Marxist definition. Marxists define the state as "the organ by which one class exercises its rule over other classes and society at large.".
Thanks for reading it! I was worried I was too late to the party. The other answer is good too but I was in too deep to back out by the time I saw it.
These policies were later codified by Stalin under the theory of Socialism in One Country. The Soviet Union would later return their focus to fostering revolution abroad in one nation at a time, mostly focusing on underdeveloped and formerly colonized nations, but the dream of a single global proletarian revolution in all or most of the developed capitalist countries was dead and the dream of communism was put on hold. Khrushchev made it a goal in 1961 to establish communism “in the main” by 1980 with the slogan “communism in 20 years,” which famously prompted the retort “this slogan will survive centuries”.
