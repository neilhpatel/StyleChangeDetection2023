You know as morbid as this all is, between these gruesome murders and innocents in both Ukraine and Russia dying. My interest is peaked and hope we can find a way to not enter a nother world war either over Ukraine or Taiwan or India or Pakistan or Iran or literally any other major flashpoint zone throughout the globe. This for the singular purpose of an HBO miniseries or full lenh series like Generation Kill or Chernobyl covering the conflict and everything happening behind the scenes. This catalyzed by a Democratic Russian and Ukrainian state at peace.
Hmmm, not what I was expecting for a random wealthy Russian that died mysteriously. Usually they are gas, oil, or weapons/military involved oligarchs, but I guess now we have moved on to food.
It's OK to call it a war as long as you brag about it and love the whole idea. God help you if you even mumble any negative though about it to yourself.
Imagine saving a years worth of salary enough to afford to lose your virginity to a Gori and then finding out the "Russian" is an old white male, Pavel was a victim of lost passion.
