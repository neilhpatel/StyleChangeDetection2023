The best way to keep from getting taken advantage of is to have someone you trust help you out with the process, and a probate lawyer is the best person to look for. If you trust your dad's attorney, then continuing to use their services is probably going to be the easiest approach to take, since he's going to be familiar with your father's estate and the terms of his will.
Yes, it's common to have to fill out a form listing his assets, that's done so that the courts can verify that everything got taken care of.
If his lawyer didn't ask for an hourly fee and only stated that we would be charged his retainer and what the filing fees were, is that normal? Or should we give him a call and ask specifically about hourly fees?
Estate lawyers rarely charge based on the value of the estate; they will charge an hourly rate. You should discuss the lawyers rates and fees before you decide to hire/retain them, just like you would discuss costs with any professional.
The retainer is an advance fee payment and then the payment is put towards the bills. You should as for hourly rate. You can minimise the bills by doing much of the work yourself such as inventory, asset lists etc.
Just so you are aware, life insurance is paid directly to the beneficiary, it’s not part of probate and cannot be garnished to pay for debts of the deceased. It becomes the beneficiaries money essentially instantly and has nothing to do with the deceased’s estate.
And our mother had a life insurance policy that was paid out to my father as he was the beneficiary. Would this be part of the estate estimate because it was already paid out to him?
If your father did not have a beneficiary on any life insurance or if the beneficiary was your late mother with no contingent beneficiary than the money may go to Estate and may be part of Estate.
If father had life insurance and one of you were the named beneficiary then it’s not part of the estate. If father was a beneficiary on someone else’s insurance that payout is the same as any other money in the estate. Now if mothers policy hadn’t paid out yet that would be worth consulting someone.
