The Digest is also a chance to shout out those interesting yet overlooked posts that still cry out for an answer. Feel free to post your own, or others you came across and liked.
Below are my entries for the week last month \- questions with a link to an older response are marked with ‡. Let me know what you think were the realest questions you saw this week month, and be sure to check out .
, I'm experimenting with how I actually handle The Real Questions. Among other things, that means I'm probably switching to making this a monthly feature rather than weekly. Hence, the hiatus. But, here we are again!
And that wraps me up for another week everyone. You have yourselves a fantastic time out there, and I’ll see you next Sunday!
The salamander one really called to me, purely because I love salamanders. But I do have to say, the historical pornography one has been on my mind since I saw it.
It’s the start of September, and that brings with it a new shiny digest for everyone to enjoy Check out the hundreds of great history threads, and don’t forget to show some appreciation for the hard working contributors.
At long last, it is once again time for another installment of "The Real Questions", where we take a look at the wilder side of r/AskHistorians Here, I give a shout-out to people asking the more atypical questions on this sub: questions that investigate amusing, unique, bizarre, or less common aspects of history, as well as ones that take us through intriguing adventures of historiography/methodology or niche/overlooked topics and moments in history. It's always a wide (and perhaps confusing) assortment of topics, but at the end of the day, when I see them I think, "Finally, someone is asking the real questions".
