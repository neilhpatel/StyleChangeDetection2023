Until you receive that, do not make any other statements about it, nor accept the debt collection co's comments that it's yours.
If you didn't accept the loan, or receive any funds related to said loan, then no you have no obligation.
DO NOT accept the loan or the suggestion that is your debt. Push back on the collection co and request debt verification and proof that it's yours.
I had told them on the phone I had never taken out a loan like that and she said she would put it on my credit report as a dispute, but there would be a possibility of litigation.
Also going forward, as that all correspondence be through email so that everything is documented. If they call, invest in a tape recorder and disclose you'll be recording. They record everything to use against you, protect yourself against them claiming you say something different.
Don't accept the debt. Additionally if they DO for suit and you are served, absolutely respond to that. If you miss court it will be find in their favor regardless of the facts and you would be obligated to pay at that point.
