The shop they worked at is a small business that is, literally, too small to have even implemented 6-foot distance procedures even after things began to open again.
There was also a while where they were open at partial capacity and only put a few employees on the schedule as a result (I'm talking about one person working open to close).
It wasn't just general anxiety, the VA state government told everyone to quarantine inside their homes unless they were essential workers, and the unemployment commission said that if you were unable to work due to the pandemic, you were eligible for unemployment.
I am also a Virginia resident and none of the executive orders told anyone to “quarantine” for months. He will likely be required to repay the money for any of the time his work was open but he chose not to go in. The unemployment money was meant to help those whose jobs were lost due to temporary or permanent downsizing or closure due to the pandemic. Contrary to popular belief, it was not meant to support those who chose not to work when their job (or a new job) was available. The questionnaire he completed weekly should’ve been read and answered very carefully.
The only advice is to appeal. Unless he was personally told it was medically necessary to quarantine he should prepare to replay it, start on a plan to do so. General anxiety about COVID is almost certainly not going to be good cause.
That’s reading into what the Governor said more than was intended. The governor didn’t tell people to quit their jobs. I would expect the appeal to be denied.
