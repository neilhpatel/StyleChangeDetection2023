The CDC moratorium only applied to evictions for non-payment of rent due to COVID related hardship anyway. It did NOT apply to holdover tenants, which is what she would be if she remained beyond the properly provided notice period.
Due to the novel nature of things right now, it's not a terrible idea to book 30 mins to an hour of a local landlord attorney's time just to have them look everything over, but I don't see any reason why you would be prevented from moving forward with eviction on June 1st.
The federal decision was stayed (meaning essentially it’s potential effect was paused pending appeal), so that’s not going to help you at all. But the CDC eviction moratorium is limited to evictions for nonpayment of rent. It should not apply to an eviction for end of lease term. Having said that, some Magistrates in SC won’t touch a case at all if a CDC declaration has been given/filed. If I was you, I’d go ahead and file the application for ejectment if tenant is jerking around and being dishonest, but realistically if you file on June 2nd, she’s not going to be put out until about the end of June anyway if she requests a hearing. But I guess if you file now at least you won’t have to wait the additional 3ish weeks from filing to set out if you waited until July and she still didn’t move.
