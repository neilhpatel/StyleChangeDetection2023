Nothing too fancy, just an old-fashioned massive surprise attack to start the war. The Arab countries involved didn't expect the war to start then. For example, the Egyptian army was in the middle of redeploying to new positions in the Sinai (which didn't help them in the ground fighting, since many units were quite unprepared to fight - some were separated from equipment and supplies, some commanders didn't know where their units were, etc.), and appear to have thought that either there would be no war, or that war would come after some posturing and threats, and probably be started by Egypt. The Israeli pre-emptive war was fundamentally a surprise.
The Israeli Air Force preserved surprise for as long as possible by flying over the Mediterranean and by flying low to avoid radar. The first wave was at 7:45 in the morning, and destroyed about 40% of the Egyptian air force; the second wave a couple of hours later took this to about 2/3 of the Egyptian air force destroyed. Most of the IAF's operational combat aircraft flew in the first wave, and most of them flew again in the second wave. This, in itself, was surprising to the Egyptians, who were not capable of such a rapid tempo - since they couldn't refuel and rearm their own aircraft for a second strike so quickly, why should they have thought that Israel could? Most of the Israeli aircraft flew a third time at noon, this time striking airfields in Syria, Jordan, and even Iraq.
The destruction of a large part of the Egyptian air force gained Israel air superiority, which enabled them overcome opposition later that day, when their enemies had been warned, and turn that superiority in air supremacy that would last the war.
This air supremacy didn't bring victory by itself - the Israeli army earned the victory the hard way: on the ground. The air victory took the Arab air forces out of the picture, and let the Israeli air force provide air support for the ground forces. However, the destruction of enemy ground forces was largely done by the army.

Crazy to think Israel managed to hold back and even overcome the other countries despite the overwhelming difference in air, naval and ground troops.
It's notable that Egypt should not have been as surprised. They knew that Israel has finished mobilization and deployment by June 2, and some sources (i.e. Michael Oren's Six Days of War) even quote Nasser saying on June 2 that the enemy would "strike a blow within 48 to 72 hours, by June 5 at the latest". June 5, of course, is when the blow actually was struck. So why the confusion and failure to respond?
Well, in part, it's because Nasser and his military leaders thought that they wouldn't face the losses they ended up taking. Sidqi Mahmud was saying that 15-20% of Egyptian planes would be lost in an Israeli initial strike if they didn't pull aircraft back from forward operating positions, and Sadiq Mahmud responded that pulling back would ruin pilot morale and that was worse. Nasser, for his part, said that if Sidqi Mahmud still had 80-90% of his planes, that remainder could still cause Israel to lose 60-70% of its own forces. In the actual first wave of the strike, some estimate up to half of Egypt's planes were lost; far more than the estimate. Including the second wave, which struck further back in the lines, up to 2/3 of Egypt's air force was destroyed, and many of the bases were rendered inoperable, grounding many of the planes that weren't destroyed.
On the Egyptian end, there was general command and control overconfidence. Commanders went on vacation despite the tension, or partied. The chief of the air force in Sinai later wrote that "The commander of the [Sinai] front wasn't in place and the army's commander wasn't in place, and neither were their subordinates", even as Israeli tanks began to line up along the front.
Another unique factor that hampered response was the way Israel launched the attack. It first launched old training jets, broadcasting on the same frequencies as fighter jets, and kept them looking like they were running the routine patrols. Then it committed virtually every jet it had to the assault. The planes flew incredibly low to avoid detection by Egyptian radar, and swept out into the Mediterranean before heading south into Egypt, with complete radio silence and the use of hand signals only. The pilots were well-trained, and had been secretly planning the strike with almost no knowledge, even among the political echelon, in case of execution. They had intricate knowledge of Egyptian bases and locations through spies in the Egyptian military. The Egyptians, for their part, had not placed any of their planes in hardened bunkers or hangars, making them especially vulnerable. Many Egyptian assumptions were proven wrong, including beliefs that some bases were outside of Israel's range for any initial strike. And perhaps the most unique factors were twofold: the location of the head of the Egyptian military, and the failure of warning systems in Egypt.
I'll add onto the generally correct and excellent answer by /u/wotan_weevil above with some additional details, since I have the time today!
The first problem was the location of not just the head of the Egyptian military, Field Marshal Amer, but also the location of many commanders (including the head of the Egyptian air force, the already-mentioned Sidqi Mahmud). Many commanders were traveling between bases in Ilyushin-14 transports when the attack came, and came upon the destroyed bases from the air. But they had issued no-fire orders to avoid being fired on themselves, so many anti-air forces failed to fire. One Egyptian Major in Cairo did command his forces to open fire on the Israelis, and even said later that he expected to be courtmartialed for it when he did it, but instead received a medal for valor; he was one of the few who chose to fire without orders to do so.
So why were the Israelis themselves taken aback at their success? Well, partially because they themselves weren't aware of all these factors. They had accounted for the Egyptians overcoming their shock and rallying, shooting down far more Israeli planes than they got. Israeli planes were ordered to reserve some fuel for combat maneuvers, as well as ammunition. But no response came; Egypt's failure to anticipate the attack at all, its failure to respond due to fears of shooting down Amer, and its trouble getting planes in the air, all crippled them far more than Israel expected. Additionally, Israel was employing new runway-destroying bombs, whose effectiveness was shockingly high even for Israel.
Israel itself was surprised at the level of its success. In fact, Israel's own expectations were wrong; they expected to take out half as many aircraft and bases as they did.
There were other problems. Egypt assumed that Israel would attack at dawn, so their pilots were eating breakfast in many bases when the attack actually came, a couple hours later. Their patrols had already been flown, so they didn't expect an attack during that time. There were only a few training flights in the air.
Hope that helps explain how the surprise was so effective! When it comes down to it, Israeli effectiveness in training, preparation, and intelligence contrasted with Egyptian failures in command and control, communication, and preparedness, and that created a perfect storm that led to the success of the initial strike.
If you'd like, I can talk a bit about the Syria strike that followed, once Syria decided to join the war (though Israel did not want this, according to Cabinet discussions and orders that went out, it did expect this).
The fighting on the Jordanian front did not begin with the airstrikes. In fact, there were sporadic outbursts of small-arms fire from the Jordanians before anything else. The Israelis did not respond, because Israel hoped Jordan would stay out of the war and wanted to avoid escalation. However, the Jordanian offensive also included artillery shells fired towards Tel Aviv, albeit only a few at first. Then, after about an hour of relatively few shells being fired, Jordanian artillery opened up with a massive barrage towards Jerusalem, at which point Israel realized Jordan did intend to enter the war. It was about two hours after the first artillery shells began landing that Jordanian fighters carried out attacks on a few towns in Israel. Those attacks did not do much damage, but did also further indicate the Jordanian resolve.
The second problem was a failure of command and communication. Few know this, but Egypt did receive a warning that Israeli jets were incoming. Jordan had a radar facility at Aljun, supplied by the British, that did see the Israeli jets taking off. They had seen, thanks to Israeli preparation, planes heading out to sea before, but not in these numbers and density. So they transmitted a warning to Egypt. That warning would have saved perhaps 30+ minutes of preparation, enough for Egypt to get more planes in the air, had it been communicated effectively. Unfortunately for Egypt, it was not. The first problem was a problem of encoding; the Egyptians had changed their coding mechanisms for messages, but Jordan hadn't been told. The second was that Israel's planes were not broadcasting on the normal frequencies for those jets, since the training planes were doing so to trick Jordan/Egypt. Still, Jordan radioed the warning repeatedly, and got no response. The person who would receive them, the Defense Minister, had gone to bed and told everyone not to bother him. The people in charge of decoding messages were also not at their posts. Warnings were ignored by officers who did see them, believing they were not accurate. Those who were there are largely viewed as unprepared, if not incompetent, which was an endemic issue in Egypt's military due to a political cronyism inherent to its composition at that time.
