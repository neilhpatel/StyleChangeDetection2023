First, gather a time line of all your contacts with your probation officer, be sure to highlight when you attended the evaluation and when the results were provided. You will want to show the judge you have been making repeated attempts to compete the terms of your probation.
The second issue is the factual problems in the report. Unfortunately there is a problem with unethical treatment providers doctoring assessments to increase recommended treatment plans. They know the client can't quit because they are under a court order. Some states address thus by requiring the assessment provider cannot provide the recommended therapy. Gently bring this up with your judge and say you have concerns about the accuracy of the report, ask for a new referral to a different provider and a new assessment.
Judges do not take kindly to this unethical behavior, I saw several providers in my area go out of business when it came out they were doing something similar; the courts stopped using them.
The therapist doing the assessment should also be using objective measures, such as the SASSI as part of the process.
Honestly when I asked my PO where to get the classes through I was told they would tell me, and they basically just handed me the papers without saying anything. Is finding the clinical director an easy task? Is this something I should get done before or after court? My PO setup the next date to meet after my court date this month, in December.
It already has been extended, my original court date was in July and then my PO filed an extension to push it to last month. I'm not entirely sure that's an option anymore because the extension was for these classes that I didn't have during the extension.
Edit: And yes, I would do this immediately. If you can get an updated eval before court that would be great, but you can always ask for a continuance if they cannot do it in time for your hearing.
Edit: After reading again I realize you likely mean the actual location that did the substance evaluation, but in that case my question still stands on how to find the director.
You just call the agency where you did the evaluation, and ask to speak with the clinical director. Just let them know you completed an eval on X date, but after reviewing it, there appears to be some significant discrepancies, and you have concerns there may have been a mistake. I would have a list of the issues prewritten, so, in the event they request the discrepancies in writing you will have that ready. Ask that they redo it based on the info you provide and request an updated copy be sent to yourself and your PO. Given that some of the info is easily refutable (the offense type), you have a good deal of credibility here. When you call, do your best to remain calm, and I would follow everything up with an email, so you have a paper trail. I’d also CC your PO on everything. If it’s in writing, no one can deny they received the information. If they refuse to correct the report, then I’d escalate to an attorney.
Weed's legal, driving high is not. Got pulled over for having my center brake light out and when i made a left turn I went into the lane on the right side when you need to go to the one that's closest to you.
