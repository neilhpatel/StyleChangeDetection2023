They do have it setup to pay people in the other state, I know that. A few people I work with live in that state.
You don't have a legal argument, but you might have a semi-compelling argument if they already are set up to pay people in the state you want to move to. Otherwise, that will be expensive, probably cost-prohibitive, for them. Think of every state as its own little country, in a sense.
Again, I don't think they'd say no, especially since they pretty much said there's no reason I have to be in an office.
Hot job market....I'd find a job willing to let me be virtual, with a higher salary, and force their hand or I'll leave.
Especially when you are talking about moving to a different state; while it's not super complicated, it's not always the easiest thing to have an employee working out of a new state, and the company may not want to set things up just for you.
Generally, companies can have different rules for different employees so long as those rules aren't illegal discrimination or in violation of any agreements or contracts. So just because other people are remote, does not automatically mean you can demand it.
