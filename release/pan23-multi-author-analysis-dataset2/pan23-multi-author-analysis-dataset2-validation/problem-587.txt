The Canadian military is crying out for more people but the problem is why would anyone sign up these days. Pay is garbage and the government screws you. Trudeau said to the vets, "You are asking for more than we can give." Then dumps billions overseas. Get a trade and start making 90k a year easily.
Sadly cannot find it right away, but it was incredibly interesting. Since it went into the urban warfare aspect quite a bit, and how one could/should incorperate it during city planning.
Forgot who it was but was listening to an officer making an excellent case for allowing the baltic states to switch to an insurgency style of defense.
Either they rush, unload everything and push as far as they can before help arrives, and they get caught without proper supplies/ammo, now fighting against an army build for insurgency & nato reinforcements.
Or they take a more measured approach, make sure logistics can keep up, and they won't make it before help arrives.
The idea of total defence in lieu of the current NATO model is getting traction, but the powers that be inside NATO apparently are wary of change in this way, atleast that's what's being said.
I was a conscript in the estonian defense forces and one of my officers said that he believes we should train for warfare thats more guerilla, rather than try to fight a conventional war against russia. Whether or not he's right, I'm in no position to say.
This was before feb 22 mind you. And he correctly called the trouble Russia would face logistic wise, once they get away from their trains.
This isn't a issue if we actually went to war and everything is mobilized. Standing up "enough bodies" means more military budget is required, and god forbid if we have to increase military spending.
This "first-line" force is not a stall, its a token force to show NATO resolve to deny Russia expansion.
