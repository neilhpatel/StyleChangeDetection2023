I suppose if one wants to be technical, any business for which one’s sex is in any way relevant is a sexually oriented business. Not sure why anyone would want to regulate on that basis.
Regulating on the basis of morality is a general route for authoritarians, left and right. Thing is, one is traditionally directionally motivated (right), and one is more generally accuracy motivated (left).
On a more accurate note, we should begin designating some pseudo-Christian religious institutions as “sexually oriented businesses” and “abusive to children”, as some of these institutions are highly manipulative, dishonest, and dangerous to children, families, and individuals.
They are sex obsessed and frustrated, and they live in such a way that they have no real human connections in their lives because they eschew empathy at all times, even with their children and spouses.
Respect for empathy was knocked out of them by their parents when they were young kids so they are stuck sleepwalking through their lives, unable to create meaningful bonds with anyone, and unable to understand and accept that it isn’t like that for normal people.
They make things that aren’t about sex and sexuality about sex because they aren’t able to put themselves in the shoes of other people, but they can relate to sexual repression and frustration, so everything becomes about that all the time forever.
