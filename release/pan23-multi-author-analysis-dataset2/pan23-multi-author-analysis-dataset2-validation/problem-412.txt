Bronze became popular before iron because alloying copper to make bronze was discovered long before iron smelting was discovered (smelting = turning ore into metal). Iron was used before iron smelting, in the form of native iron (i.e., iron found as metallic iron rather than ore), mostly meteoric iron. Tools and weapons were sometimes made with meteoric iron, e.g., Tutankhamun's meteoric iron dagger:
but these were rare and expensive - the gold-bladed dagger also found with Tutankhamun was likely the cheap-and-nasty companion to this iron dagger. (Iron smelting had been discovered, but had not reached Egypt yet.) Tutankhamun's iron dagger demonstrates that key iron-working technologies, such as hot-forging and forge-welding had been developed. With these, depending on the object, iron can be easier to work with than bronze. Typical Bronze Age bronze alloys need to be cold-forged (and annealed by heating and quenching as they work-harden), and this cold-forging needs more force than hot-forging iron. Bronze had the advantages that it could be cast, and some items were easier to forge (e.g, large thin sheets, or helmets, or breasplates and other plate armour pieces) because it's easier to hand such pieces when cold than hot, and they cool quickly if hot-forging (due to large surface area for their mass).
The high-tin bronzes typically used for edged weapons and tools were generally harder than their iron equivalents. They also had the advantage of much better corrosion resistance. Iron was functionally inferior. Meteoric iron had the advantage of rarity making it valuable - an important consideration when making prestige items. Where the meteoric iron was identified as stuff having fallen from the sky, it also had the magical advantage of being "sky metal". Once iron smelting became reasonably common, iron became much cheaper than bronze. Iron ore is very abundant, and bog iron and iron sand can be collected without the difficult process of hard-rock mining. Copper ore is less abundant, and more likely to require hard-rock mining and/or underground mining. Tin ore is even less abundant. Iron was not a better alternative to bronze, but a cheaper alternative.
Later, hardened steel provided a superior material, much harder than both bronze and iron. When iron was first replacing bronze, hardened steel was still far in the future.
As for aluminium, aluminium is very abundant in the Earth's crust (third after oxygen and silicon), and aluminium ore is common. The difficulty is smelting aluminium. Copper, tin, and iron are usually smelted from oxide ores (non-oxide ores are commonly converted to oxide ores by roasting (heating in an oxidising atmosphere). To smelt the ore, the oxygen needs to be removed, and the usual process is to heat the ore with carbon - the carbon will bond to the oxygen more strongly, and pull it off the metal, converting the ore to metal. This won't work with aluminium - it bonds more strongly to oxygen than carbon does. Today, electrolysis is used to convert a molten alumina (aluminium oxide) solution to metallic aluminium. This needs electrical technology, and was not possible before modern times. This means that aluminium only became available long after hardened steel was available for edged weapon and tools. So it hasn't ever been attractive for edged weapons and tools. Today, many tools are made of aluminium (especially cookware) or have aluminium parts, but aluminium sharp edges are very rarely used.
Aluminium would not be attractive for edged weapons/tools even in the absence of hardened steel. It is harder than copper, but softer than wrought iron and high-tin bronzes. The Brinell hardness of aluminium is about 70, vs 105 for wrought iron, about 100 for 10% tin bronze and 160 for 20% tin bronze (and bronze blade edges are typically harder due to work-hardening by hammering). For comparison, mild steel has a Brinell hardness of about 130, and hardened steel about 600. (Brinell hardnesses depend on the test conditions, and I've tried to find values for similar test conditions).
I've spent time in the meteorite collection at the Smithsonian, and my memory is a lot of them had nickel, and possibly other elements mixed in. Are any of the extant meteoric iron goods, like that dagger, interesting alloys?
Most meteoric iron objects are nickel-cobalt-iron alloys. 5-25% nickel is usual. A nickel content of 5% or greater is suggestive of meteoric origin, but some terrestrial iron ores have enough nickel to reach those levels, so it isn't definitive. However, a high nickel content combined with a nickel:cobalt ratio typical of meteorites is excellent evidence of meteoric origin. Tutankhamun's iron dagger, which had long been suspected to be meteoric, was confirmed as such a few years ago on these grounds:
Daniela Comelli et al., "The meteoritic origin of Tutankhamun's iron dagger blade", Meteoritics and Planetary Science 51(7) 1301-1309 (2016):
Interesting has been done with high-nickel meteoric iron. One famous example is the use of meteoric iron to produce high-contrast pamor (patterns) in pattern-welded Indonesian keris blades. The only known source of meteoric iron in pre-modern Indonesia was the Prambanan meteorite, which fell in the late 18th century. Nickel-iron alloys in pattern-welded keris blades predate the meteorite, and probably used high-nickel terrestrial iron from Sulawesi. The meteorite offered higher-constrast pamor, due to higher nickel content, as well as the opportunity to use something fallen from the sky. This has given rise to claims that all keris blades are meteoric (or partly meteoric), which is simply untrue, but shows the wonderfulness (in the literal sense) of meteorites and meteoric iron. (In modern times, high-nickel bicycle parts or even sheets of pure nickel have been used.) The high contrast results from the arsenic-based stain blackening the low-nickel iron/steel parts of the blade, leaving the high-nickel iron relatively bright. Much modern high-contrast damascus steel is made with 1095 and 15N20 (with 2% nickel), although the usual stains are different (non-arsenic, for a start).
The other way to identify meteoric iron is Widmanst√§tten patterns, resulting from very slow cooling forming large crystals, as seen on these cut, polished, and etched meteorites:
Hot forging destroys these patterns (so they're not present in Tutankhamun's dagger), but if the object is ground to shape without forging, the pattern remains intact. Cold-forging will distort the pattern, but not eliminate it - such distorted patterns were used to identify the iron edges in two early Chinese iron-edged bronze axes as meteoric:
