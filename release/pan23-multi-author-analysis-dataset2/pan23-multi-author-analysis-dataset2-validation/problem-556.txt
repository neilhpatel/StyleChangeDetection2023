Insurance follows the car. If the car is insured, it's insured. You need to check with your insurance, but she's probably covered if you don't live together. Is the title in your name only? If so then you can tell her you will not allow her to drive the car. But you're going down the wrong path with the insurance, probably. Just check with your insurance. Because insurance follows the car, not the driver, she's probably right. Doesn't mean she has permission.
I actually called Progressive and they said they allow something called 'permissive use' which means only driving it like once a month or something. I obviously have no way to know how often she drives it though.
As for title I'm the only one on the title. So are you saying that even though our contract via email when we initially agreed to this doesn't explicitly ban her from driving the car I'm still able to tell her she can't drive it as the title holder?
Also if I can tell her not to drive it and she keeps driving it can I pay her back what she's already paid for the car and tell her our deal for me to buy it after the lease is off?
Actually my full plan was to only let my daughter drive it while at my house. I'd then have to drive my daughter back to her mom's when we have a switch in our parenting time. I've already thought about telling my ex she can't drive it and letting my daughter use it at both houses but as you said the only way I'd know is if I asked my daughter about it and I don't want to put her in that position.
