Do you have health insurance through your employer? If so, you should explore whether you will owe them for premiums if you don’t return to work. The FMLA does allow the employer to charge the employee for insurance premiums under certain circumstances.
I do have health insurance with them. For this last post period they used my earned time off to pay me and take out my health insurance. Should I be okay then?
That’s true. At this hospital if you don’t give two weeks you are ineligible for rehire and I just don’t want to burn any bridges since this is the only job I’ve ever had.
You have to pay your portion of the premium no matter what so that’s good that they were able to take it from your check. If you were taking unpaid time, you’d owe your portion for sure.
The concerning part would be whether you have to pay the employers portion as well if you do not return. When i worked in HR, my company would not pursue this, but other companies might.
Only you with the help of your doctors can evaluate if you can afford to make that choice (or afford not to).
Quitting for another job is certainly a reason under your control for which they’d be entitled to collect their premiums. You’ll have to balance how much you’d owe against your ability to pay and the likelihood of them pursuing it.
