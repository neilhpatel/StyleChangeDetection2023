It's all branding and strategy for that particular region. No need to drag the whole Country. I'm not sure this has to be reminded, but it's a very big Country. Now Trump, that's a different story. Reality TV star turned President. Very on brand for America, gotta admit. But again, that's a national election, so it also makes sense.
If this were a decade ago, Warnock would have been blown out, so it's still progress. It's still very concerning how 70% of white voters in Georgia voted for Walker the first time around though.
Kemp had to have gotten some kickbacks in order to put her in that position. She is an absolute idiot with no qualifications other than seducing her rich boss.
Walker would get absolutely crushed in most States. In most conservative States, he wouldn't make it past the Primary. Liberal States would destroy him in the General. The South knows football and religion. So it's between a football star and a minister. This is uniquely Southern. Which makes sense, because it's a State election.
The younger generation looks at the states around Georgia and doesn't want to go down that path anymore. The fact Georgia has a Senator that is younger than me blows my mind.
Warnock also represents a link to our past. A lot of people want to think MLK only cared about racism and that those issues are solved now because we had a black President. Warnock is carrying on his legacy and being a proper Christian who follows the teachings of Jesus and not just someone who expects forgiveness without suffering and uses the church for more than gossip and tax breaks.
