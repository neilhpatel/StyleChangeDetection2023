Indeed the Medici bank, actually all banks of that time, had a physical location. The Medici's location was located near what was then the Cavalcanti palace, near the wool markets. The word "bank" actually comes from the old Italian word "Banca" which means bench or table, in reference to where the bankers would count out their coin.
The interesting thing about the early banks is that they did not charge interest in the traditional sense, but they would charge what we would understand as service fees for services such as cashing out debts or money changing.
Fundamental to the rise of capitalism was the rise of the negotiable instrument. A promissory note or bill of exchange that stated a party would pay a stated amount to the Holder, either on a given day or on demand. The reason they are referred to as "negotiable" is because the Payee, the person receiving the money, can be transferred to another. The modern terms are Endorser and Endorsee.
One of the ideas that would lead to the rise of capitalism is the realization that a good debt has value in and of itself. The service the banks of that era provided was providing liquidity, the ability to turn an asset into cash. If a merchant needed cash immediately, but all of their available assets were in the form of debts, the banks of this era would accept the negotiable instrument as the Endorsee, and pay cash to the merchant at a reduced amount as a service and risk fee, and then pocket the difference.
This allowed them to avoid usury laws, because technically they were not adding a percentage onto the repayment of a debt, they were simply receiving compensation for a financial service proportionate to the amount that was being cashed out.
More particualr to the Medici themselves, and one of the factors that allowed their rise was the fact that they had standard paperwork. While the Medici did not invent the concept, they popularized a concept known as Double-Entry Bookkeeping, for every transaction usually two or more actions occur. If I lend you money, it needs to come out of my account. Therefore, the lending of the money to you, credit, and the withdraw of said money from my account, debit, is both recorded. Simple concept, but if you've ever looked at an accounts spreadsheet, you'll know how fast numbers rack up, and having numbers corroborate each other is key to keeping your accounts in order.
If you want to read more about the history of banking or finance in general, The Ascent of Money from Niall Ferguson provides a fantastic introduction.
Finally, the rise of the Medici was not particular to anything to do with Florentine law, or to be entirely honest anything to do with Florence in general. That being said, Florence was indeed booming and was a good place to do business. The Medici understood the importance of independent branches. Similar to how corporate umbrella companies or conglomerates work today, each branch of the bank was its own entity, and while they would shift funds to each other as needed, their accounts remained separate. Therefore, if one branch were to collapse, the rest would survive and not have their accounts severely harmed. Or, even the nature of Italian politics, if one branch were to be banished from a city-state, they rest would continue on as normal.
So, the thing to remember about the great "banking" houses of Florence (and elsewhere in Italy) is that they were not banks as we would understand them today.
Pulling from Raymond de Roover's old (but still useful) The Medici Bank: Its Organization, Management, Operations, and Decline, there are several different institutions that were called banchi, and they collectively filled not only the social functions of a modern bank, but others as well.
So, in the fifteenth century, you have several different credit institutions. The banchi di pegno, banchi minuto, banchi in mercato, and banchi grossi. The first were pawnshops. They gave small scale loans based on predges of personal property at about 20 percent per year. I have seen lots of questions about banks and the way the Medici and other related institutions operated in terms of modern banking, and I think pawnshops played a crucial role that modern people interested in history tend to forget.
Then there is the banco a minuto, about which de Roover questions whether or not we could even consider them as a bank. They essentially sold jewelry on an installment plan. Now, I want to set De Roover a side for a moment to dwell on this point and the idea of medieval wealth. In the modern age, we are perfectly comfortable with wealth being stored in bank accounts and what is essentially imaginary money. In reality, a variety of different objects were not only functional, but served as objects that served value. You see this in wills and records of inheritance. Beds and bedframes, clothes especially, and, of course, jewelry. These purchases were legitimate investments for individuals.
ONly partially. They also had "factories" that produced finished goods within Florence and made a great deal from textiles and the sale of bulk goods.
Next you have the banchi in mercato. This is what u/SweatCleansTheSuit is essentially talking about. INstitutionally they have their origins at the semi-regular "fairs" of Europe. They did not get profits from "convenience fees" per se, but by concealing profits in exchange rates. This is the institution where one could get a promissory note, but that didn't come until later in the Middle Ages. In the 11th century checks were unknown and transfer orders were given by word of mouth. These are transfer and deposit banks. These eventually became larger institution and more "official", but these ARE NOT the Medici bank.
Now, it is important to realize that the Medici WERE NOT moneychangers. I restate this, because people see things like "Medici Bank" and they assume that this is what they did. Now, they maybe played around with aspects of this business, but their main role was something different. The Medici, and their antecedents—Bardi, Peruzzi, etc—were members of the group banchi grossi, the great banks.
The Grossi were traders as much as bankers, and they "combined foreign trade and dealings in exchange—not petty exchange of foreign for domestic coins, but trade in bills of exchange (cambium per litteras). To most bankers IT WAS LESS IMPORTANT [emphasis mine] than the trade in commodities. Even the Medici, the most prominent firm of the merchant bankers in Florence, emphasized trade rather than banking (de Roover).
There is also a misconception about the importance of spices and luxury goods. These objects undoubtedly were valuable, and lots of money were made from their sale, but these banking houses made the bulk of their money from wholesale goods—grain, lumber, etc. Edwin Hunt's Medieval Super-Companies is an excellent explanation of these institutions. This book in particular examines the Bardi, Peruzzi, and Acciaiuoli, who all collapsed with the collapse of the bulk goods market in the mid 14th century (bad harvest regionally in Europe and the Mediterranean, along with the demographic collapse ot the plague). Each of these banks dealt in bulk goods, luxury goods, and lent sums of money to European monarchs. These people would not take Joe Merchant on as a client.
Likewise, it was never interpreted to be a ban on investment. There were thirteen safe harbors (to use a modern term) against usury under ecclesiastical rules. One of them was any investment where the creditor and debtor shared risk, explicitly facilitating investment. And all this meant that ecclesiastical usury laws represented regulation on markets that continued to operate. Even where there were explicit bans, such as the Florentine ban on certain kinds of predatory lending, the actual operation appears to have been closer to a licensing and regulation scheme than an actual ban.
The argument fundamentally ran that usury was double charging someone, that you could charge someone for the use of something (a loan) or to receive something (a sale) but not both. In other words, you could not sell someone a loaf of bread and then charge them for the privilege of eating it. Likewise, you could not charge someone for a loan and for using the loan. Note this means that you can charge them for taking a loan. But you can't charge them for the use of the loan. Thus the term 'usury'. This was thus more similar to the modern Islamic concept of usury than its popularly imagined version.
First, let's address exactly what usury was and how it was "banned". Ecclesiastical bans on usury began with theological interpretations that charging usury was equivalent to theft in the 11th century. The actual laws were mostly in place by the 13th century.
The banks did have physical locations. These varied but very often being one of the ten or so employees was a cushy gig, with high pay, relatively luxurious corporate housing, and proximity to the great and powerful. They did not have any equity stake in the bank, though they were often given bonuses for good years. Likewise, it was a good way to get established in banking and eventually strike out on their own.
There was a central nerve center of the bank, that was the public/private space of the Medici palace, which ran this entire operation. The best way to understand how this stuff worked without getting bogged down in technicalities would honestly be Iris Origo's The Merchant of Prato, which is a fun biography of Francesco di Marco Datini, the founder of one of these family firms that dealt in bulk goods.
This money was then invested in various operations, most famously the wool manufactories in Florence. They also commonly invested in commodities. And there were a few other activities, like money speculation. In general, the Medici Bank looked to make a profit however it could through financial means. And this business, of basically private equity, grew to dwarf all the others during the height of the bank.
