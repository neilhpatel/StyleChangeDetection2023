If he moves in with permission from your sister, you would have to terminate his tenancy and go to court to evict him. Neither of those things are allowed right now in Washinon until at least the end of July.
In general, the landlord has discretion over the tenants they rent to. You could decline to rent to any adult, including your brother-in-law, as long as it wasn't for a protected legal reason (race, religion, national origin, sex, etc).
If he moved in without your consent, you would have to give them both a written notice to terminate their tenancy (20 days before the next rental period, in WA). If they didn't move, you would go to court to evict them. Police will not consider your tenant's spouse to be a trespasser.
That shouldn't be an issue except as a practical matter that you don't know when your brother-in-law will be there. Some small landlords, or those who share the home with their tenants, are exempt from some antidiscrimination laws. But this is not a discrimination dispute.
Point well taken. Not only are evictions not being accepted for filing, but a landlord may not even send a notice of termination of tenancy, according to Proclamation 20-19.5.
My tenant hasn't paid since her employers died of COVID last February so I don't even look at the details anymore. Inslee's one great talent is demanding that other people hold their breath.
