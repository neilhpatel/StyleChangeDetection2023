If they have a lease, they can tell you "no." You have no recourse to force them to terminate that lease early.
If they would be open to it, offering to buy out the remainder of the lease might help you reach a compromise, where you get possession within 60 days and they get something for their trouble. Offering to cover their moving expenses is a starting point, but expect to pay more than that in the end, so put some thought into how much vacant possession is actually worth to you.
Failing that, you might be able to find another loan product that's more appropriate for a tenanted property. There's no legal requirement for your lender to _only_ offer loans for owner occupied properties, and even if this lender only does owner-occupied ones, another lender might not. However, loans for non-owner-occupied properties are usually harder to insure and noticeably more expensive - so factor that into your negotiation with the tenant.
Are you lying or withholding information related to your mortgage? Then yes, you're committing mortgage fraud. FNMA(Fannie mae) has regulations who occupancy on properties that they will purchase from the lender. Lenders often have different departments that would handle the loan depending on occupancy.
If you do not intend to move in within 60 days, and you sign the mortgage closing docs that say you will move in within 60 days that is mortgage occupancy fraud.
Failing all of that, you might want to back out of the sale. If you have a financing contingency and have made a good faith effort to find financing suitable to you, then you're usually in good shape to tell the seller that you are exercising that contingency. If the sale contract promises vacant possession and the tenants have a term lease, then this is the seller's problem to clean up - they can't deliver vacant possession with term tenants in place, so it should be them taking on the work to negotiate with the tenants. Otherwise, if there's no contingency and no vacant possession commitment, you may need to negotiate with the seller to void the sale or to renegotiate the price to accommodate the presence of tenants.
