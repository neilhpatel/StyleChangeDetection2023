Well could her brother potentially be trying to blackmail you because he is salty that you're trying to date his sister? In that case yes, I would say it matters.
I don’t know anything they didn’t even say who it was. All I know is she was working and she was coming inside and the my pushed me away so she wouldn’t see me.
What actions have you done towards anyone in any manner that could be taken as inappropriate? Often actions can be perceived different as we intend, and you may have done something to someone that made them feel unsafe, but you thought it was normal.
I'm assuming that if you work for the clown, you are a non-union employee. If so, your employer can let you go over alleged sexual harassment. There's no due process, and no recourse for that decision. However, unless you have a well-documented track record of sexual discrimination, or some other clear and indisputable cause, you would be owed notice or pay in lieu as normal, would be eligible for EI, and would be eligible for any applicable statutory or common-law severance as normal: it's hard to fire someone _for cause_, especially over an unsubstantiated allegation.
