I think you should ask in /r/mechanicadvice but based on the way I understand things, if you had stripped threads before the most recent oil change you would have had an oil leak prior to bringing it in for your most recent oil change. I also think you could possibly repair the threads using a tap and larger drain plug without removing the pan though I am not sure this might not create metal shavings that could damage an engine. That's something to ask there too.
Seems highly suspect. Did they communicate all this to you before they performed the work? sounds like them trying to cover their ass for a fuck up. If it was stripped how was it holding oil in the first place?
You can still take the first shop to small claims for what you paid to have VW fix the issue. Bring the evidence that this shop discovered the stripped threads and any other evidence you have.
The first shop could have made the plug too tight causing threads to strip at removal but I think that isn't typical.
I think it's most likely the most recent shop messed it up maybe by cross-threading the plug but doesn't want to take the blame.
