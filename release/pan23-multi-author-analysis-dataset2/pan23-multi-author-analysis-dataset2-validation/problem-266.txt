We're very concerned about you, but the moderators and contributors at r/legaladvice are not the best source of support when dealing with thoughts of suicide. We hope that you'll reach out to others who can help you better than we can, such as the community at /r/SuicideWatch or a crisis service. There are always kind people available who want to help you feel better and connect you with resources to help deal with your situation.
