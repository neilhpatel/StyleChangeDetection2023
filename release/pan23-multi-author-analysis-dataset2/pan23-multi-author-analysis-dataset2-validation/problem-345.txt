Your insurance may be willing to give you a mail order override so you can go pick it up at a pharmacy near you. Id call and ask for one of these first.
I mean, that's not going to cut it. You need to be escalating with the insurance company. No waiting for people to call you back, you need to be talking to people up the food chain at the insurance company, NOW. And if you need to take her to urgent care or the ER, do that.
If they dont have it, then id recommend getting another prescription written, taking it to the pharmacy near you and pay out of pocket without insurance. Do not even mention you have insurance. You'll have to submit a claim form, or even a request for reimbursement, to get it paid by the insurance afterwards but i think its worth the hassle so you can get your important prescription.
u/kaitmill1 Please ask her doctor for a fresh prescription to be sent to a new local pharmacy and pay out of pocket for now. Check GoodRX for coupons and which pharmacy closest to you has the lowest out of pocket cost. Fill it without insurance and get her numbers down NOW. If you cannot get this done today, please go to the ER. The will administer insulin quickly.
