They’re not even good at being thugs. Seriously though, what can they do when Zelenskyy is backed by, not just NATO, but a country that spends more on their defense budget than all other formidable countries combined..
The worst part is that the US could probably have both if they regulated the finance industry slightly more lmao, as generally its far from economic suicide to implement nationalized healthcare. The societal benifits are large enough to virtually even out the costs, especially in a place like America where everyone has certain conditions prevelant to the nation at this point.
In fact, last time I checked, it is cheaper to nationalize healthcare across the country and provide a great level of care to all equally than to deal with the current situation. We would save money.
Edit: just so we're clear, this was a joke. Healthcare in the US is expensive for a multitude of reason.
It’s almost indescribable how much hate I have for Trump. It’s palpable. If I had a choice between destroying every present and future mosquito, or ridding the world of the trump family, I would pick the latter without a moments hesitation.
I mean, Obama attempted to take a step in the right direction but Trump, being the useless dumb fuck that he is, gutted the system.
