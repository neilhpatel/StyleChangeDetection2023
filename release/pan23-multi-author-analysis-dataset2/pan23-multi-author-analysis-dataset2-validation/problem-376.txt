The Soviets did thermonuclear research alongside their fission research, and assumed the Americans were as well (and they were right about that; the Truman "crash order" added a little urgency and priority, but the US was already working on H-bomb stuff since World War II). They benefitted from accurate espionage-derived intelligence on the state of US thermonuclear intelligence through around 1947, and were pursuing the same things, more or less, as a result. It was not a "crash" program, per se — it was just part of their normal research activities. They did not figure out how to make multi-megaton thermonuclear weapons until after the US had detonated one of their own, however.
So one could make the argument that if the US had held off, and made it somehow clear that it was going to hold off, that the Soviets might not have been as rapid in their development. However given the lack of any way to verify if someone was researching thermonuclear weapons (other than a full-scale test) it seems unlikely that the Soviets would have taken any agreement very seriously (whether the US would have would have depended on how it was passed down). The Soviets, at least in their later years, generally regarded any verification-less treaties to be by their very nature likely to be violated on the US side, and so felt free violating them themselves. They regarded unilateral moratoriums (like the Test Ban Moratorium from 1958–1961) as being worth following only as long as it fit their interests (the US has held similar attitudes over the years).
Is it possible that if the US had not raced into detonating a full-scale thermonuclear weapon that the Soviets would not have hit upon the way to do it? Often seeing that something is achievable is very stimulating to the imagination, and there are some allegations (denied by the Soviet scientists) that they were able to analyze the fallout from the US test to derive information about its design. So I guess you could imagine the whole thing being dragged out a bit longer if the US had pushed for such a thing.
But I think it is very unlikely that the Soviets would have agreed to a "true" moratorium on the research. They would have needed to know if it was possible. Them being without thermonuclear weapons would be a significant disadvantage — more so than the US being without them. Why? Because the US had access to many forward bases and allies next to the Soviet Union. That meant that they could effectively attack the Soviets even without intercontinental ballistic missiles, with huge waves of bombers. The Soviets could not effectively do the same thing to the United States; it is too far away, and bombers are too vulnerable. This is why the Soviets invested, from quite early on, in ICBMs. And early ICBM accuracy is low-enough that anything less than a thermonuclear warhead is not an effective deterrent. (The US did not really begin investing in ICBMs until after it had thermonuclear weapons, for this very reason.).
All of this is speculative, of course. I respect Priscilla quite a lot as a scholar and a person (she has had an amazing life — look her up!). There was an interesting article written by weapons designer Herbert York in the 1970s that essentially argued that _even if_ the US had not developed the H-bomb and the Soviets had not changed their history at all, that the US would not actually have been at any significant disadvantage and would have likely been able to "catch up" almost immediately. Which is to say, that the US had very little to lose from a moratorium attempt. So that is another position. (For this, see .).
Thanks too for linking your blog post! The timelines you drew really helped illustrate the different scenarios.
Did Truman's 'crash' program direct much financial, manpower or other resources to Los Alamos from 1950-52? Or was it more a declaration of research priorities? Might we speculate that absent a presidential directive, Stanislaw Ulam might have been tasked with thinking about miniaturization or fission efficiency or other technical problems?
But I think the view that the Soviets would have held off on H-bomb work both underestimates the Soviet view of things, and also underestimates how attractive the H-bomb would be for Soviet deterrence purposes. The US could effectively deter without the H-bomb; it is not clear the Soviets could.
On an entirely different track: How much of Soviet nuclear program records have been declassified? Do nuclear researchers have a clear idea of the policy decisions made by Stalin, Malenkov, Khrushchev from 1945-60?
This gets into rather thorny ground, which has been debated for a very long time since the 1950s. You are basically asking, "what, exactly, was the genesis of the Teller-Ulam idea?" Teller argued that it was directly a result of the increased priority, etc., given to the work, and thus in his mind the H-bomb "crash program" saw real results. But Bethe and others (including Oppenheimer) argued that it was not the result of any new attention, but rather a result of some new calculational tools (which would have been available anyway) that finally saw the Classical Super put into the dustbin by the spring of 1950, and ideas from Teller and Ulam that were essentially "out of context," in that they were not affected by the priority shift. This lead to the rather strange situation in which Teller was arguing that the Teller-Ulam idea was nothing special, just what happens when you apply more time and urgency to old questions they already had, and where Teller's opponents were instead arguing that Teller had been a genius, and thus it had nothing to do with funding, etc.
If one of the arguments about the history of the idea is true, then the "crash order" made no difference, and the opposite is the case if the other is true. Both sides leveraged various technical arguments but you can see that at some level it is a political argument as well. (I have written a paper on this but never found the time/will to do anything with it. .).
Can you expand on that a little bit? In the book Priscilla McMillan depicts Edward Teller as energetically championing a "Super bomb" and actively lobbying the Truman administration in the late 1940s. In the comments of your blog post, Cheryl Rofer mentions Teller pushing for work on the Super concept during the Manhattan project.
My sense is that, in retrospect, the strongest thing you can argue in terms of the "crash program" having any impact is about urgency and focus. Not spending or manpower — those were pretty similar to what they were before, and it's not clear they had anything to do with the theoretical insights. And it is possible to make a strong argument that what really delayed the discovery of the Teller-Ulam concept was primarily Teller's own stubborn clinging to a wrong idea, coupled with various "unknowns" that existed prior to the more careful nuclear testing of the late 1940s (you need to know a lot of very detailed information about the physical processes going on inside the first microseconds of detonation, and until the late 1940s they just didn't know certain things).
Once the US and USSR had conducted successful H bomb tests, do you see any potential "off ramp" that the countries could have pursued to avoid the massive weapons build up that actually happened?
On the other question — quite a lot is declassified through about 1955. After that, there is a lot less. Not nothing, but a lot less. But the Stalin period is very well documented at this point. David Holloway's _Stalin and the Bomb_ covers much of this very well, though there has been a lot released since he wrote that book as well. If you are curious about how the Soviets came up with their equivalent of the Teller-Ulam idea, you might find .pdf).
In your first answer you laid out deterrence reasons why Soviets would not have agreed to halt research on thermonuclear weapons.
Or, were problems of inspection/verification and public panic over bomber gaps and missile gaps things that made an arms race inescapable in the 1950s?
I think the only plausible "off-ramps" were in the 1940s, when the US did not have thousands of bombs staring down the Soviet Union and there was still some possibility of negotiating some kind of way out of a build-up. But once the US went "all in" on making nukes, and ringed the Soviet Union with bases and missiles, there's no way the Soviets could have ever contemplated _not_ building as many as they did. I think one has to keep in mind that until the 1970s the USA had around 10X as many nukes as the Soviets did, and by its own calculations could kill hundreds of millions of Soviet and Chinese civilians in a matter of hours. I know how Americans frame this, but from the Soviet and Chinese perspective this doesn't look like some agent of peace and reliability, it looks like genocidal madness.
I do think that the appeal of whipping of fear of the enemy — even patently absurd ones — has an inevitable political appeal, especially in a democracy. So if you're asking, could the domestic politics have ever led the United States to really pursue anything other than an arms build-up? — probably not.
