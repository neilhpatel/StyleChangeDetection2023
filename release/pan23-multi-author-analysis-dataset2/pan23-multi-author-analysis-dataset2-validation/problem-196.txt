Also the vice article gets it wrong: the legislature “theory” of ultimate decision making of elections is built RIGHT INTO THE CONSTITUTION.
Democrats lost their majorities in North Carolina and Ohio Supreme Courts after striking down partisan gerrymandered maps. I... can't believe people are this dumb and didn't try to protect their damn judges.
similar to the way there is no reversal of a rigged presidential election where big tech the fbi and the democrat party have colluded and interfered. Treason be damned.
Coming and voting with an ID is not facism. It’s literally what every other country on the planet does.
“2) If yes, does this photo ID have both your current address AND your current name (as opposed to a maiden name) on it?”.
Which counts “lack of ID” as actually having an ID but not your current address, or if women are using their maiden name instead of their married name.
So the entire study is rigged to inflate false positives, and then the ACLU just passes off this rigged study as if it means 11% of the people lack any ID at all.
All you have to do is fact check these orgs from primary sources to see they are using deception for their political agenda. It’s not hard. It took me 60 seconds.
