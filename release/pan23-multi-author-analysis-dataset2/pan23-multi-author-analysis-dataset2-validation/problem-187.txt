Hi there - we're happy to approve your question related to your novel, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists, based on past experience: some aspiring novelists have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what's needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it's not always what you want to hear.
Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you're asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don't know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.
If our traveller does make it out, however, the geography is more favourable. For a brief period in the former half of the 10th century, there was a significant amount of Viking raiding and trading in the Caspian Sea via the Volga river. Ibn Faḍlān in 921 encountered Viking traders of Slavic slaves (mostly sex slaves) on the Volga, while the Arabic historian Mas'ūdi, writing in the early 940s, records a Viking raid in the Caspian in 913. Just as Mas'ūdi was writing, another Viking raid happened in the Caspian, this time capturing the city of Bardha'a (now Barda in Azerbaijan) according to the late 10th/early 11th century historian Miskawayh. Rabban Bar Ṣauma's route took him to Marāgheh, which is quite a ways inland, but according to Mas'ūdi the Vikings got as far as Ardabil, which according to him was three days from the coast, so with any luck our hypothetical private/fugitive traveller could find himself caught in a freak Viking raid on the Caspian coast. The physician Marwazī, writing in modern-day Turkmenistan in the 1130s, alleges that Viking piracy in the Caspian was still ongoing then, but as the one example he lists is the 943 Bardha'a attack take it at your own peril. The last major specific attack in the Caspian region recorded in Arabic sources seems to be the 965 sack of the Khazar capital of Itil, as recorded by Ibn Hawqal.
My limited understanding of Viking slavery is further constrained to a geopolitical context, so I'm afraid I cannot help – /u/textandtrowel specialises in this area, though. From their older answers my understanding is that we really don't know that much about slavery in Scandinavia itself. EDIT: by /u/Aerandir gets across in more detail why this is.
If our traveller does gat raided, how likely would they be enslaved in such a raid? The answer is... not hugely, but plausible in certain conditions. Neither Mas'ūdi nor Ibn Hawqal specifically mention enslavement as part of the 913 or 965 attacks, but we could chalk this down to simple brevity. Miskawayh, whose account of the Bardha'a attack is much more detailed, does say that the Viking raiders kept 10,000 captives, robbing and then releasing the men while enslaving.
But let's assume that our traveller is enslaved irrespective of gender. How likely is it that they'd end up sold to a Danish jarl? Again, unlikely, but nonetheless possible. Firstly, slaves were sold internationally, with a major slave market at Hedeby in Jutland and a substantial quantity of slaves being sold to the Islamic world – as we have mentioned there was Ibn Faḍlān's encounter with Viking slavers on the Volga, while Ibn Hawqal's universal history in 988 notes that the majority of slaves captured from the Franks and of Slavic eunuchs were sold in markets in al-Andalus. In all likelihood an enslaved traveller, particularly one captured on the Caspian rather than in Ruthenia, could find themselves sold off at a different point than Denmark, especially as it was primarily the Swedes who plied the Eastern European rivers. Moreover, as slavery was quite widespread, the likelihood that a jarl rather than an ordinary freeman purchased our traveller would be similarly limited. Perhaps our traveller's exotic origin would attract attention – especially given that they'd likely be a sex slave – but once again it must be stressed that slaveowning was not just a luxury afforded to high-ranking nobles.
Firstly, the situation in China is a bit of an issue, as the probability of a westward traveller in the period described is somewhat slim. The 'Viking Age' (if defined as beginning with the Lindisfarne raid in 793) would have encompassed three periods in Chinese dynastic history: the final century of the Tang Dynasty, which collapsed in 907, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, and the early years of the Song Dynasty, which began in 960. During these periods, imperial control was constrained to China proper, and so the oasis cities of the Tarim Basin lay outside Chinese dominion, with the Tang having retreated from Tarim in the 750s-60s thanks to An Lushan's rebellion. This meant that the most viable direct land route west, on which one might be intercepted by the Vikings, was comparatively inaccessible. Gan Ying's ability to travel westward into the Arsacid dominions in search of Rome in the late 1st century was facilitated by Han control of Tarim (he was in fact sent there by the commander of the Tarim garrison), while the Nestorian Christian priest Rabban Bar Ṣauma was able to set out from Beijing and travel across Europe in the late 13th century by virtue of travelling through regions of Mongol dominion, which at that time extended from China to the Black Sea. That is not to say an intrepid traveller might not be able to pass through, and that some may have done without leaving a trace, but given that other westward travels from China were official dispatches from dynasties holding Central Asian dominions, it is somewhat less probable.
So to conclude, I'll grant you your 1% believability, but you'd firstly need to explain why the hell someone who had the resources to make such a journey out of China would do so at a time of political fragmentation within China and powerful nomadic empires in the way, and there's a lot of aspects to do with Viking slavery that you're going to have to grapple with – particularly the sex slavery.
A free farmer might house his wife and children, his parents, a cousin or sibling, maybe some nieces and nephews, the young children of someone he owed a favor to (or who now owed a favor to him), a few free people who didn't have family farms but who helped out and were adopted into the household, and maybe a handful of slaves. Slave status didn't necessarily mean these people were considered scum. They might dwell with the family, on dependent farmsteads of their own, or perhaps among the animals in one end of a longhouse. Some free farmers probably had small households with no slaves. Others probably maintained a longhouse with slaves doing daily chores plus dependent farms worked by both free and unfree laborers.
But can our enslaved traveller end up 'embracing Norse culture and becoming a Viking'? Well, kind of? But not really. A male thrall could be manumitted by various means, but would hold 'freedman' status, marking them below normal freemen, along with two generations of their descendants. In all likelihood one was not going to be armed to go on the very raids that one had been captured in. However, slaves captured from Western Europe and the British Isles do seem to have formed a part of Viking colonisation of Iceland based on genetic studies. Sex slaves, that is, because I should stress again that most Viking slaves captured abroad were female sex slaves.
It depends on the size of the household. If I recall correctly (and I don't have access to my library at present), Viking-Age dwellings are generally assumed to have accommodated perhaps 10-30 people, or an extended family plus free and unfree dependents. The percentage of slaves in the Early Middle Ages is generally estimated at between 10 and 30 percent. You could imagine this playing out in several ways.
Slave labor was used for all sorts of things. Men were vital to all kinds of subsistence work—tending crops and livestock, fishing, hunting, and foraging—and women were vital in other ways. Their most important work likely included raising (and sometimes mothering or nursing) children, serving as sex objects that gained their master's prestige, and doing all the daily work of textile production and food preparation (including making ). Slaves of either sex might have accompanied free members of the household whenever they traveled, providing a bit of security and serving as a personal servant.
This was, by all indications, a form of slavery very different from the more modern forms of Atlantic or US slavery that most of us are probably familiar with. That said, our texts are mostly later, and archaeology is often seen as a poor tool for investigating slavery. We can figure out a lot, but things like statistical averages are necessarily going to be guesswork.
