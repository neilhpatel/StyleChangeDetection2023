Your lease transfers to the new owner. If you are a month to month tenant, then the new owner must give you proper notice.
How much time you get (30 days, 60 days, etc.) and whether a phone call is proper notice or if you must be given written notice depends on your location.
If they really want you out, they can offer you "cash for keys" and you can negotiate an amount that will allow you to relocate sooner than your lease is up.
Thanks for your response I appreciate it,I know about the time limit you get and all of that but what I'm wondering is if I'm not able to be out be the first of next month what are my next options? I have 2 kids one who is 11 and the other who turns one on the 3rd of December,can I appeal this or get more time to find another place to live?
If you’re given proper notice to vacate and your landlord is within their rights to terminate your tenancy, and you refuse to leave, your landlord’s next step would be an eviction lawsuit against you, and, if they win (which they likely would), that’s going to make future landlords incredibly hesitant to rent to you.
If you want more time, you can negotiate with the landlord. You’re not necessarily entitled to more time beyond the end of the notice period that your tenancy is being ended.
Thank you I understand exactly what you're saying,I know they are within there legal rights to terminate tenancy but would they have to send a notarized letter or just the one they sent me stating there terminating tenancy. Does it matter? And on another note there is a huge hole in my kitchen ceiling that my old landlord has never fixed although she was notified about it years ago,it literally spews water everytime it rains or snows. I can literally see into the crawl space seeing as how I live on the third floor of a 3 family building. There is so many problems with my apartment that we're discussed with the previous landlord that we're never fixed. Is there any way I can use that as leverage?
Writing the notice down and ensuring that you received it satisfies the law. There's no requirement that it be sent certified mail, or be notarized, or anything like that -- just written notice that your tenancy is coming to an end, delivered to you.
A hole in the ceiling or other problems are a mutually exclusive issues that are unlikely to buy you more time there.
"You need to give me more time to live here because there's a bunch of problems with the unit," I would think to be a somewhat unsuccessful negotiation tactic.
A tenant winning an eviction case would mean that the landlord does not have legal standing to evict them, or did not follow proper procedure leading up to that eviction.
It appears that, if you refuse to leave at the end of the notice period and your landlord evicts, that your landlord would have legal standing to evict you.
In other words, I'm not seeing a slam-dunk, winnable case for you here. Your landlord wants you out, and ending your tenancy with proper advance notice and seeing that you leave is within their rights.
Yes, if you lose an eviction case, it will be on your record, visible to future landlords. The fact that you were involved in an eviction case, regardless of whether you win or lose, is also public information.
"I need more time and/or I don't want to leave just yet," are usually not winning eviction arguments. That's what the notice period is for before you're evicted -- to give you time to find a new place, sometimes in a hurry.
I understand,thank you for your response. Is there anyway to win an eviction case if that makes sense? Like if I get sent to court and lay out my case and the judge agrees with me or w.e will the eviction still be on my record? I'm sorry if it's a stupid question,I've only been evicted once before and that was like 6 years ago,I didn't even bother fighting it then. I have no problem leaving I just need to find another place before the first and its right around the corner.
