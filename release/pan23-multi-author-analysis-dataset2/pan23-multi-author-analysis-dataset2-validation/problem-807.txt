Fascinating to read the slow evolution of the salute from that initial painting to adoption by the nazis. I really didn’t open this thread to read such a long, complicated answer but it was so compelling (and the visuals were great) that I couldn’t help myself. Thanks.
But this still leaves us with another question to follow. Was the "Roman Salute" actually Roman? To which the answer is a fairly certain no! In no extant Roman sources or surviving Roman works of art is there representation of the salute that bears the name of Rome. We have evidence of salutes that involved raised hand but not in that manner - the closest examples, seen on Trajan's Column, have the fingers splayed out - and salutes not dissimilar to the modern military one as well. The famous statue , although assumed by some to possibly be a Roman salute, almost certainly isn't. Aside from finger position, the simple fact is that the arm is a later restoration not original to the torso, and once upon a time the raised arm held a spear. Likewise, the on the Campidoglio can be erroneously identified as a Roman Salute, and was so even by the Fascists themselves, but it only works from very specific angles - close in, staring up - and is generally agreed by art historians to be a gesture of "benediction", one which is is much more easily identified as from many angles.
We'll return to the Nazis later, but now the first question to tackle is why did the Italians decide on the gesture? Mussolini was obsessed with creating a new Roman empire, and he adopted the trappings of 'Rome' as symbols for the party in furtherance of that obsession. The name itself, "Fascist", comes from the fasces which had once been a symbol of power and authority in Ancient Rome. The salute that they made use of, with the arm extended outwards, fingers together, palm down, was known as the "Roman Salute", so of course it was only appropriate that it would be the salute of the 'New Rome'. The association of the salute and a revitalized Roma-Italian Nationalist ideology predated Mussolini, who was likely influenced in picking it by the proto-Fascist thinker Gabriele D'Annunzio, who had implemented the salute during his short-lived control of the city of Fiume, and is the one who introduced it into the Italian nationalist lexicon.
But its influence is beyond simple art, and for our purposes, it is the influence of the straight armed, fingers together, palm down salute that they render to their father accompanying the oath, although this of course ties into its aesthetics.
Unlike the actual Roman works where any similarities to the "Roman Salute" fall apart on examination, this one is unmistakable. It still isn't perfect, as they are at differing angles, and a mix of right and left arms, but the parallels, and the context, are unmistakable. Of course, the scene itself is a creation, a fanciful representation of filial and civic devotion that is not present in Roman accounts of the (mostly mythical) story, but that is quite secondary. Just as the scene is a creation, along with anachronistic clothing and weapons, the salute represented in the painting was chosen because of how it would impress the scene into the mind of the viewer, something which it is inarguably effective at. The work was possibly influenced by Roman images that showed Roman oath scenes where, weapon in hand, the soldiers pointed their swords downward, and as such the Roman oath motif generally was hardly alien to European art of the period, such as the by Gavin Hamilton that predated David's work by 20 years. But as Rosenblum put it, the style and gesture, including this new, specific presentation that was David's conception of the salute, left earlier works of "classical virtue [...] flaccid in both style and moral conviction". Although the caveat must of course be that this is art, so it is necessarily subjective, while Carrier certainly would disagree with such strong words, in his direct comparison of the two works noting the comparative "greatness" is not easy to answer, even is he agrees "the claim that Hamilton made a greater painting than David is unconvincing".
The specific degrees of 'greatest' though are not really our concern, insofar as they are secondary to the general tenor of critical acclaim, and especially how it relates to the use of gestures in the work. Much of the power of the painting is tied up the 'language of gesture' present in the work. It was, in fact, specifically the fact that David had chosen an essentially new gesture that helped get that across, since as Johnson notes of the debut:
Later works would likely be influenced by David's powerful use of body language and gestures, such as Jean-Léon Gérôme's , where the arms of the tyrannicides, thrown upwards weapons clasped, possibly draws from The Oath, "express, a work depicting the titular event in the French Revolution, and almost certainly did so not only because of the power of the gesture itself, but to consciously connect his two works, and the connection between both the ancient and modern oath. By 1810, and his work , hopefully you're noticing the theme here, namely that he knew to milk this thing for all its worth, but more importantly it should be noted that the meaning is expanding, and the oath is more imperial, Napoleon's military commanders showing him their loyalty. And although obviously a French scene, the gesture, through its genesis, was now a Roman one - Napoleon too going back to that old Empire for symbolism - and it is impossible to not envision the composition of the work unchanged, and only the figures transposed, with Italian Black Shirts, or Nazi SS men taking the place of the French soldiery. For this scene, which shows an event three days after the Emperor's coronation when the regimental commanders came to swear their oath of loyalty to him, as Boime poignantly notes the shift:
But if it isn't authentically Roman, what is it? In this regard, if there is any one, single culprit, it is certainly , a late 18th-century neoclassical work showing a scene from Roman history of the Horatii, three brothers who triumphed in combat over the Curiatii, as they give their oath to their father prior to the combat. It is an evocative piece, considered a true masterpiece of the style, and greatly influential as a work of art:
The symbol hadn't entirely changed, and certainly however the meaning might have shifted through David's evolution of use, the most important theme, the evocation of Ancient Rome, is a very consistent thread, and entered into the popular imagination as such. Prior to its early 20th-century repurposing, it would go through other venues. Most famous perhaps was its use by Francis J. Bellamy, who wrote the 1892 Pledge of Allegiance, and published it with these instructions included by James Upham, the editor of The Youth's Companion in which it was published:
That gesture (called the Bellamy Salute, although Upham had chosen it) would remain until WWII, when it was done away with for possibly obvious reasons, but of course the close similarity to the Fascist salute was no coincidence, as both were drawing from the same source, and the invocation of civic loyalty that had been behind its creation a century prior. Early stage and film representation of Ancient Rome would use the gesture too, in this case either not caring, or simply unaware, that it was far from authentic. This too would fall from favor with the rise of Nazism, and many mid-century works would - as with American school children - replace the outstretched gesture with one that placed hand over heart.
The Nazis did not invent it themselves. The 'Nazi Salute' was chosen because it was the 'Fascist Salute' already popularized by the Italian Fascist Party under Mussolini. Other Fascist aligned movements, such as the Spanish Falangists also adopted the gesture in similar imitation of the 'Ur-Fascist' group.
In fact, Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Italian nationalist and literary giant of the turn of the century, possibly came to interact with the gesture through film, being involved in the absolutely massive - for the time - 1914 Italian epic Cabiria, set during the Second Punic War, and of course including the "Roman Salute". In 1919, unhappy with the gains Italy was set to be given in the post-WWI divisions, the glory seeking D'Annunzio led an expedition to the city of Fiume on the Yugoslavian coast in the fall of 1919 which was occupied for just over a year, in the name of Italy, but without their actual agreement, leading to its de facto status as a free city, with D'Annunzio setting himself up as leader, with grandiose titles such as "Savior". A close friend of Mussolini, and a proto-Fascist thinker himself, much of the symbols that would come to mark the Italian Fascist movement in fact debuted here, and this included the use of the "Roman Salute" by the occupying forces (Praetorians), part of D'Annunzio's obsession with a return to Roman glory - he had even written to Mussolini the day before leaving for Fiume a letter including the evocation of Caesar that "the die is cast". As one early historian of the movement wrote - although unaware of its fraud [emphasis mine]:
Hitler's genesis here of course is impossible. It is an attempt to claim that it was a long standing German tradition independent of the Italians, as he doesn't want to be seen as borrowing the gesture, but beyond there being no evidence in of itself for his history here, the examples long predate the literal invention of the gesture by David in the late 18th-century!
The city lasted little more than a year before they were kicked out, but the ideas remained with them, and the rising Fascist party in Italy embraced the symbols that the occupiers of Fiume had thought up, and beyond that, the Fascists were heavily influenced as well in their image of Roman greatness by the screen images from Cabiria. Drawing on its supposed 'Romanness', for the Fascists:
