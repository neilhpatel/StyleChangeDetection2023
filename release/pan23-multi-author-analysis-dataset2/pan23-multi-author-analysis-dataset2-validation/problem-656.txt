She can file suit. Whether or not it will be successful is indeterminable here. But remember: Lot's of people threaten to sue for lots of things and few actually do. If actually served respond. If not she is just blowing smoke.
I don’t know she was telling that it was worth a lot and other stuff I was to tired to remember. I just saw her with some handle bars with out the bottom part.
No, my back wheels felt like they ran over something but the lot has lots of pot holes and bumps I didn’t think it would be an unattended child’s toy that was worth at lot of money.
Some can be a couple hundred dollars, but I doubt they'd be leaving a nicer one lay out in the parking lot like that. Was most likely one of the $40 Target ones.
I never complained about the scooter. I was just annoyed it was right in the middle of the lot where cars drive. My dad voiced it and we went home. I didn’t leave with my truck till late at night and ran over a tar patch, not the scooter.
If she SAW you running over it in the afternoon, but you said you didn't move your truck and ran over something at night, then is it possible you ran over something else?
I don’t know, she said it cost her a lot more then that becuase I remember saying she should have paid her rent instead of giving her young kid something that expensive to play with and leave around out in the dark and rain.
I saw the kid with the scooter in the afternoon, but i wasn’t in my truck when I saw her that afternoon. I was with my dad in his car. She left the scooter in the middle of the parking lot and my dad stopped because he saw the scooter and her coming to get it as my dad complained about it being there.
It seemed unlikely anyone, or a young child would be out at 11 pm in the dark and rain on a scooter. The parking lot had bumps and pot holes and I did stop and try to see or hear anything. There seemed to be nothing and the back of my truck was close to several other parked cars.
