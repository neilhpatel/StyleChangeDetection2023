Used to work for a firm that did gym collections. They relied on members not noticing the monthly gym payments and it being difficult to get money back.
Can you dispute this with your bank? Show them the contract and charges and proof that you sent the letter and they should be able to refund everything without needing to pay for legal fees.
You can dispute with your bank but you still have to provide documentation if you have proof you canceled and you have the contract that shoes you canceled the way it says so in the contract then you can win and a charge back can be captured if not then you should go the small claims court but one thing that I can't tell ppl on a recorded line... Depending on how big the business is a negative review on say a FB page or yelp or Google might do alot of good in this situation... The smaller the better cause they need that to promote themselves as a good company and the best gym in the area... So possibly go that route as well and it might help but if you don't have documentation then small claims court might be your only option and I'm not sure how the review would be seen in small claims court.
California lawyer (not your lawyer) here. Assuming you cancelled your memberships and did not simply pause them, this is an open/shut case that has class action written all over it. You are likely just one of many that experienced the same set of facts.
