>the offer last week came after a deadline to disclose evidence and one day after the parties had filed a joint order making clear that they would not call any DNA experts as witnesses.
Trump has been accused of sexual assault (and admitted to it on tape, famously) numerous times over the years but few of his victims have ever gone on to have the resources to really go after him. So this is the case that gets this far. Its illustrative, I think, of the inherent inequity in the American justice system.
A writer and author claimed Trump sexually assaulted her in a dressing room 30 years ago in a 2019 memoir.
Trump called her a liar, publicly and frequently, so she sued for defamation 3 year's ago. Due to the nature of whether she was assaulted being core to that case, she was basically forced to file a civil suit regarding the rape since NY law allows for that after criminal statute of limitations has expired.
Cherry on top.. Trump's defense has largely been, "she's too ugly for me to sexually assault" yet he confused a photo of her with a photo of ex-wife Marla Maples.
It's a messy, complicated affair and she's not the strongest accuser. She was selling a book and it was a long time ago. On the other hand, she actually had the resources to not get buried and fight Trump in court for now going on three years.
