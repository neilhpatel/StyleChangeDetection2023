Quick Google search has lead me to these 3 links with similar info. If neighbours can’t agree / come to a resolution about the need for a new fence or who is paying for it, there is something called a Line Fence Act, that outlines how to deal with it through a 3rd party essentially.
NAL and not in Canada: Also double check with a new survey that this is true (if you haven't since the fence was built that is). Many fencing companies will still put a fence a few inches onto the land of whoever commissioned the fence to be built even if they tell the owner that they'll build it "right on the line" to avoid situations exactly like this.
The arbitration procedure only applies in two situations where the owners are unable to reach agreement:
- Where no fence currently exists at the boundary between the two properties, and one owner wants a new fence to be constructed to mark the boundary.
- Where a line fence already exists, and one owner believes that it needs to be reconstructed or repaired.”.
It is a reasonable place to post, in addition to here. A significant amount of Canada specific questions come through this, the significantly larger sub.
