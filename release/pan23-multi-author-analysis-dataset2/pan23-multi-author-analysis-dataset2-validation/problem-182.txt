If you can show you ex failed to disclose assets, this is a serious matter and likely will have serious consequences.
I believe California is a community property state that vests parties at 10 years. So if the crypto was bought during your marriage with funds made during the marriage (not a gift or bought with funds from a trust where they are the beneficiary etc.) and you were married long enough to vest, your ex spouse might have spent some of your assets. But, this is definitely a CA lawyer question.
So, here is the squeeze. How much do you want to spend to get this? It is incredibly wrong and unfair if your ex spouse did this. It may even be criminal and likely perjury if they signed affirming documents.
One of the biggest problems with divorce and divorce lawyers is that they benefit from your anger. They will take this case because its interesting and likely very lucrative for them. But, you need to ask yourself, is this what you need both financially and emotionally.
I think that’d be tough. Even though the divorce has already been granted, this is close enough to ABA model rule that I don’t see anyone willing to do a contingency fee arrangement. Payment plan, perhaps. Contingency, no.
