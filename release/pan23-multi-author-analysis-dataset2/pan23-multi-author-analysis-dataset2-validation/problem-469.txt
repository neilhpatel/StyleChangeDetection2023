Sure, but this particular conflict did not start in the 90's but in the 18hunderds. The two parties just keep digging up old quarrels and can't seem to be able to move on.
They're quite ready to move on now that they got what they wanted. If Kosovo was still a part of Serbia, they wouldn't be sitting on their asses quietly.
Its always the serbs. I'm sure there wouldnt be any conflicts there if the serbs werent a thing, and I'm a serb. The amount of shit they try to steer all the fuckin time, conspiracies, always on the bad side of history,etc Serbs suck.
If theyâ€™re anything like Greeks, Turks, and Croats, they have a poor sense of humor about nationalism.
There is a lot of good serbians but saddly most of the ones related to the war arent. And the people around them still believe in the propaganda of those days.
Im not perfect but Im not gonna defend my people when I know they were awful and still are to this day.
(i was born during that time, didnt participate obviously but my family did.. so yeah even I could come out different. Being in the west helps to develop differently).
Honestly, looking at the situation in the EU right now, it kind of reminds me of Yugoslavia. A bunch of nations acting really friendly towards each other, but with a lot of hidden hate and unsolved issues that are just waiting to pop out.
Those kind of serbs literally think Serbia is the first ever civilization, every european language was stolen from them, every event is thanks to them,etc.
