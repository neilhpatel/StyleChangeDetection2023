It was just a general “I promise to send photos whenever you like” which I have written record of via text but I’m an idiot I should’ve made her sign a contract. I just never in a million years thought she was this crazy.
Not really. If you sold her the puppy then the puppy is now hers to raise how she likes. Unless there is some specific agreement she is violating (like a promise to send exactly 2 photos per week) then I don't see you even having an enforceable agreement about photos.
Honestly even if you signed a contract or may not be enforceable to require that and even if it was that part of the deal has no monetary value to sue her for.
Yea I mean I figured she would be protected for basically doing what she wanted to do. I just was hoping somehow she could be held accountable and to learn a lesson to not do this again. I’m wondering if she sold her last dog and just pretended he was stolen.
note for the future, it's best not to make empty threats like this. there's really no good outcome from doing so. if you do need to take legal action, do so.
Noted. I thought just saying that would make her admit she either sold her or finally send a freaking photo lol. However it had already exploded so quickly I should’ve known the moment I expressed concern for lack of seeing her it was over.
