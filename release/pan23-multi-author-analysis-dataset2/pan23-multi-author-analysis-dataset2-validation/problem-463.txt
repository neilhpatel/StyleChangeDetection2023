So this is a checking account that her paychecks are deposited into? The fastest way here is simply to report the card missing and get a new one; the police are unlikely to get involved over a debit card.
Why does the sister have her money - how did your friend's money come to be on that card (where did the money originate)?
Why is she living with her sisters and not her brother, if her brother is her legal guardian and her sisters are not responsible?
She works for her own money and as soon as her brother told her she could leave her sisters her sister took her card from her and she lives away from him so she can be independent she turns 17 in 2 weeks.
Her guardian can let her stay wherever he believes she can stay; if he is fine with her leaving her sister's house and going somewhere else, he can do that. If, however, you're mistaken and her sisters (or someone else) has guardianship over her (or her actual parents are around...), that decision could be overridden.
This is really something that your friend needs to discuss with either her brother or her parents. Certainly if her sisters are abusing her or neglecting her, she should contact the police.
