Agh I was worried this might be the case. You don't think the guard telling me the things would be alright is something to pursue a case on?
Also, if I slipped and hurt myself in their garage they'd have to pay with insurance - I'm genuinely unsure why this is different?
They're responsible for the upkeep of the garage. They're not responsible for the actions of other individuals within the garage.
But threatening a lawyer won't amount to much, they weren't the ones who stole from you. You would need to sue that person if caught for the value of the items.
If you have renters/homeowners insurance they should be able to help you out. These types of items are typically exclude under auto policies from theft.
Even if the parking lot guard assured me my things would be okay? Is that not some false sense of security that he was portraying? He had a bodycam on as well so there may be evidence of this conversation.
