Dang look at those fasces behind the Speaker. I can't believe I never noticed before. I guess it all just blended into "decoration" to me before. I was about to ask if anyone post WW2 felt an unsavory connotation to "bundled sticks" of the staff but I guess they must not have, considering!
The original House Mace was chosen by Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg, the first Speaker, and bestowed upon the first Sargeant-at-Arms, Mr Joseph Wheaton. Everything went swimmingly until the British showed up on Aug 24 1814, when it was destroyed - the Mace had not been removed from the Capital and when the building was overrun and burned it was lost. The used a wooden rod for a while, but in the 1840s had a fancy replacement made, and that [Mace] ( can be seen anytime the House is "In Session" in its reserved spot, just to the right of the Speaker. It's comprised of 13 black rods bound by silver bands, each rod signifying an original American state. Atop sits a Bald Eagle, our national symbol, and the globe sits beneath him with N America facing forward. It cost 400$ in 1841 which, according to the House, would be about 10,000$ today. [Here] ( it is with the 54th Speaker, Paul Ryan. And [here] ( it is hanging out with Woodrow Wilson in a very historic moment. What we call the State of the Union Address is mandated by the Constitution, yet it fails to specify method of delivery. Washinon and Adams showed up in person, but Jefferson didnt think that was the best way to do it. Instead he wrote it and had it delivered by clerk, and that precedent stuck. It stayed that way until Dec 3 1913, and that's the day the above picture was taken as Wilson delivered the address in person. [This postcard] ( of Truman's Address also has the Mace represented, though it's difficult to see clearly. Next time you click on C-Span and they show the House Chamber, look for it. If it isnt in his home, the House is not in session (and, outside of ceremony, this is the thing it's been most commonly used for over the past 125 years). So to your question of beating someone with it... Absolutely not. It's a ceremonial artifact that has seen some serious history, and that would never be considered an option by the Sergeant. Needless to say it came from the design for a historic weapon but is not itself designed as one.
Oh wow, cool question. I'm gonna back you up one second because I very seriously doubt very many of us know what a "legislative mace" or specifically the "Mace of the Republic" (also known as the US House Mace) really is. So let's start there.
As far as if that doesn't work, the Sargeant-at-Arms, as we all saw, is armed. In the 1800s, when fights in Congress weren't that uncommon, they did what you do when two men are pummeling each other with canes - pull them apart or let them finish. "How did fights in Congress in the 1800s get broken up? Did someone step in or let them duke it out?" could be a cool standalone, but I'm not well versed enough in that to elaborate on it today (I'd need to do some reading up on the specifics to give it worthy attention).
Covering centuries in seconds here, they were first used by Romans and they made it to England by the authorities of that Empire entering the British Isles. They were used by Normans as a signal of power and became commonly utilized to show authority, deriving that from being a mounted, or noble, weapon used by Knights. One became symbolic of the King and was placed in Parliament to represent him while that chamber was in session. It did so until Oliver Cromwell declared "Remove that man's bauble!", though he was offended by the design, which was altered and soon after reinstated as their mace. After the restoration, they redid it again. The first American mace was already here by then, however, showing up in Maryland in the first half of the 17th century. They had a mighty ceremony involving the mace when their chamber split and the lower house gained its own autonomy in the late 1600s. Virginia likewise had their own, probably in or before 1676, but also definitely being gifted one from Gov Nicholson on Dec 7, 1700 as the House of Burgesses sat in the Grand Hall at the somewhat recently constructed College of William and Mary, who then bestowed it to the "Mace bearer and Messenger" which they subsequently reference as the historic role of Sargeant-at-Arms. This one was likely replaced later in the century (a record of an order to England for a new mace and new gowns for the Speaker and clerk exists), and that one sold post revolution in a purge of all things monarchical. The City of Williamsburg even had their own, being likely gifted from Dinwiddle in the early 1750s (and [it] ( is restored and owned by Colonial Williamsburg as part of their collection).
On April 14, 1789, our first Congress established a Sergeant-at-Arms for their chamber to execute their will. They also established a symbolic item to represent the power of that office and the chamber as a whole, and chose a mace. They said;.
So it hasn't been used as a weapon for a long time, but the symbolism behind it is the reason it is respected. It's much more of I "I command authority on befalf of the People" than it is "Listen or I'll wallop you one" To that end, that symbolic reference in the US House (the Senate, btw, chose a gavel instead) is not of the King but rather the authority that permits the House to have its authority, or simply We The People.
Cool somewhat similar side note, in colonial times staffs were used to call order - in a Virginia court room, for instance, the judge did not have a gavel. Instead the sheriff (or "bailiff") would hold a staff, usually about 6' tall and as around as a forearm. When the courtroom got loud, three hard verticle strikes on the wooden floor would silence it. If you've never been able to sit through a reinactment, I can assure you the force, noise, and vibration from this big dude slamming a hard wooden staff on a hard wooden block/floor would silence you, too... WHAM, WHAM, WHAM! It's very LOUD and very SUDDEN. In fact I would equate it to the noise of a firework or small caliber firearm and in a room not bigger than many livingrooms, with nothing but hard surfaces to bounce the noise, it's pretty cool to see and hear.
Virginia is one of the few states to still have one, and [here] ( you can see that golden mace, worth significantly more (to recreate as a non-historic relic) than the US version.
Ill edit in here that S Carolina has the oldest legislative [mace] ( in the US, dating to the 1750s and still in use today. It cost 90 guineas when new (in 1756).
