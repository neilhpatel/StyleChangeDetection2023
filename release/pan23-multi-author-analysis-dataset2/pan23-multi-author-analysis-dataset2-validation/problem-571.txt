Since I have been summoned, I'll add a few thoughts on my previous post, because I think there is something to say about the way people tend to read Eco's essay and related list.
As a general rule, historians of fascism - that is of "generic fascism" - seem to prefer coming up with definitions of their own, or with interpretive proposals that mirror the nature of their research, rather than adhering on a "standard" definition. This is even more obvious when you consider different field of studies. A sociologist, an economist, a political scientist are unlikely to share the same point of view, even if they may agree on certain general features and even rely on one another in their work.
There have been attempts at a "consensus" definition of a "fascist minimum" - notably by Griffin himself - that, while legitimate, have not earned universal approval, leaving the issue of "consensus" open-ended, regardless of the dispute on merit. There have also been those who have challenged the notion of a need for a definition altogether, favoring a - not undeserving - "phenomenological" approach. I personally don't believe there is a need for a minimum definition, nor one to reject such attempts at a definition.
In many ways we do have some sort of operative "definition", that comes from a process of natural selection - so to speak - of different interpretive attempts. The historiography of fascism is a field of its own, starting roughly in the early 1920s with the first works attempting to explain the affirmation of Italian Fascism. What one can witness through the decades is that - while certain traits remain consistent - our interpretations of fascism continue to evolve, driven for better or worse, by the dialogue between two poles: the present and the past.
In many ways, Eco's attempt appears to look at the present - his present, to be fair - more than it does at the past. The idea of a "meta-historical" historical object is, more than an apparent contradiction, a challenge to the notion of "historical" object itself. Which, for a historical assessment of fascism "in its epoch" - to borrow a famous choice of words - is not very helpful.
But I can only say - at risk of sounding a bit condescending - that those who focus on the "fourteen points" in an effort to box-ticking history into folders might have to put more work into understanding the meanings of the text.
Now, as one who has some experience with students, and with not so driven students in particular, I think numbered lists are the best way to ensure that students won't read the chapter, let alone doing their own research (heavens!) And maybe they really shouldn't.
It doesn't necessarily mean that those elements are invalid, though. But are we really supposed to seek to adapt those points to the historical circumstances of 1940 Japan, or 1975 Chile, or - why not - Napoleon's France? Would it help much to see if the Old Believers framed their enemy as both strong and weak in 1682?
Or, in other and more straightforward words, it's not about a definition of historical fascism, but rather to make sure that we keep a safe distance. Just in case.
People do use them wrong - that's true. But that's not, by itself, an issue with the definition. Every definition, or theoretical framework, can be adapted improperly.
The economical relations, for instance, are almost entirely absent, and it could not be otherwise since social and economical relations in the Italian agrarian environment of 1919-21 are so profoundly different from those of today, of the 1980s and even of 1930s Great Britain for instance, that such a direction would undermine the "meta-historical" inspiration almost entirely.
As you pointed out, the elements highlighted by Eco tend - rather than identifying specific moments of recognizable patterns in a precise historical context - to mirror "meta-historical" modes (if there is such a thing) and logical arrangement of what one could call "public discourse", the sphere where a collective meaning is formed, the rhythm and sound of a time.
I have never read Eco's essay as an instrument to analyze the past; but rather as an invitation to challenge our assumptions on the present - and, thankfully, that's Eco's present, so we don't have to violate any rule of twenty years. The assumption - for instance - that, since fascism is - historically speaking - confined to "its epoch", regardless of our desire to stretch the boundaries of it, than we can do no wrong, nor borrow, or even reproduce without the need to borrow, the elements that defined (maybe) the formation of meaning in the public conscience in the outward sphere of "historical fascism".
So would you say its more of a semiotic reading of how discourse within fascism might look, as in how it brands itself and signals itself (since Eco was a semiologist), but its not a guarantee because the historical context and intents itself might be different?
Thank you for this excellent follow up, and a great discussion of an essay which gets bandied about quite frequently. Very enlightening.
