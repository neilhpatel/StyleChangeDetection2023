I have both the original trust and the disclaimer, I've been reading over it and understand some of it, but the wording is confusing so I doubt i have a complete idea of what it says.
Sure, this a sentence that trips me up in the "disclaimer" document which is titled "Agreement to adjustment of beneficial interests and release".
"Thus, on termination of the trust, John Doe (ME) will receive the first $\\,\\\ of assets of the trust and the balance of the assets of the trust remaining, after all winding up expenses of the administration of the trust have been paid, will be equally distributed to the remainder beneficiaries.
I cant figure out if i will receive the first $\\,\\\ of assets of the trust and the balance of the assets of the trust remaining.
or if the balance of the assets of the trust remaining, after all winding up expenses of the administration of the trust have been paid, will be equally distributed to the remainder beneficiaries.".
IANAL. It sounds like you're guaranteed a certain amount first. Then, after all the administrative fees have been deducted out of the trust, you will be given an equal share of whatever is left. You can split that sentence up into 2 sentences:
You posted that this is in the state of Texas, although it's easy to overlook this because it was posted at the bottom of the message.
told me I was signing off on the transfer of the trust to a new bank/trustee, which a believe is true, however that was the only thing they told me it was.
You will receive an additional portion of assets, YOUR SHARE (because this portion is being divided across multiple people listed in the trust, the other beneficiaries), of whatever is left in the trust after expenses (administrative) have been deducted.
If you have signed away your rights as a beneficiary when you have attained age of majority with the knowledge of the trust, it's going to be difficult to make a case of coercion or undue influence.
Is there any proof of correspondence between you and your trustee over the years? Like the one you have received right now?
Hopefully you have gotten the assistance of an attorney by now. Before you received the information about the "revised" trust, the trustee should have furnished you with a copy of the trust plus accounting statements for each year the trust had been in existence.
I only had a vague idea at the time that there was a trust, i had no knowledge of how much the trust was worth or really why i was involved at all. I have emails from the past year or so as that is when they began to call me directly. But no correspondence before that from a trustee. The trustee rep who emailed me recently is not the one i have worked with, but apparently their boss. "Head trust specialist." When i turned 18 there was no attempt to contact me directly, inform me, or provide me with documents i needed, not by family or trustee.
