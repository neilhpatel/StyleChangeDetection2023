You don't get to keep the money and the CD, effectively getting you a free CD, if that's what you're asking.
Whether you get your money back and return the CD, or keep the CD and send back the money is something for you to work out with the seller.
If you can't work this out and you remain in possession of both the money and the CD, then the seller has one or more avenues of legal recourse, up to and including suing you for the money.
The point that Iâ€™m getting at is that I never asked for a refund or even insinuated one. They started going through the refund process without me saying I wanted one. The website sent me a shipping label and sent me the money back practically disregarded my email telling them I would like to keep the item.

Your recourse, currently, is to work it out with them. Tell them you want to keep the cd and pay for it. See where that gets you. Communicate with them and work out a resolution.
