Ooooooh, boy, the Classical Vs Medieval Army Sizes question. Just about everyone I've ever read or talked to about this matter agrees that it's A Thing, and that your typical Medieval European army is going to be smaller than the armies raised by the Greeks or the Romans...but as far as I can make out, we still have no clear answer on why this is the case. (My prevailing theory is that, for the specific case of the Romans, a Roman is actually three small Latins stacked on top of each other, and the given army sizes for Roman armies are actually counting individual Latins. Thus a Roman army size should be divided by three to get a picture of what their confused opponents saw from their side of the field.).
My thoughts (I hope I can post it here since i'm OP?) were related to things like the plagues, the increasing specialization of jobs (so fewer soldiers or farmers who could be levied), decreased reputation/honor available from becoming a soldier, and so on.
That aside, some posters have attempted to grapple with the question, so while we wait for someone to take on this problem, here's a few previous posts for your perusal, oldest at the top:
The reply about belisarius' armies "retaking" Italy was fantastic, and makes a lot of sense - very much what I thought I knew before reading it - because the ERE was pretty broke at the time and also didn't have access to a huge part of where the manpower would have come from.
I'd still be interested if you are looking at (guessing here) the political, social, environmental, etc, aspects of (what appears to me as an amateur) the massive reduction in size of armies from (as an example) the Punic wars, where armies were (and as I think I understand it, we have somewhat decent reliability on the answers because we know the of legions, the of soldiers in a legion, and - very roughly - the number of auxiliaries which accompanied the legions.) many tens of thousands (and sometimes wiped out and quickly replaced) compared to the paltry numbers of later centuries.
