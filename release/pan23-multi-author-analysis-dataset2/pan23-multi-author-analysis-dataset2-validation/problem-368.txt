ADA regs only require that businesses provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with medical issues. When I was working in a restaurant at the beginning of Covid the ADA released a statement that the owners printed out and posted for everyone to see. The statement summarized was basically this: the ADA does not recognize any situation where it is discrimination to bar a patron from entering the store for not wearing a mask as long as some accommodation can be offered outside the store, such as curbside service, delivery, a drive thru, or online ordering. Legally you are covered as long as you still provide some kind of accommodations.
As a gaming store, your best solution is to tell customers that anyone in the store must wear a mask to cover their mouth and nose at all times. If someone cannot wear a mask you can accept a phone or internet order, and do curbside delivery.
Refusing to allow someone to hang out and GAME is not the same as refusing to provide service. They can still make purchases from their FLGS online or by phone. They can find other places to hang out and game where masks are not required, at least until the current wave settles down.
I would not ask for nor accept a doctor’s note regarding masks. if they can’t wear one, they will just have to accept delivery at curbside and play elsewhere.
We made reasonable accommodations for our customers who were not allowed in the store because they couldn't wear a mask.
If you require masks and some customers can't wear them, no doctors note helps with why you have people wearing masks.
It's up to your customers to decide which they want more, to play in your store or to not wear a mask.
I run a business and this is the best answer and exactly what we have done. A disability or exemption doesn't give you the right to disregard all rules.
