Has your girlfriend spent the night more than 15 days? If so, then you are probably in breach of your lease because of that. While you quoted the part of the lease that says not more than “10 consecutive nights, you omitted the rest of the sentence which limits guests to “15 days within a 60 month period” without LL’s written consent.
Additionally it was my understanding that it was a breach of lease only if you went over the 10 consecutive day limit OR the 15 day limit within a 60 period span. Your phrasing makes me think that i can have guests over only for 10 consecutive days AND at a maximum of 15 days within a 60 day period, however that was not my interpretation.
She has not spent the night more than 10 days. My apologies, I omitted the bit on the 15 days because I was sure to be within the 10 consecutive day bounds.
ETA: The lease is hard to read from the pics but it appears to read that guests staying 10 consecutive days or 15 days in any 60 day period requires LL permission.
It honesty sounds like you are kind of a nightmare tenant that the LL doe not feel is reliable and would like you gone.
