The seller does not have a legal obligation to help you replace the title and bill of sale, if they were given to you at the time of purchase. The impetus is solely on you to register the vehicle on time and keep track of the paperwork.
You will need to contact the DMV to get the title replaced. It is generally possible, although it is an arduous process.
Dmv already stated the only option would be to go to court. Dmv can't issue a replacement only the owner can do that. Although he has no legal obligation the transaction was never recorded so I could argue he never gave me the title in the first place which would be a breach of contract.
It would absolutely not be a "breach of contract." Ignoring the fact there isn't a contract here for the seller to be in breach of - you gave them money and you got a car, title, and paperwork in exchange, and the seller failed no duty here. They gave you everything they were obligated to give you, but you lost them. They have no further duty to either give you new copies or help you obtain title.
It would be you committing perjury to lie to the court and claim they didn't give you the title. It would (likely) be extortion to tell them that you will lie if they don't help you. You'd just be adding criminal penalties to your extant problem of not having registered the car and losing the title. It isn't a solution or strategy.
I am trying to be patient here, but please let me assure you, I am not "failing to understand" anything. I understand exactly the situation, what you assert happened; what the issue is and what you need; and why it is both (a) a problem, but (b) not his problem.
I contacted him and his work I offered to pay for him to get a duplicate title and compensate for his time he flat out refused saying he has no records of the sale yet he sold it thru a lot and said it was my problem and hung up.
Have you tried offering to pay the seller for their time and work helping you? That is usually how one gets a practical stranger to help them.
You want to lie in court and accuse him of not fulfilling his obligation in providing you a title and BOS. This is perjury and would be extortion, in most jurisdictions, to threaten to do if he isn't willing to help you. Stop fantasizing about how he has to fix your mistake, and start thinking about how you can approach it without his help; you're just going to keep going in circles and getting nowhere if you keep trying to convince yourself or anyone else they messed up here. They may have made mistakes, but it wasn't one that caused this problem. That one is yours because you didn't register the car and now two years later you want to, and out of nowhere are expecting him to produce records or do you a favor. You can't find some tangent issue that you can't prove he did/didn't do wrong and pretend that's the key to forcing him to fix your mistake. Trying is almost assuredly why he isn't interested in helping you out. If you go from asking a question to telling me how I am wrong in two exchanges, I can only imagine how pleasant it is to talk with you when you think someone owes you their help.
You, on the other hand, are failing to understand my explaining to you that the dealer has no legal obligation to help you because you are the one who did not register the car, and you lost the title. The end. That's all that matters here as far as your goal of "make seller help me" goes. He doesn't have to and the court can not make him. He did what he was legally obligated, which is give you the title when you purchased it.
The guy lied about keeping the transactions on file, he worked at the lot is what ur failing to understand they have to keep everything logged. He said he has no record of anything. The Vin number even comes back as being last registered to him he used his lot made me fill out paperwork and then didn't keep anything for records we are both in the wrong he's not obligated but he was obligated to keep a record of the sale which he did not.
The guy didn't keep any logs or records of the sale at HIS job on the lot, the lot would be able to look to to see who sold and bought the vehicle and I could use that to prove to a judge to give me a bong I'm not legally Taking him to court. For me to be issued a bond I need some sort of proof I own the vehicle. By law he has to keep a record of the transaction especially selling it thru a lot he didn't do that. Ontop of why the car sat around for 2 years was because 1 month after getting the vehicle the motor blew it was a lemon rod bearings were already shot in the vehicle and he knew about it. I'm simply asking what I can do while you sit here and provide nothing other than I he has no legal obligation to provide me anything which I already knew but him using his employer to sell this vehicle with no record breaches the contract that was signed and dated at that time they are supposed to keep on file. So the only proof I have of ownership is having the vehicle for 2 years some screen shots of him marking the car as sold and it not being registered as stolen. Don't bother commenting useless information that is obvious in this situation.
Or, you could stop being a totally asshole because your approach of being a dick isn't working, go to the DMV, and POLITELY ask if someone can help you understand the process to obtain a bonded title, since you are also wrong in assuming you can't do it without the seller.
You're also clearly not thinking it through, since you would file suit and the seller would have it dismissed because you lack grounds or standing to seek the records in the first place. Then, on the off chance the seller decides to produce them, (1) it doesn't help you one iota since you don't get to keep it and it wouldn't be the same proceeding as obtaining bonded title, but the judge will know you lied on the complaint, in your testimony, and on the bond application, plus attempted to utilize the legal system to make someone else fix your mistake. You aren't making friends with attorneys with your antics here so I imagine you aren't going to get any farther with the judge you tried to manipulate.
You want to sit here and say lie to the jury as if the guy isn't already lying about everything. There's no record or proof of must everything I'm simply trying to get a advantage in this situation I said I could argue that he never gave me any documents, the only way they could prove me wrong is if they came up with paperwork and then they would be at fault as well as they stated they have no records or paperwork. But thanks for a whole lot of nothing.
You know what? I changed my mind. Please lie in court. Please do this. It is a wonderful idea and I don't know why nobody else ever thought of lying as a way to achieve their goals.
