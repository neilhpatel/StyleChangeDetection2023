Pets are property and it's just a matter of who has physical possession of them will rule. It doesn't matter who paid what, it belongs to both of you.
Thanks for your response! Does that mean, if PJ moves out with me, my ex would be entitled to half the cost, and PJ could stay with me? I'm willing to pay any cost to keep PJ.
That’s what the other person can get through the legal system. Police won’t get involved and small claims just (usually) deals with money. We can’t predict how he’ll react from that.
Thank you for your response. I do have vet bills that amount to over $1300 for PJ alone, plus many many receipts for food/toys/training classes for the dog that I paid for. I also have the microchip registry info showing that the dog's chip was registered under my name, and a document from our current town showing that the dogs are licensed under my name. I also have pet insurance records that are completely under my name. I hope that will be enough. One followup question - since we are still living together for now (I move out in about a week), can I just move out and take both dogs with me? We have no rental agreement drafted up so there is no official move out date - I was just paying him a certain amount per month as "rent" to pay towards the mortgage. Thank you again for your insight.
