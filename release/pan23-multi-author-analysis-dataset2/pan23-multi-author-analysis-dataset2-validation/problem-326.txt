I filed with the subcontractor for small claims court. I cannot find him. Nobody really knows where he is.

I've personally printed out probably 20 pages of documentation text messages venmo statements in just various things I had going for me. And I took it up to the office of the owner. The construction company. They know about me but they are ignoring me, will not return my phone calls, my emails. And every time I get on the phone with them they gave me the run-around.

I'm vacillating between hiring a private investigator / process server who can definitely get it served, or simply filling a mechanics lien. That seems like a more guaranteed way of getting my money back. It will only cost me around $40 to file it.
I think I just read today that it's 90 days. The text messages show basic things like arrival to the job site and leaving the job site. We're talkin about which job site to meet at. But none the less, they are quite big and there is no text message proof of pay.
How specific are the text messages? Do they talk about what your hourly wage will be, or what the full price of the job will be? Do they acknowledge you completed the work at any point?
Regardless, please know that in many areas the window for filing a lien can be pretty narrow. Don't let it slip by.
