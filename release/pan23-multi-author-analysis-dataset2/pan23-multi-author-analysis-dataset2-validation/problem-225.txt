Also: Utah, like many other states, has a specific set of laws related to tenancies in mobile home parks: .
Are you sure that you and your friend are both on the lot lease ? It would be unusual to have a non-owner of a mobile home lease a lot. It is more common for the mobile home owner to lease the lot, then turn around and lease the mobile home separately.
Do you have a separate rental agreement with your friend, for your family to reside in the mobile home ? Is it month-to-month or a fixed-term lease (usually 1 year or more) ?
I don't think you will be compelled to move out quickly. And you should take a skeptical approach to the things your friend is telling you, and verify them independently if possible.
Oooh, yeah, don't do that. That looks more like fraud conspiracy or conspiracy to conceal assets, and it would surely drag you into her drama in a costly way.
Her theft or embezzlement of money from her father is likely a separate legal issue from the ownership of the mobile home unless he was the former owner and she somehow faked paperwork to transfer the deed to herself.
You will very probably have the right to stay in your home and continue to pay the agreed-upon rent until whatever legal processes affecting her ownership AND your lease are over. The usual exception is if a bank forecloses on the home, and even then you typically get 90 days notice.
I'm not a Utahn or particularly familiar with that law, but wanted to mention it because it's easy when you're looking for advice on landlord/tenant law to get information that applies to ordinary houses and apartments but might not be applicable to mobile home parks.
I'll refrain from making an offer on the trailer until I'm sure there's no legal issues but I don't super trust my friend anymore.
Initially we lived together, she got a boyfriend and married, so she moved to another house for intimacy reasons. Essentially we pay the lot rent, and she doesn't make me pay her anything else to stay.
My current lease is a year with the trailer park, just started this year. And I'm positive that he never owned the trailer, only her name and the previous owners appears on the documents.
