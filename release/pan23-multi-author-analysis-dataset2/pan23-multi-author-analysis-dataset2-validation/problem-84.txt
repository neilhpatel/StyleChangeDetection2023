Then that's the landlord's problem. Debts and expenses are not passed generationally when people die - this is her 'debt' not yours. If the estate can't cover it then that's too bad, but not your problem.
As far as the law is concerned you are a stranger to the lease - you are no more or less liable to cover rent and cleaning expenses than if the landlord had called someone randomly out of the phonebook.
If the landlord tries to serve you papers, then go get a lawyer. Otherwise, tell him he needs to serve you to see any money from you. It's not illegal for him to tell you that you owe him money when you actually don't - that's what he's doing.
That being said, some debts in some states can be tied to you in full if you start to pay them at all, because in some cases that can be construed as you accepting responsibility - so don't 'compromise' or try to 'meet in the middle'.
(Edit) Re not having an estate; whether she does or doesn't, and what the details of it are, is also something that is not your job to provide. The landlord needs to make an effort to look up the details in the public record if he wants to collect. You can't go out into the street and demand rent from strangers walking around because you don't know your tenants phone number - telling you it's your responsibility without looking up those details is the same as doing that.
Well, you are not a tenant, you are not in the contract, and you are not legally liable for managing your mother's affairs since you aren't the executor of her estate.
IANAL, if you are not on the lease you are not responsible. if you live there and the lease is not being paid, he can evict you. You do not have to pay him anything. I would not even respond to him.
