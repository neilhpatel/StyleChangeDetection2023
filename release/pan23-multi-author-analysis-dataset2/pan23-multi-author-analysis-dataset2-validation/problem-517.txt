Springer's Politico again. Isn't it fun shitting on the new mildly progressive german government trying to change things?
And no, Germany does not backtrack on defense spending. The money is there, but planning is not ready for instant spending. And guess who has been responsible for military planning over the past 16 years? Yes, Springer's favorite german conservatives. Pot, kettle.
Cept there are systems you can aquire and fill a role immediately. You choose poor examples. Not only that but Germany didn't even build enough G36 to fully arm their troops for NATO exercises. They have critical shortages of numerous things they could immediately put orders in for and increase production. They could immediately buy parts and increase manpower so more than half of their armor assets aren't incapable of fighting.
It announced it would start spending that minimum agreed 2% of GDP and 100 billion Euros to modernize and improve their readiness. Now they are saying it may not happen in two years so by the third year it can be shrugged off entirely.
The fact that the most powerful economy in Europe doesn't even spend enough to equip every infantryman with a rifle is disgraceful.
Sure, Germany could acquire the M4 right now but it would be a waste since Germany has already standardized on the G36 AND is about to replace it with the HK416A8, acquiring a new firearm now, just because, would simply mean wasted money and wasted time and effort.
Another example would be the US army acquiring the Leopard 2 just for the sake of increasing spending, the waste of money/resources to integrate a new weapon system like that, without any real reason to, would be too much for it to make any sense.
my point was that acquiring anything still requires planing and careful consideration as not to waste money.
And yet you need proper planning before you can spend money. And parliament needs to clear these monies off in Germany. The government has provided the money, it's there, but government cannot spend it right now bc planning is not ready and Bundestag cannot clear/approve the projects.
Also (if it works the same in Germany as here in Sweden) the Regering/Bundesreigerung/Ruling Party can't really decide anything, they are the executive power, it's the Riksdag/Bundestag/parliament that decides and tasks the Regering/Bundesreigerung with executing said decisions.
Therefore, to immediately buy stuff or increase production WITHOUT the Bundestags approval would probably be hard or impossible to do.
So let's now move on to foreign products they can buy. Drones, Germany does not have a robust drone program and its partners do. F-35 to fill a role Germany has no ability to fill with native aircraft.
Y'all are mocking Russia for using cold war era kit but Germany over here wouldn't even have that to fall back on.
Is this the same logic that justifies Germany taking over a decade to procure new helmets including a study on if American helmets fit German heads? (I wish I was joking).
Who is Springer? Did not catch their name in the article, nor as writers of the article. It is a noticeable difference in stance from the Zeitenwende speech shortly after the invasion of Ukraine in February, no? Is there really good reason for why they're not planning/attempting to match the 2% NATO commitment on national defense spending before 2025 now? Especially during a time of tense conflict on the borders of NATO that have transformed the post-Soviet terms in Europe.
Everyone downvoted me constantly when I kept saying Germany hadn't even drawn up spending plans over 6 months after pledging to spend more and here we are.
