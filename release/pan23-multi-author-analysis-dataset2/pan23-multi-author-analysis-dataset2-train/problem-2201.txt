So your mother is going to file a false police report, commit insurance fraud, and then you’re going to go plead guilty to a crime he did not commit, get a felony on your record, and then you would be personally responsible for all of the damages caused in the accident. You would have to pay your parents for the car and you’d have to pay the other drivers for the damage you did, plus their medical bills. Your mother would commit crimes, but you would be the one going to prison. The easy thing to do here, is to either get your own car, ride your skateboard, take the bus, take an Uber, pay to get on your parents insurance, there are dozens of possibilities that are easy quick and cheap and don’t involve multiple crimes being committed.
Edit: to literally answer /u/baddoodlesRus's question, the statutes in PA allow for anywhere from up-to-seven years in prison, to up-to-twenty years in prison, depending on the type of car theft. With fines of $15,000-$25,000.
In theory, zero, because they didn't steal a car. We aren't supposed to be sending innocent people to prison. But driving without insurance is illegal. And your family can lose everything if you crash.
