Given the behavior of the GOP and their supporters over the past decade or so (at least), it doesn't seem likely that they'll change course now. But if for some reason they were to want to change course, they would need to do this early and emphatically. And the tame media that they've relied on to spread their messages over the years will need to play their part as well.
