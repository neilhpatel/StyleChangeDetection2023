Is there anything at all in writing regarding your agreement or the ownership of the house that indicates he's an owner? If not, then your friend may not be able to overcome the statute of frauds, depending on your state. If that is the case, then his contributions may merely be those of a renter.
Naw, we just had a verbal agreement, but he hasn’t held his end of the agreement. (Putting up the same downpayment as myself) The worst part is the houses appreciated a lot in the last 5 years and he wants half.
There are two potential issues of mortgage fraud here, by you. First, encumbering the mortgage without revealing that to the lender at the outside. Second, mortgaging the house without the right to do so. Again, potentially. Can you give a location and more details?
You need an attorney. This could turn into an expensive mess. You can't have oral agreements for real estate anyway. Get this sorted out now before it costs thousands and thousands more to sort out down the line.
I was planning on offering him 30k when we sell. He was paying 1000 + his portion of utilities for 5 years. $500 for each month seems fair. He would have $$$ for a dp whereas I had to use my first time home buyer’s.
Yeah, I will see how it goes. I was planning on offering him 30k cause he did pitch in towards the house, and we never discussed rent. He was paying $1000 + utilities, which is still cheaper than rent here. That’s $500/mo for 5 years.
