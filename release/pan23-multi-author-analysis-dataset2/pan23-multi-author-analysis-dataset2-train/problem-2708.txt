If they just want monetary compensation, Small Claims Court would be the right destination, no lawyers needed. I feel they would first need to decide what they want from the other party.
I think at this point recouping the vet bills would be a good start if there is no real legal recourse. What would happen if the homeowner ignored any sort of action via smalls court?
If the homeowner ignores the summons to small claims court, a default judgement will be issued in favor of your friend (simply put, your friend wins by default because the other team didnt show up to the game). Then comes the harder part of collecting. He can ask the court to garnish the neighbors paychecks, he can place a lien on their property like their vehicles, boats, their real estate, etc. A lien is basically a legal Post-It note saying your friend has first dibs on the property or value of the property because the owner has a debt. For example if your friend won a judgement for $5,000 and the neighbor tried to sell his car with the lien for $7,500, the first $5k from the sale goes to your friend and the neighbor only gets $2.5k.
