Given the circumstances, even if he was in perfect health, I'd say he should talk to a lawyer. The statutory requirements for notice or pay in lieu are well below what someone can usually get in Ontario, as there are complex common-law entitlements that go well beyond the _Employment Standards Act_.
Combine unexpected termination with a recent injury and modified duty and that recommendation is even stronger. If there's any indication at all that they fired him for being off on medical leave or in retaliation for his accommodation, then he has a strong negotiating position for a severance/buyout package.
Worthwhile to consult an attorney or file a complaint, would be a little odd that they'd wait the entire modified duties period and fire him at the next most suspicious time.
Pardon me, that's the thing he's a fantastic employee, they even asked him back after they closed for covid over two years ago. The second he has back issues flare up, they wait till he's done his modified duties and fire him. It's very upsetting.
If he was part of a union, he should talk to his union rep first. Otherwise, a referral from the Law Society of Ontario would be a good next step.
