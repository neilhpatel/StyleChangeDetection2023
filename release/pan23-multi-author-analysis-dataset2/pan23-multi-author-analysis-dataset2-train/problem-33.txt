This did evolve/get centralized over time - by the end of the Ancien Regime, there was only one tax farm for all of France, the Ferme Générale (General Farm). That would get reformed in turn multiple times , though it was very much hated by the general population (part of the reason why the Ferme Générale required 20,000 guards to essentially wage a war against smugglers within France).
We could make a more or less continuous line of European "The Greats" for millenia; but that was hardly the only Cognomen outside of the Roman Empire. Henry the Navigator, William the Conqueror, Ivan the Terrible. Were these commonly used at this time? Was Henrique of Portugal referred to as "the Navigator" by his contemporaries, or were a lot of these assigned by historians? Also, why did they fall out of use?
