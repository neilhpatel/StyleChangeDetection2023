Don’t patronize me and it’s obviously extortion/exploitative. I don’t the exact legality of this, but it’s just terrible. They coincidentally waited to share their opinion and nearly made us put him to sleep on financial grounds, despite knowing all along. Did we really have to pay $2000 to hear that he was going to pass anyway? It’s insane.
I am not sure what you are trying to get recourse for here? If they ran no tests I assume they didn't charge you for tests. The vet likely thought this may be cancer, but they would rather run the tests to make sure it isn't something else. When you mom was concerned about the costs of the test they gave her more information to help her make a decision.
They purposefully withheld information as to extort my mother at a ridiculously inflated cost. The main vet caved and admitted he was going to die anyway and that it was pointless, so the vet knew all along. Surely there has to be some legal aspect behind extortion.
I am very sorry about your dog, and I know you're upset, but this is just not extortion. Vets are allowed to charge their own fees and testing at an emergency facility is expensive. The vet is also allowed to prefer testing be run before they make a final comment on the future of the dog.
