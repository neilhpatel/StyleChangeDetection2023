Do you know for a fact the landlord removed you from the lease? Everyone needs to agree and sign the proper papers for that to happen. (Without domestic violence, a restraining order, etc...).
What is happening is definitely an illegal eviction. If you can afford it, I would contact an attorney.
There have been no crimes, restraining orders, no police at all no issues. She only wants me out because we broke up.
Both my ex and roommate confirmed today separately that the landlord"got rid of the old lease and they signed a new one".
Ik you're NAL but from what I've seen in my state my only recourse would be to sue the Landlord if he tries to enforce this "eviction" (in quotes because it seems clear this is not a legal eviction and thus shouldn't be enforceable yet) but I would only be eligible for hotel/moving costs if I incur such charges as a result.
If they call the cops I'm fucked though because sellouts show them the new lease and claim I'm trespassing.
I can't imagine it'd be worth the money to actually fight this in court. I guess I'll just "squat" here until I find other amenities.
