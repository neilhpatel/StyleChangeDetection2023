Thomas Jefferson was explicitly in favor of viewing the constitution not only as a living document but as one with an expiration date. In a letter to James Madison he wrote (emphasis mine):
I suggest beginning with The Quartet: Orchestrating the Second American Revolution, 1783-1789 by Joseph J. Ellis. The work focuses on the Constitutional Convention, specifically George Washinon, James Madison, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton--the quartet. The sections specifically about Madison provide insight into your question; yes, Madison specifically regarded the Constitution with it's "ambiguities" as a "living" document where clear answers were not offered, but instead provided a space where arguments about issues could continue. "The Constitution was intended less to resolve arguments than to make argument itself the solution..the foundation for an ever-shifting political dialogue that, like history itself, was an argument without end." Ellis argues that Madison's, ergo the Constitution's, original intent was to make all original intentions, e.g. the Constitution as it was when written, negotiable in the future.1.
I would also look at the Constitution itself, as the process of amending embodies the environment of argumentation and negotiation. Beyond the scope of the early American Republic, read Eric Foner's The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution as it outlines the Constitutional debates during Reconstruction and the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments and again, the "argument without end.".
u/ToastyTree69420 you're welcome! I usually post more extensive responses; however, at the time I lacked access to all of my sources. If you want more academic journal articles or other books, I can provide you with those.
Also go to JSTOR, there are numerous academic journal articles which cover this topic as well. Usually my search includes James Madison and Constitution. Hope this helps!
