This is pretty much it. Even if Ukraine doesnâ€™t win - Russia has been pretty much wiped out as a military. Including leadership, soldiers, weapons, hardware, etc. If I remember correctly they lost a bunch of special forces early on in a failed operation. We also know how they operate in the field and the limits of their technology- including their communications and drone capabilities. Russia will just be a 3rd rate power after all is said and done. Granted they will still have nukes and natural gas, but that is all they will have.
Sometimes I think all this back and forth is planned rhetoric. They don't want to go rushing into Ukraine, possibly causing a wider conflict. It's terrible to think about all the lives that are lost while the world is getting used to sending heavier weapons to Ukraine. This is the reality when faced with the remnants of the Soviet Union that still has many nuclear weapons. They are boiling the frog here. The frog is Putin and his cronies. By going slowly, they're robbing him of the power to unite his country against the west over a single incident.
