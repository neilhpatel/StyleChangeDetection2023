She's a traitor to her country and should have been sent to Guantanamo with the other neocons who perpetrated the 9/11 atrocities.
She still denies that anyone here could imagine someone flying planes into buildings, despite the many Pentagon led exercises covering that exact scenario.
You have to understand Russian government is very good at propaganda and being unethical. A former KGB spy, Yuri Bezmenov explained \ wherein Russia spreads so much misinformations over a long period of time which pits a target country's people against each other (especially Russia and the US, lesser extent with the UK, Australia,etc). Russia has a long history of being unethical with distributing weak covid vaccines, killing off political rivals in the days of Russian monarchy, USSR and modern Russia. Russian govt constantly bombards their populace with mostly state owned news media telling people what to think. Not everyone of course is pro-Putin but they won't usually say it openly because Russia has a long known pattern of making people disappear. A lot of Russian civilians probably don't trust each other or rat each other out. In North Korea, there's basically radios everywhere telling the population what the laws are, how great the Kim family is blah blah blah but they also don't trust their neighbors and have been known to rat each other out on the slightest suspicious. So basically, fear and corruption plague the Russian elections and government. Russia has always been like this. It's a pretty depressing country, but they're too good with propaganda as it's affected English speaking countries a lot (with RT TV, Rupert Murdoch owned news media companies like Fox News, Sky News, various newspapers, etc). It's clear to me this is a successful massive brainwashing going on with the usual corruption. Things are rarely as simple as you point out.
