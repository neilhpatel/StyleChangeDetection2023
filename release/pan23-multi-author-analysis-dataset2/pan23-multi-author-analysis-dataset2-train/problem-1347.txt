Iâ€™m sorry about your pup, that is really hard to go through. Did the breeder provide you with any sort of health guarantee? Unfortunately Golden Retrievers are very cancer prone, there is a very high rate of cancers in the breed. There is no health testing that can predict whether breeding stock is going to produce offspring with cancer ATM, sometimes you get unlucky IMO.
Even if you found grounds to sue your damages may be limited to the purchase price of the puppy, some states have puppy lemon laws CO is not one of them.
Did your vet give you more info on this particular cancer and why they suspect it could have resulted from breeding? It is known to be hereditary?
You still might have some luck in small claims court without that specific law. Sorry about Rosalee, but I would recommend not racking up additional vet bills, because counting on reimbursement from the breeder would not be wise.
Some states have "pet lemon laws" that require breeders to offer a refund when they sell a sick animal. California even has a law that requires the breeder to cover vet treatment, up to 150% of the purchase price. However, google tells me that as of 2018 Colorado did not have a law like this. Maybe spend some time searching for "pet lemon laws" for your state/county/city (where the breeder lives) and see if you might have some legal protection.
