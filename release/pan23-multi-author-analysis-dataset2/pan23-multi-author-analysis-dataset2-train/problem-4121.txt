Family Law cases can be heard by a State Supreme Court for the same reasons as any other field of law - if they’re an issue of first impression, if there’s a conflict between different circuits/appellate districts within the state, if there’s a novel or complex issue of law, if there’s a federal statute which modifies prior state case law.
A lot of time it’s financial and property issues which get appealed up that high, not custody disputes. Things like business valuations during divorce, or pension disputes between ex-wives and current spouses when the beneficiary dies. ERISA is a constant source of state law issues. But custody issues, parental kidnapping, and grandparent/third party custody issues all first were established at the appellate level.
Would you say judicial bias is a reason why a case could go straight from a Superior Court to a Supreme Court? For the case in question, a pro se litigant is arguing bias and disputing custody and the decision to sell a $550k house. There are no other assets. It's ridiculous in my opinion, and I'm trying to read up if she has a case at all.
