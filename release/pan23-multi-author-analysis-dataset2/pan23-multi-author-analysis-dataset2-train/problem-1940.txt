Zeman, for those who don't know did "speak out" against Putin's invasion, but has a long history of being pro-Putin/anti-EU along with Babis who was a corrupt oligarch/PM/President prospect. Zeman, for example, would famously drop Russian sentences in to some of his speeches. He was a sort of "toothless" Orban, so it is such a big deal he is replaced by a pro-NATO general, who in my opinion should change it to Czech Republic as a statement.
It feels bizarre that we had a reclusive drunk for a president for ten years, now Pavel hasn't even been sworn in and he's already in major international news every single day. With Milo≈° Zeman leaving the office, some of the final remnants of our East-aligned past are finally fading out. I really hope that in some time, Czechia will become a true Western liberal democracy.
Any sensible Warsaw pact country citizen is pro Ukraine. I am surprised it is even a thing. This is like saying "A Bosnian turned out to be pro Kosovo." What a surprise I would say.
