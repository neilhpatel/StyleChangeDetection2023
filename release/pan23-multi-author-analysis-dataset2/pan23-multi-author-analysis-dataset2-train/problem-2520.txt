The real fun will begin when German car industry gets nationalized to protect its overpaid and over-socialized workers making crappy gas guzzling cars with ICE engines which are increasing forced to be produced locally where they are sold unlike the previous decade where they were built in Germany using cheap Russian gas.
Wow, you don't know that our (EU) companies are banned from producing cars with gas engines by 2035.
Now VW and BMW have already bend their back to US and China, its only a matter of time before German companies shift assembly abroad and then full production. This will happen across many industries in Germany only leaving behind their very high skilled research teams. Just look the British car industry or the Italian, you couldn't convince a British in 60s that Royal Enfield, Jaguar and Land Rover are all Indian owned and majority of Italian brands are owned by Chinese, Americans and Indians.
Lol, In your own little EU bubble, your workers are massively overpaid compared to the workers in other non-EU nations and its unfair to those nations when their rich import German made cars instead of German cars made or assembled locally, it protects the workers abroad and increasing many nations like US, China and India are building up barriers to protect its own car industries.
Its inevitable that EU declines in value unless they can ramp up their domestic demand, but EU citizens are already overtaxed and have little to no disposable income to spend on luxury items, while your middle class is being hallowed out and replaced by high skilled immigrants who are willing to work for a much lower rate and sill take half the cake of a better life in EU while the residents increasing become delusional and live in the past memories when everything was great.
Probably spot on, most Indians have realized its not the talent or skill that we lack but rather the lack of capital that keeps us from expanding our production or up-skilling into higher industries. While China exports its cheapest products, India sends its best Engineers and workers abroad not only to learn technology but build wealth which can used to create more wealth back home.
