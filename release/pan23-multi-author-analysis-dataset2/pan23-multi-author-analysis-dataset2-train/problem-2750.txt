No Lavrov, the west does NOT want peace, we want Putin dead and Russia broken up. Are plan is working, in the past year over 120,000 dead Russian s in Ukraine, another 250,000 to 300,000 wounded, a million young men has fleed mother Russia for the west, your best and brightest, we will keep them, they will not be coming back. We in the west do nothing but spend hundreds of $Billions supporting Ukraine while Russia destroys whatâ€™s left of the USSR. What a deal for the west, Putins such a tool, 2 or 3 more years of this and Russia will not have a military capable of stoping China, win win for the US and Europe, Thank You Putin for making America great again.
His opinion was that if Russia wants to negotiate they know how to begin negotiations. Right now, Russia does not want to negotiate, they still want to win.
Probs because Ukraine will agree to nothing less than restoring its territorial integrity as well as join the EU and NATO. Giving russia concessions will only embolden them to attack again in the future.
