You have probably signed a binding contract and cannot back out without the dealership's permission. You COULD talk to them - they might be able to work with you and the credit union to swap things around, but they aren't legally obligated to allow it.
I think your best bet is to explain to the dealership that you are having second thoughts and ask what is the process and penalty, if any, there would be if you wanted to buy a different car. If they think they can make more money off you they will figure out a way to make it work, trust me haha.
I agree, they want money at the end of the day and what I’m looking to do is swap to a car that would actually cost a couple thousand more. But if they refused, I was curious if I even had to sign those contracts at all.
I obviously do not have the documents but I suspect that if you don’t sign it’s not going to be in any way beneficial to you (stay at higher interest rate, payoff is wrong, etc.). The original contracts are mostly likely not going to be void because of a mistake you made in giving them incorrect information or because the interest rate changed. These are likely highly sophisticated contracts vetted by lots of lawyers who would not allow this scenario to occur.
