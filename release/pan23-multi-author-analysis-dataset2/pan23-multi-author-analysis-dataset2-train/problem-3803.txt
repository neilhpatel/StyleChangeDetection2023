If it is in fact uninhabitable -- like, unsafe to hang out or spend the night there -- then the requirement to move out may be reasonable and legal. The owner has the right to start immediately to repair the damage, and technically it's state or city safety/health code that makes the apartment uninhabitable -- not actually an eviction.
If it is legally habitable but inadequate to meet the conditions of the lease, then he might have recourse against being forced out. It matters what the City/County/State says.
If it's officially red-tagged, he only shady part is what the landlord would do with the friend's personal property if it's not moved. In many states, the landlord would have the right to move it into a secure storage facility at the tenant's expense, but not to get rid of it or sell it, etc.
Edit 2: Another case for renter's insurance. It's cheap and can protect against things like this, depending on policy terms.
Look at your county eviction court website online to see if they describe eviction procedures. Generally a letter would not qualify as official notice and you need to see how much time is allowed for a renter to stay before being officially evicted through the court process. He should be talking to a landlord/tenant law attorney to see if there are particular steps he should be taking or if he is qualified to request additional compensation.
His apartment may have damage to the wall that joins to the other apartment( if so, it would only be the bottom half) and he has been there since the damage was sustained.
