He's giving you a chance to come back with proof of insurance. This goes very differently if you had insurance and can demonstrate you did than if you didn't.
I didn't have insurance at the time of the citation. Now I do. The judge didn't ask me if I had insurance now. When he asked if I had insurance at the time I said "I don't think so". He said "either you did or you didn't" I said I don't think I had it no. Maybe I didn't respond well but either way what was determined from this court date and why do I need another one when nothing has changed and after I said I have insurance now he didn't ask for proof or say anything he just said come back to court on this date. I don't understand what happened.
That all makes sense to me. I just don’t understand what changes in a month . I’m already there in court before a judge and I don’t understand why it couldn’t be relsolved. What is changing in month, nothing. Why didn’t he just say are you guilty and I would have said yes and paid the fine. Why is it like this big game.
Because you didn’t give a straight answer. You said you didn’t know if you had insurance, so he gave you time to try to figure that out.
The court does not care that you have insurance now. The citation was for not having insurance on the day you were pulled over, not for not having insurance today. If you didn’t have insurance on the day you were pulled over, you’re guilty. This was likely your first appearance and now you will have an actual court date to settle the citation. He was nice enough to give you a month to figure out if you had insurance on the date of the ticket since you “don’t know” if you did. If you didn’t have insurance, your answer is “no, on the date I was cited, I did not have insurance”.
If you didn't have insurance at the time and you want to do anything besides pay the fines for both the missed court dates, and for the driving without insurance you should talk to a traffic attorney.
