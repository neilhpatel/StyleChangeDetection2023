In addition to the advice you've already received, you can call your local hospitals and put emergency contacts on file. While travelling, your passport should have a spot where you can write in an emergency contact as well.
You set up what is often called an Advance Directive. In some states it's a single document; in others it's multiple documents. It does several things.
Sets out your wishes for healthcare, especially end-of-life care. Keep me going under these circumstances; let me go under these others. This is often called a "living will.".
When you have the Directive, you hand out copies all over the place. All your healthcare people--doctor, dentist, eye doctor, acupuncturist, whatever. Give copies to your agents, as well as the executor of your will (You do have a will, right?) Your employer. Keep a copy with your passport or some other easy to find place. I keep a note with my drivers license with my agent's phone numbers. If admitted to a hospital, give a copy to the staff. Stick a copy on your refrigerator door for the paramedics to find.
Names someone and a backup to be in charge of what the law calls "disposition of remains." That's funeral. cremation vs. burial, etc. This is usually a separate document. As a frequent international traveler, you may want to be sure your travel insurance covers "repatriation of remains" if you want your body returned to the US. That can be a daunting process and, in my opinion, worth the money to let the pros handle the paperwork. (I also pay for the top-of-the-line stuff, where a company rep will handle paperwork with hospitals and whatnot, including coordinating with my doctors and providing translators.).
