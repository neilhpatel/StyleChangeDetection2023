From my understanding, China is all in on hypersonic missiles because those are seen as the best deterrent to our air craft carriers. The military doesn't release detailed response plans, but I remember reading a military expert and he was saying that if a war broke out between the US and China, he'd expect the air craft carriers to quickly retreat away from China to reduce risks associated with hyper missiles.
I don't think the US has EMP weapons able to prevent this, but I remember hearing about jamming and other electronic warfare systems we had. Would definitely be interesting to know exactly what they are doing but I wouldn't be surprised if the systems they are using are classified.
