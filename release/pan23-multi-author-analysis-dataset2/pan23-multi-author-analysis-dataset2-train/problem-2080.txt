E: I'm unsure if these are actually 2A4s or are 2PLs, the biggest difference being optics and some other small stuff namely replacing the hydraulics with electric drives. Overall the 2A4 is not fundamentally different than the 2PL or 2A6 and with the 2A7 being decidedly not for urban warfare idk what you want them to send? Hell, I'd argue that the longer bore of the 2A6 makes it less suited for the type of warfare being fought there as well, but overall there's not a huge difference in the models, so arguing they're obsolete or whatever (especially against T-72s, which they were literally designed to defeat) is moronic.
That's literally how the contract for buying nearly any foreign equipment works, violate it and you'll find it's hard to buy equipment fr anyone in the future.
So after all the trashtalking for 2 weeks about a Blockade from germany Poland gets the permission one day After the request and then sends the Oldest one they have in Stock?
Even the oldest models still require permission and will be very decisive. Even Poland's rebuilt T-72s, the PT-91, is vastly superior to what Russia is fielding despite being worse than the Leopard 2 in every way. The point is to get Ukrainian forces trained on NATO-spec electronics which PT-91s, Leo-2s and Abrams all have while phasing out ex-Russian equipment/unmodified T-72s.
