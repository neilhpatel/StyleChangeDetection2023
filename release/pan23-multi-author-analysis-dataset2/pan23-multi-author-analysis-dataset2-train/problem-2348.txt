Honestly I’m not sure but I would also add that the house and senate are different in the behavior and rule breaking they allow.
I mean…here’s something fun to consider. The average age of a house member right now is 58.7 the average age for senators is around 64.
There honestly isn’t really any “young” leadership options for democrats in the senate. Honestly there are more young members of the house than in the senate.
People in their 60’s is alright to me. That seems just about the right age to have connections to getting things done while having a healthy mind still.
That’s true, but has less impact when someone makes a procedural puzzle move and they’re on in session. Staffers are more helpful for writing and researching, prep, than they are in in-chambers fast paced procedural fuckery.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Also if I’m not mistaken there’s a difference in leadership between the chambers. Speaker of the house is a separate position from majority/party leader.
Especially in the Senate, where there are loads of bullshitty procedural rules that fossils like Grassley and McConnell know how to exploit. Someone too green would get eaten alive.
