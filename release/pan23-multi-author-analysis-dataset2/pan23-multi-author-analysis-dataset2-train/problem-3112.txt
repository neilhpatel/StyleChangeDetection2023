Move there and file a motion with the local courts for a parenting plan. You are entitled to see your child. She can only get a restraining order if you have threatened her or harmed her within the last 12 months.
My question is this: is she just lashing out and saying things that are not going to happen? i have been sick to my stomach, anxiety attack, etc ever since she said that. If I can't see my daughter again, there is not much left in my life.
It took me 10 years and 85K but I finally got custody of my son. My ex wife tried to make it to where I wouldn't see him ever again. I fought as hard as I could against everything. I could have done it much cheaper but I wanted to prove a point to her and her family.
If you don’t want custody but just to be nearby, there’s nothing stopping you from moving. She can file for a restraining order and you can fight it. But nothing would stop you moving a town away, the order couldn’t be that broad.
If she’s moved within the past 6 months your home state is the venue for custody hearings. If you have no formal agreement or parenting plan in place you have an avenue to get your child back in your care if that’s what you want, courts want stability so keeping her in the same school can go a long way.
I'm in Indiana until my COVID vaccine, the court said anything I file here will be served to her there, Currently turning in the petition for paternity tomorrow.
but could the restraining order restrict access to my daughter? sorry for the stupid questions i am just completely strung out over this entire situation.
like, are you guys saying unless i committed domestic violence, there's a slim chance of a judge revoking my visitatiom? She told me she would "allow me" monitored visitation.
