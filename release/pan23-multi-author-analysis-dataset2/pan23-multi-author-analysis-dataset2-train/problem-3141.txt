1. 90% of your issues should be posted on a roommate advice sub, not here because they are not legal issues.
You are in fact liable for the entire $1050. Actually you are each responsible for the entire rent each month (jointly and severally liable). Just because you are not there does not invalidate the contract you signed. That's literally what a lease is...an agreement to pay for a period of time.
Except that if the leasing company decides that you are easiest to come after for the rent that is not paid (for whatever reason), YOU will be responsible for ALL OF IT. That decision is not yours to make.
This is a huge mistake. You WILL be looking for a place to rent in the future. If you have an eviction on your record, you will find it very expensive, or very difficult, or both to rent a decent place. Unless you enjoy living in shitholes for a long time, you should be concerned about an eviction.
True, with me out of state though.. I’m hopeful that the other 3 will be easier to get a hold of since they are closer. I’m still paying the rent, they will be too. So no violation of the lease. I am simply creating a new payment schedule.
