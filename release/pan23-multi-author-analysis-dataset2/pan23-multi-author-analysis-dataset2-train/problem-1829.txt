I also once got into it with a friend who is mildly anti abortion, and was defending the repeal of roe v Wade. She said she could feel attachment to her sons from early on in the pregnancy and that I, as a man, couldn't understand that.
My mother was staunchly pro choice, in no small part because she tried for years to have children and had multiple miscarriages. It was traumatizing and painful. This was before Roe. She knew what it meant to go through with that while people were questioning why your pregnancy ended with intent to punish or, at the very least, shame you.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
