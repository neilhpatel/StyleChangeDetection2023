That's what I thought. My fiance is getting reimbursed at the end of this month from his university - about 6-7 grand. We'll be looking into attorneys. Worst case scenario, we'll just have to take out a loan. Thank you.
Anyway. While you will likely need a lawyer's support, getting some idea of what the laws look like in Texas so you know what you actually need to ask the lawyer should help. You should do your own research rather than trusting me as I'm just googling here, but this still might be a helpful start point as it's not just an ad for one particular law firm:
While you do need to speak to a lawyer, first you should start by doing some basic looking around at Texas custody laws for unmarried parents. Unfortunately his rights are limited in this situation.
The first thing he'll need to do is legally establish paternity. Under Texas law being named on the birth certificate isn't enough. He needs either an acknowledgement of paternity signed by the mother or he'll need to push a paternity lawsuit through in court. Until legal fatherhood is established, he has basically no rights here - she has full legal and physical custody and doesn't even have to notify him before taking the child away.
We spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars only to have the mom completely ignore the custody order.
Once he's established in law as the father he can file a court order for custody rights. He's very unlikely to get 100% custody. However, if the child has established a home and school ties and so on, the courts might rule that she should stay in the area and the mother would need to live near you in order to exercise her custody share.
