And even better, they'll ban reading entirely except for the upper classes (fun fact, England's test for being a clergyman was the ability to read; punishments like execution for theft may seem harsh, but they could be "clergy-able", which means priests got a lighter sentence, though crimes like murder were not clergyable. Thieves couldn't read, naturally, but they proved they could by reading the "neck verse", so called because it saved your neck, though most of them memorized it instead of reading. Of course, if the magistrate didn't like you, he could enforce the full penalty anyways.).
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
