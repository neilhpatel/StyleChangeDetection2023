Perpetrator being 7 and you 8 would possibly be viewed as child sexual experimentation and curiosity, not molestation. Him being younger than you is a factor and whether he would even be considered to have criminal capacity at that age.
His abuse would post likely even further mitigate his actions and decrease his criminal responsibility. Look, rather than seeking vengeance, rather seek therapy, heal yourself and your wounds, try understand that he was a hurt kid lashing out and most likely recreating what was being done to him at home. You're both victims, you achieve nothing trying to punish him for being one. Just heal yourself and try to move on with your life as best you can.
That wasn't the case. You don't know him or me. He was in an abusive home and was constantly tormented by his brother while his parents ignored. He would take every chance he had to exert power over me as an outlet. I KNOW that he was reflecting abuse that had been done onto him to me. And I have suffered irreparable damage to my social and neurological development because of the trauma that happened to me, Because my neighbors own mother refused to deal with the trauma and abuse within her own household and let it hurt me.
