Update, he apologized, he says he had intended to get rid of his dogs excrement, that morning, but got caught up in “the heat of the moment”. Of course he didn’t mention why he still had the bag with him. Naturally he blamed the media and critics for nasty reviews pointing out the critic. So a standard, “I’m sorry you took offense at my actions but you deserved them and you should do better”.
I will never understand how this story about a local ballet dude got to be an international news story. There was even an event with ministers, both federal and state, for this.
Strange. Ballet conjures images of class, sophistication, culture. A feces attack would be suitable for a punk band, not a ballet director. I guess even the fine arts need to get more hip these days to attract audience. When ballet directors choose to imitate GG Allin, you know something is fundamentally wrong with the world.
the media is pushing it as an "attack on journalism". Though this was just a "professional critic". Things like that should usually come with the job.
