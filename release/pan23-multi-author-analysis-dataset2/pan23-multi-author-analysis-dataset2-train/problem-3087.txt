There's an argument in the article that the state constitution says only citizens can vote. However reading the constitution, it clearly says that citizens have the right to vote. It doesn't say anything about non citizens.
No taxation without representation was drilled into me in school. So at the end of the day I think it's not right to deny tax payers the right to vote, even if it's just a limited capacity.
I hope this bill becomes law, and that more people feel empowered to participate in making their community a better place.
I hate the phrase “no taxation without representation”. It doesn’t mean anything to American politics. It was a feature of British law, not some sort of moral thing that the founding fathers aspired to achieve. It was also broadly not intended to be about individual voter rights, but more about territorial representation. The colonies just didn’t have reps in Parliament at all. They would have been fine even if only 10 percent of colonists were allowed to vote.
DC residents can still vote in local elections. Same for residents of Puerto Rico. This bill would make that an option for tax paying non citizens in RI. I don't like the fact that those two places don't have federal representation, but I'm not knowledgeable enough about the specifics to really go further than that.
