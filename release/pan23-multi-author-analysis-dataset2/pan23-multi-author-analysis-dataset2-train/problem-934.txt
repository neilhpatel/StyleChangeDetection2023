The situation on the front line was analyzed and countermeasures against missile and drone terror were discussed at meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.
“I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today – it was quite long, three hours. We analyzed the situation on the front line in great detail – in all directions, on the energy front, the situation on the borders. The Commander-in-Chief, commanders, head of intelligence, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, head of border guards delivered reports. We know what the enemy is preparing for. We will respond and continue to liberate our land. Everything related to the defense forces supply support was also analyzed thoroughly. These are equipment, ammunition, communication, winter uniforms. Countermeasures against missile and drone terror were considered separately – there are already quite significant results in this, the percentage of shooting down has become higher, but there is still work to be done,” President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address.
According to him, it is necessary to fully protect the Ukrainian sky and everything possible and impossible will be done for that.
In the coming weeks, Ukraine expects good news regarding air defense and missile defense, Zelensky noted.
Moreover, Ukraine works extremely closely with partners to get more tanks, more armor, more artillery.
“Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the National Guard members who defend our state in Luhansk region as part of the defense forces. In particular, the soldiers of the 27th Pechersk Brigade of the National Guard, who, together with units of the Ground Forces, very effectively erase enemy equipment and the occupiers. Thank you, guys! We are doing everything so that you and all other soldiers have even more opportunities to chase the enemy,” Zelensky said.
The President also commended the border guards who continue strenhening the borders in Sumy region, Chernihiv region and Kharkiv region despite constant Russian shelling and provocations.
As reported, the U.S. Department of Defense announced a new package of security assistance to Ukraine, which provides for the allocation of funds for the modernization of HAWK surface-to-air missiles for their further transfer to Ukraine.
In addition, the United States will send 45 upgraded T-72B tanks with improved optics, communication and armor, as well as 1,100 Phoenix Ghost tactical UAVs, 40 armored river boats, secure communications and surveillance systems to Ukraine.
Funding is also earmarked for the modernization of 250 M1117 armored security vehicles and for the maintenance and operational readiness of already transferred equipment.
- Russia does not have the manufacturing capacity to replace the missiles/tanks/planes/etc that they are losing.
- Russia’s economy has been hollowed out. They have avoided it going off a cliff so far, but economies take a while to go off the tracks. All the indicators are bad. Like really, really bad. Decades of economic progress lost bad.
- Ukrainian progress is currently hampered by the mud season, which favours the defending force, but those conditions don’t last forever.
- They have no ability to produce their own chipsets, and they’re finding it very difficult to get them from outside sources. All those fancy weapons need chips.
- Soldiers are facing shortages of basic things like rifles, winter clothing, and first aid kits. There are reports of mobniks having to provide their own equipment, which is selling at exorbitant prices online.
- They’re seeing shortages of even basic things like gauze - commanding officers are on tape recommending mobniks buy tampons and pads to build their own first aid kits.
- There are documented cases of mobniks being thrown into frontline positions with little to no training. You can only plug holes like that for so long.
That’s not quite it. Mobik just means someone who has been mobilized. In this we have also seen “contractnik” for contracted (instead of conscripted) soldiers and “refuseniks” for people who refuse orders.
- Hundreds of thousands (minimum) of Russian men have fled the country, exacerbating economic problems at home.
- As Russian equipment is getting worse, Ukrainian forces are being trained on more modern NATO weapons systems.
I’m sure I’ve missed a bunch, but TLDR the only way Russia freezes this is if Ukrainians lose the will to keep fighting or they stop receiving support from NATO, and particularly the US.
No, with ATACMS long range HIMARS missiles being the most obvious example with the impending transfer of long range Iranian missiles to Russia. Previously, ATACMS was held back presumably out of a fear of escalation, but if Russia escalates the conflict using similar weapons, this argument dissolves.
There are also thousands of 80s-00s armoured vehicles, aircraft, and munitions that could be transferred from the US to Ukraine for only the cost of shipping and training. The US keeps these in mothballed storage in case the US ever gets invaded (somehow...), and since it costs money to keep them maintained, arguably they would be better used in Ukraine rather than being stored until they reach the ends of their lives and have to be scrapped.
- There are probably sanctions packages that could still be levied but haven’t been because they would harm western nations as well. It’s a balancing act of trying to hurt Russia while also mitigating damage to everyone else.
- There are western food and pharma companies still operating in Russia that have declined to leave voluntarily because they argue that removing basic necessities should not be interrupted. The justification from drug companies is easier to swallow, but Russia is a major food producer. They’re mot going to starve if Nestle chocolate isn’t on the shelves. (Idk if Nestle specifically is still operating in Russia or not. Just an educated guess.) More could be done to pressure these companies.
Expand demands in which way? Ukraine wants all of its globally recognized (1992) borders back, and Russia wants the complete subjugation of the "little Russians" in the "fake country of the Ukraine". Those are both maximalist demands that cannot be further expanded.
