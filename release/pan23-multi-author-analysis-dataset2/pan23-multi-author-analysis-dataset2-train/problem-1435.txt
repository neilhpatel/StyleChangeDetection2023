It’s going to be difficult to blame anything on routine bloodwork. If this was an emergency situation your doctor would have had you in immediately to run the tests.
You’d need to show that the delay specifically caused special harm. Let’s say one of the panels was for gestational diabetes. It’s not enough that you had something that would have been of note, but the condition was worsened significantly because of the delay. That worsening condition would be something a court makes you whole with significant amounts of money.
Realistically your outcome here is to get a refund for out of pocket costs. You can complain to your insurance if it was all covered. You can leave honest reviews.
