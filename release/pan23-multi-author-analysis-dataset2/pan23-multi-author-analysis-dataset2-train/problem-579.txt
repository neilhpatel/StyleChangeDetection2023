So, that's a pretty pricey charge. Are they accusing you of bringing in an infestation that spread through an entire building.
Quoted from the lawyer: "per Green v. Superior Court, as well as California Civil Code Sections 1941.1 and 1942.5, the landlord is responsible for the treatment of bed bugs in a home.".
What was the lawyer's reasoning for believing it to be illegal? We don't have enough information here.
Their citations raise an eyebrow. CA Civil Code 1941.1 deals with the landlord' responsibilities with regards to habitability, but as far as vermin, it has to be free of them when the lease commences.
The other information is this happened in the middle of our lease (4-6 months in), the unit next door was currently under remodeling, maintenance had bin our suite multiple times around that time as well as a fire alarm impector that visited every unit (400+ unit complex).
They claimed no other unit was effected, however, we also share walls with a staircase that many people use.
1942.5 deals with retaliation, but the landlord didn't throw you out or raise your rent as a result.
Green vs Superior Court is about the warranty of inhabitability, but if they treated it after you reported it, that seems moot as well.
In order to win a suit, they would have to prove (by a preponderance of the evidence) that you were the cause. If they report it to your credit, dispute it.
