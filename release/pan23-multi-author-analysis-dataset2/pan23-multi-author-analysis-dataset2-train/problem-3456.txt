Someone told me that if the bank actually did make a mistake then my dad’s lawyer would have paperwork backing that up and they could do a settlement where we would get to keep the money they “accidentally” gave us and my dad would get the money he is apparently owed so I’m not sure if that’s true but if it is it does make me suspicious that he would just tell us to claim our money and then give it to him.
Did the executor of her estate send you and your siblings a copy of the will, as the executor was required to do by law?
If you know the city and state and county where she died, a good place for you to begin would be to visit the county courthouse (if they are open to the public) and look at all of the documents in your grandmother's probate file. There will be information there about her assets, including the IRA accounts, and you should make copies of whatever documents you want so that you can use the basic information there to show to another professional person, like a CPA or attorney.
Look for that county's probate court website online to see if they have a court records request you can fill out to order the information you need, or call them for more information. You should let them know you want a copy of all documents in the file so far, and they will charge you a minimal copy fee like 50 cents per page plus postage. You will probably have to send a blank check (so they can fill in the correct total amount owed) or send a money order if you know in advance what the total cost will be.
Sounds like he is trying to steal your money. If the IRA’s beneficiary was changed to your father, there’s about a zero percent chance that paperwork was lost by the bank. And if it was truly lost before being sent in and the bank never received it, then it doesn’t matter because it never legally changed. It’s your money.
