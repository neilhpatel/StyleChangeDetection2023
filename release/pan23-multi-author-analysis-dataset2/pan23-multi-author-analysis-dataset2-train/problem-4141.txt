I guess i’m a little surprised that the landlord could just easily fall back to the lease instead of presenting a new one. Should we have asked for a new one when the previous one expired?
You're still bound to price terms of the previous lease regardless of whether it is expired or not. When you continued to live there past the term of the lease, you became a month-to-month tenant but you never made any other arrangements as to the terms of the lease, so a court would hold you to them being that it historically what you've done so they can prove an agreement prior but not a new agreement. Each month you stay there is like creating a new lease with those provisions that only lasts a month. You can negotiate with him for a lesser rent, I doubt he'd go for that, and at that point you either pay the amount you previously agreed to or you can give him notice to leave but you're still liable for the original rent payment until such time as you leave.
I just think its a little weird that they can just not present a new lease when the old one expired. The roomie that moved out only did so because the lease wasn’t explicitly renewed and therefore would not be hit with any sort of monetary penalty. Does that make a difference?
The difference is you didn't move out when the lease expired. Why should a landlord be out of money when you're the one that stayed past the lease? Why didn't you move out if you didn't want to continue to pay the same thing you agreed to pay a month for rent?
The landlord doesn't have to explicitly renew the lease, because it's being automatically renewed for a 1-month period every month, per local laws. The only way anything around your lease can change is if you give 30 days notice or your landlord gives 30 days notice. So your lease is the exact same as it was before, except it's only good for 1 month.
