The proof is also the course of dealing between you and your landlord. Virtually no landlord would've let you move in without paying the deposit.
The proof may also be in your lease - sometimes it specifically says that a deposit of $X "was" paid (not "will be" paid).
Also your bank may be able to give you a receipt of the cashier's check, if you still bank with them.
As other posters have discussed, you send a demand letter for return of your security deposit within 14 days after you have exited the unit (pursuant to New York State Law or you will file suit in court, per New York . Indicate that documentation issues between the Landlord and his bank are none of your concern and not a valid reason for not meeting his statutory obligations to return you security deposit.
Did the lease say how much the deposit was? If so that is your proof you paid. No way a landlord would not update the lease or give a written statement saying it's waived.
I would write your landlord by e-mail with a copy of the lease. Tell them it states a deposit was paid. Ask when to expect to receive it.
1. The lease was executed and you testify that you provided the security deposit (and the LL wasnâ€™t refuting it).
Its not your job to prove you paid to the landlord, you have a signed document that said it was required. It would be on them to prove it was never paid/agreed to be waived. If they do not pay it back then file a small claims court action.
Also has it been more than 30days? NY requires the landlord to return it or give reason why. Them losing track of it probably will not look good in court.
