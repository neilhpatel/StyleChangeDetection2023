I can’t believe it took this many years to see an openly destructive malware like this in the news. We used to joke in olden days the reason you saw no “nuke the computer” viruses is because they cannot propagate or would need to be some manner of mission purposed system to deploy and then activate on some condition.
IMO this is way more likely comming from within Russia itself to hinder conscription and punishment of those who refuse to die in the idiotic war, for people and the country who couldn't care less for the lifes of those, who are commanded to give them up.
Pick resistance movement inside Russia. The same or at least ideologically affiliated to the ones fire bombing police stations, recruitment offices and other governmental buildings.
Consider this: Russian "hackers" steal passwords, troll social media and send the occasional ransomware.
Or 3rd parties that aren't Russian. Though the similarity to another virus that targeted Ukraine does raise eyebrows.
I agree it definitely doesn't fit the MO of nation-state actors. They generally don't like announcing methods, even when they admit to the results.
