IMO it’s a gray area and depends on if the judge considers smoking to be a minor lease violation or damaging to the property. For most states, multiple minor lease violations (same violation) within a set period of time is grounds for eviction/termination of the lease. For example, you get multiple noise complaints it could lead to eviction, but if you have 1 noise complaint, one late payment, one not bringing in trash cans, etc. that wouldn’t trigger an eviction.
If the landlord tries to claim that smoking is causing damages and the judge agrees that the damages exceed the threshold for eviction, then yes you can be evicted. Where I am each judge has a slightly different threshold because it is “what a reasonable person” considers damages.
We could all agree that accidentally breaking a 99 cent latch on a window doesn’t really have merit for an eviction, and we can also agree that punching holes in every door and wall would be sufficient to evict. But we all probably come to a slightly different answer on where that line is. Where I am, smoking is right in that middle zone where some judges will grant an eviction and some won’t, others the smoking has to be extreme.
The burden of proof lies on the landlord. First he/she has to prove that you were in fact smoking. Smoking something from an open window probably isn’t good enough. Second, they have to prove that it caused damage to the property.
Hm ok, there is obviously no damage as it didn't originate in my unit. And it's the "first offense" so to speak. I just wonder if "he smelled it when he was standing in your doorway" would be enough to use as "proof" in this case.
