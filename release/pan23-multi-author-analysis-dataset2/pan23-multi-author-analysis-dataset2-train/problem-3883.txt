People of Praise was founded in South Bend, IN (where Notre Dame is) in 1971, but it has groups in cities throughout the country, Canada and the Caribbean. Amy grew up in its New Orleans branch, but during her two year period of joining (known as being underway) she lived in the household of Kevin Ranaghan, who functions as the group's prophet. During that time, she also attended law school at Notre Dame while going back to New Orleans in the summers for internships.
I ask because she was working for Notre Dame in South Bend Indiana before taking the supreme court job, and I'm from not far from that area.
