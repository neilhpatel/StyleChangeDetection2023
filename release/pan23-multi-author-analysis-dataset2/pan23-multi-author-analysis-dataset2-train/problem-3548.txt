Right now, you have to be firm. "Brother, you know very well that Dad quit claimed the house to me 12 years ago. The house is NOT part of his estate. It is my home. We will be splitting anything left of his actual estate after his funeral expenses and other debts are paid 4 ways as we both know Dad wanted us to." Note: The estate (NOT YOU!) does have to pay your father's debts — credit card, any loans he has, medical debt, and do NOT forget the 2021 taxes owed to the government. If anyone tells you that you or any other heirs or the executor are responsible for any debts, be very careful. In 99.9% of cases you are not.
If he gets a lawyer you should consult one as well. Not knowing what he may argue we wouldn’t have any guess as to the strenh of that.
So even though it's been over 12 years he can try to argue about the house? I'd rather sell it and split the money. It's not worth the arguement and hassle.
If dad’s estate is not fully probated there could be room for discussion. Again, we have no idea what the arguments would be of if they’re valid, meaningful, or able to be asserted here.
