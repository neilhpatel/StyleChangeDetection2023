NAL. Please document these instances, take any relevant pics/vids of whatâ€™s happening. I say all that because my crazy roommate destroyed many of my belongings, forced me to move out, then tried to sue me. I wish I had documented the things she did because in court it was just her word against mine.
If you're in the US legally and not violating your visa, calling ICE is an empty threat - it'll go nowhere. She seems unhinged, but her behavior doesn't seem to rise to the level of pursuing legal options.
She's just doing it to scare you. The police aren't going to care over ownership squabbles of personal items in an apartment you both lawfully reside in. ICE isn't going to care, either if you're here legally. I'd probably just start looking for a new place to stay as soon as possible.
