You are automatically emancipated when you turn 18 and parent financials are still required for things like FAFSA. 26 is when you are no longer bound by your parent's income for the purposes of federal school financial aid.
You'll need to make/have enough money to provide for all your own needs without affecting any compulsory education. As a result, emancipation tends to really be limited to children that are already wealthy (trust fund kids, child stars, etc) or those who graduate from high school early.
You are already living apart from your parents. They are either OK with this or at least are not trying to get you to come back. It must be stable housing, not couch surfing or "my friend's parents say I can live there.".
OK, then what is it? I am unaware of any financial aid that will completely ignore parental income and pay out $400,000 because you got emancipated earlier than 18 (which, as a side note, is extremely rare).
Your parents consent to your emancipation. If they do not consent, you can try to convince the judge that it's still the best thing for you.
OK. In order to be emancipated in California, you will have to prove the following, with supporting documents:
You already have a legal income that is sufficient to cover all your expenses. Rent, food, clothing, transportation, insurance, healthcare, phone, internet, etc. A big one here--school expenses. How will you pay those with zero contribution from your parents? Is the school willing to provide written verification that, if you are emancipated, they have a way to cover your tuition?
You are currently paying all your own bills and doing a good job of it. No run-ins with the law. You have a bank account, and, even better, savings.
For all of this, you will have to provide documentation. Proof of income A budget that shows that you can pay for everting. Proof of your expenses and that you are currently paying them. If you have not yet graduated high school, a plan for doing so while still working.
