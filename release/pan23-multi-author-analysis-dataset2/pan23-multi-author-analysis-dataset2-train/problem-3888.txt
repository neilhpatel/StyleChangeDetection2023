Make sure the account you are being sued for is the same account that they are confirming is in good standing. It is possible someone fraudulently opened another account using your identity. You need to pull your credit reports immediately and review for any suspicious accounts.
I was wondering about that as well, but my credit is quite robust as of today. I only have 3 accounts - checkings savings credit, all with BOA.
As others have said, check your credit and ensure no mysterious accounts have opened in your name fraudulently. I would cation asking BOA about a case on the off chance that a pending case against you exists, they are not your friend in that case.
You don't need to do anything until you are served with official court papers. This third party could be running a scam where they look through court proceedings and then contact people with the same name to try to get money from them while they are in a panicked state.
Actually confirm that you are being sued, contact a local clerk or, if a jurisdiction is provided on the letter, check there if there is a pending case there. If there is, talk to a lawyer in that jurisdiction. If not, itâ€™s probably safe to ignore it until something from BOA providing a court date and an address for the case to take place in.
