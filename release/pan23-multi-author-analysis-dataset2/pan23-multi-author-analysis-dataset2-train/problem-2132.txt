I see, thanks! Would it be appropriate for me to ask for a written lease agreement? Or do you think it would just be tempting her to evict me?
We came to an understanding after the argument, but I would prefer not to constantly be worried if this is the month she decides to evict me on a whim.
If you are behind on your rent, then she may be able to take steps to evict you; she may also be able to refuse to renew your lease.
I am not currently behind on rent and I purchased the trailer from the previous owner (not the landlord).
I'm in North Carolina. As far as I know, there was never a lease agreement when I moved in. Everything was handled with verbal commitments and handshakes. The trees were in contact with power lines, but I was hoping to trim them myself not destroy the entire plant. The bushes were on the fence line and apparently were just in her way of mowing the grass.
Up until this incident, the household has always been responsible for the upkeep of the fenced in portion of the yard, and a space of about 3 meters around the dwelling/fence. This is the first time she has actually entered the backyard.
You can absolutely ask for that. And I would probably not choose to occupy a property when I knew landlord could at any time give me notice to end my tenancy.
