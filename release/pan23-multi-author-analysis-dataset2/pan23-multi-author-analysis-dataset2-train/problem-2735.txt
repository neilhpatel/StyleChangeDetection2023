You probably don’t need any attorney for unclaimed property. You just need a paper trail to prove your relationship. In this case, you’ll probably need your normal photo id (like your driver’s license), your birth certificate (assuming he’s on it), and his death certificate. You can usually replace any of those documents through the original issuing state’s vital records department if you don’t have them immediately handy.
Cool, it appears that I need a copy of the death certificate. Is that county-specific, or just a statewide database?
I have a title to his car that still says "Heir Estate of Father". Would something like that be sufficient, or would you still recommend the death certificate?
Most of the state unclaimed property departments also ask for a certified copy of the document called "letters testamentary" that was issued to the executor or administrator of the estate when it was probated. If the attorney was actually the executor, you can contact him and ask him to file the claim for the unclaimed property and he can get a copy of his letters testamentary from the county courthouse probate court if he doesn't have a copy already in his personal files.
If you want to, you can contact the Unclaimed Property department now to ask them if they would prefer for the executor to file the claim. The executor would be the only person authorized legally to distribute the monies to the correct heir.
