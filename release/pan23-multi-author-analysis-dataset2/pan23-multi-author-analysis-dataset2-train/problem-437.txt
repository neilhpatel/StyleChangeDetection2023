Do you think that doctor and everyone in the facility should be exposed to COVID because you can’t wear a mask? Your rights don’t stand in a vacuum. The rest of the world has rights too.
There don’t appear to be any violations or problems here. You’ll need to find a provider who is willing to work with you.
The ADA requires that the provider make reasonable accommodations for you. Potentially exposing themselves and all their other patients to COVID isn’t a reasonable accommodation. They don’t have to see you without a mask.
Could be exposed - it’s an unknown. If I have no symptoms and have no interactions then how is that risk to others any greater or more important than the known risk of cervical cancer or an untreated ear infection? Why is my health less important than the slim chance that I might unknowingly have Covid even though I have no symptoms and have not been around anyone with Covid or Covid symptoms?
Your health is not less important than mine. But you don’t get to choose to take on risk for the rest of us. Even if that is based on a disability.
It is a reasonable accommodation- as stated by the ADA. Do you think that it’s right that both my child and I should be denied care because I can’t wear a mask? Even if none of us have symptoms, nor have we been around anyone with symptoms? This is absolutely a violation.
