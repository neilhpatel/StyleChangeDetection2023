5. What is considered as defimation? They contacted my job and my college and the police, all of whom after investigating have concluded the messages I sent were not sexual, a sexual advance, or innapropriate. However the discord staff has still banned me permantly and is standing by their accusations that I sent predatory messages and that I am a danger to the community. The only thing I have lost is friendships and now several people in the server geniuely believe I am a predator, a very serious allegation which damages my reputation and trust with many others on the server.
"this message is predatory and this guy is a creep" is not strictly defamatory, and proving defamation per se in MI is going to be time consuming and expensive.
Again, what allegations? A "sexual advance"? What specifically is your school accusing you of, if anything?
They did report it to the school. However they already investigated it and deemed my comments not predatory, sexual, or innapropriate in any way. But the server still stands by the allegations and is continuing to tell others about it.
Further, defamation consists of untrue statements of facts, not opinion. Stating that your messages were inappropriate is almost certainly protected opnion.
