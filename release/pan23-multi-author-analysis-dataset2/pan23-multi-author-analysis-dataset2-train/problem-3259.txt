Your wife needs to use her days off, sick time, or fmla if applicable. If she does not have these options then yes she could be terminated and they could say it's because she is not showing up. If she cannot take time off, you should do so or find someone else to care for your son.
This is the right answer. My wife has worked in HR for years and unfortunately the laws are not to good when it comes to this kind of stuff. FMLA offers time off for caring for a sick child but you have to work a specific number of hours before that option is available.
Unfortunately Illinois has no laws providing employees with protected leave for this situation, and unless your child is actually ill with Covid and receiving medical treatment, it won't qualify for FMLA leave. Unless her employer opted in to the extension of the (which became optional instead of mandatory at the end of 2020), her leave for that reason will likely be unprotected and her employer can legally discipline or terminate her for taking leave.
I know you said that you can't take time off, but you really should consider splitting the time with your wife to make it fair to your wife and reduce the amount of time she has to be away from work. To answer your question, yes they can fire her as long as it's not discriminating against her for a protected reason (because she is pregnant, gender......etc).
