They don't really have human capital to extract those natural resources themselves, though. Due to most of them being uneducated and not skilled at capital technologies. The trick is to have western companies help you extract resources, use the split revenue gained from western companies, and use it to invest in your country. Get a skilled population, that way in the future you can take over the manufacturing for yourself. That's what the rich Arab nations did. And several other Asian countries. That's what Norway did.
The issue is a bit more complicated. Africa is huge for one, and viewing it as a monolith is a common mistake. Lacking human capital is also half true, educated people are often offered better and more stable jobs overseas. Why be a professor in a country that can’t pay you on time. So there’s a serious brain drain and general lack of opportunity over large areas mean that rural areas are left to languish. So any opportunity is welcome, even if it’s an ecological disaster, its a way out.
when ever i read about african countries around the equator, i always wonder how they have 1billion GDP with national resources being worth multi trillions.
