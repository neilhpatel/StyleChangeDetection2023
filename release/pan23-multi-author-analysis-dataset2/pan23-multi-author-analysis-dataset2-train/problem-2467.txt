Will I get in trouble for holding the cat hostage and telling her to break my door down even though she threatened me first before I told her to break the door down because I wasn't scared of her?

I realized I was in the wrong for keeping the cat but I did it because I got permission from the other half because it was 50/50 custody. I felt justified because she was using the cat and threatening to send it to the pound indicating she didn't care about the cat nor did she want it. I talked to my magistrate and he told me they wouldn't count that against me because its what I thought was right.
