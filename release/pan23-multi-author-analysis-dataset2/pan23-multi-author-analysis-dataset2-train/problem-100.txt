I doubt working in a lab qualifies him as an agricultural worker, but it's a good question. If he was, they wouldn't owe him any kind of OT at all until 45 hours a week or 9 hours a day (until 2022, at minimum; those wages and laws are slowly being brought to parity with all other workers). See IWC Wage Order 14-2001.
If your brother wants pay and the employer refuses to pay after he discusses this with the correct person, he can file a .
I added a question in my post (specifically about whether or not he's working for the government, because that could be very relevant), and /u/UsuallySunny has some important clarifications as well, such as the comp time perhaps having to be 1.5 times the number of overtime hours (though overtime laws for bona fide "agricultural workers" might be slightly different -- the question being whether your brother is or not).
Assuming your brother is classified as non-exempt, the employer cannot do this without the written agreement of the employee, and if the employee agrees, it must be at the same rate as overtime, time and a half. Additionally, your brother can't have more than 240 hours of PTO. ().
