You need to read your lease carefully to see what it says about modifications, windows, etc. Anything that could generally cover this. She may be within her rights even without such language, but check the lease. If you're month to month then you have less protection, when does your lease expire?
Iâ€™m on a month to month lease right now. Iâ€™ve been here 2 years. She did modify the lease to say we canâ€™t have actual window ACâ€™s. But she said we could have portable ones that have like an AC hose that pull in air. But now sheâ€™s saying we canâ€™t have the hose part in the window. So what is it???
Yea she re-wrote the lease when she started. I was fine with that and complied but now sheâ€™s saying I canâ€™t have a vent in my window. So Iâ€™m just HOT ðŸ¥µ.
Where are you located? Some states (though not many, I believe) have tenant protection laws that would give you the right to cool your unit to a certain temp, but I suspect you're not in one. Still, a lot of scuzzy landlords cheerfully break laws like that knowing that most residents will never push back, so it's worth checking.
It doesn't look like California mandates any sort of functioning air conditioning, unless it was part of the provided appliances/furnishings when you moved in. It's possible that your city/county might have more protections, but that's well beyond my google fu, I'm afraid. Your landlord IS required to provide "sufficient ventilation", but I don't know precisely what that entails; the best you may be able to do is just set up a swamp cooler with some box fans. (You should be able to google instructions for that pretty easily.).
