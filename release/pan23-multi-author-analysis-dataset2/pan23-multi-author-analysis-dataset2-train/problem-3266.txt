Newsweek is not a reputable source. Not since it was acquired by a cult. Please report all Newsweek submissions as misinformation.
> For half a century, Newsweek was owned by the Washinon Post and was a well-respected voice in American journalism. In 2010, the Post sold Newsweek to 91-year-old businessman Sidney Harman; Harman bought it for $1 and assumption of its liabilities. Ownership turned over a few more times, from Harman to Barry Diller. Diller regretted his purchase and sold Newsweek in 2014 to a group called International Business Times Media. IBTM changed its name to Newsweek Media Group. Its owners were tied to a small Christian college (Olivet University) led by a charismatic Korean pastor, David Jang. Jang also was founder of a cult called “The Community,” according to this report in Mother Jones.
Its almost like if you release murderers from Russia's hellish prison system, they will continue to murder.. and there is no love lost on the people who held them there in the first place.
