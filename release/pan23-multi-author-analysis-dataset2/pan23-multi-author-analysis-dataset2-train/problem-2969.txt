It sounds like you're liable for the damages to this person's vehicle, and guilty of distracted driving and potentially DUI.
Does this mean you don't have insurance to repair your own vehicle? You should open a claim with your insurance and allow them to repair the other person's car. And if you don't have collision coverage you'll be on the hook for the repairs to your own.
I obviously would not tell the police I was drinking and looking at my phone, but yes I do have victims coverage, I don’t have coverage of my own, but the damages aren’t THAT bad. Just a minor set back.
That's a difficult thing to recommend. Obviously there are some serious risks in that. There is more risk in being caught looking like someone who kept running.
Should I still continue the claim for the incident? I really am just extremely naive. I didn’t know I was supposed to file a police report unless someone was injured.
The main thing I’m wondering is if the best option, is for me to just go back to the place it happened, and just explain and swap insurance.
