My dude has become the best gift Democrats could ask for, and even though my better judgment wants him criminally punished and barred from office I’m not complaining if he wants to stick around and keep being the cinder block chained to the GOP’s collective necks. His brand has become a perennial electoral bottleneck for Republicans; it wins handily in primary contests where pluralities get nominated, but then there’s no growth, no broad appeal in the generals, and he and his candidates just keep eating dogshit. This is the worst case scenario for them, a parasite they can’t evacuate who’s tangibly and persistently bleeding them dry.
His magic is dead, and if Republicans are so void of ideas or vision that they really want to try it again for a fourth election cycle in a row then God by all fucking means please have at it.
His entire sense of self-worth is a Jenga tower and admitting to himself that he lost and there was no conspiracy against him would be like him bumping the table with his knee. It's always going to be someone else's fault.
