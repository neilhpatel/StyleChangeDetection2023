They can't make you vacate for the photos, but they are likely within their rights to take pictures of the dwelling. You should indeed put away personal items to include family photos; there's nothing to stop you from draping a cloth over things like your television and other expensive electronics.
If your landlord wants to take photos- usually allowed with notice. However, I doubt he can ask you to vacate the property for a few hours if you don't want to.
They cannot, however, force you to clean, nor can they force you to leave the premises. They also cannot force you to be kind or helpful to the people coming through. Many good landlords will offer to compensate tenants for cleaning, and for leaving during tours, but they are not obligated to do so.
NAL, but in my experience unless you have specifically negotiated otherwise in your lease, its considered reasonable for a landlord to take pictures or hold showings for the purpose of selling/renting the unit. They must give you notice, but it looks like they have done that.
