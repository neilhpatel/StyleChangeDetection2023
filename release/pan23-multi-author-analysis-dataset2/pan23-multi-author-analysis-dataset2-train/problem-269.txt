Maybe this is really how different sections of Machu Pichu have been built up over the centuries? Maybe the tourists will get bored and start in on some new sections.
A few years ago, a friend went there; and they weren't able to go visit the actual site because of a bus-driver strike.
Following r/travel it looks like that the only way to leave Machu Pichu at the moment is a full day hike to a town where you might drive to Cuzco, where the airport might reopen today. So to leave Machu Pichu you have to pass: a railway that has been damaged, a road with road blocks, and an airport that is closed. This just to reach Lima, not even to exit Peru.
Couldn’t even find coca tea bags in Lima, but found the locals market with huge bags of fresh leaf and the good lepita in Cuzco within a couple days and really enjoyed chomping my way through the rest of the trip. A tour guide and a native relative confirmed that it’s generally viewed similar to chewing tobacco in the US, a country bumpkin habit - but I enjoyed it a lot (all the good aspects of coke (though in a subtle way) without the bad (aside from the inability of getting to sleep early if you chew in the evening).
