Well you see, when you're the smartest person in the room and your Uncle went to MIT ... did I tell you about my Uncle and how smart he was? It's the genes you see it runs in the family, well anyway when you're the smartest guy, great intelligence, you know I passed that cognitive test with flying colors, even now I can remember all the answers, would you like to hear them? Oh, yeah I guess those Army guys said something, but since they weren't from the fantastic new Space Force I created, I knew they didn't know what they were talking about. Can you believe they even thought those voting machines weren't rigged?
