> The ADA requires that all medical information about a particular employee be stored separately from the employee's personnel file, thus limiting access to this confidential information. An employer may store all medical information related to COVID-19 in existing medical files. This includes an employee's statement that he has the disease or suspects he has the disease, or the employer's notes or other documentation from questioning an employee about symptoms.
In the same article section B.7, what would be the consequences if an employer or supervisor would communicate the reason for leave?
But you insulted me by assuming that I think my colleagues are idiots. Why not post the source from where you got your information so I can read into it?
I didn't "assume" anything. I simply said they weren't. They will figure it out if someone is suddenly gone for 10+ days and they are informed of a COVID exposure.
Because your employer, unless it is also your health care provider, insurer, or a related entity, is not a in the first place.
