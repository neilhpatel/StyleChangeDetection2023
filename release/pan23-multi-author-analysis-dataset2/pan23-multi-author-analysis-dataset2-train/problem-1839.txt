This whole thing has been a massive, crushing, on-the-record demonstration for Trump that the people of America no longer wish him to have anything to do with their country. He's always thought he was a maker of kings and this was a very humiliating public confirmation that everything he touches turns to shit. I wonder if he'll finally get the message or whether he'll just up his dose of Adderall or whatever and get right back to his delusions.
