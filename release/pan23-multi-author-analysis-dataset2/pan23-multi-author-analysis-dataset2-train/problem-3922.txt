Look - danish people hate him. He is In Sweden now, because he applied for Swedish citizenship and now has dual citizenship. We, The Danes, did not like him, so he left. This is the act of one deranged person and does by no mean represent danish views on religion. His political party did in fact NOT get elected to our parliament. They did not receive the required amount of votes, because Danes knows he is a attention seeking loony. This is taken out of nothing and blown out of proportion. I don’t know where you are from - I’m pretty sure you a couple of anti democratic loonies too. This just happens to be on of ours.
I did not know that. He did go awfully quiet after the election though to reappear across the sea with our Swedish neighbors. I would never do acts like these. It’s so crazy. Not only do I generally find them wrong but I would also be so afraid for my own safety. It’s unwise to piss on religion.
He’s just an attention whore. He left Denmark because he didn’t get any attention any longer. Now of course he gets attention by the Swedes especially since we have a bigger immigration population than Denmark.
Just as a clarification, he got citizenship because his dad is Swedish. So it wasn't exactly through naturalization.
My guess is that he probably got it when he was born, but because Denmark didn't allow double citizenship until a few years ago, he lost it and now he got it again.
Leader is a mighty big word for someone who failed so hard to get elected that he ran away to Sweden to try his luck there.
