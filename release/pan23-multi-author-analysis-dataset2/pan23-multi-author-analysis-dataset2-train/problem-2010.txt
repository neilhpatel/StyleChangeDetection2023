You can either go through your insurance and hope they subrogate and collect your deductible back with it or you can sue her in small claims for the damage.
Why would I have this person's insurance information otherwise? Please kindly have their insurance accept liability so we can all move on with our lives.
always call the police right away when someone hits your car, even if the person is being nice and they admit fault . I learned that the hard way. People will act nice/cooperative but will stiff you in the end if you aren't careful. I'm fixing to get a dash cam kit with a huge battery so that it runs all night in parking mode where I live. You should do the same, black Friday is right around the corner.
I live in MA. When I got rear-ended with minor but visible damage, I just drove to the police station and filled out a report. No need to bring a policeman out to the scene. It was the state police in that case because it was a state-owned road, otherwise it would be the local jurisdiction.
