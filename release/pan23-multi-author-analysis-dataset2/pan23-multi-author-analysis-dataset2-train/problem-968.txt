I guess that's true, it could always be worse. Just makes you wonder who else they are doing this to, I got lucky and caught it but I'm sure other folks out there miss it and are being charged for something they don't know about.

Title: Amazon forcing customer into free trial, then reactivating the subscription after it has been cancelled during the free trial period.
Ultimately it’s a no harm situation as you are refunded. It’s quite likely the cancellation didn’t process vs them intentionally wanting you to hope you didn’t notice a minor charge recurring. If this was effecting a large amount of customers, then it’d be something. There’s nothing to do about what possibly can happen in the future unless you want to cut all ties with Amazon.
This is likely not Amazon. Someone has compromised your account. Contact Amazon Support to have this cancelled and refunded. They may walk you through securing your account, but they also have a guided process for that under Account -> Accounts and Logins.
