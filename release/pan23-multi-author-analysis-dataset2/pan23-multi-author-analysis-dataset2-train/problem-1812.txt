They‚Äôd have definitely made similar levels of money too. Instead the spend billions every year on various things like political bribes and astroturfing organizations to promote fossil fuels.
You know, if they had just invested in renewables back in the 1970‚Äôs when they first learned about their role in anthropogenic climate change like they should have, they could be leading the market today and everyone would love them for having done the right thing. Alas, here we are. But of course the real problem is inflation. /s.
Aren't they? No worries about securing energy bc we're completely moving away from local renewables and focusing completely on what made us so rich with it's instability, I mean oil stable üòÅ.
If they'd just invested all the money they spent fighting green energy they'd control basically all energy generation in the world.
Now they‚Äôre trying to push hydrogen as the next big thing. Guess who else produces and uses tremendous amounts of hydrogen? The fossil fuel industry to refine oils.
Where do I buy stocks in guillotine manufacturing? I have a feeling they're about to see record profits too...
