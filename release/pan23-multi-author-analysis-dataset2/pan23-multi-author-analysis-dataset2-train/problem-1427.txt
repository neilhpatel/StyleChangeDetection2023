Its almost as if Republican politics, only benefit themselves and no on else... maybe politics and elections dont actually benefit the rest of the country, no wonder only like 40% even vote... we're on our own anyway.
You and I both know that Chistie on that beach is the single most iconic moment in NJ politics. You could say that Chris Christie is larger than life.
His first term was bi-partisan focused and honestly pretty great. He worked with Obama to roll out a well executed Sandy Recovery. He put a damper on runaway property taxes that were really weighing down on the middle class. As a result, he won 60-38 as an R in NJ.
His second term was.. uh... really fucking bad. Bad enough to end his political career outright. The second his eyes shifted to national races he lost his shit.
