Granted, mom should follow proper eviction procedure to evict her son but from a practical standpoint, what is it that your boyfriend expects out of this?
Does he want to continue to stay in the house until she properly evicts him? Then he'd have an eviction on his record which makes renting extremely difficult. Renting at 19 is already going to be difficult.
Does he want to sue his mom for the illegal eviction? If he wins, does he win in the long run? He's 19 and his mom is angry at him now. She may not be angry at him in the near future. Suing someone will likely make them angry at you for a long time. He's 19, he probably may need to rely on mom's support in the near future more than she will need to rely on him. If he burns that bridge, he might not get support in a time of need.
Then there is the logistics about this. He's not going to get into court tomorrow about this and it all be settled. It could take weeks or months (in the case of COVID and landlord tenant actions, it's likely going to take months) to sort this out.
We want to look for an an apartment but timing is really hard… if we had a little more time then we would be fine even enough time for him to get a new job but she’s not giving him that time. His mom doesn’t really help him out with anything either so..
