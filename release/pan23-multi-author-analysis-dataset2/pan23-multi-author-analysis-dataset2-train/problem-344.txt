You really need to get a consultation with a lawyer in your area. Trying to have us (people you can't trust to know the law in your state) "walk" you through a divorce is a recipe for folly.
I didn't say to hire an attorney. I said to get a consultation with one. As in pay for an hour or so of their time so they can advise you how to best proceed.
You say you "had to relocate" in the past tense, but that you are "hoping to relocate" in the future tense. Your posting history suggests you have moved to Canada and there is an active physical custody dispute for at least one minor child.
Is your spouse still a Washinon State resident ? Have you already filed for the divorce in the Washinon State county you lived in with them ? There is no lenh of residency requirement for a Washinon divorce filing.
That may be a very high number because you present as difficult to work with, or because you have an international custody and immigration case to handle as well.
I understand that this is difficult and just so you are aware yes it is international I left but he has my child so I am needing to relocate her. I know this is difficult and not nieve to the amount of work it will take I am just looking for advice as I feel like I can't have been the only one to go through this. Thanks for the reply I know Reddit isn't for legal advice but I was more just hoping people could say here read this RCW and see if it applies or here's a link to some information that helped me.
Nobody on Reddit or in most low-cost legal services clinics can walk you through a divorce that includes that many factors.
One of the better legal advice sources online is LawHelp.org, which runs a couple dozen state-specific legal assistance websites under their framework and portal.
"read the RCW and interpret it" is literally why people go to law school and take the bar exam. It's fun for amateurs or people sparring with their landlord but is too risky when your marriage, assets, and child are on the line.
