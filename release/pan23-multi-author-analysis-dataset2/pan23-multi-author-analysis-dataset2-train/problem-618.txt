The bbb is for consumer complaints and has no authority over workplace disputes. The law isnâ€™t made for revenge. OSHA is correct for Ppe.
Is there any way to go through the labor board anonymously? I filled out the form and it made me put my name at the end so I scrapped it.
No i'm not owed money. I always called him out when he messed up my paycheck and he acted like it was an accident and fixed it. I'm talking about all the other labor laws he breaks. And god why am I being downvoted to death??? I don't get it. I explained why I wanted the report to be anonymous so bad. I didn't want to be counter sued into the dirt plus he scares me to death. I just want a better work environment for my ex coworkers without him finding out who got the labor board involved but they make you put your name. When there were boxes to check going through the labor board form that showed which laws he was breaking I checked over THIRTY boxes. But once i had to put my name I just couldn't do it. I was too scared.
I'm not doing it for revenge. I'm doing it for my ex coworkers who are still stuck in that hell hole. They deserve to have their lunches and breaks. They deserve to be treated better. They deserve a safe work environment. They deserve so much better and I figure by reporting him for all the laws he breaks it will improve the lives of my previous coworkers.
I did report him to CalOSHA because they do work with toxic chemicals like formaldehyde, venomous animals, bleach as well as other hazardous chemicals such as test kits that contain highly toxic compounds.
