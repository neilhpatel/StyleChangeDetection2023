In addition to the thread already linked by u/kdfsjljklgjfg, I would also like to highlight my older answer , which explains why some modern scholars (including the world's most prominent authority on Sparta) believe that Sparta wasn't really all that militarised to begin with. When we look at Sparta, we're not looking at a society that minmaxed on militarism but didn't get the expected result. We're actually looking at a fairly ordinary Greek society that was the subject of much myth-making by outsiders because of a few notable achievements (mainly internal political stability). I cannot speak for all of history, but my baseline assumption is that something similar will apply to other societies that have traditionally been pigeonholed as "military cultures". Did such cultures ever really exist?
Now that I think about it, that's an excellent addition to my original question. Not just, "Were there any successful military cultures?" but, "Were there any genuine military cultures?".
That kind of depends on definition I'd feel. The Warring States basically put the competitors on a war footing, or a "total war" style mobilization. But even then, there were cultural pursuits, huge monuments and palaces, religious rituals, etc. So I'd argue that China wasn't a "military culture" or "minmaxed military power", just state(s) that had been under prolonged and increasingly heavy military mobilization. Certainly neither the Qin nor the rest of China did what popular image painted Sparta or say Klingons, which is everything done for the military and nothing else.
