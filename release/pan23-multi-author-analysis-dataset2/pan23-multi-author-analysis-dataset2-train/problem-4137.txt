I assume he got his Social Security number because things were undoubtedly looser in the 80s, especially before the internet became much more mainstream.
He has the Social Security number? And he has the Social Security card? Why does he believe that information is in accurate? (Also has it occurred to him that his mother made up this whole story?).
It is valid. I'll mention that he got a S.S. sometime during his teenage years. He says back then you didn't have to get a S.S. upon birth like you do today. I know that the first 3 numbers determine when and where the number was received but that likely doesn't apply here since he received his well after he was born.
Despite that issue, I haven't considered that angle. This is a new situation for me, so how do I go about finding the "right" PI?
That would be one cold trail though, no? We are talking to track well over 30 years and in an era before digital copies became mainstream. Anything sooner wouldn't make sense since he knows people that can recall his existence that far.
We both have searched his name numerous times (him much longer than me) and called/visited various county offices. His name shows no record of his birth anywhere in the U.S. (or the world for that matter).
