Depending on the county, you could also be offered a diversion program which would keep the misdemeanor off your record. If you are offered that, you should take it. It's generally a class on a Saturday followed by a period of unsupervised probation -- that means stay out of trouble -- and if you complete it successfully, the case gets dismissed entirely.
You need to speak to a lawyer, do not take advice from the prosecutor and absolutely don't speak to the police any more. This is really location specific because some areas (like SF) have prosecutors that flat out will not prosecute prostitution cases. Others will.
Do not talk to the police, they are not your friends and they are allowed to lie to you. They also don't actually have much (if any) input on what your punishment is. If they try to talk to you again, say you won't speak to them until you get an attorney.
If you can afford a criminal defense attorney, you should get one. If you can't afford one, you can ask for a public defender when you go to court and they will be your attorney. Your attorney can let you know what your options are.
You should speak with a local criminal defense attorney. Most offer free consultations. It really matters on your exact location and what you're charged with.
