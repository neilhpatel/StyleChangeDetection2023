You are getting a lot of comments from people who don't realize that outside of very narrow circumstances, worker's comp is your exclusive remedy against your employer for workplace injuries. You should speak with a worker's comp attorney.
You should have a worker’s comp that you have/will use for all your work-related medical injuries. It may seem like a drawn out process...in some/most cases it is.
In pretty much any other state your post would be the end of the issue. In Texas, Workers Compensation is optional for most private employers and many don't carry it because it's not cheap.
Depending on your state and doctor’s office, you can sometimes see your primary physician regarding your concerns; however you should have the worker’s comp to minimize insurance issues (with respect to your private medical insurance).
Your priority should be about healing and getting yourself in the best physical and mental health to see yourself forward with healing and welcoming the new addition coming to your family.
Better yet, get consultations with several personal injury lawyers. Don't just go with the first guy who promises you money. There's unfortunately a lot of bad PI lawyers out there. Read testimonials and reviews if possible, and ask friends/family for recommendations that they've personally used themselves.
