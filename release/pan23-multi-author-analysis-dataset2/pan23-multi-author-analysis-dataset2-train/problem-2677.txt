Sigh, I've been dating this girl for two years and have spent almost every day of that time with her. Look, i get it, you guys want to look out for the poor schmucks of the world, but I assure you, my girlfriend is real, the agency she works for is real, and this is 100% not a scam. So please, treat the question as legitimate and answer it on those merits, not your assumptions.
To be fair 95% are scams. She can open a bank account in the United States even without being a US citizen. She can probably do it online.
Well, it's certainly not a scam, lol. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 years and have met the head of the travel agency she works for. Now, whether the U.S. government would treat the money as my income is important, if that is true then obviously this won't work. As for my girlfriend trying to avoid any tax obligations, that is also not the case. My understanding is that since she operates out of Colombia, the money is not subject to U.S. tax law, but the reality is she needs to talk to a lawyer to be sure of that.
We've looked into her opening an account and from what I have read it is not so easy to do as you make it, and the banks that use to do it no longer do, or else it is on a branch by branch basis. They usually require you have a U.S. address which she does not. If you know if a good bank though I would love to hear it.
