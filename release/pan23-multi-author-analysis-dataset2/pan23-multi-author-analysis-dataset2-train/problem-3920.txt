Technically, entering what you know is a sham marriage to get military benefits like a housing allowance is illegal. And from what I understand the military is cracking down on it.
If your command catches wind up of this, you’re gonna wind up in big trouble. As your wife, she would have certain legal rights, including making medical and financial decisions. You really need to think about this and not make a really big mistake just because you don’t want to be in the barracks.
You are not smarter than the entire military chain of command, nor your CO nor JAG. Please do not engage in a fake marriage to gain access to government benefits.
This is not only fraud, it's an incredibly stupid reason to get married. Divorce, even uncontested divorce, will end up costing you hundreds if not thousands of dollars in court fees plus a bare minimum of six months to accomplish -- that's assuming you stay on great terms.
If the military finds out you aren't in a bona fide marriage, you could be subject to criminal penalties.
