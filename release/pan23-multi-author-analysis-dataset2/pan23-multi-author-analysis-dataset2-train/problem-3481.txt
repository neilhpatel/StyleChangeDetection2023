Small claims court. Make sure you get written estimates. And list both the bank and the company that they are pointing to in the claim, so both must show up in court instead of giving you the run around.
Your own insurance should be handling this but keep in mind that your insurance premium will go up and it might cost you more than repairing it yourself. Regarding the comment of small claims court- if you are not properly insured they will throw the case out, if you are insured the insurance company gets whatever money you might win FIRST, then you get the remainder so it typically ends up being more than small claims because you have to factor in that you are also suing for the amount of legal fees and time restitution etc. Consider this question- how valuable is your time? Is it worth it financially for you to put so much time effort and stress into some thing that will probably cost you less if you pay for it yourself. Call the Attorney General of your state and ask what your options are.
