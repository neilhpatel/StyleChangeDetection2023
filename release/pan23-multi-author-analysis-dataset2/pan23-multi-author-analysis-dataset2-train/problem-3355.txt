read the HOA rules very carefully do everything you are allowed to make the property more appealing. e.g no-one will buy a lot now; might they buy a dock/boat launch/jet skii lift etc. ? and/or make you lot annoying. Then offer to give it to the people using the other lots regularly, if you're allowed to go BBQ there invite 100 people every weekend (don't break the rules don't commit any crimes) but right now your lot most likely has value in "we have a nice quite street and a nice view just trees and just a boat launch and they pay $500 (or whatever) to our road upkeep a year." The HOA doesn't want your lot because the fees will go up for everyone else (I assume someone is using it because they don't want to dissolve the HOA) may not be as valuable when "there are 100 cars parked on our previously quiet street and there are tacky banner, music, they are eating durian everyday" might just might, turn it into "ok fine we will accept your lots as a common area/Fine I'll buy it for $1".
The lot is surrounded by other empty lots unfortunately and they make it very difficult to combine lots so they can keep collecting dues on each individual lot.
