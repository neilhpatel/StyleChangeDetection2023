I really want them to vote on the 30% consumption tax now because the CBO would have to score it, and show (once again) how stupid the Republican think tanks are.
The very basis of the GOP's position is wrong on every level. This money has already been spent (and a good deal of it was spent under Trump). This is not the right place to have budget negotiations. They should be negotiating spending during the regular budget development process. What they are doing is unethical and it harms the country on so many levels.
They'll say "we have alternative models" and nobody will believe them. The bill will fail and they'll look like idiots again.
The very existence of a debt ceiling is ridiculous. Basically congress tells the president: you should spend x amount of money and raise y amount of taxes, but you can't borrow more than z dollars to fund that spending, even if x-y is more than z.
The fact that congress has repeatedly had these theatrical political showdowns over raising the debt ceiling rather than just outright abolishing it, is as clear a sign as any that our politicians are more interested in playing their political theater than in making common sense policies.
