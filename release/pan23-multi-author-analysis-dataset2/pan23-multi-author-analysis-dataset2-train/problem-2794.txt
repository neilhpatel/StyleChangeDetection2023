Many states participate in a federally funded free lunch program. The schools recieved money from the government to feed the children. But with the pandemic and schools being virtual for most of us last year the money was not used for food. But since it is a federal grant it can only be used for that purpose. The schools then had to get the money to the parents in the form of P-EBT cards so it could be used for food. You did not need to apply or do anything to recieve this, the school handled all that, regardless of your income. Unfortunately it took forever to get all this worked out. The past few weeks parents have just started receiving the cards for the previous school year. If you don't need the money for food then make donations to others in need. But you have done nothing wrong and that grant money rightfully belongs to you and your child.
As others have said, you're not obligated to use it and donating to a food bank is always an option. Many farmers markets also accept EBT cards, which would in turn support local farmers. The 'form with your SSN' was most likely processed and submitted through the school, and there's no 'inappropriate record' of you applying for benefits. Pretty much every family got them.
