It's likely the case that he's waited too long to do anything about this. It's incumbent on him to prove it wasn't abandoned/a gift at this point. Ignore him until he sues.
Have you actually been sued yet? If you are sued you should respond. Until then, you don't have to offer to do anything.
I haven’t been just threatened with a potential suit. I’m just wondering what they would have to prove I guess or how HIS lawyer would look at this to win it. I think the suit would take place in FL too.
How is it racist? The term comes from the white man creating terms with the American Indians and then doing an “Uno reversal card”. The Indian giver was the American government. Not the Indians. Also OP your friend seems like a real ass hat. I’d wait until he sues.
So what information would be required by him and what would I have to prove if it got to that point? I’m trying to understand what he could really tell a judge and what I would be expected to say to defend myself.
If I've read this correctly, it appears as though Georgia has a 5 year limit on abandoned property, in your situation.
