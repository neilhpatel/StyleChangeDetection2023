The book banning is just a stage. They will be rewriting the history books and jailing the truth if allowed to continue.
And that led to a lot of teachers just removing all their books because of the threat. It's basically set up that if a parent finds something objectionable they can have the teacher fired/arrested. I honestly get why the teachers would opt to just remove everything but it's so sad that it's come to this. I expect book burnings in florida and other places soon.
When they ask why Ukraine fights, this is the answer. This is what we reject. This is the future we don't want for our country. We know it, because it's also the past. It just came back after a brief intermission.
It’s clear someone doesn’t understand what is going on. That’s fine, sit this out, but maybe you should work on not displaying your ignorance so freely.
For the people constantly defending the average Russian, and claiming that it's only a matter of time before Putin dies/is overthrown and then Russians will finally be free... please read and digest this. Russia is a deeply fucked place. Humans are capable of being so deeply sick that they can't even see their way out of hell. So glad there was this one young lady that was able to see straight, but the fact that she was denounced by her own classmates shows that the problem is fundamental to the Russian mindset. It's a sickness that we've no idea how to even address.
