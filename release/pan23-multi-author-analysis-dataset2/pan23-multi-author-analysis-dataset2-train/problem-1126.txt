Regardless of how you feel, the nation still requires people to fulfill these roles and in many cases, easing the immigration process and more government oversight will help a lot of this. Aside from that, I don't know what the proper solution is but for you assume that the entire situation is black/white (immigrants are obviously low level employees ready to be exploited vs Americans can fulfill all jobs no matter what even though they arent enough to fill all vacant jobs) says a lot about your life experience. Research birth rates, job growth and labor shortages and start from there. Evne without our declining birth rates, the US has always relied on immigration to fill the labor gap throughout its entire history.
America needs both but its widely known that the US needs more immigrants and has been immigrant dependent on labor for quite a long time now. Even if we paid every single American a fair, livable wage, there would still be a labor shortage without immigrants, legal or illegal.
And the assumption that you think the necessity for immigrants and my advocation for it necessitates an exploitable underclass is laughable. You realize there are a lot of avenues to not have that.. correct? We need the labor, regardless of your opinion and there are humane ways to get there. Don't put words into peoples mouths.
