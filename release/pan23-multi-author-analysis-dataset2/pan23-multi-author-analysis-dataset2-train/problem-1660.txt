Not quite true. For instance, while GA doesn’t recognize CL marriage formed in the state, if your relationship legally “ripened” into a CL marriage in another state and then moved to GA, they recognize it.
Common law marriage is kind of “de facto marriage”. You live together and present yourselves as a couple for a set number of years (typically at least 7) and the courts allow you to be considered “married” and reap the same benefits as a traditionally “legal” married couple.
You still have to agree to be married, live in Texas as husband and wife, and represent yourselves as married to be common law married in Texas. Not sure what outright means in your comment.
No, it's actually quite a few, they use to do them automatic though, now I think none are automatic. Texas for example still has common law marriage, but what they mean is you can do a civil marriage up to 2 years retroactively. That means you can legally fill out forms, like apply for insurance, saying you are a spouse before you do the paperwork, and the paperwork is actually just a simple statement saying you are married.
