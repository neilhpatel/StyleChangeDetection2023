I was also just informed that they were using this same character with art work that had my places name on it to advertise themselves.
The way it was originally explained to me was that i basically had anyone who submitted agree that the characters intent was for public use and thus the artist no longer had rights over the character. They couldn't do anything about it as long as I didn't use any of their art work, which I never have and never will.
The fact that you have your place name on the shirt (or whatever) is close to meaningless. You can’t have a copyright on that, and unless they are using it to confuse customers and sell competing products, you don’t have a trademark claim either.
Exclusive copyrights must be transferred in writing. The most you could get would be a non-exclusive license (and event that is tenuous). Everybody who submitted a character still owns their submissions, and they are 100% able to use the work for their own purposes.
If they never signed anything, how the post was worded could have context. I am no lawyer, but a word of advice for all commercial dealings: contracts.
