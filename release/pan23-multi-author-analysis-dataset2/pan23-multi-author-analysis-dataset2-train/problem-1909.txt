Your children would inherite the house before she would. Parents only get to inherite if there is no spouse, no children and no will. It wouldn't hurt to write a will that states where everything goes in case of the worst happening and you are not there to protect the interests of your children.
She may want to fight it in court, but she'll need a lawyer and the lawyer will want to be paid. A clearly written will will make it clear what your wishes were and who gets what. Maybe leave her something to show it wasn't just a case she was forgotten, you just don't want her taking things that don't belong to her.
If this was a legal adoption, he parents are his grandparents. They would inherit before his bio mother if she terminated her parental rights.
Yes, for example, if fiance died in an accident along with the children but OP survived, then the mother would inherit over the OP in the absence of any will.
Or if just the fiance dies but his nutty mother contests his paternity of the children that his girlfriend gave birth to outside of marriage, then that could be a bit of a headache too, absent a will.
