Plus he's always been a gaffe machine on two legs. I mean, he's not the only one on the Olympic Committee who made boneheaded statements and was sacked for it, but still, his idiocy was pretty memorable.
Dudes not wrong, i don't support what russia is doing.. But there's no version of this where russia decides to lose.
What else is there to say apart from point to the prideful maniac in charge of the russians and wait for ppl to make the observation that I've already pointed out.
Putin remembers all too well the consequences of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, which demonstrated that the Soviet machine was not invincible even when trying to subjugate a country next to then. Within years, the Soviet Union fell. Granted, there were other factors, but the Russian people do not reward the leaders who fail them.
Or Nikita Khrushchev and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Only 2 years later, after a very public embarrassment and US victory, was he forced to step down.
What is likely to happen is that Russian losses will become so bad and embarrassing that Putin will find a scapegoat and declare it was some other thing that caused them to fail. Traitors, incompetent generals, western spies.
