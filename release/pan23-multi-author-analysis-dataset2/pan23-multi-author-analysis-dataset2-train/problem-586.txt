No, it wasn't. Although there's a persistent myth that connects it to the 18th century erotic novel _Fanny Hill_, the first known attestations of the term in a vulgar sense are from some music hall songs from the late 1830s, several decades after the publication of Mansfield Park. Although even a half-century later it's still apparently considered just an innocent name even in pornographic contexts, as Spedding and Lambert argue:
sexual connotation in the _late_-nineteenth century, it is likely that many conventional writers in this period were completely unaware that _fanny_ carried a sexual meaning.
Huh, I'd always assumed Fanny Hill was called that because fanny was a dirty word at the time and that the title deliberately implied the pubic mound. It's funny that one of the most famous erotic novels in English has a name that's now understood as a dirty pun purely by coincidence.
Fanny did remain a popular name well into the 20th century. If you look at those many websites that have name statistics culled from census data it seems it in the USA before dropping off to virtually nothing around 1940. In the UK, according to the statistics compiled, it was the 69th most popular name for newborn girls in 1900.
