Well, you could pay the tow fees. Or, your insurance could. Has your car been deemed a total loss? I'm guessing so, if the accident was a bad one.
Typically, your insurance company is having your car remains "held" by a local junkyard, with the understanding that they'll probably get to keep it once it is deemed a total loss. You should be speaking with your insurance agent about the towing fees and the status of your car, and stress to the agent that you have personal belongings from the car that you need to collect before they scrap it.
Did you have insurance? If you had insurance, you shouldn't be contacting the junkyard / mechanic at all - You should be calling your insurance agent. They are the ones that typically handle the arrangement with the junkyard that has your car.
Oh yeah itâ€™s a complete loss, It rolled over twice! So I would have to pay to get it out and a place to trash it, also transportation to get I there. If I leave the car it would have no cost to me.
ETA: Looking in your post history, I see and . So, I'm going to take a wild guess at this and say that you're uninsured and/or at fault in the accident. You also seemingly bought a new car two days after crashing your old car, but you waited another 12 days after that to inquire about your old car.
If that's the case, then you should probably see if you can cut a deal with the junkyard - Tell them they can have the car if you can get your crap out of it. Given the bill you've racked up, they might say "no," in which case you're probably SOL. You could get an attorney - you can sue over anything - but that cost will likely exceed the items you're attempting to recover.
And to add to this, if you don't deal with the yard they will auction off your car to recoup the costs and could still come after you for the remainder. Ignoring this is only going to cost you more down the road.
