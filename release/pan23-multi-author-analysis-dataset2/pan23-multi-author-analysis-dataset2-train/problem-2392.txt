I think it's entirely fair to be excited to see these despicable individuals tear each other down, with hopes it may play to the democrats' benefit. I'm no fan of Biden but can you imagine DeSantis as president? Or trump again?
Yikes. Nothing affiliated with either one of them should be described as fantastic unless itâ€™s them being delivered swift justice.
Also, while I don't think DeSantis could hold his own in a direct feud with Trump, he can probably get to the nomination without having to do so. He's got the machinery of the state of Florida to arrange a sham prosecution or investigation or whatever other stupid strong-man stunt he needs and he'll just do that to change the subject every time Trump's trash talking starts to have an impact on headlines.
Seriously though, this reads as excitement for Trump schooling DeSantis. Is this really where the three-ringed circus has landed us?
Beyond all that - whether it's Trump or DeSantis who takes the nomination, we're in serious danger. Either would be a disaster for the country and after 2016 nobody should ever think a candidate is too crazy to win ever again.
