Sure, this is public record. Some details will be redacted, such as his date of birth, and if you are named as a victim you will be identified by your initials.
You can search “name of your county+Texas+court records” and learn how to request the information. Make sure you are looking at a government website, not a for-profit website.
You will want to request the charging document and the judgment. You don’t need a certified copy. There will be a small fee.
Thank you so much. You’ve been a huge help. I searched the cases, but unfortunately, I was unable to find it. Perhaps I was lied to about there being a case at all.
I’ve already done all of those things (and have been for the past year plus) and I can’t do the last two because it appears there were no official charges.
I work at a courthouse and we have people calling all the time searching for cases. Give the clerks office a call in the county you used to live in and see if they can look up the case number for you. Then you will have better luck finding the records online.
