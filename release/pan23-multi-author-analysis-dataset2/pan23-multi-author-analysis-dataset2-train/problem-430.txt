Mostly just really sad. Romance scams are huge, and just last week she started working on a case where a woman wired 180,000 to a guy in India and of course she never heard from him again. She is 71 and that was all of her savings.
She is also working a lot of moving company scams that are run out of India. Generally these are cross country moves or moves across state lines. They will hold your stuff for ransom and tell you they will return it if you pay them whatever amount, but in reality they just go sell your stuff and take your money.
They have people in America that they've either conned into doing work for them, or they are just bad people stealing from Americans.
In many cases, the (bad) people in America get to keep the goods, and the ransom money is sent to India where it will never be recovered.
Actually that's an extremely common tactic by many scammers, they make themselves intentionally easy to spot, so they don't waste time scamming someone who may wise up. If anyone falls for them then, they know this person is 100% certified gullible as shit, and can scam to their heart's content.
Had one girl call me and pretend to be from police. Easy to spot really, why would someone from Latvian police start conversation in russian with ukrainian accent.
They’re pretty common here in western Canada, except it’s Chinese callers going after new immigrants. It’s at the point where we joke about getting a call from “our Chinese mistress” when one of the calls comes in at work.
Or else their visa is about to expire if they don’t pay up or similar. My partner is Chinese, so I handed her the phone once asking what it was about. That one was a visa scam.
