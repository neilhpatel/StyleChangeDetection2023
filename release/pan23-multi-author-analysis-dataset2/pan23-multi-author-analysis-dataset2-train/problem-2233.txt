The west made it clear they can buy all "Russian oil" under their 60$ price. What is so surprising about this since a whole month ago? This was expected.
No no no no. Nah uh. See we’re buying Indian oil. How can we possibly know where India got the oil from?
Would be hilarious if it turns out that India and Russia have secret agreement to share those profits - and Russia is selling their oil on that condition.
The price cap policy is intended to maintain the supply of Russian oil to the global market while reducing the revenues the Russian Federation earns from its oil sales, particularly in light of elevated prices caused by Russia’s war of choice. To accomplish this goal, the EU and the other countries in the Price Cap Coalition designed the price cap to maintain the flow of Russian oil at a discounted price.
Are you suggesting it may actually have just been a thinly transparent ruse by the US to act as though they are taking a principled stand with Ukraine while at the same time funding the Russian army with petrol-dollars? There is no way the US could be that brash and unscrupulous, could they?
It’s like when your cousin Danny brings home brand new speakers that he bought from someone who says the speakers fell out of the back of a truck. No laws broken here. /shrug.
