I don't really know how much racism is tied to this dynamic. I'm sure there are some people who view things through race. I just think in general, people who are more inclined to be motivated by the morals of caring and fairness are likely going gravitate to Democrat party messaging and policies. People that are more motivated by liberty, local community loyalty and self determination are likely going to be more accepting of GOP type messaging. I'd imagine that what is happening with US citizens of Hispanic heritage is they are more and more gravitating to ideas that are more commonly seen in conservative voters. Add to this that there is a lot of diversity within what is labeled the Hispanic community and you'll get a big variety of voters. Its kind of working like we want - diverse populations, diverse views, we all learn from each other... It is kind of a hopeful development honestly.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
