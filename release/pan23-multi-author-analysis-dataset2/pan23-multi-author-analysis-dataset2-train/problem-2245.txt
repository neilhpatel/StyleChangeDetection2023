Yeah then it's probably time to go to a CPFB or regulator to go "above" the bank. It's a shame that they are siding with the merchant here - most banks will usually side with the customer with any reasonable explanation. Sadly if this doesn't get resolved you are liable for it, so I'd keep escalating within the bank. Ask them for an appeals process, etc.
Except the porch part. We live in an apartment building and someone managed to sign for it while we are not home. Crazy.
It would be very unusual for a bank to side with a merchant unless they have a ton of proof. Was this something that was fraudulently ordered and then picked up by the alleged criminals? I’m trying to figure out how they had proof of delivering it to you if you weren’t involved at all.
So to recap, someone stole your credit card, ordered something to your house, which was then delivered via fedex and you never saw this package at all? i.e, it was then taken from your porch before you had a chance to return home? I'd take this up again with your bank and make sure they understand the situation at hand - it's not that you're denying that a shipment was recieved at your address (because both you and they "agree" on that) you're denying that YOU made the charge. I have a feeling it's communication difficulties...
