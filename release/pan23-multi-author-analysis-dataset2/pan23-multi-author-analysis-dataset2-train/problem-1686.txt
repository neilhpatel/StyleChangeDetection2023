No but honestly discussions need to be had. If you want your “even an accident will be considered an attack on NATO soil” to hold weight you have to hold your allies accountable. Fact of the matter is they are claiming the actions of a non NATO country led to the death of NATO civilians on NATO soil. Our allies must hold themselves accountable. It’s a messy situation.
Well they should, its a non-nato country that attacked a fellow nato country. Article 5 needs to be enacted. Funny how when people thought it was Russia they were basically screaming article 5. So much hypocrisy.
Well, no, that’s not what happened at all. Ukraine was attempting to defend itself from Russian missiles, and a Ukrainian defensive missile accidentally landed on Polish soil. They didn’t attack shit.
And none of this would’ve happened if the Russians weren’t attacking. Criminals are held liable for injuries and deaths that occur during the commission of a felony, even if they didn’t directly inflict said harm themselves. The Russians are the criminals here, if they want this to be avoided they can walk their happy asses out of Ukraine. It’s super easy, the border is literally right there.
