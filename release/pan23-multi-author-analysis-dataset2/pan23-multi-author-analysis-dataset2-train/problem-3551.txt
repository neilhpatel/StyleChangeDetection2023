The opposite with me, I had a dealership do this. I told them I would not go in and it’s not my problem. I could fax or email a copy of the contract and they said no, I had to go in and sign. They threatened to repo my car via text from the manager so I laughed and said I had all the information I needed to go to a lawyer if they took my car. I got called from the actual district manager who apologized and sent a driver 2 hours to my place of work, I told them they had to come during a 2 hour window and if they missed it by a minute, I wouldn’t sign or even greet the driver. They sent the driver and the new contract had a different price by a few cents. I was petty at this point. I called the DM and They told me to just sign and they would amend, I told them no and they can send a new driver with a new contract but now I would want it cheaper or else again, I’m not signing.
Yeah, take a copy of your copy of the contract, hand them it and say “this is the contract we signed”, and leave. Hell, I’d just be mailing it to them.
They already sound shady, and I wouldn't be surprised that if OP takes the original copy, it will somehow go missing.
