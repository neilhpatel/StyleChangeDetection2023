This is my disclaimer saying I'm not a lawyer or financial expert but if I would to give a guess I would say it might be a part of an investment deal but without more info it's just conjecture. As for the effects on the lower ranks that's just taking a shot out in the dark.

Title: My company wants us to vote on converting shares - what does this mean for me as an employee?
This is a pretty good description of what the difference is but essentially it boils down to ordinary shares have a bit of voting power equal to its stake in the company and so dividends. While preference has no voting power but like the name implies it has preference with dividends. If your company boss is trying you get you to convert your shares itmeans that he/she wants more centralized control at the cost of more money going out.
