I appreciate the information. We have called every time for the past few months, but it has gotten to the point where the animal control employees are tired of us.
I’d call animal services each time it happens. If your neighbors don’t care about rules, I’d bet their dogs aren’t even registered with the local municipality.
No, but you can call the police/animal control EVERY time they are on your property and threatening. Have you checked into your areas leash laws to cite each time you call?
Nothing has been done on their end at the time of this post, but they are making us fill out a specific form that needs notarized each time we have a complaint. The form needs submitted in person each time, and we just can't do this multiple times a week every week due to the need for a notary each time and then the 30+ minute drive to the office to submit it to animal control.
You can try going down to the office and talking to a supervisor of what they need you to do for them to act. Be honest that you understand if their hands are tied.
You can talk to your elected officials about it. There's no guarantee but they might be able to make it a priority for them.
