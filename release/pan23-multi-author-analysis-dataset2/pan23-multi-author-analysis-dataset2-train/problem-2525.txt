I thought he really meant cat bomb too. Apparently there is a hollow spot in a house a cat that the CIA tried to hide listening devices in.
They would still need some kind of support or at least silence from their Arab allies & Turkey. Itâ€™s likely they will strike Iran nuclear facilities soon, they have done it with Saddam before.
Israel just committed to a pause on settlements in the West Bank. Guessing some very interesting negotiations with the Biden Administration are happening.
Considering the coalition that forms the current government/administration- yeah something is happening. Bibi was willing to instigate active conflict to stay in power and the far right extremists/nationalists in the coalition would never be willing to do this otherwise.
I feel like people vastly overestimate the value of North Korean nukes has in stopping people from trying to attack them. The fact that they have Seoul hostage has been the primary reason no country has tried to dismantle them. Being allied (as in providing a buffer zone) with China, and then the nukes, are just icing really.
