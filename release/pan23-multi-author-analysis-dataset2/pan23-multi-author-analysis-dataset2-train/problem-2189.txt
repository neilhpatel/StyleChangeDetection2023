Sex for money is the illegal part. Just because someone does something illegal for their primary job does not make every job they do illegal. So as long as the transaction does not include one of the acts that your state counts as sex, it isn't prostitution and is totally legal.
You can hire a drug dealer to mow your lawn and it is legal as long as you don't also buy drugs from him. Hanging out with a prostitute for money without sex is kind of like that.
The exchange of money for sex is illegal, and that is how prostitution is defined by the legal system. Essentially he is getting a cheap escort service. Now if he was interrupted by the police while picking up a known prostitute he would have a hard time proving that he wasn't paying for sex, unless some respectable professional was willing to stand up for him. Now let's say he really is paying for sex, and he is or intends to use this all as some form of cover. I would recommend against the actions of paying a prostitute for the work of an escort. He should use an escort service for this, it tends to cost more but some of that money usually goes towards protecting employees and clients. (I used to rent a basement suite from a former escort).
