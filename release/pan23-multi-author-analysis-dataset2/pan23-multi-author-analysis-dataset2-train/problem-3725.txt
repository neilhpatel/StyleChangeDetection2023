Might be a fake name/address of an innocent lady. Hackers are pretty smart, they wouldn't be leaving their contact information lol.
Somebody did this to my Domino’s account. Here is how it works. They hack into your account, and then they advertise “half off anything from bitesquad/DoorDash/etc” on Instagram or somewhere. Then people send them the money, and they order the food and have it sent to the person who paid them. Typically, the person who ordered it doesn’t know that it’s a stolen account. I contacted the people who made orders on my dominoes account directly, and that’s what they explained to me, along with a screenshots. I would be willing to guess this is the same. It’s unlikely that the person who actually received the food is the same person who both hacked into your account and placed the order… so unless you can prove that they knowingly did it, there isn’t very much liability. If he reported to the police, and they have nothing better to do, they might try to track where the money went… But from a practical perspective, you would be better off just contacting the merchant, getting your money back, and changing your password.
