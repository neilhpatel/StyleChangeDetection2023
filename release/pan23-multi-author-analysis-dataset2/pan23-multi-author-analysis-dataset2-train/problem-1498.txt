What protections? What makes you think this vaccination is going to be different than the dozen other shots you were already required to get when you signed up?
Firstly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines approved for use in the US are "genetic altering material". That's simply false. They cannot "alter genetic material" in the same way eating a steak will not cause me to grow horns or start fathering baby cows.
The vaccine, my erstwhile friend, is preventing the viruses from rewriting your personal code that you believe makes you so precious just as you are without a chromosome out of place (which, candidly, I am not convinced is the case, having read your post.) Every virus you've ever had overwrites your DNA. Every prior vaccine you've had prevents viruses from doing this, by creating signals that recognize the genetic makeup of the virus and attacking it before it has a chance to do so. Listen, Covid has been hard on everyone. Boredom is a helluva drug. But for fuck's sake, you're barely an adult, and you believe yourself to have some sort of superior understanding of medical science and biochemistry greater than teams - and I mean HUGE teams - of scientists, physicians, researchers, and other professionals who've spent longer doing their jobs than you have been alive on the earth. Because you read some stupid idiot on facebook? Because you watch youtube a bunch? This is nonsense, supremely arrogant, and exactly the reason why nobody takes you seriously.
Second, precisely what religion have you been a fervent member of that prohibits a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine?
Religious exemption first off this is genetic altering material and altering my body in such a way to me is crossing the line on my religious integrity I do not expect you to understand or agree but I do believe in religious freedom along with investigative research so Iâ€™m doing my best to understand things to THE FULLEST.
