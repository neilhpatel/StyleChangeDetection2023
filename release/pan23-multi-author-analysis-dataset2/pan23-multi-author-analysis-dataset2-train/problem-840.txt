Oh she’ll be speaker. No matter who gets the spot she will run that person down so hard they will give her their firstborn child to get rid of her. She didn’t run unopposed in her first election by chance. She and her psycho friends ran her opponent off and the strain caused his marriage to end up in divorce. She is evil personified.
Not disagreeing with your last sentence but who was MTG's original opponent? In a way MTG kind of got her karma there, if she really caused someone else’s marriage to end in divorce since her husband discovered her infidelity and finally divorced HER clown ass!
“They had been arguing a lot, but this time it kept degenerating until his wife said she wanted a divorce. Kevin said she could not possibly understand the stress he was under. He asked if she could wait until after the election, but she said no, she was done, and they kept on arguing until Kevin punched a wall hard enough that he broke the paneling.”.
But personally, if this sounds crazy, this is a Trump show, and Trump having McCarthy squirm, as to let him know, Trump is the quasi Speaker, not him. And of course, to give crazy Trump crackpots key positions.
Well, as crazy as it sounds, we have to root for MTG. If she's as dug in as these other holdouts, they'll likely have to go to the Democrats for a concencus candidate.
In the end, they'll fold for McCarthy, but he'll be on notice, and one anti trump screw up from him, they'll fire him in a ny heartbeat. Which, is more likely than not, for Scalise to then take the reigns.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
