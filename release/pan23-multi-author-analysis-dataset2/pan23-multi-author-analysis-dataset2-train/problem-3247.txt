Without getting too off topic, this happened yesterday. I confronted her about it and told her she had a week to get her shots or we were done and she needed to leave and I wanted a divorce. She made the decision and left last night with the kids to go stay with her sister. She texted me today and told me she wasn't coming back. Gonna be kinda hard to get my kid, especially with her not around.
If your wife left the state with the child to stay with her sister, then a clock is running. Currently, your child is a NC resident and subject to the NC court. If Mom establishes residency in another state with your baby, after a period of several months, you'll have to file in that state's court. You can get an emergency motion filed requiring her to bring the child back to North Carolina.
Either parent can make medical decisions for their child, barring a court order specifying otherwise. I assume you are on the birth certificate, aren't separated or subject to a restraining order. Take your infant to the pediatrician and have them vaccinated.
For future reference, you will absolutely want to work out medical arrangements/approvals in your custody agreement. But for the meantime, you want to look into protecting your rights as a parent to your child.
This is more /r/relationship_advice: this may be the nuclear option with your wife. It would not be an entirely bad idea to have a Plan B in order (e.g., marriage counselling; a talk with a family law attorney) if she reacts badly.
