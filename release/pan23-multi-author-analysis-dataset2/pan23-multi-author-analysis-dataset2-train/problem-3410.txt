I'm not certain what sort of advice that you're looking for. Your mother has no legal obligation to babysit for you while you work or to provide you and your children with room and board. If you don't like living under her thumb, find a job and move out. As long as your children are being cared for and not exposed to your ex's abuse, there's little chance she'd be granted emergency custody. Your local domestic violence advocate or women's shelter may have resources to help you get back on your feet. At the bare minimum, you should speak with a family lawyer about filing for a formal custody arrangement and child support.
You're aware that your mother doesn't have to let you live with her or support you, correct? I am just unclear as to what other options you believe you have, setting the question of whether she could get custody of your children aside.
That being said, if she were to call CPS and explain the situation, it may lead to an investigation being opened. If CPS determines that he is unfit, they are going to make you to pick between your kids or your ex.
