Your credit score will be impacted, you won’t be able to file for 7 years. A consult with a bankruptcy attorney is free. Depending on your income and your debts, you can file in either chapter 7 or 13. 13 is better for keeping your house, 7 helps you get rid of everything, but there are ways to keep your house. Don’t know what state you are in so there are various other exemptions that creditors cannot get at.
If you have that much money lying around, you probably aren’t eligible for chapter 7. The discharge of “everything” is a bit overgeneralized. There’s very specific rules to this and I don’t know how options trading is impacted in bankruptcy. You would have to speak to a bankruptcy lawyer.
No, if you file don't try to hide or move money in unusual ways. Leave everything alone and tell the truth. There are different kinds of trouble you can get in by screwing around with the process, the worst of which is jail.
Also, spend some time going to a gambler’s anonymous meeting. I’m not joking, I’ve seen what that stuff does to people. Start going yesterday, you need the support and you need to stop what you are doing to yourself.
Stop doing things and relax. Don’t do any more than you already have. Don’t even think. Don’t mess with your accounts or your money. Go to sleep, and in the morning call a bankruptcy attorney and pick their brain after laying out your full financial situation.
So if I have like 3-4 retirement accounts between rollovers/IRAs/401ks - those are protected entirely or is it questionable? I have a sizable amount actually that would be worth honestly having destroyed credit for 7 years.
Yes, anything in a qualified retirement account is protected, as long as there isn't any fraud (like contributing a large amount of money to a retirement account right before filing for bankruptcy).
