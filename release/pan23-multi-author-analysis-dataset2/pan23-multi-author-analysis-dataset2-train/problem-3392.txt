A lot of people don’t realize just how well armed the Self Defense Force is. I think they’re in the top 5 in military spending. It’s a truly world class military, it’s just not set up for offense.
The Yokohama one from the video has the most articulation, being able to kneel with one specific leg, and move its arm and point a finger with one of the arms. RX78.
Furthermore, Japan will only operate 42 F-35Bs when all things are settled. This isn’t that many and the Japanese themselves only stated that the modified Izumo-class will accommodate about 12 F-35Bs or more comfortably with an absolute maximum of 28 (this will prevent them from carrying any helicopters or any other aircraft).
The Odaiba one can change modes (the armor pieces separate/move/extend) but it doesn’t actually move. Unicorn Gundam.
It'll probably be the most epic pit stop ever as they mount wheels on the whole of the Japanese armed forces.
The one in China actually doesn’t even move its arms. The arms are stationary, but it can move the hands. Hands can rotate, and can open and close the fingers.. Freedom Gundam.
