This is the biggest one for me, thank you. He never definitively draws the connection between the Medieval French "Tiphaine" and the Early-Modern English "Tiffin", nor is he able to explain why the surname does not persist in the Old World at all.
After watching the Tiffany video (and bearing in mind that I'm not really a "proper" historian myself), no, I don't think he's really demonstrating the experience of historians. I don't get the feel here that he's going through dozens of sources and chasing footnotes - it actually seems very ngram-ish and shallow, and makes me wonder how much he missed because things weren't found in a search on Google Books or Archive.org.
The main thing that stands out to me wrt this video is that, from what he's saying - which may not be absolutely representative of what went on behind the scenes, but I'm going with this angle because you've asked about how the video itself demonstrates his methods - it appears that his research focused almost entirely on tracking instances of the name through time, over the course of hundreds of years. Historians don't typically study something over a huge date range. When I look at the books on my shelf, pretty much any time the date range is more than 200 years, it's an edited volume with chapters written by different historians who have different focuses within the larger timespan; even in the cases of the shorter long timespans of 150-200 years, the authors usually focus more heavily on one area of it and have some outlier examples that expand the title range.
Yes, there are ultimately two completely unrelated narratives from two different periods that CGPG is, intentionally or unintentionally, juxtaposing to give the impression of continuity of a "Tiffany" equivalent over many centuries.
