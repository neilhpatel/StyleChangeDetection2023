That's an uncomfortably general clause in a rental lease, but it's very likely that if it came to a lawsuit, a judge would not interpret the word "repair" to impose a duty to replace a rotting floor that was not failing because of a specific negligent incident.
But you have your own testimony, including testimony about when the landlord reinforced the floor with plywood, to set the timeframe.
To make you responsible, the damage would have to be due to your negligence. An example of "you didn't tell us soon enough" would be a tenant who fails to notify a landlord about a leaking toilet, and the water from that eventually causes damage that would not have occurred if it had been repaired promptly. That is obviously not the case in your home, where all the floors have been failing since before you moved in.
If your lease ends soon, I recommend moving out. That place is going to need replacement of all the floors and you don't want to be part of it. Don't wait until you fall through a floor and the place becomes "untenantable".
That is not your responsibility. Your lease doesn't give a specified time to notify the landlord, either, so they shouldn't be able to use that excuse.
