No, you can't stop each other from using it. You can't prevent him from using it and he can't prevent you from using it; if either of you called the police to report it stolen they'd tell you to go away. Obviously the domestic abuse is still domestic abuse.
Who is (and in some cases who isn't) allowed to use a vehicle is usually stated in the insurance. The title refers to who owns the property, and if I remember correctly as long as OP's name is first on the title and listed as the primary operator on the insurance, then IP's partner can't take the vehicle without permission.
Watch out for the OR on your title though, that does mean either of you could decide to sell the car without the others permission or signature. If it was AND, both of you would have to sign.
Jumping on top comment to say this is correct. NAL but I work in the financial industry and am loan trained. This is a common question we get asked and the short of it is, if both of you are on the title you both have rights to the vehicle. He can't forbid you, you can't forbid him.
Not a lawyer, but that doesn't sound right too me. When she says they co-signed for it I assume that refers to the financing but I'm not sure that has bearing on actual ownership. Co-signers are lending their credit to you which basically means the bank can come after them for the money should you fail to meet your financial obligations. Who's name is on the title is what counts.
