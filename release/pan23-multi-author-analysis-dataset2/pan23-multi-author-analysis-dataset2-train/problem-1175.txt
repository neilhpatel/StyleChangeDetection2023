And recent attack in Colorado wasn't fueled by bigotry and hate? Maybe hate at a different group of people, one not sharing a coming race, but still bigotry. A lot of the shootings today, maybe not all, are fueled by bigotry and history of prejudice. Go look at all the shit the GOP has been saying and doing about LGBTQ people? There is definitely a history of prejudice.
Actually, the gay communities in San Francisco did that back in the day. They all got whistles and agreed to come running to beat the shit out of gay-bashers invading their neighborhood.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
