He either finds some way to work with the roommates for them to release him from the lease (with the landlord's cooperation) or he doesn't get off the lease.
I mean it would also be pretty unfair if your bf could sign a lease with his friends, get a gf and bail on the lease leaving his friends to eat that cost.
They aren’t his friends, their have been a lot of instances of bullying and isolating him or else he wouldn’t have moved in with me, for example. Roommate has his girlfriend living there, wasn’t paying rent and also had her dog there that would take their shoes. Boyfriend addressed it, he grabbed dirty pans and put them in his room. This is just one of the issues....I didn’t want to go over there anymore because of how uncomfortable and unwelcome I felt.
Boyfriend had asked months before moving out if living with me was a possibility and they had agreed. Although it was verbal and that is why we are in this situation now.
None of that matters. He choose to sign a lease with them which is a weird thing to do with people you don't like but whatever, he's an adult, he can make weird choices. Now he's bound to the agreement that he made.
