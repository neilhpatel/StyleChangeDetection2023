Hmmm not sure... I didn’t know police made records of overdoses...? Overdosing is not a crime. And here in Ontario it’s made very clear that neither the person overdosing or the person reporting the overdose will face any legal repercussions. I know I certainly have never faced any legal trouble or even had to talk to police any of the thousand times I’ve overdosed. Do u know if they keep a record of that kinda thing? Cause if they do then that’s probably what he was looking at. It seemed like he just used my ID to radio in and run my information like police always do in these situations, at least to me it didn’t seem like he was doing anything out of the ordinary which is why I found it strange that he was able to find out about the overdose that occurred a week prior to this situation.
Yah luckily my friends ended up calling an ambulance... not completely certain, but I’m pretty sure the police usually tag along on all these calls. I’ve always been too fucked up to notice, but I feel like I remember seeing police around a bunch of the times I overdosed.
I agree with another commenter that they likely accessed police records from a prior call. Your health records are private, but police can access their own records.
