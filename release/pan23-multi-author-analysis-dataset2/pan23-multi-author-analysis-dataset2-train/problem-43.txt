They are not obligated to accept it in the way that you're suggesting, as /u/derspiny explained well.
That's enough. We don't need to go back and forth about how big an ass OP can be to the poor desk clerk under the guise of OP following the law. This sub isn't malicious compliance.
Were you trying to pay a traffic ticket with a deliberately-inconvenient pile of coins, such as all in pennies or nickels?
While it is true that cash is a valid tender for all debts, it is _not_ true that the creditor must accept cash, even when the creditor is the government. In practice, the government will usually accept cash, but may have policies against accepting payments that are inordinately difficult to handle. There are situations where refusing a cash tender can cost the creditor the ability to enforce the debt in any other way, but likely not in this situation.
In addition, you should realize that you're only making life difficult for a run of the mill employee - your grudge against the government and attempt to make your payment a hassle would just ruin their day, not actually get across whatever point you're trying to make.
