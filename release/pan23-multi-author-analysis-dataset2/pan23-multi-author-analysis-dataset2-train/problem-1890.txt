You don't mention where you are, but in most places in the U.S. employees are "at will," meaning they can be terminated (and can quit) for any reason or for no reason.
An employee terminated without cause is not legally entitled to severance unless severance is provided in an employment contract or per company policy. You may be entitled to receive unemployment payments.
In Alberta, under labour statute, you can give notice, or severance instead of notice. They gave you notice, and more than what would be required based on how long you worked there.

Based on what I've read, they did not fire you (terminated with cause), but laid you off you (terminated without cause), what does your ROI say? There are some situations where a business might not be allowed to lay someone off, but pretty remote. And with COVID, they can just say the reason is that.
