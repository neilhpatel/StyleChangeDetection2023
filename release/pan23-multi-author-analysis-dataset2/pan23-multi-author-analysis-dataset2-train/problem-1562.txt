When you cannot move a rock that must be moved, you crush it instead. The rank and file of the Chinese military are not automatons, they will not tolerate the massacre of their Mothers, Fathers, Brothers and Sisters.
I guess that's what its like to grow up in a country where the information you receive is controlled and censored by a dictator government.
The Chinese people are actually quite intelligent and aware of their political situation. They know exactly who and what Xi is. They also know that even with the military, Xi cannot survive as premier if the populace turns against him.
Governing China is a delicate balance for a fascist prick like Xi. He can only pound on the populace just so much before the people become a massive tidal wave drowning every fascist prick who gets in the way.
With fascist and other authoritarian governments, there is always a tipping point of popular support vs. popular condemnation. Has China reached that point yet? I don't think so but, roll out the tanks and have another Tienanmen Square type incident and Xi could see a billion pissed-off Chinese citizens in the streets outside of Zhongnanhai, the Chinese Kremlin.
