An engagement ring can be a conditional gift (it’s yours if you get married) but that doesn’t apply if he just gives it to you after the breakup.
The safest thing is to keep it until you can get something from him confirming he is willingly giving it to you without expectation. As others have said, engagement rings are typically conditional in court. So you need to make sure he can't come back later saying otherwise.
So we were never married. He proposed and I said yes. Things happened and I gave the ring back and blocked me on everything. Now he had his friend send me the ring back with a note written by the friend that I can do what I want with it.
Technically you could, but if I were you, I would try and contact your ex just to make sure they really wanted you to have that ring, and that you truly can do whatever you want with it, it doesn't hurt to ask.
The court has ruled out the ring to be a conditional gift, and a complete gift after the marriage, so if the ring was given to you before marriage, it is rightfully yours after the divorce too (that's if you got married). The thing that's confusing me is the fact that your ex gave you the ring, did you propose to them and gave them the ring, or did you give them the ring after the divorce?
