ugh exactly, this isn't even part of "biden's green agenda", it was ONE employee of a federal agency, who made ONE comment about possibly limiting the sales of gas stoves in the future.
I thought at first the light temperature would be a problem and I also thought that they would be more like fluorescent bulbs and undimmable, BUT the LEDs are soo much better than regular bulbs in every way.
I changed my house to ALL LEDs and CFLs and my elec bill dropped by almost HALF! They make your AC work better too since you are added less ambient heat.

I can select the light temperature, 3000, 4000, 5000 etc. I can dim them better than bulbs, They are warm and one of my bulbs is fully color configurable with an app.
LEDs versus Bulbs all over again. Meanwhile the stove manufacturers will continue to increase production of induction tops and the republicans will try to pass some kind of "don't say induction" law.
it looks like that's just what the modern republican party has devolved into: shadowboxing against imaginary threats while ignoring the real ones.
surely with this one, they know they're being dishonest, right? like there's no way it's an act? it can't be.
