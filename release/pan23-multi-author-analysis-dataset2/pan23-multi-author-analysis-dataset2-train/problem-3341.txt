Of course, most of the reason we've given up even considering that is because nobody has any faith in the typical American to apply themselves. It's accepted that their vote is all they're good for, however axiomatically they make it, however little they try to inform their own decisions and however little they care about anyone else but themselves. This won't be fixed by "civics test for politicans" and a culture devoid of civics is in no position to test someone's aptitude for civics anyway.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Voters have an unforgivable disregard for civics and too many of them want politicians that don't either. This is ultimately why civic minded politicians lose American elections. Trump and everything his victory normalized was the consequence of a problem that started from the bottom up, not the cause of it.

Voters should too. It's little more than a fantasy to think educating politicians on civics is going to solve America's disrespect for civics when the people that elect those politicians don't.
