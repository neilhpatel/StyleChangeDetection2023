But also I think any effective model willl sort of mathematically consider that anyway so it's kind of moot, but still.
Now I understand how the Irish famine wasn’t really a genocide, because the British elite would do the same to their countrymen. It’s not about ethicity or culture, it’s all about money and how much you got.
It's not even that. It's like asking them to take a nonperishable food from a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of packages of it, that they literally couldn't get through even if they really really tried.
Spooky thing is Tories (or their appointed think tanks) will literally have considered that option with computer models.
And what would selling off the history of Britain accomplish? Should he then divide the money between each citizen? It wouldn't do anything. The king is nothing more than a moral compass. And yes, he lives in wealth and does so with the agreement to watch over the government and try to advocate for the people. Those who demand the royal family's wealth are just jealous usually.
