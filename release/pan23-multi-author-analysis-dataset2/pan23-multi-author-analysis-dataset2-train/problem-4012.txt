I would think first of all it would have to dance very close, if not over, the line of being illegal.
That's such a vague question and isn't illegal to ask. It isn't even asking how to do it, just asking how easy it would be.
"How easy is it to murder someone?" for example, in and of itself, isn't an "illegal" question or legally-actionable, without a whole lot more context and detail that would make it illegal (such as taking actual steps toward the planning of a murder or what-have-you). The same with the question you've quoted.
And law enforcement is incredibly unlikely to get involved over a semi-anonymous post containing only the question you've quoted.
Reddit is not in the business of turning over personally identifying information to any rando user that asks for it, especially without there being some kind of subpoena for that information. And this does not sound like anything the legal system is interested in dealing with, but if you feel that it is, you can get in contact with law enforcement and reddit about it. Set your expectations accordingly.
