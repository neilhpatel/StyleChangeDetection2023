Don't take legal advice from the police, because the chief was likely wrong. You cannot establish tenancy in Alabama after a single day. I strongly recommend your godmother call up the Alabama State Bar Association for a referral to a lawyer specialized in landlord issues. It shouldn't cost much, and hopefully will fit inside her modest budget. Otherwise, try googling "legal aid clinic <her county/city.
Hence why godmother needs to speak with a lawyer who knows how long it takes for a guest to establish residency. The state requirements may be different from, say, Birmingham. Alabama is very much a landlord friendly state, but finding out the right answer from a local attorney is the best way for her to go.
You're doing the right thing in making sure that he is not welcome back and the locks are changed. If any mail does come for him, your godmother should mark it return to sender/addressee does not live here to avoid him establishing it. I'd also make sure to have a chat with her neighbours if she's on friendly terms to make sure this guy isn't skulking about.
As far as I’m aware, your godmother gave notice for them to vacate and they did, if he had any rights to stay, they were gone as soon as they vacated. Do not let them back in.
It does. I highly doubt they would be considered a tenant after three days. So you should be good if they decide to possibly sue for illegal eviction. You would need an attorney if it came to that.
I’m just pointing out that you said “you cannot establish tenancy in Alabama after a single day”. That’s incorrect, the guest was there for more than one day.
