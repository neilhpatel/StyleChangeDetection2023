M4L is a professional, theatrical astroturfing production, from soup to nuts, funded by dark money sources like the Koch Network and the Council for National Policy. There isn’t anything grassroots about them. Maurice Cunningham of Bucks County Beacon documented the entire front group. One of the most concerning things about them is that they are considered the foot soldiers of Ron DeSantis for his 2024 run.
The old codgers and hysterical Moms for Liberty in Florida might give the impression that LGBT bashing and book banning is popular but they are walking on thin ice ( not to talk about abortion which will into a redhot issue once more in 24). Listening to those that scream the loudest can be dangerous. Lets not forget that they lost every single culture war battle in the end.
It’s the same mistake everyone seems to make these days, that loud voices on social media = actual public sentiment. When nothing could be further from the truth. Attention is the currency of social media, and nothing brings attention like conflict. Hyperbole and demonization generate attention like golden geese, so as a result, everyone thinks everyone hates everyone.
