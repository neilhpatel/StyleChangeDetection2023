Essentially, I had communicated with my supervisor a week prior to starting that I am also taking care of my mom (a widow who has a rare form of cancer) and am also coming back from a recent surgery. She was well aware of this and knew I wouldn't be at my computer 24/7. The first day of work, we had a power outage due to heat (this was a coincidence) so I texted her this so she was in the loop. Second day of work went fine, no problem. But then third day of work, I had to drop off my mom to chemo (as I've been doing for the past 5 months) and wasn't at my computer for a few hours. She started throwing a fit saying that I need to be there when she was already informed about my situation. I get a call thursday morning from HR saying that I'm terminated bcuz of this....bcuz of this one dumb ass lady.
You need to pay back a legitimate over payment, but they do need to pay you for time worked. If they try to claw it all back, you can file a wage claim with the Illinois DoL for what you're owed.
