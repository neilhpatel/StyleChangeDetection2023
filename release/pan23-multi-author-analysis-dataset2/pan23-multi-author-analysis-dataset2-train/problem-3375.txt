Iâ€™m all about keeping our guns, and my opinion is that there should be much more regulation, mandatory training, and things like annual license renewal. Basically manage gun ownership more like vehicle ownership. But I doubt even that would put a dent in our gun violence, at least not in the short term. The root causes must be addressed, which will require more than voting to change but voting can certainly help.
