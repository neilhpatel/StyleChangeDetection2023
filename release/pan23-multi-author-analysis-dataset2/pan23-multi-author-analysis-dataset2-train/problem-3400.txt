How are you being paid? "Consultant" does not mean "independent contractor" and, under CA law, your employer does not control how your work status is characterized - the state does.
If, however, there is no withholding from your paycheck (and assuming that's lawful), you should speak to your accountant about setting up for quarterly expected income tax payments where you prepare an estimated tax based on your earnings and expected withholdings so you're not nailed at the end of the year.
"As discussed, your role will include but not be limited to all aspects of customer service operations, order entry & fulfillment, payment processing, and factor integration. Throughout the rest of the year, we have agreed to allow you to work remotely with as needed attendance to our office. We are expecting that your work will cover 24hours/ week at $\_\_/hour. You will be required to submit an invoice to us detailing your hours worked on a biweekly basis. If you exceed the 24 hours, you will need to request approval from us.".
Yes, 100 percent. As simply put, this is exactly what it is. I am going to email them and let them know that because they will "allow me to work remote" does not mean its grounds for independent contractor... when this is a clearly laid out job description that is a part of the companies day to day "regular business" functionality. Ill just keep looking for work. Thank you!
