That being said, I would continue to insist on an itemized receipt or at least a written list of the charges before I paid for anything. If you do pay for the damages, you should also make sure that you get a release of liability from them (saying that once you've paid, you don't owe them anything else).
Insurance won't just eat the cost of repairs if they know who caused the damage; either the hotel will demand you pay for it directly, or they'll go through insurance who will repair the damage and then demand that you repay them.
Nail polish can be difficult to remove once dried, and nail polish remover can and will damage many surfaces (including wallpaper).
If the wallpaper and vanity cannot be properly cleaned and require replacement, they can legally charge you for the replacement of those items per the terms you agreed to upon check in. Charging $250 for a cleaning fee seems high, but the details of that cost may not go deeper than that single line item.
