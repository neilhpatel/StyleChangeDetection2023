Perhaps more so if the students would have to be abroad... But for whatever reason would be using the online classes from the place they reside. The new students whom will yet enroll will also not have any options for hybrid or sandwich like courses where they could perhaps spend more time at home in China than usually (be it wanting to be with family, urgent matters like death in the family, sudden natural events or even pandemics- ). It would make them inclined to stay in these countries rather than come back when they want to. This is then enhanced by the fact they they are culturally heavily inclined on completing their education as a matter of honour.
And given the hard on Canada has for foreign students, this just seems like a huge cash cow returning to pre-pandemic form. Think of all that cash to be raked in from rental income alone.
While I'm not a fan of banning stuff, a good look at what is in the long range interst of each country is needed. A few wolves hidden in the flock could do a lot of damage. Little green wolves.
