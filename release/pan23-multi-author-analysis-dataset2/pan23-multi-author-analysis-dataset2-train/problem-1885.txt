For the rest of the stuff, such as the poor relationship with your brother and parents not accepting you, the only real solution there is to move out. You are 19 and have no obligation to live with them or speak to any family you don't wish to speak to.
To get your papers, call the local police on their non-emergency number. Explain the situation and request a police escort to go pick up your things. Keep them somewhere safe (not at your parents house).
Thanks for the advice. I have questions. How do i get my birth papers, citizenship, and all that if my parents wont give it to me? For moving out. They want me to marry the person they want, not what i want. Aka, Forced marriage. Another thing, they are forcing me to live with them.
Ideally, have a plan for where you are going before you tip your hand. Your parents can’t kick you out without following eviction procedures (which takes time), but given the situation you described you may choose not to stay there. Local women’s shelters are a often a great resource in times like these and can likely point you to other resources to help you get on your feet.
