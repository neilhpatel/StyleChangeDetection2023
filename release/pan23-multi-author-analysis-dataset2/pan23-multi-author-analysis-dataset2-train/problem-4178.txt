I found for New York. Looks like your fiance can voluntarily accept a PAID lunch break under the one-employee-shift exception.
The employer isn't legally required to deduct the money for lunch breaks; they're required to give her lunch breaks. Can't do the former without doing the latter.
No, legally they have to give her the unpaid meal period required by law. Their deducting of her pay is unlawful, and an attempt to cook the books in the event they are audited, because they can "prove" their employees received their required break.
I am not a lawyer but a HR Director in NY. I want to confirm what this post is saying. There is an exemption for the one-employee-shift that allows business that have one employee that can’t be easily replaced to waive their lunch break, but they must be paid. Daycare generally comes with ratios and licensing requirements, so your fiancé can have her lunch waived due to her job.
That being said, them deducting the money is straight up wage theft. It can be reported to the department of labor.
Also, adding that you could report this to OCFS (NY child care regulatory agency) as they are most likely a licensed program or an illegal program. I used to run a licensed program in NY as well.
This is wage theft. This is protected under Federal law, for sure. She could file a complaint with her local wage and hour office. They are legally required to GIVE her the break. If she doesn't get the break, she MUST be paid for her actual time worked.
