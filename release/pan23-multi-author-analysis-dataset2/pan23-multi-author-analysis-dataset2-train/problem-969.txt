If not, and the money is going to you, then the only thing you should ask is "where do I sign?". You will likely just hire an estate attorney in PA who will handle everything. You may have to sign a few things, but that's about it.
You definitely don't want someone else, or a lawyer who doesn't work for you, handling your inheritance.
Where will you be able to find a list of assets, bank accounts, retirement accounts, and all that. Same for debts--mortgage; car loans; accounts for phone, cable, streaming service, internet, electricity, etc.
Does the will maker have provisions for what the law calls "disposition of remains" (funeral, burial.cremation, etc.)? That is, do they have a prepaid funeral plan? Or, have they designated in writing someone to handle this? f not, then "next of kin" makes the decisions. As executor, you will be responsible for either paying funeral bills or reimbursing someone for them.
Does the will maker have an attorney or accountant? Where are the person's old tax records? (You will have to do final income taxes for the estate.).
Does the will maker have a living trust? Do any accounts or real estate deeds automatically go to someone outside of probate?
