Location is not optional, I'll assume generic US for now. If you are in the US, this is a common misunderstanding.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
Hospitals and doctors keep their own medical records for internal use, there is no "universal health record" that exists in the same way that your driving record, or criminal record would be kept.
Doctors are not even permitted to give other doctors from another hospital or office your records without your consent.
Ultimately you can go to the hospital where this happened, but they are unlikely to change your records from an event in 2017, as the doctors and nurses involved are extremely unlikely to have a recollection of your specific visit. You may be able to request that they destroy those records if you wish.
You can, and should file a police report. You can provide all the evidence you have. But getting all your ducks in a row with an accurate medical report, and a clean case with clear proof is not your job.
