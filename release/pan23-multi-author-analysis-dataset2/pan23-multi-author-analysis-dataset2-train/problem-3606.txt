You are correct that the Supreme Court ruled that police officers do not have a constitutional duty to protect individuals from harm. This ruling was made in the case of Warren v. District of Columbia, in which the Court held that police officers have a general duty to enforce the law and maintain public safety, but do not have a specific duty to protect individual citizens from harm. However, this does not mean that police officers never help protect people or save lives. In many cases, they do so as part of their duties to enforce the law and maintain public safety.
Kinda like the nexus pass. If we trust you going across the boarder - and you get caught doing something illegal - extra punishment.
It's unbelievable that something like this could happen. Police officers are supposed to protect and serve the community, and it's shocking to hear that one of them would shoot a teenager in the head. This kind of violence is unacceptable, and I hope that the authorities in Greece take action to hold the officer accountable and ensure that something like this doesn't happen again. It's important that the police are held to high standards, and that they are not allowed to use excessive force in situations like this.
