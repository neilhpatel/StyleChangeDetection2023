That becomes a philosophical question then of how do we measure evil? Which I don’t think we can do. Especially if we are comparing two different but equally terrible situations.
…when all countries involved are economically motivated. Throw in massively corrupt dictatorships and massive cultural differences and trade can sadly become blackmail.
Obviously evil, and the turning of the eye is evil too, which other countries did. Is it as evil as causing hundreds of thousands of deaths because of an evil invasion? You tell me, both are evil but I would say one is clearly worse.
Do we measure evil purely based off of the number of deaths? Or the total number of people affected? Do we look at intent, malice and justification or simply the consequences/end result of actions? Do we take into account possibility of justice vs improbability of justice? Does time affect how evil an act is? Do we judge it less harshly as more time passes by? Do we take into account the power balance/imbalance between the parties? Do we take into account global importance/significance or do we treat all acts of evil as equally weighted? Does a genocide of 1 million in the African Congo weigh the same as a genocide of 1 million in England or Denmark?
