I love how the media and MAGA, GOP people tried to spin this: "Well, stop electing corrupted democrats and this won't happen." I then ask: "Why doesn't this happen to corrupt GOP officials?" Their answer: "Their base knows better." Yeah, as in: "If we go against them, we will never see the light of day.".
I wonder whether this case will be referenced in any way during the Republicans' 2024 Michigan primary. He was sentenced in federal court, so wouldn't that mean he would be eligible to be pardoned?
