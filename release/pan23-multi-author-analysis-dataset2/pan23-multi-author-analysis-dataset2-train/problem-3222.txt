Ok but they’re not the only one I just used that as a famous example I’m talking about like local restaurants listed as “stacks” or chili’s being delivered as “embers bbq” just seems like it’s a little too frequent to be just something a couple restaurants do on their own.
And I bet all the others are the same- it's not DoorDash or the delivery service- it's the restaurants getting cute.
I mean, it took me five seconds of googling to find that the first two you listed were both the restaurants working under multiple names.
Ok then how about stacks sandwhich shop that pops up as macalisters but is really Jason’s deli there’s plenty of other examples I just don’t feel like listing every single one of them.
Most people don’t google every place before they try it especially if it seems like it may be a local place and you may not find a website anyway just because the 2 examples I listed were national chains doesn’t change the fact that DoorDash is the company advertising them as such when they’re really not what they claim they are.
