This has HUGE implications. It means NATO countries will set a precedent to further restrict trade and increase sanctions on russia, but whats even bigger, is it also applies secondary sanctions to other countries and entities that trade with russia. This is fantastic. It forces the whole world to play along.
You mean cripple further. That economy has been ruined for the coming decades. But change has to come from within. There is only so much the west can do to get the people to actually take action against their billionaire oppressers. The amount of destruction Putin and his cronies have caused in the past years cannot be ignored any further. Syria, Chenchnya and now Ukraine. It has to stop.
Which is going to suck for the Russian civilians. Hopefully it'll encourage them to oust the Putin regime but such actions have historically had mixed results.
I'm also wondering about individuals, particularly politicians etc who receives or moves money from Russia. At this point, anyone who does so should be considered profiting from the proceeds of terror, and be charged appropriately.
Have you not noticed all the politicians and businesses with suspicious ties to Russia and dirty Russian money? That's definitely an issue we need to do something more about.
