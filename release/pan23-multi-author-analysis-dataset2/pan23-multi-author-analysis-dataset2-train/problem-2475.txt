What state did the grandfather die in? That is normally where probate is supposed to be done. You need to look at the county courthouse probate case records online to do a search under your grandfather's name to see if anyone ever opened up an official probate case for his estate. If a case had been opened, it is normal procedure for the executor to send out notices about the probate to the heirs (who would include your husband), so the fact that your husband was not notified is very telling and an indication that no probate may have been opened.
Probate can be done in more than one county, so you need to check the county in California and the county in Arizona where he owned another home to see if probate was done in either state.
She sold the home in California without a lawyer. The estate has a will against it, she sold the home and the contents and did not pay anyone out. The Arizona lawyer said she would only handle the AZ home, not the CA home, so it sounds like I have to talk to a CA lawyer?
