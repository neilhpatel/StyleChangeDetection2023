North Korea has some of the best power lifters. That tiny country of underfed people has good power lifters…. They state sponsor doping and it blatantly obvious. The fact that they are allowed at the games at all is suspect.
People are shocked that North Korea is coming back but I bet 99% of people don’t know why they were banned.
It’s because they didn’t send athletes to Japan, citing the pandemic. Not because of anything else they did.
You are saying they were banned because they opted not to compete one year? That’s crazy. Especially in light of a pandemic.
Most western world lifters really are not juicing. If you look at a list of all the best power lifters and weight lifters, most of then are Americans, brits, and the like, but none of them win competitions like the olympics. Why is that? It’s because the Olympic committees of countries like the USA will suspend you into oblivion for doping.
They aren’t that tiny…countries much smaller than 25 million people do well in international competitions.
I’m pretty sure they can manage to get enough food to the handful of athletes they intensely train for the Olympics. It’s possible they’re doping but it’s really not “blatantly obvious”.
