I get downvoted almost anytime time I criticize Dems in this sub. Nevermind it‚Äôs my own party and the one I feel responsible for and want to be better. Nevermind my criticism is always about how moderately conservative most of them actually are. I‚Äôve been called a right winger and a trump supporter. What can you do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Ugh. That whole exchange was infuriating. Feinstein's response to those kids sounded like a textbook example of Narcissism.
Because the truth is that the US is run by and for corporate interests and Feinstein is 100% on board with that regardless of how "liberal" she claimed to be.
