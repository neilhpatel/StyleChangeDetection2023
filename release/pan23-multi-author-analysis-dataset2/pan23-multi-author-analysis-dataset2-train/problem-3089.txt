Thats exactly what happened. Previous owners bought in like 2018 for super cheap and fixed it up to sell. The taxes were super low (and I knew they would go up when it sold since they'll use the sell price). Well anyways as a first time home buyer I didn't really know that the taxes were credited or I would've said something due to the big price jump. My future taxes will higher but my escrow is already adjusting for that but my escrow also adjusted for the the 2020 bill as well. Im paying for 2020 taxes and 2021 taxes for the next year to make up for that.
Did they use the previous tax bill when they came up with the prorated amount? If not, what did they go off of to calculate the taxes?
Also has your house been recently assessed by the city or county? They would usually send you a letter. Say if the last asses value from the city was say years ago or the last time it sold (before you). The city/county could now see it recently sold again (from you buying) and used that price to update the taxes. If it sold higher (I assume it did) then your taxes will also end up going up as well.
