Pretty sure this will be an at-fault collision, unfortunately. From-the-rear collisions are almost always considered the approaching driver's fault, on the principle that if something is stationary on the road, then the approaching driver has ample time to see and avoid the collision. After all, you're not supposed to be driving so fast that you can't stop before you pass the things you can see.
You can try contacting an insurance lawyer to help negotiate, but I don't think the odds are in your favour.
There’s likely no reason for an attorney here unless you want to retain one for whatever you may have been cited for at the scene. Your insurance should handle this matter.
Then your insurance company will do their job. And frankly they’re entitled to their assessment of fault and to act accordingly. Your lawyer may try to persuade them but she couldn’t actually change anything they don’t agree to change.
But again, your OP and your subsequent comments make it relatively clear that you have at least a large share of, and potentially all of fault here. Your obligation to drive in such a way that you manage not to collide with stationary objects, even when in the middle of the road, is nearly absolute.
Left another comment about that situation leaving ample room……this person would have been hit by anyone, only I was so fortunate enough to be the lucky one.
