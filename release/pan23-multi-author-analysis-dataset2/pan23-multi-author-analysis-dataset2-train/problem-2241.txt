I actually look forward to hearing a reporter ask him if it's true as he "re-truthed" that he's running because he can't stomach all the children being murdered to appease a pagan demon God.
"I don't know much about pagan demon gods, but I know about God, and I like God, and I know God likes me, so if God likes me, then I think the demons are bad so it would be bad to murder children to appease a demon God – it would be bad to murder children for any God — but the liberal Democrats don't want God... They don't want God... so they would actually have the demon God instead and the child murder, so I don't know anything about the children being murdered, but if the Democrat party were murdering children — and we love our children, don't we? We love our children— then of course I couldn't stomach it... Couldn't stomach it.".
