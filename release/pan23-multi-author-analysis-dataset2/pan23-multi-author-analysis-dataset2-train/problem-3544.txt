I believe he broke this because he wasn't answering my emails during my tasking and I did not get my questions answered. I believe this made my efforts a failure because he did not help me as he said he would.
Action Steps and Tasking must be followed to the letter to ensure the maximum success of the Intervention. If action steps are not being followed adequately or instruction are not being followed we reserve the right to conclude the program.
You’ll have to find something specific that was promised to be provided and not delivered. If they said they’d provide continuous feedback with these tasks, you might have a leg to stand on. The clause you cited will not help you.
That language is about YOUR obligations, not his, and nothing you have quoted addresses his requirement to answer emails or questions.
If the contract outlines a specific programme to be followed that was not, then this could be a breach but it sounds like you were offered the services you paid for, they just didn’t meet your expectations/requirements.
Without reading the contract it would be impossible for anyone to say whether he is in breach but it’s extremely unlikely anyone would contractually commit to any kind of outcome for you in this circumstance (such as improving or resolving depression) and even if they did it’s likely unenforceable as it’s completely subjective. In fact you would expect to see a disclaimer on this. Much more likely the contract outlines their obligations in terms of goods or services to be provided. I.e. 6 sessions of 1 hour etc.
When I also talked to him, He said that my depression will go and after the 4th session I felt worse. He ignored me. I just don't believe he held up his end.
