You can use the judgement to levy bank accounts and such, that's often more of a hassle than getting the judgement in the first place, unfortunately.
Did you write them a check for your deposit? If so, look in your bank statements and see if you have a copy of the cancelled check, and can see what bank they use. (The bank the check was deposited in usually prints information on the back of the check, hopefully there will be some identifying information.).
They have 21 days to pay. At the end of those 21 days, if they don't pay, you can send them to collections. If the defendant is an individual, the court can order their wages be garnished at 25% of their paycheck until the debt is repaid. I am not sure how this would work if the defendant is the business itself, though. I would imagine a court clerk can help you with this process though once you are in the collections phase.
Then file a Request and Writ for Garnishment (Nonperiodic) with the Court, and once the Judge signs it, send it to their bank. There is a SCAO form for this, the form number is MC 13.
