If there’s an active issue landlord should fix it. If there’s just a bunch that needs to be done when there’s next work done, you can’t force that.
Does the house fail to meet current electric code as it sits? Or does it fail to meet current electric code for the improvement of supporting EV charging?
I'm assuming both, because it still uses a fuse box. When the internet guy came to install when we moved in, he claimed he couldn't find a ground either in the home and it was illegal for them to install internet at the address due to that (he did it anyway though).
Building codes often don’t apply to existing properties unless or until some amount of work is done on that system.
In most cases a home electrical system that met code at the time it was installed would not need to be ripped and replaced unless the house was remodeled or there was some level of electrical work otherwise being done. In that case, the house may not be at the current electrical code, and the landlord may not be obligated to correct that.
