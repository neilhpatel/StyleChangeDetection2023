I'm not sure I understand. Are they giving you a permanent work from home position or something? If the office isn't reopening, where are you working?
If they're just keeping you on working remotely, you will want to look into being able to either claim some work espenses on your taxes (usually a portion of rent and utilities) or seeing if they will be providing a stipend to employees. A lot of companies are realizing that they can just close their offices and offload the cost of rent, internet, electricity etc onto their employees.
Title: Company got rid of office during pandemic and says its not coming back, do I have any recourse?
Yes, I am expected to permanently work from home. I've been doing so since last year but was planning on going back into the office once it was reopened.
