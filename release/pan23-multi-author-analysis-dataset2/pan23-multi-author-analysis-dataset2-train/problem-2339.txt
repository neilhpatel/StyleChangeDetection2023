Your insurance company does not want to pay this claim. They will have the resources to mount a solid defense. It is unlikely you will have resources beyond theirs. Let them handle it.
Surrender the situation to Geico and get out of their way. Do NOT hire a PI to try to prove facts of the case and DO NOT start stalking this dude and harassing him over his alleged injuries. This is literally what you have insurance for; There is no "BS" to get you out of, its your insurances problem.
The question I have here is, how is it exactly that this becomes the insurance company's problem that they will step in? If I'm this guy, I'm thinking "oh shit this law suit is suing my wife directly ". Why wouldn't the insurance company be like "hey we don't have anything to do with this beyond deciding to pay the claim or not, that's your problem".
A lawsuit was always an option. Usually it happens after any insurance settlement is reached, but it goes down the same regardless. Your insurance company will provide the attorney for your wife's defense. There is no "outside of insurance" or "private lawsuit" because your insurance company is bound to defend her in court, period.
If the settlement is within the insurance policy limits, yes. A lawsuit could still be expected after settlement if the party's losses exceed the limits of what the insurance company will pay.
It's common to sue privately, and then the other party just involves their insurance. If you don't know a person's insurance provider but you know who the person is, just suing them privately is the fastest way to find out.
