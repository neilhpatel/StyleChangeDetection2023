Concerning, but not unprecedented as stated in the article. There have been others. It warrants close observation by health authorities. I hope they can get more information about the potential vector.
No cause for alarm at this time, but the world must be on guard in case that changes because it could change quickly. There's a lot of sensational bs around these topics sometimes, but this is genuine as far as I can tell.
It's also noteworthy that many dead animals have been observed. I take that to mean that various animals have been observed dead more than usual. We are observing the current H5N1 strain exhibit enhanced mammal to mammal transmission in nearly every region of the world.
This current outbreak has been ravaging avian populations for some time and has been classified as the worst and most widespread outbreak in history. It makes me wonder how long ago this mutation occurred, and are we still in the proliferation stage, or has this mutation been present since the beginning of the outbreak and only now observed?
Not yet, as of now it is only spread through contact with dead/infected birds and consumption of infected poultry meats. The thing experts are worried about Is exactly when and if this does make that giant jump, which there's still a lot more it's gotta do.
