The rules around child abandonment can be tricky, but the simple answer is if you feel like you're being abused/neglected, you should contact CPS. If you can stay with your dad while any investigation takes place, that's probably for the best. If your dad is willing to take on more custody, see if he can get a legal aid organization to represent him in court to change your custody arrangement. Since you're 17, the judge will take what you have to say into account, and any findings CPS makes could also come into play.
I live in New Jersey and I want to know because my mom has abused me for so long and I’ve considered trying to get my dad custody of me if she got legal consequences for child endangerment, I want to know if this is enough to prove that and what steps to take if it is and what would happen to me and my little brother.
No my dad did come to get me abit after my mom had left, I just don’t know how to use the train to get back to my moms house because she didn’t tell me and just left.
