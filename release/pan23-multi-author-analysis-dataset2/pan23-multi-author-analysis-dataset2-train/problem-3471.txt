Not a WV licensed lawyer. I assume this is in small claims due to the amount? If so, if your contract reads that if the sale was not completed by that date, earnest money is forfeited, then you are likely entitled to keep the earnest money. That is really the entire purpose of earnest money, a deposit to "buy" time to complete the transaction.
However, this was the attorney chosen by the buyers and who initially advised them they could sue for the earnest money so I’m not sure how seriously to take him.
Keep in mind anyone can file a case, but that doesn't mean they will win. Take all of your evidence and put it together, notes, emails, texts, copy of signed contract, etc and prepare to defend your case. Good luck.
It is in small claims court. The lawyer that was handling the closing advised us to pay and suggested that a judge would likely rule against us and order the money returned because the contract is “vague.”.
Did the contract have a financing contingency? If so, this is not likely to break in your favor in court (although I doubt they are getting double their earnest money back).
