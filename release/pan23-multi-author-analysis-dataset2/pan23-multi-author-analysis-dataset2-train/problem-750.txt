That's a declaration of facts (probable cause) to support issuance of the search warrant. You're gonna wanna try to read that if you want to really know what's going on.
I just need something soon cause my 2 kids I can get back from the state as long as he's in jail or a pfa is in place..till fbi want to do their case against him.
Sadly this has happened before and the previous wife died 2 weeks before the case was in court.... she was the main witness to their case...it got dropped due to her death.
Even if you don't hire them then and there, it would be a good idea to have the name and number of an attorney who knows what's going on in your back pocket just in case. Best case is you don't ever need to talk to them again, worst case is you have them ready if the DA decides you might have been in on it.
It probably wouldn't hurt you to consult with a criminal defense attorney who has experience defending federal cases.
Your dealing with the FBI is probably all on the up. and up. But mistakes and misunderstandings happen.
