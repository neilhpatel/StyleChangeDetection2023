If you still have the keys and are paying rent/utilities, then you still technically live there, even if your things have been removed from the apartment. He cannot force you to buy out the remainder of your lease.
Unless there is some provision in your lease stipulating a process for this, then you can carry on doing what you’re doing. If you’re still paying, regardless of if you don’t reside there, you’re still entitled to access and use the space as if you were there full time. Often times there is a clause concerning if you won’t be there for an extended period, but you’ve obviously provided notice and been acknowledged. Save any communications you’ve had with your landlord, especially if you can find where he agreed to it.
Purely speculation, but it sounds like he wants you to cut him a check for the full value of the remainder of the lease then find a new tenant for the house/room, effectively double dipping the rent collected.
If he continues to press it, you could say that you’ll gladly accept being released from the agreement with no further charges and waiving the future rent, but otherwise plan to continue as agreed upon. He has no basis to demand the entirety of the remaining rent be paid immediately and you to forfeit your tenancy.
If your lease has an early lease buyout fee in it, that is generally an OPTION to exercise rather than to pay rent until the end of the lease. If you are paying as in the lease, you can move out and continue paying, just make sure to notify the LL you are not renewing.
You can continue to pay each month. Unless you signed something saying upon early moveout you would buy out your lease tell him to pound sand and keep paying as you are.
Unless someone else is there, you do need to keep the utilities on as well. If the LL re-rents the home, you no longer owe rent.
