They are police officers I see them frequently making traffic stops but I don’t believe their the ones questioning people. I have heard there are undercover ATF that stop people walking out of gas stations asking them for their ID.
You aren't really under any obligation to answer any demand from strangers. If you live in a stop and identify state, you may have to identify yourself to a peace officer, but you don't need to assume that any random person with a Rouge or an F-150 is necessarily a cop. An officer who wants to stop you will identify themselves, and you can call 911 or your local police department to confirm their identity if necessary.
We'll need to know your state to really answer that, but as a baseline: Someone you think might be an undercover cop, and a total stranger, are the same thing. You don't owe strangers any favours.
