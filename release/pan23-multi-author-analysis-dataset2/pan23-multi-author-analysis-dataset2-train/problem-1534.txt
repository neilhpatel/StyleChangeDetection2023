worth noting as well, you're going to get an increase in accidents when you have an increase in activity. For example, you don't usually slip and fall when you're calmly going about your business. You slip and fall when you're rushing or are short on sleep. Same goes for equipment failure. If the equipment is just sitting unused, it's not going to break or cause an accident. Once you start mobilizing it, that's when it breaks. You can't drop a crate of explosives if they never move from storage. Only when you start moving/using them can you have an accident with them.
.... 30.2F isn't summer weather for a large part of the globe. Like seriously you can just Google the Temps in the arctic and realize that it's warmer than freezing during the summer, Antarctica is colder but it still averages above freezing.
It's reasonable to assume that a certain percentage of these are not from sabotage or an attack but plain old human error, which has likely increased 100 fold as a direct consequence of the war.
