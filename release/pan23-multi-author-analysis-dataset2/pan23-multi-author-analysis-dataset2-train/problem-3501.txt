The social democratic party won the last election, but instead of forming a government with the left wing parties, as they've usually done, they choose to make a coalition with two right wing parties.
In Switzerland it's easier to vote on stuff actually, if you can convince 100'000 people (that's 1/80 of the total population) to sign your initiative in 18 months, you can force a vote on the national scale on basically anything.
Man, people really need to stop playing economist and just vote in their interests. It's so extremely rare that a government will flat out let you vote on something directly in your interests. Just take it.
The result is this unwanted bastard child. They can't even defend the proposed law and nobody wants to admit where it actually came from.
But now digging into it, it seems someone other than me is right because the lowest rate is 36%, not 44%.
Same here, hard atheist but if you want to have public holidays for some saint or whatever then have at it. What kind of idiot opposes public holidays? The more the merrier.
Swiss democracy is the best form of democracy I know tbh. Sadly it doesn't solve common democracy problems like voter apathy and the power of lobbyists... But it's still doing pretty well in comparison to most other places.
