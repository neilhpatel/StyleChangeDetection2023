Very few jurisdictions create a general duty for one adult to rescue another, or even to call emergency services. It's possible that one spouse would have an elevated duty of care towards the other, but it's likely the police looked at this at the time - if no action was taken, I doubt a police report now will go anywhere.
Civilly, the limitations period will have closed years ago on any estate claims related to your father's assets or any other property of yours, his, or your brother's.
A few jurisdictions have no such limitations period on serious crimes, but even then, 15 years is a long time for probable cause to fade and reasonable doubt to rise.
Then your legal guardian should have made a claim at the time. If you only just turned 18 you might have been able to make a claim, but there‚Äôs next to no chance now.
So she stole our belongings and most like stole them to sell because she is also a drug addict. And one month later, she remarried. So there‚Äôs nothing to do?
Not from a decade and a half down the line, no. The time to act was within a few years of this whole thing happening.
I was never aware of them until my uncle told me about it. You have to realize my dad has been dead since 2005 so I was 8 years old and had no knowledge of it until yesterday when I was told. Forgive me for being a child and not realizing the big picture üëçüèº.
Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not talking about what she may have done with regards to your dad, just the stolen property. How did no-one notice property was missing for 15 years? If you misplace an item it usually doesn‚Äôt take you 15 years to notice that it‚Äôs not where it‚Äôs supposed to be. There is no way for you to get those items back now, they‚Äôre long gone.
