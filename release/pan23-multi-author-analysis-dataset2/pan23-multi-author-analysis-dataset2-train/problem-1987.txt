No, it was not possible to own a white slave. Though that technically might depend on what you consider "white". Legally speaking, anybody who was at least 1/4 black, and their mother was enslaved, was also considered enslaved. Anybody between 1/4 and 1/8, it depended. Anybody less than 1/8 was considered free. So, there could be people who "looked white" but were enslaved because of how much black ancestry they had.
More can always be said, but you may be intrested in these previous answers to similar questions in this sub before:
The last time this question was asked, someone followed up with the question of whether or not white slavery was outright illegal, or if it was just against social norms of the day. I followed up with . In short, it was illegal. White people weren't held as slaves because it was against the law to do so.
Is the 1/8 thing true? I’ve read several stories of people who were less than 1/8 and were still in bondage—since slavery followed the status of the mother. OP back to your question, their were some white people albeit they had black ancestry. When the propaganda increased to end slavery, they used white looking slave children in the post cards.
Anyway I came upon this comment and thought immediately of Eleanor Butler, who became a slave in colonial Maryland by consensual marriage to a black slave. This is obviously not at all the kind of example OP was looking for, but it's an interesting one nonetheless, I'd definitely enjoy hearing your thoughts on the matter.
Hi, saw an informative answer of yours in another thread and was reading many of your (very informative) comments on various 19th century topics, really appreciate the time you spend on them.
