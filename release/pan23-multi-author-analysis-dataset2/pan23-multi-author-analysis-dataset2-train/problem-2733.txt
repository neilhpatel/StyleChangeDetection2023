Thank you We are in a single-unit house. I am no lawyer, but in reading thru AB1482, I don't see anything that protects us. What are you referring to specifically? Tx.
What's the end date on your lease? She can't force you to move just because she wants to sell. The lease would transfer with the property to whoever the new owner is. She wants to get you out bc it would be easier to sell the house without a tenant.
Single family homes are exempt from AB 1482 if the landlord has provided written notification that you are in exempt housing. It can be part of your lease, or have come as a separate notice. If you have not received a notice, the landlord may have lost her exemption.
Unfortunately with a month to month you don't have that long term protection of your tenancy. I don't know enough about eviction to help much further, I would suggest reaching out to your local tenant's union and/or a housing lawyer. Your tenant's union should be pretty easy to find by just googling your city + tenant's union. Good luck!
