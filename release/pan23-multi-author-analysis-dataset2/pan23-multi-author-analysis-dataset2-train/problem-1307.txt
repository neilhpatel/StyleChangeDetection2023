Your parents need a lawyer. Your location matters, but the US requires compliance with the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) for businesses. If your parents are in violation of that they can be sued. The fact that this lawyer \may\ be doing this to many other businesses is largely irrelevant.
That's just an example, and the actual suit would have details of the proposed infraction. Below is alink to the govt regs for this for businesses if you want some dense reading on the topic. But really, you need a lawyer and soon.
However, there have been a slew of lawyers suing businesses without ever verifying an ADA violation.
Public businesses have to be accommodating to people with disabilities. That can mean A LOT of different things, but wheelchair accessibility is a good example: could someone in a motorized wheelchair get into your parents' restaurant unaided, including into the bathroom? If not, that could be an issue.
I can't guess what your parents might mean. If they have general liability insurance, they need to tender this as a claim and see if their insurer will provide a lawyer. If they do not (and they should) they need to retain one. The consequences if they do not are potentially devastating.
Title: My parent's restaurant is being sued by a handicap lawyer, and they told me the same lawyer has sued hundreds of restaurants.
The restsraunt owners are going to need to hire a lawyer, and also verify if there even was a violation.
