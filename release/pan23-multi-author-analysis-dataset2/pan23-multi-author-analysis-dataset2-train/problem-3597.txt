Unless you have told your boss that you need a reasonable accommodation they are not required to just assume that the fact that you have said you would not be able to drive or focus on work is due to a disability. As importantly, the Americans with Disabilities Act only requires a reasonable accommodation. In most cases unexcused absences are not a reasonable accommodation. Have you worked for the company for more than a year? Does the company have more than 50 employees within 75 miles of your location? You may have better luck with coverage under the Family and Medical Leave Act than you will with the Americans with Disabilities Act. You should still ask for an ADA accommodation, but as presented the facts here do not suggest there is an obvious ADA violation, there may have been one, but its not a certainty.
However, and I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but they are also only required to give a reasonable accommodation. Reasonable typically is judged on a number of criteria, but "Days off without warning" is a challenge to establish as reasonable, and the VA law specifically protects employers from actions where the disability leaves the employee "unable to adequately perform his duties, or cannot perform such duties in a manner which would not endanger his health or safety or the health or safety of others.".
You need to do that immediately. Unless you explicitly request an accommodation, most laws do not protect you. She doesn't need to give you the option, you need to specifically request it. The ADA Title 1 would only really applies to them if they employ 15 or more people, but VA also has their own anti-discrimination statues that might apply.
