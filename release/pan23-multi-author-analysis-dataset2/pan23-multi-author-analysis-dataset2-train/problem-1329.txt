How about we do primaries on multiple states one week, and then the same in weeks that follow and shorten our primary season so it's not 4 months long leaving half of the states without any relevance?
Honestly, I'd rather New Hampshire be first in the nation than South Carolina. It is a swing state, is small and cheap enough for lesser known or less funded candidates to meet voters and make their case, and in my opinion typically votes for the better candidates in the primary (with a few exceptions). South Carolina seems a bit pointless to start with if you are also going to have Georgia as an early state (and unlike South Carolina, that is an actual swing state).
