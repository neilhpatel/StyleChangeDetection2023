If she is trying to collect money from you outside of the AirBnb app, contact them immediately. They will shut her right down. I would tell her you need her to message you through the app so you have some proof of this for Airbnb, then contact customer support. If she refuses to message this to you via the app, then go ahead and make a complaint to the service.
Was this $900 specified in the AirBNB listing? If not, then I'd contact AirBNB and tell them a property owner is claiming you owe her a fee that's not specified in the listing and that you never heard about until after the rental was over. Let them get in touch with her.
Good to know! You would hope they would have a system like that, but you never know how crappy some company's back-end systems are - or how hard it is to get that informative from the company.
If she does sue, it would almost certainly be in small claims court -- it would cost more than $900 to hire the attorney. And, despite what most people think, losers in litigation in the US don't pay winners' attorneys. (Except in some very specific cases.) And, without any evidence other than her recollection, that's not going to go very far.
NAL but can confirm small claims in CA does not allow either party to be represented by an attorney in an initial trial. If it gets appealed to trial de novo, then attorneys are allowed to represent.
