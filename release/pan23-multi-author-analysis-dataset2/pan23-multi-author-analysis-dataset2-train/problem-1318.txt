There are ways for other countries to ask to take over such investigations, if they have a good reason for it, but generally they can't start their lawsuit for the same thing. Otherwise we'd see 26 more lawsuits every time one of these succeed.
This is a violation of EU law, so it's no different if it's EC issuing the fine or individual countries. And it's more common for individual countries to do so, as EC is simply not big enough to watch everything.
