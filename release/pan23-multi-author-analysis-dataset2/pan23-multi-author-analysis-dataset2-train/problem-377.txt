True, thinking about doing this. I just looked up the noise ordinances in our county and I definitely believe that it meets the standard of nuisance noise.
Otherwise have you checked your local noise ordinances? At some point that is disturbing the peace, or similar.
Just a thought but can you leave them a VM at 5:03 AM? The lovely sounds of barking and howling making it harder for thrm to hear you at 5 AM might leave an impression.
It's horrible that you have to deal with that. But maybe id the owner knew they could find a work around to relax the dog when they go.
But on the bright side I did just check my county’s noise ordinances and bark laws and I’m thinking about filing an affidavit.
Yes they did mention that they’d be willing to, the only issue is that the type of unit that I’m currently in is in high demand and they rarely have units open, so it would likely take a hot minute before we’d be able to move forward with that.
Unfortunately don’t have any of their contact info or else I’d totally I something like this .( that’s why I was gonna try to leave them a note first or something cuz I rarely see them.
