As the repeated line goes, "AskHistorians is an actively-moderated subreddit." Per Rule 4, answers must be , based on good historical practice. Just being 'correct' is insufficient by the sub's standards. An answer is not good just because it's correct; it's good because it explains. It is not enough that I cry "no" when people come by asking if the people of the Medieval Era drank alcohol all the time because the water was unsafe; I must explain why that's a myth, what the Medievals actually did drink, and why.
Honestly, it's better to come onto the sub to browse it directly instead of popping into the threads that come up on your recommended feed; indeed, those threads tend to have a higher incidence of people coming in who aren't used to the sub's moderation. Give it time, browse the Digest and while you wait.
It takes time for a good answer to be written. I'm a homebody with no life and I still take around four hours from when I spot a question in my bailiwick to hitting the post button. Now consider that some of the people here have actual jobs, or don't hang around sniping the New queue, or have classes to teach, and it's easy to see why it can be a bit of time, not to mention the time necessary to write that answer in the first place. (Or in some cases, the emotional labour required to answer the question is currently unavailable. Hell, even I have it easy just by linking posts and I still get bouts of "I cannot deal with Nazi bullshit right now" - what more for someone who needs to devote six hours into writing about Nazi bullshit?).
What a strange comment. Lots of questions never get answered, sometimes really interesting questions. But I have learned so much about obscure matters of history with really in depth answers that people have clearly taken a lot of time to write out. Including references.
