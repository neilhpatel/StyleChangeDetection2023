Honestly, coupling your age with the speed. I don’t think you’ll serve any time, that’s not common at all. This will, however, likely be an expensive lesson.
Sometimes judges offer to let you complete a driving course, the one in my state is Alive at 25. Often times they’ll order you to take that and take then they’ll drop the ticket. I’d be hoping for that outcome.
Reduced to a lower penalty? Possible. Dropped? Exceptionally slim chance at 30+ over the speed limit. I dont see a state and that is important in determining what the penalties could be.
On the other hand, a motorcycle cops sole purpose is traffic enforcement. All they do all day is write traffic tickets. Unfortunately this means that more often than not the tickets stick.
If found guilty of reckless driving, yes, that is likely. This is where an attorney can help. They might be able to negotiate it down to a lesser charge. Either way will still likely be pricey though.
In KS, 20-25 over qualifies as reckless driving. If that's what you were charged with and if convict of that charge, it's a minimum of 5 days jail (90 max) and up to $500 fine. It usually also comes with a one year license suspension.
Get an attorney. They may be able to get it knocked to a lower speeding violation, but don't be surprised if it is costly and you spend some time with out a license.
