This issue isn't so much weather it was a valid contract or not. Oral agreements are often just as valid as written ones. The issue is simply one of evidence. Without any evidence that points to your side of the story as to an oral agreement existing, the agreement may as well not have existed, as courts are rarely going to rule on enforcing an oral agreement in a he said she said situation. If you had for instance, texts that corroborate your version of events, or assuming legal in your jurisdiction, audio recording of the agreement, that would shift it in your favor instead in general.
In that case, it wouldn't hurt to look around for local attorneys who could take a look at to see if you have a case worth pursuing. Many will give you a free or low cost consultation to see if they think you have something. Contacting your local bar association for a referral would be a good first step. In Iowa this would be through the Iowa Bar's internet portal service at which specifically has a filter for layers willing to do a quick 30min consult for $25 or less.
