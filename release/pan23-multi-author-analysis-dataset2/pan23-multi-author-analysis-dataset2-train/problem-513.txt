well it was a red wave this year, like republicans won popular vote wise, got the house, Nevada governorship, bunch of districts in new York. also held senate seats in Ohio, north Carolina and Wisconsin, the latter two with about 2 point difference and Ohio by 6 points. the fact it wasn't a bloodbath, an absolute wreak for the dems speaks to the fact that the dems shock of all shock, ran good candidates in most places. including Ohio. but this year was a good year for republicans.

Yeah, both made headlines for ethical violations that while they weren’t charged definitely looked scummy as hell (potentially insider trading using info about the start of the pandemic…).
