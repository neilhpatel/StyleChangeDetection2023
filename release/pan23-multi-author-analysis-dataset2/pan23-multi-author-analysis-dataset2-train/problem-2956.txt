Generally, personal car sales are as-is. The buyer should have the vehicle inspected before the purchase, and accepts the condition of the vehicle at the time of the sale.
That means as soon as the buyer drives away with it it’s their car. It’s on them to do a prepurchase inspection and identify any issues prior to buying it. You have no obligation to refund their money and they will not win in court unless they can prove you knowingly knew it would break down the day after they bought it.
There are circumstances in which you might be liable for a refund. (e.g., you unplugged the airbag warning light to cover up an issue with the airbags), but as long as you didn't do anything purposefully-underhanded, you have nothing to worry about.
