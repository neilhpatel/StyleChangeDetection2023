It's neither of those things, otherwise the seller would return the deposit and keep the car. They're trying to steal from your friend. He should demand the deposit back in cash or a cashier's check and, if they refuse, sue them. Depending on the state and amount this may be settled in small claims court.
Suing for performing specific action (enforcing the contract/ making him sell the car) likely isn’t worth it. He’s going to need a lawyer and private car sales really don’t warrant that.
He can get his deposit back by suing In small claims. He can google the county court house and there will be instructions on how to file.
Check the contract and see what it says. Specifically - is there a way for the seller to cancel? And is there a specific date for the sale of the car to be completed? Likely if they wrote it up it doesn't say anything about cancelling or breach and may not say specifically that the sale has to be closed by X time. Specific performance is not generally available in a situation like this, so it's just monetary damages. The return of the deposit is most likely, but are there additional damages? If so, what are they? Has the price of similar cars gone up?
Don't forget damages if the price of the same or a similar vehicle is now higher, since you'll be paying the higher price because of the actions of the seller.
