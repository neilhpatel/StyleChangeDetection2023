So what is OP to do? They do not consent to being recorded and at the same time will not provide OP with the recording they made. It does not seem like a level playing field.
You should not rely on “implied” consent for this. And no, my consenting to me recording is not logically the same thing as me consenting to you recording.
Tried that and they ignore my request to have it in writing. They just repeat whatever they said verbally. It is very bizarre.
The truth is that recording an agent wouldn’t do as much as you’d like it to anyway. Mistakes by their agents that deviate from the policy terms are correctable. Even if you managed to record the agent saying something advantageous it just wouldn’t do very much. And again, I’d definitely not record someone, especially in this situation where you’ve been told by other agents that you don’t have their permission to do so, on the basis that they’re recording.
I didn’t know there’s a written process that can simulate the phone call so I’d have to explore this.
I know that recordings won’t help when an insurance agent could’ve made an honest mistake. However, in my situation, it would have helped to record my phone call with the doctors office to prove that I did schedule a primary care visit.
I am asking about this to protect myself from unforeseen charges and errors on the doctor’s/insurance’s ends that negatively would affect me. This isn’t to try to take advantage of a system or to do a “gotcha” on them. It’s so that I don’t get punished for their errors.
