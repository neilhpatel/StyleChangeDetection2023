If I wanted to steal her money I would and wouldn't ask Anything. It's a real question because the child has been my dependent. From what I have read I'm fairly certain I can.
I'm not some evil guy trying to find a loophole, I gave her the child tax credit from our taxes. I moved my stuff out and didn't fight for our apartment or anything.. Even with things ending so spiteful I still love them and want them to be happy and do well.
The irs will sort this out eventually and pay her if she files correctly. And they may ask you for the money. I'm not sure what their most recent advice is for payments that went to someone incorrectly. This isn't a new question, but there isn't a clear answer. In the initial round, they said they weren't going to ask for payments back, but it's unclear what they're doing after that to sort out where money went. I don't think people are advised to self help and give money to someone directly and expect that to be official unless it was a joint return.
I know that but isn't the cares act basically a tax credit for the 2020 fiscal year? To recoup money lost in the pandemic? I'm not trying to argue I'm just trying to understand. I appreciate you responding with facts.
I meant I gave her the child tax credit I received in the tax return I got for 2020 recently. The child tax credit in the bill comes on 2021's taxes, and some in summer or something.
The child tax credit in the new act is for the year 2021, and is available whether the parents pay taxes or not.
It wasn't a joint return, she just started working for the first time this year. If I didn't claim them she wouldn't have gotten the child tax credit which I gave to her despite all this crap.
