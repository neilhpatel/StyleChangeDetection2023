Green cards are valid for ten years. Are you saying that you didn't apply to remove conditions from your two year conditional green card? If so, you are definitely not a permanent resident any more and you will have to start from scratch.
Even if you did apply for removal of conditions, living abroad this long without a re-entry permit will almost certainly mean you're found to have abandoned your status (also meaning back to square one).
So it looks like I have to start all over again, meaning I won’t be able to since I’m no longer married….
Aside from that, you are correct that you start all over again with no firm routes back to the US on a long term basis. Sorry to pile on the bad news!
Yes. Belgium is a signatory to the Hague Convention so there are established processes for doing child support internationally. Since he has acknowledged paternity (and it sounds like there isn't any uncertainty anyway) it should be fairly open and shut, although probably quite slow to process. In many cases, US child support orders don't get backdated beyond the point where the custodial parent filed, so file early.
It is likely, though not certain, that your son is an American citizen. Depends on the father's residence in his younger years - if he lived in the US for at least five years, at least two of which were after age 14, he transmitted American citizenship to your son. However, your son cannot sponsor you for permanent residence until he turns 21. He also can't do this if he does not himself wish to return to the US at this time.
His father was born in the states and has been there ever since so yeah my son definitely has citizenship.
