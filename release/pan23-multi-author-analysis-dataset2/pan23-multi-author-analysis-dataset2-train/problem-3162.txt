Canada seems to be giving it to the lowest bidder because companies like Nestle just rob us for next to nothing so obviously someone is getting paid on the side for selling off our fresh water.
The continuous Canadian meme of "Canada's reputation should be far shittier than it is!" across basically any subject you can think of is getting tired---it's just cynical. We are one of the better countries when it comes to this issue and the recent decision to advance the introduction of a publically searchable beneficial ownership registry represent continued progress.
I like how capital ownership of heavily regulated utility companies being spun as some grand conspiracy. What a load of horseshit journalism. We live in a global capitalist system, investors from Taiwan and the U.S owning water companies functions identically to British investors owning them.
Of course Canadian pension plans own 15% of England's water system. It seems like every global investment story has at least one Canadian pension plan these days.
The article doesn't seem to have any point? What problem is being caused? This was done in the 70s and 80s, have we had some issue with water that I missed since then? The companies performing poorly should have their license revoked, those are governmental issues.
