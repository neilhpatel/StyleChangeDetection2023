Any time a Dem has a microphone in front of them, they need to strongly reject the notion that MAGA Republicans are conservatives.
Sure we can sit here and hash out the minutiae and talk about how mainstream conservatism willingly took this poisoned pill--and kept taking it, and taking it for years leading up to this point--but the continued use of the label "conservative" gives MAGA Republicans the convenient fa√ßade of a traditionally accepted ethos in American politics when in reality they are anything-but "conservative".
In my experience there is a significant portion of the electorate that just hasn't yet been challenged on the idea of what it actually means to be a conservative, and how the MAGA crowd willfully defies those ideals.
The average voter just isn't likely to piece this together on their own. It needs to be a challenged frame of reference everywhere.
Oh, do they have a platform again? They literally abandoned having a platform. Even the RNC's website was scrubbed. They may have reinstated one, though.
