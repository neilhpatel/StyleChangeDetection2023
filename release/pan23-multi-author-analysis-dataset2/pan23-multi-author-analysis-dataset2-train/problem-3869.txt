Social media is a portion of it, but yea, the problem is what they SEE when they log onto social media. Huge chunks of America are not a good or even reasonable places to be a woman right now. Our former president was literally going around "grabbing women by the \_\_\_", paying off porn stars then watching them get robbed by their own lawyers, before getting elected and swearing in people whose sole mission in life was to remove reproductive rights from women. It's truly devastating and sad.
