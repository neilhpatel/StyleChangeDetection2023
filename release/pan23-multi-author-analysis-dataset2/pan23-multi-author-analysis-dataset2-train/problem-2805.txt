You know what I don't do in life? Teaching. You want to know one of the reasons? Shit pay for shit work. The shit work part doesn't point towards the actual teaching part, as that's technically not the majority of the job. Teaching is bogged down in administrative bullshit where I live as well as entitled parents making your life miserable. Why on earth would I subject myself to that when I can earn significantly more working significantly less in the private sector?
But also, we need to dramatically improve food & air quality. Tons of studies have come out these last 10 years, showing how kids' brains are being badly affected by junk food and pollution (not only loss of IQ, but also higher likelihood of mental health issues).
Frankly, saying that we should pay them shit because they aren't doing a good job is a feedback loop of idiocy perpetrated by the idiots who would suggest such a thing.
If the pay is shit, the only people doing the job are people who aren't good enough at other things.
