Normally requests to serve by publication are denied if you don't show due diligence in trying to locate and personally serve. Did you submit a declaration from your process server of all of the attempts and a skip trace? Did the court say why you couldn't serve by publication?

It's ordinarily not particularly easy if you have a home or a job. But yes, if you're willing to upend your life, you can "just avoid being served." Due process requires service. Due process is part of the US Constitution.
A process server can do more to try to serve. It will cost a few hundred dollars but they will run a skip trace, get info from the post office, etc, fail to serve, prepare a declaration on all the steps they did to try to serve, and THEN the court will allow you to serve by publication. It's a method of last resort because it's a poor substitute for personal service. Your mom can get it done if it's worth enough to her.
