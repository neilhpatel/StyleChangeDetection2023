Yes but to become a licensed driver she first needs to get the interlock license, the interlock license would be valid for a vehicle with interlock installed. It just restricts her to only a interlocked car. So in my state after a dui, licensed driver or not licensed, is suspended from any and all driving for X amount of time (depends on the state and also if it’s first,second, third, etc dui) from this date to this date. Then you’re restricted with interlock for X time (1 yr starting and again that’s this date to that date) and you can only drive to your school, your work, and your court related places, nothing else. No dropping your kids at their school, no grocery shopping, etc. Very restricted. But those are set dates from the dui so say Jan 1st 2000- Jan 1st 2001, so you can not drive during that timeframe and avoid the restricted location driving, but to regain your full license you will need to complete a certain amount of time with a interlock license, which should be perfectly acceptable with the interlocked car.
In the case of WA they wait 15 years before dropping a DUI/OWI off the driving record. So the person has to either fulfill all agreements or wait till the 15 years until the DUI/OWI drops off. Each state is different but each state will say the same thing, comply or wait until it comes off your record.
