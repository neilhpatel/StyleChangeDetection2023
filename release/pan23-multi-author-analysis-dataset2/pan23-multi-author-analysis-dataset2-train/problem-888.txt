The tiktok page asks for proof of ownership of the copyright in the form of “a certificate, license agreement, and/or other materials.” Even though she probably doesn’t have a certificate or license I think it may still be worth submitting photo identification to prove it’s her in the video and proof of the original upload to Vine. Also, explain the situation, that she was a minor in the video and never consented to anyone else reposting the video. That may or may not be enough but that’s what I would do if I was in her position.
Makes sense, it’s a shame that the original video is gone with the shut down of vine as it would have been a whole lot easier with proving she owns it. As she has changed a lot in appearance in the past years. Plus give your photo ID to tiktok doesn’t feel really save since it’s owned by China. But if it’s the only way than that’s the solution.
It’s worth noting, everything I’ve seen says to first ask the offending account to remove the content. They may be willing to delete the video just to avoid Tiktok taking action against the account.
IANAL but my understanding is she owned the copyright to video the moment it was created even if the song she sang is copyrighted by someone else. That is true even though she didn’t register the copyright.
I’m thinking you shouldn’t even have to assert a copyright to get the video taken down because reposting stolen content almost certainly violates their terms and conditions, not to mention the video is of a minor. You can just report the video and see if that is enough to get the video removed.
