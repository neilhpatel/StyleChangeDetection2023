All a plea bargain proves is that someone was charged with something and decided to enter a guilty plea. Maybe it's because they actually were guilty. Maybe they were trying to avoid the dreaded trial penalty. Maybe they thought that no one would believe in their innocence.
There's no way we could possibly tell you what the likelihood is that he'll receive a custodial sentence.
No case has ever been prosecuted without any evidence. The real question is whether whatever evidence the state presents proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.
Taking a plea is an admission of guilt. A plea agreement is offered as a non-trial resolution to a case that allows the defendant to suffer lighter consequences than they would if they decided to go to trial and be found guilty.
Without knowing details of this specific case, a plea involving a sexual assault will involve prison time and/or sex offender probation as well as mandatory sex offender registration.
There is no difference between a plea deal and being convicted of that charge at trial. Except that you often waive your right to appeal a plea bargain.
Yes, it's a guilty plea. It's an admission of guilt. If it's a felony, you're a felon after you enter into that plea bargain. If you're a sex offender, you might have to register.
Edited: Just realized that you're the same person who posted yesterday saying you had him blocked from dating apps and asking if you could inform his apartment.

The principle of "innocent until proven guilty" still applies even when someone is accused of a heinous crime.
