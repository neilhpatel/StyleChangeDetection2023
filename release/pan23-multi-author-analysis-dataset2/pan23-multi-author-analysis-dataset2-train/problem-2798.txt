You can call the police and report if you think there was a crime. They police can choose to investigate. If they feel a crime was committed, they can discuss with the prosecutor who can choose to "press charges.".
You, as a random guy, cannot "press charges." You can report crimes and choose to participate in investigations if you want.
The simple answer is "Yes. Taking the first swing does not mean you cannot make a criminal complaint for assault".
"She slapped him, he choked her" is exactly the sort of aggravated DV assault where police arrest and charge only the less-severely-injured party.
I can't guarantee that both of you won't be investigated and charged. The one who calls police first is often the one whose story gets more traction.
