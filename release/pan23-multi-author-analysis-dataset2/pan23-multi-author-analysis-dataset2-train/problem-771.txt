It's not really clear from your post, but defending yourself probably isn't following the individual to another room and then assaulting them. It's possible for you both to be guilty of a crime.
What if I don’t hit her tho and I record the situation and call 911 ? Because they threaten me with this like every day even when I try to protect myself verbally because she says really nasty things verbally and they keep saying your abusing a minor and we can call 911.
Of course, if your sister and your granny tell the police you were the aggressor, you may have no way to prove your claims of self-defense, so it won’t really matter so much that your defense was legal.
I had a pet and my sister followed me into the other room because she knew I had it and when I wouldn’t give it to her she hit me really hard and left a red mark. I tried talking things out with her and my grandma first I asked why she didn’t get in trouble for it and I got told I was the issue and if I was to try and defend myself back I would get 911 called on me because it’s hitting a minor?
Mind you my sister is almost 200 pounds I am 147 i have little to no muscle mass when she messes with me it really hurts it leaves a mark I was beyond livid.
