The biggest thing to worry about now is collecting unemployment. If you have an employee handbook look through it for their procedures for discipline. If they dispute your unemployment claim and didn't follow their own established procedures then this will help you.
Yeah I know the at-will law, just feel its kinda illegal to fire someone without a proper investigation. I felt like maybe I could take legal action for slander or defamation. Thanks for taking the time though.
Florida is an at-will state. Lacking a contract or union agreement they can fire you for no reason or any reason under the sun as long as it isn't for being a member of a protected class or in retaliation for filing a complaint with a regulatory agency.
Well I would speculate that those rules are mostly advised by affiliates educated in legality. I will have to give it a gander but I doubt many companies miss any loop holes these days. They’ve been sued twice in the last 5 years and both plaintiff’s won their cases. However the chances are slim. Thanks again!
