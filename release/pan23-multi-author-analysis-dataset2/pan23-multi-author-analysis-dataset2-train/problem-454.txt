When you disclose is up to you. They cannot base your employment on your pregnancy however if you don't have some form of protected maternity leave they may end up firing you for missing some time there.
There is not a lot you can do about them transitioning back into the office and honestly even if you were on work from home they would be pretty reasonable to request that you seek out other childcare and are not taking care of a newborn baby while on the clock.
As a single mom I thought this would be the most financially viable option for me, but having childcare lined up is looking to be my only (albeit expensive) option.
I don't know you're financial situation but you need to prepare financially to be out at least a week. You're not going to be in any state to work effectively.
Whenever feels right. You can't be fired for being pregnant, you could potentially be fired for needing a period of time off (childcare, medical issues, bonding, etc).
You're going to need to disclose before you give birth. The best bet is after all the paperwork is signed. Just fir reference I had a completely normal easy pregnancy and then ended up staying at the hospital for a week because I was induced ( 3 days long) and then had preclampsia with an emergency c section added 4 days to my stay.
