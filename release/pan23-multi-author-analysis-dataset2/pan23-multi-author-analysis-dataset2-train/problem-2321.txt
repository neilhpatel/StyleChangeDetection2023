In addition to the suggestions about a certified letter, I think you should attend your next HOA meeting and bring this up - force it into the public eye and something that has to be documented in their minutes. Bring facts to that meeting - explain that you were not given an explanation of the color tags. Survey your neighbors and bring hard data that says you spoke to X community members and zero understand it. Bring the police report and read from it and ask to enter it into the minutes. Explain that youâ€™ve repeatedly spoken to property management and they are acting in bad faith. Explain that not only are their actions damaging to you but also to your patients who rely on you as a nurse. Ask them point blank for a response on how they plan to permanently resolve this.
You may also want to review whether your HOA complied with . There's quite a bit of detail there; generally some notice is required and maybe a tenant verification (?), though I'm not familiar with the intricacies. Looks like there's also misdemeanors and fines possible, in some circumstances. Good luck!
