Like Zimbabwe or something? There's a reason they choose these two countries, because they can actually get there in time and survive there with the little money they have, now if they are being sent back into the hands of the Russian government they may be forced right into the meat grinder and more people will die in this war. These countries should support every fleeing russian instead and provide them with whatever they need.
I dunno how I feel about this, on one hand I can see the punishment it does to russian citizens, on the other hand those that are turned back will be used as conscripts to give the russian military more bodies to throw on the situation in the coming months.
Imagine you are running away from a murderer with a bloody knife in their hands and you see a taxi cab but the driver locks the doors and speeds off instead of letting you in, how would you feel then? You are then left alone vs a serial killer.
this, this isn't punishing russia at all, its just giving them more unwilling bodies to send to the meat grinder.
Tell that to the estimated 250,000 dead Ukrainian civilians over the past near year. All this past year has proved is that you don't have to he a military genius to commit genocide.
edit: Not all russians are complicit, there are partisans burning factories 24/7. Without foreign aid, it will be hard for the russian people against the regime to choose an anti imperialist russian future.
