You do not have the right to the airspace over your home. In terms of the law, the sky is considered public domain and may be used by aircraft as long as they fly at least a certain number of feet above ground - this is dictated by the population of the area and is usually 500-1000 feet. Although if a plane is taking off or landing, it is exempt from these requirements.
However, many airports do have noise mitigation programs for handling complaints. You can call your local airport to file a complaint and see what can be done. In some cases, they can work with the flight operator to modify flight paths or perhaps give you soundproofing materials under the FAA's Soundproofing Program. It depends on the situation and locality.
I think you are confusing "airspace" with "air rights." You can purchase air rights for the development of buildings. Airspace is the area where aircraft travel. It is public property, can't be purchased or owned, and is exclusively governed by the FAA. If aircraft can operate in it, it is considered navigable airspace.
