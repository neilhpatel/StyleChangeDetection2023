The scammer doesn't really have any incentive to follow through with the threat. Yes, if they do, there's not much you can do about it, but it rarely happens as there's just no upside for the scammer.
They can either not reveal your conversation, and continue trying to get you to pay money. This is ideal, as they can keep trying to blackmail you, and hopefully will eventually squeeze money out of you.
Or, they can follow through and send the messages to other people. The scammer gains nothing from this, as now you will never pay them; they've lost their leverage over you.
In a scam like this, actually going through with their threat is a loss for them. Now I'm not saying that these scammers never actually do follow through, that's totally possible, but it is very unlikely.
It’s a total scam. Do not send money. Just walk away. They may try to intimidate you by having others contact you. In some cases even a “cop” or “pi” will reach out. It’s all bs.
Correct. The Internet's a big place, and word getting out that some random person somewhere in the world got embarrassing pictures revealed really isn't going to inspire somebody else to pay that exact same scammer money. (It might lead to a better chance of success for another scammer, but that's not very useful for the person chasing you.).
The funny thing was she said she was doing this to me for her sick dying son in the hospital. I’m glad I blocked her and didn’t give in to money demands.
The website I spoke too also said if I ignored them they typically follow through and the perpetrator could send the pics too my workplace etc. and portray Me as a pedophile using website extortion? I ignored the blackmailer and now I’m worried this service I contacted are saying these things will happen?
LPT: Do not solicit or transmit pictures of private parts over the Internet until those parts have been seen personally by the other party first.
