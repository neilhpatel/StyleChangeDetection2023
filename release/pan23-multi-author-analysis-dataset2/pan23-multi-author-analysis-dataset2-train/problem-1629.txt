This. It is exactly the correct response. Arrest the vessel. Conduct an official investigation. Levy such fines as provided under [Japanese] law. Then demand an official apology from China for breaching international law and "hurting the feelings" of the Japanese people.
Japan’s Defense Ministry said a Chinese navy survey ship was spotted entering the country’s territorial waters early Sunday near Yakushima, an island in the southern Kagoshima prefecture.
The vessel crossed into Japan’s waters around 2:30 a.m. local time and left at about 4:10 a.m. sailing west, according to a Ministry of Defense statement. The Japanese government relayed strong concerns to China over the intrusion, Kyodo reported.
Funny how they encroach on everyone else’s legal territorial boundaries, but then cry like little bitch’s when other countries sail past their little self-made islands.
China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are the saddest sacks of shameful shit and every threat or posture they put out just reinforces it.
