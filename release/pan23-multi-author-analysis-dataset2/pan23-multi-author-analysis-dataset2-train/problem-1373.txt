You are not obligated until you take possession of the car, and if they show up to your house trying to get you to take it then they are stupid.
A credit check authorization is permission for the institution to try to secure you financing, nothing more. You have a bunch of stuff yet to sign after that point if you wanted to complete the deal.
If there was some kind of fine print in the credit check that by agreeing to the credit check I'm also locking myself into the lease, would something like that even be legal? Would I be able to argue that this document was deceitful if it does say that?
You're not going to have to argue about the document, they cannot force you to accept terms of financing without actually knowing the final financing decision.
For outright auto purchases, the Truth In Lending Act requires bold-bordered boxes with disclosure of the price, duration, interest rate, and amount financed. For leases, the disclosure boxes are about the same but slightly less bold and labeled "Federal Leasing Act and Other Disclosures".
A verbal agreement to an amount due at signing and monthly payment does not create an enforceable lease agreement.
Sorry if I'm just freaking out for no reason, this is my first time buying a car so I really don't know what I'm doing.
Every time I buy a car they say "oh, our license clerk only comes in every other Thursday, and I think we're out of stamps", yet they claim they applied for registration on your lease before getting a signature on the lease agreement ? Even if they got that far ahead of the process, they can get that money back and accept a slap on the wrist from the DMV.
It's just a high-pressure sales tactic. Don't put your signature on anything. If anyone from the dealership calls you again, ask for the spelling of their full name and tell them you're making a complaint with the , then hang up.
Just walk away and dont even communicate. They can even try to deliver the car but as long as you dont sign you are covered.
Also since it is clear they lie to people. After it is done with. I would post a review to warn others.
Thanks. They said they started registration with the DMV or something along those lines, does that matter?
"Started the registration" is meaningless. You just submit a form, it's not like a 6 week process that someone has to keep manually moving along. "Start the registration" is probably like...they printed the sheet out.
Do some research about your budget and whether buying or leasing makes sense for you, but I can give you some very simple legal advice that will never steer you wrong:
