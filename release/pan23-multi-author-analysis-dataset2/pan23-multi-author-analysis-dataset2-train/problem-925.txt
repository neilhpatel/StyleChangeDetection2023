North Carolina Supreme Court flipped to a conservative majority in 2022 and I cannot believe when I say it that GOP will probably send the same maps and the partisan courts will approve it.
Are they going to appeal this until it's "too late to change it" before the next election. North Carolina republicans understand that the courts are ok with having elections with illegal maps. The party shouldn't be allowed to run candidates since they can't create fair maps.
They’ll 100% run out the clock after submitting several increasingly terrible partisan maps. Then they’ll have the election with an illegal map, just like in Ohio where I voted and was wronged by the government.
