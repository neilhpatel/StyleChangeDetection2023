Presumably the dude was moonlighting and you didn't write a check to the actual dealership he works for.
If I read your story correctly, you're driving "his partner's car" but he has the car you paid him for. You've gotten two years of use and wear out out of both vehicles, total.
You can ask for the depreciated value of the now-used tires you put on a car that wasn't titled to you, but in general when you improve or repair a car that you then want a refund on, you forfeit the value of the repairs.
Sue him for the $6,555, plus the depreciated value of the tires, minus the IRS standard mileage rate (0.575 per mile), in the small claims court where he lives.
IRS mileage rate for business use of cars isn't a precise or perfect way to value wear and depreciation, but it's one that a small claims court might accept as reasonable.
Small claims courts have jurisdiction over people who reside in their judicial district (often a particular county), so you have to sue in the city where he lives.
There are "long arm" statutes that apply to situations involving out-of-state vehicle driver or absentee landlords, but they don't apply to your situation.
If you have evidence of his agreement to refund your money, and a reasonable estimate of the money he owes you after this complex set of delays / repairs / exchanges, you're likely to win in small claims court.
He is a licensed dealer and he fixes up cars to sell, from what I gather I'm not the first person this has happened to with this kid.
Does he actually have a lot and offices ? A lot of guys moonlight or curbstone by buying cars at auction, fixing them up, and selling them but not actually being licensed as an auto dealer, or dabbling in related businesses. I've gotten sideways with a few limousine and trucking companies who are always trying to shift around money and liability and often have a curbstoning component.
