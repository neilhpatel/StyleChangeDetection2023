Parts of the city council were pushing local regulation to prevent those evictions as well, but I can't find anything saying that actually passed.
The eviction ban only prevents landlords for evicting you for failure to pay rent, not for failure to leave at the end of your lease. Since you had a month to month lease your landlord has chosen not to renew your lease. If you stay past the date of the end of your lease he will be able to seek to evict you.
You should begin to look for a new place to rent, having an eviction on your record will make it much harder to rent in the future.
Well unfortunately this is the reality of the situation. If the cost of living is too high you may need to consider moving to a different city. You could try to stay with friend and family for a couple months while you save up or look at homeless shelters.
The eviction moratorium is for failure (inability) to pay rent. Your lease isn't being renewed which isn't protected from eviction. You can still be evicted. It's the loophole many landlords are using to free up their properties since overstaying a lease isn't protected. tenant holding over action is how they will legally evict you. It's not protected in any of the eviction moratoriums.
