Not to be glib about it, but we refer to Pearl Harbor as the start of WWII because, well, it was the start -- the initial Japanese attacks on the Philippines did not happen until about 10 hours after Pearl Harbor. While the Philippines were an American colony, they were removed from the mainland to an even greater extent than Hawaii, and the attacks there were simultaneous with a general Japanese drive on western/colonial possessions in Asia.
Your glibness isn't entirely inappropriate; my grandfather (a Filipino) told me the story many times of getting into a cab in Manila and being told that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. He said his reaction was "so they bombed some goddamned Chinese fishing village? who cares?" and the cabbie had to explain what Pearl Harbor actually was. So anecdotally, at least, there's proof there that the Philippines had not been attacked prior to the Pearl Harbor attacks, since presumably my grandfather would have heard about that first rather than Pearl Harbor.
I tell that story just because, as a follow-up question, I'm wondering how much an average educated Filipino like my grandfather could/should have known about the forthcoming invasion of the Philippines. Were they on edge? Would they have known right away that they were next? Had they known that an invasion was inevitable for some time? Was Pearl Harbor a "well, this is it" moment for Filipinos?
