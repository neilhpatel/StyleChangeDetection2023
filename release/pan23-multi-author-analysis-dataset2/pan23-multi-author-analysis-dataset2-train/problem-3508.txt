A surplus is the money the government collected in taxes and other revenue streams that have not been used on public works such as roads and hospitals, police/fire departments, government employees, or other federally funded programs. All this means is the amount of money being spent is now more than want being generated. This is normal in a lot of economies, but can prove to be detrimental to Russia since the sanctions are meant to cause these kinds of economic pains.
You are describing a government budget surplus, which is very different to a current account surplus.
What you're saying needs to be contextualized. Russia is almost entirely an export economy. Russia's exports account for 30% of GDP (source: ) in 2021.
I'm no expert but it sounds like Russia doesn't have a huge national deficit. America is trillions of dollars in debt. Course it's a fiat currency and we can probably just tell the creditors to get fucked. The Federal Reserve is basically a monopoly bank if need be.
No, the American people are basically the collateral. We can rack up a YUGE debt because the American people will pay for it. You're responsible for a percentage of the debt. You didn't lend the government anything.
