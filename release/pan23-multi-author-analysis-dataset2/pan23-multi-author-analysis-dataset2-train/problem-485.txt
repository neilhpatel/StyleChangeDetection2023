You can complain to your city council, but provided that they followed the proper processes and zoning regulations, there likely isn't anything illegal about this.
We have a rehab house in our neighborhood, though not on my street. We had a few problems with unruly tenants.
There's not much you can do on a higher level. It's about reporting the problem tenants to the police. The majority are probably well behaved, but unfortunately you'll just need to continue to call the police on the problem ones. It's possible you might be able to contact the mental health facility running it to discuss those problem tenants as well.
If you're asking whether there's any legal way to force the state to stop using particular homes for this, the answer is "no." You might have a chance on the political side, if enough people complain to the politicians. For individual problems that rise to the level of criminal violations you can keep contacting the police.
I put up the police scanner, and since the police didn't come to the scene for half an hour, the neighbors had gone inside already. I guess I'll keep having to call.
