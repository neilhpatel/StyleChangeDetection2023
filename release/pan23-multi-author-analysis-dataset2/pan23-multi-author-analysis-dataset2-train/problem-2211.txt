Thanks for your response. The ring wasn’t even mentioned during divorce proceedings. And I get the resale value angle. This is the difference between little value and no value. I do have insurance on it. As I understand it, don’t insurance companies want or need to know that, too?
No, I don’t see any reason as to why disclosure would have been required to you at the time. If there was any intent to deceive if the appraisal was used to obtain insurance coverage, that could have been an issue, but it doesn’t sound like there was ever a claim. The only recourse you might have is if the engagement ring was a specific offset at the time of the divorce for something of equal value. The truth is that secondhand engagement rings have little value anyway.
