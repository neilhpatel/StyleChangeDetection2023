It's highly unusual for a BI case to be settled leaving one injured party out in the cold. When there's a policy limits issue, they usually wait to assess all the damages and divide up the pot giving each person a percentage. I'm not familiar enough with TX to know if you can file a 3rd party bad faith suit or only 1st party. You might be able to go after the BI and/or UM of policy for the driver of the car you were in, or your own auto med pay or PIP if you have it.
I wasn't able to ask, as I'm currently still at work and just kind of waiting to get off so I can call them again and hopefully get some more information. To my knowledge, I'm still being represented, but up until this afternoon, I was also under the assumption that I was going to get some form of settlement. With that being said, I'll be updating this post as I learn more.
Honestly, I don't know how TX law works. In PA the ins co will not pay anyone until all claims are presented so they know if they can pay out money without running out. They surely wouldn't screw over the claimant with the biggest claim.
I'm by no means a lawyer, so forgive me; if my lawyer never gave me any reason for the delays, would that still be a possible bad faith suit? To clarify, my old case manager never informed me of any reason as to why it was taking so long, if I could even reach them by phone or email. However, with that being said, the other parties who were involved in the car crash with me have already been paid out, so something isn't adding up to me.
