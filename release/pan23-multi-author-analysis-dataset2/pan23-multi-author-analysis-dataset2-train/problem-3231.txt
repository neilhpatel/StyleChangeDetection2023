If the title is in your name and you can get the car without trespassing (like breaking into a garage or anything) just take it. If he tries to stop you call the cops. Bring the title with you so there is no debating that it's your car.
Well that depends. This private property is somewhere that the OP and his/her GF were previously allowed open invite on to. If there's no signage warning of trespass, the owner will need to articulate that the OP and his/her GF are not welcome on the property and they have been trespassed from this private property. If the property owner tells them they aren't welcome whilst retrieving the OPs property, well then they've been given a trespass warning. But it's not automatic. But it does make for another good reason to have an officer do a civil stand by if you can find one to make an appearance.
I would preemptively bring a police officer with me tbh, local police departments are happy to assist in this kind of matter as long as youâ€™re calling non emergency and not clogging up the emergency line.
