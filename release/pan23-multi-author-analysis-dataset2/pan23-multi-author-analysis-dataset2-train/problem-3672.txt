Eh, i wouldn't say that. Shia and Sunni split is old. But Saudi Arabia in it's current form exists for what? 90 years? And while prominent in Sunni world and they like to portray themselves as the leaders they are a tiny part of it. Before them current parts of Arabia was dozens of small states that were of little consequence to anyone, with the exception of the ones controlling Mekka, but even that was more of a Cermonial importance. The rivalry was more of Ottomans (or whomever is in Anatolia) vs Persia or before that the various caliphs ruling from modern Iraq, Egypt or Syria.
Iran and China are against each other's side now, but China and Russia are friends and Russia and Iran are friends.
Same with China and India clashing it out but India is doing all these deals under the table with Russia. And now we have China being buddies with Saudi Arabia which is heavily supplied by America.
russia can like india and iran and china, and china can hate india and iran but still be friends with russia.
unless they form some ww1 style alliances going and go to war with eachother the relationships nations have with eachother are going to be fluid and dependant on the interests of the state in question.
In no way am I denying Taiwan's existence, but I don't think Iran has any place commenting on "rights" until they fix the insanity going on in their own country.
thats what the idea of sovereignty is about. they are independant. the idea of nations acting like a childrens club is sophmoric at best. States will always act in their own self interest, regardless of morals or ideas of whats right or wrong.
I'm sure this is just some stupid optics bullshit to distract from the blatant human rights violations happening in Iran though.
