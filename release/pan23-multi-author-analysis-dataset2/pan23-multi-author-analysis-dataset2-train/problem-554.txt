That not new in any way. Knowing how expensive a travel is between Russia and the USA. That not the poorest of them all.
Edit: Unless you leave by being enslaved which still happens today. In raw number, this peculiar trade is bigger than ever before in Europe.
I mean, you literally just explained the history of immigration to America for the past 300 years. People move here, buy property, get jobs, have kids, and live their lives here.
They’ve been doing this in Florida as well. Come to US , buy property, have kids on US soil. It’s been going on for so long there’s a good chance that Florida actually has law enforcement with duel citizens. The danger is they have access to federal crime databases.
Charles Lindbergh ran for office.. his slogan.. "America First". He was practically a Nazi himself. It worked for a bit as Hitler chewed up more and more of Europe.
During the Rise of Nazi Germany there were many Germans who had emigrated here and who were sympathetic to and spread NAZI propaganda. To keep The United States out of the War and to weaken the country from within. They even had a Nazi party and held a rally in Madison Square garden. Which of course was met with great resistance and protesters showed up and ran the Nazi's out of town.
This “fifth column” nonsense is why we put Japanese people in concentration camps during WW2. Because if they come from a different country, then they can’t possibly be loyal to America and must be treated as enemies.
Ask Ukraine, Ask Moldova, ask Belorussians , ask Poland about fifth column activity perpetrated by Russia since the break up of the Soviet Union.
ISIS uses this tactic, so when ever a terrorist is caught in a Western Nation.. the criminal automatically cries racism. And they know this. And they know the bleeding hearts blinded with rose colored glasses will cry foul.
