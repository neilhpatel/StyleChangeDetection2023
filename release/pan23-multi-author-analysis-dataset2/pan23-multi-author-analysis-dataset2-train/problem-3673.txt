really doesnt matter who wins the primary the supreme court will install a republican president in 2024 by taking control of lawsuits from election denying counties.
Do these people ever take a look at themselves, as they let Trump's courting of Nazis slide for the sake of gaining political influence? It's pretty disgusting.
This is actually not a new phenomena. Indeed there were Jews in the original Nazi party. Countless tales of africans or south asians being in cahoots with their British colonizers. Gays (closeted and open) in top echelons of the GOP (think Roy Cohn or Ric Grennel), and of course you have Kanye West's newfound praise and friendship with Nick Fuentes.. a guy who openly uses the N word, has said interracial marriages (LIKE KANYES!) are on par with bestiality and the product of those marriages (LIKE KANYES CHILDREN) are "filthy".
So this is sadly nothing new. What I don't understand is the psychology or pathology that is at root - would be curious if anyone in this thread has looked into that aspect of this absolute fucking lunacy. I think its something way more twisted then say, Michael Jackson slowly morphing the shape of his nose and bleaching his skin - thats an inferiority complex on steroids. This other stuff is in another ballpark entirely...
