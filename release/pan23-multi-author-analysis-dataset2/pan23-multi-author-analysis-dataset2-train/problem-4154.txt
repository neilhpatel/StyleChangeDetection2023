All accidents reported should be on your driving record. Was your insurance notified or a legal document filled out noting the accident? If so, it’s likely to be on your driving record.
Your jurisdiction might require something to be filed if the damage was over a certain amount, like $1,000. But if it was a small amount and no reports were done, there is very little chance of it showing up on your record. We all door ding from time to time, pay for the fixes and move along. No damage to your dl.

If an insurance company paid out on a policy in your name (even a temporary one) that information may be on a CLUE report used in insurance rating.
