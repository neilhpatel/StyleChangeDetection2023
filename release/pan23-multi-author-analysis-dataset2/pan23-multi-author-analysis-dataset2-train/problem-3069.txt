“Federal court documents also stated that several ‘conspirators’ in the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse of Haiti met with the F.B.I. a few months before the killing, and tried to draw agents ‘into a discussion about regime change in Haiti.’”.
“In response, an agent told the men ‘that the F.B.I. could not help them because Haiti had to solve its own political problems.’ The revelation raised troubling questions about how much the United States government knew in advance of the killing. In court records, the government denied that it had any advance notice of a criminal plot.”.
“Eleven people are in U.S. custody and more than a dozen in Haiti for suspected ties to the assassination.”.
“Among those detained and indicted by a federal grand jury in South Florida on Tuesday were Antonio Intriago, a Venezuelan American, and Arcángel Pretel Ortiz, a Colombian living in the United States, the owners of a U.S. security company who prosecutors say organized the plot to murder the former Haitian leader.”.
Hmmm, Antonio Intriago, the Venezuelan mentioned, supported Guido, the US supported coup leader that tried to get rule of Venezuela.
Haiti's location is attractive, but the US doesn't seem to want it right now and won't allow any other major power to take it. That's part of why Canada keeps being suggested as the nation that could lead an intervention.
