Not worth the risk. Any possession of meth in NC is a felony. You could get stopped as soon as he gets into your car, either randomly or due to a stakeout. Sure its "on his person" but its in your car, so even if he cops to it you could get felony charges as well. And whose to say he doesnt drop it in your car and then claim its yours? You may trust your "friend" but when it comes to meth/opiates people will do anything to keep using including fuck over others.
If you insist on "helping" him, drop him off but dont drive him back. Or keep playing with fire until you end up with your life turned upside down.
I am not asking "If I am pulled over by a cop with drugs in my car, will I be arrested?" I am asking "If my friend is arrested after I drove her to purchase drugs, but before she gets back in my car, will I be arrested?".
And like the other person above said, if your friend got arrested, you are at their mercy when it comes time to making a plea/plea deal. They legit could ID as a person who helped them get drugs by driving them to get drugs.
If it is an undercover cop selling it to her, she would be arrested immediately after the transaction, would she not? Why would they wait until after I come back to pick her up to arrest her?
There's no way to predict what could happen. You could even be set up by their dealer as a dealer if they get busted. They could send your friend off with an "extra bag or two" and then pull you over and claim intent to distribute. Cops turn people into CIs and even if the CI sets up someone lower on the chain, the cops will always try to turn it into an arrest to justify the operation. As someone with personal experience in a situation like this, it is NOT worth it. As a user it isnt, but more so as a non-user "helping a friend". Police wont just hear that you were "helping" a friend and say "ohhhh okay you're off the hook".
