Your son needs a lawyer, not advice from the internet. He's facing a serious possibility of jail time if he mishandles his defence.
It's possible his actions are defensible. It's possible they aren't. He needs a professional to protect his interests.
Is your son a minor or an adult? There's not going to be much anyone here can say. The police thought it was disproportionate. You and others disagree. Without all the evidence no one here can really guess what the result will be in court. The DA now gets to decide whether or not to prosecute. Most of these cases are dropped or settled. Only about 5% of criminal cases actually go to trial. So it's likely to expect something other than a trial, but if the charges aren't dropped, a trial is his right.
Well let’s say what I’m saying is true. Multiple punches were being thrown at my son hitting him in the face and chest, and he responded with one punch, knocking her out. Does the punch, being a knockout punch, qualify that as excessive force? Or was he only legally allowed to throw a softer punch that wouldn’t have knocked her out.
