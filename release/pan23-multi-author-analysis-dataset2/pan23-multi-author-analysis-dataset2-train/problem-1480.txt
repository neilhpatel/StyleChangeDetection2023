If your car was insured and he had your permission to drive it they should cover it unless he was specifically excluded or had a suspended license or something like that. The liklihood you are going to recover 35k from him anytime soon is slim.
Well then allowing him to drive the car was obviously a bad mistake. If he had hit someone else, your family could be sued for property damage and personal injury. Does he have $35,000? If so, then you will want to hire an attorney to sue him.
just because he wasn't named on the policy doesn't mean he's excluded. He would be excluded if he were specifically excluded or if your policy said anybody not on the policy wasn't covered. Your standard auto insurance policy doesn't have this.
yeah they won’t pay it cause he wasn’t covered, this guy has the money to pay, he lives in a 4 million dollar house, and drives a $100,000 bmw, he can easily pay it, and we came to an agreement he would be liable for damages when driving my car.
Yes you can sue him but for that amount of damages you will need a lawyer which won't be cheap. You'd be better off filing a claim on your insurance and then once that is settled, suing him in small claims court for your collison deductible.
the insurance says it’s not their problem cause he’s not a family member, therefore not liable for damages. we will probably sue him for the damages and maybe more, dunno yet.
plus this was technically a dui, since he smoked a hour or two before driving, so i could file a police report but i don’t wanna do that, that’s a last resort option.
wasn’t even totaled, it’s a tesla model s and they charge 35,000 just for 2 new wheels and the right side of the car being scraped up. he just took a highway ramp too fast and scraped the barrier for a few seconds.
