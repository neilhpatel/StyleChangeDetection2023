As for suing the student or their parents, that's problematic both from a standpoint that their statement to the school may be privileged if it's a public school and with proving the falsity of the statement. That's assuming they have non-protectable assets to go after in the first place. Defamation cases are hard to win.
It's not an issue of "standing," it's an issue of whether there are any substantive grounds to challenge the termination.
Does your wife have an employment contract that specifies termination for cause only? Civil service protections? A union? The only way of going against the school is on the procedure that was followed to terminate her if this is a public school. Winning a lawsuit may mean going through that procedure and she still gets fired. A private school without a for-cause contract means she can probably be terminated for any reason. Your wife is free to go see an employment attorney who does plaintiff's work.
Doubtful that it’s wrongful termination. The school is entitled to believe the parents and students are not your wife. If she’s in a union she might have some additional process that is due but that’s about it.
It's natural to want to side with a defend/avenge your wife however in the interests of fairness I should be frank about what a difficult case this would be to make for any sort of wrongful termination, and it really doesnt sound like defamation based on what you've shared above.
