Hi there anyone interested in recommending things to OP While you might have a title to share, this is still a thread on /r/AskHistorians, and we still want the replies here to be to an /r/AskHistorians standard - presumably OP would have asked at /r/history or /r/askreddit if they wanted non-specialist opinion. So give us some indication why the thing you're recommending is valuable, trustworthy, or applicable Posts that provide no context for why you're recommending a particular podcast/book/novel/documentary/etc, and which aren't backed up by a historian-level knowledge on the accuracy and stance of the piece, will be removed.
Catch 67 by Israeli philosopher and expert on Jewish thought Micah GoodmanÂ is a fantastic book that really gives you a complete logical and unbiased look on the situation, don't let the fact that it is written by an Israeli make you think that the book won't be as such. I live in Israel and I find that this book is tremendously helpful to Israelis to understand the situation. Great read.
