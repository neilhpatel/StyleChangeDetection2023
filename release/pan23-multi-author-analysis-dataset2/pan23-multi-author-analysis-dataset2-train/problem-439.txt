This traitor was compromised by Russia and not only led the Trump-Russia investigation but he was also in charge of counterintelligence at the NY office, which means he was in charge of finding Russian agents and thwarting them while at the same time working for Russia. Who knows what kind of damage Russian agents were able to do while he was in charge. I hope this traitor gets life in prison without parole.
Oh yeah, the NY FBI field office that was called "Trumpland?" The FBI guys who were threatening to leak Hillary's emails forcing Comey's October surprise? This Russian asset LED that NY office?
The Feds can gather any amount of data they want thanks to the patriot act. And they can skirt the fourth amendment, tap your phone without a warrant, by saying “a significant purpose” is intelligence. Which is incredibly vague on purpose.
They found him eventually. I imagine it takes a lot of time to figure these things out. This guy is a professional spy, I'm sure he knows how to cover his tracks well enough to get away with it for years.
Quite strange for a guy who is making what I assume is pretty good salary(I'd assume 200K+), and could likely make much more in the private sector domestically.
How the fuck, do we give all this money to the alphabet boys just for them to not know one of their own was on the pooty payroll. It’s absolutely asinine. Does the NSA tap people of importance ever, or is it just us regular ole citizens.
