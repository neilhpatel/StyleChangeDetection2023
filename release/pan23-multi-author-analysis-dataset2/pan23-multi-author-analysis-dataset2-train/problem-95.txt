What sort of leave? Is this protected leave like FMLA? That sort of leave does protect your job. Not all forms of medical leave protect your job. Also also, at you at-will? Most employees don't need cases "built" about them to be terminated, but again the sort of leave you're on will matter.
Its short term medical leave. I believe it is under FMLA, I had to fill out a bunch of paper work, file with the state, get a letter from my therapist, etc.
Letâ€™s say you were involved in a theft , and while they were investigating the incident, you went on FMLA. They can still terminate you.
To clarify, you cannot be fired for taking FMLA leave. It's not outright illegal to fire someone who is on FMLA leave or about to be on FMLA leave for another reason that is genuinely unrelated to their use of FMLA leave. For example, if you had been previously disciplined for performance or misconduct and were about to be terminated for those reasons, going out on FMLA leave wouldn't necessarily prevent your employer from firing you for performance or misconduct regardless.
However, this is a very risky move for an employer, as it would need to be very clear that the termination was for genuine reasons and was not related in any way to the use of FMLA leave. If you had never previously been disciplined and had received good reviews of your performance and conduct previously, and then suddenly as soon as you put in a request for FMLA leave your manager began to discipline you for performance despite the fact that your actual performance didn't change, that is very likely to be construed as .
If your employer does try to interfere with your FMLA leave or retaliates against you for using FMLA, you can . You also have the option of filing a lawsuit against your employer, though this might involve some out-of-pocket expenses (although if your case is strong enough, you might be able to find a lawyer who would work on contingency).
