Ukraine has battered and humiliated the Russian armed forces; what was previously ranked as the second most powerful military and third largest military budget.
Russia has lost its reputation for competence, skill at arms and military leadership. Itâ€™s also lost 1579 tanks, 742 armored fighting vehicles, 1842 infantry fighting vehicles, 280 APCs, 177 IMVs, 208 Command Posts, 254 engineering vehicles, 108 artillery vehicles, 154 towed artillery, 299 self propelled artillery, 160 multiple rocket launchers, 38 anti aircraft guns, 82 surface to air missile systems, 67 aircraft (including top end SU-35s), 72 helicopters, 12 naval ships (including the flagship Moskava), 2138 trucks, vehicles and jeeps, and the small matter of 100,000 men being killed and/or wounded.
Plus they've lost most of their good tanks, their troops' weapons and ammo are old and questionable and they still have shitty logistics. This would be a great way to bring the war to an end quickly and then Russia can negotiate their surrender to Ukraine.
