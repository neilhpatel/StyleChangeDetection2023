It's a bit more complex than that, and the article lays that out if you had read it. The one thing they didn't mention is that the Americans have consistently armed and provided political cover for their mortal enemy, Pakistan. And during that time the Soviets stod behind India during those conflicts so it shouldn't come as a surprise that they don't care much for what the Americans wants. India could've be a great ally for the Americans against Chinese influence but instead they got the Pakistanis..
President Richard Nixon and then National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger backed Pakistan in 1971 against pro-Soviet India because Kissinger’s actions were clouded by his own ignorance about South Asia, his emotional misjudgments and his desire stoke Nixon’s racism toward Indians.
In the 1970s there was serious speculation among NATO partners that India would surreptitiously support the USSR if it came to war between Russia and NATO. Hell it was even popularized in Western literature and not just in Tom Clancy novels.
So India’s logic is that innocent Ukrainians must be raped, kidnapped, tortured, and murdered because something the US did 50 years ago.
In short, they believed there was more to gain at the time by backing China and Pakistan as they felt they could control both.
I suspect NATO watches India just as closely as it does Russia and China, and India’s giving NATO every reason to do so. There is no upside to the Indian people for their government’s behavior. Not even how this cheap oil is supposedly going to uplift them. That’s a nasty bit of internal propaganda.
That’s the excuse. And that’s all it is. India refuses alliances. The rest of the world engages in treaties of mutual interests and it turns out none of them are best buddies forever.
