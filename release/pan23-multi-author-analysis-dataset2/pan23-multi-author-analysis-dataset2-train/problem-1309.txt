If you're a UBC millwright any recourse you have would almost certainly be governed by the grievance process in your collective agreement.
You haven't provided alot of specifics of the incident in question but maybe there's a human rights complaint in there if people were making offensive statements regarding First Nations people or residential schools, and the employer failed to act on the situation.
I know you are upset, and that when people are upset its harder for them to put together an easy-to-understand story. However, you really need to put the time and effort into doing that.
I'm going to be a bit blunt here. You have not provided a coherent narrative. I'm a labour lawyer - this is my area of law - and I have no idea what happened or what the current status is. You provide very small snippets, but don't really describe , in one comment (as opposed to bits and pieces across multiple comments and posts), what happened. Its very hard to help you or give you meaningful, useful advice as a result.
Once you are calm, you need to contact your union (email is perfect) and ask if they are filing a grievance about your termination. If so, what can you expect and if not, why not.
