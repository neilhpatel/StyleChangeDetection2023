Her trust has nothing to do with it. You and your roommates owe $8500. You are the easiest to go after and she needs to remove you to open the house to rent.
You should pay the 8500 or set up a mutually agreed upon payment plan, and then you should sue your roommates for their portion (all of it).
I get what you are saying about a payment plan if she'll accept that, though going after room mates may be a lost cause as even if I could locate them, I doubt they have any money to pay and I'll not get any blood out of two rocks.
If I move voluntarily out before she evicts me but still owe outstanding rent, obviously she could still continue suing me for that, would that still stay on my credit and renting record?
This is precisely what I fear she will do in that she will continue with having me evicted. After talking with her, I feel that she prefers suing me for the full cost of the rent owed rather than take a payment plan, probably because she does not trust me to keep to a payment plan.
OK, it seems like if I'm taken to court I'll be in a lot of trouble. Is she obliged to accept a payment plan or can she still take it through a court?
You are joint and severally liable. Meaning you are responsible for 100% of the rent and making sure it gets paid on time. You need to work something out and try not to get evicted because that will stay on your credit and renting record for years and make life difficult.
As others have stated, this will then do terrible damage to my credit and will be on my record for several years and cause me many issues. Though I guess it is all my own stupid mistake and I guess she is just doing what is best for her. All I can do is learn from this and not let it happen again.
Yes. She can remove you from the apartment because "you" (meaning the plural form - the people on the lease) haven't paid your rent. Then she can sue you for the past amounts you haven't paid.
