This isn't the kind of thing you are likely to be able to waive liability for. And it sounds extremely high risk. Consult your own attorney. This is not random internet advice territory.
Ask your doctor what it would take for him/her to engage in this type of experimental treatment. Seriously. They don't do it for very valid reasons, one of which being hurting people, the other being liability exposure.
You will want to have insurance for any business you start, as a general practice. For example, to cover you if a client slips and falls on your premises. So, asking your business insurance agent about this would be a good way to find out if it is possible.
The best way you could protect yourself is to get a medical degree, medical practitioner insurance, and be acting in a way consistent with applicable scientific research.
You also have no control over other pharmaceuticals or alcohol the person may take, even if you hand them a laundry list and ask them to declare they use none of them. Alcohol and some legal drugs increase the chances of side effects, and are associated with most DXM deaths.
There are a number of things that will be out of your control, even if the person signs a waiver. One is that some people have a genetic inability to metabolize DXM. This puts them at risk for serious side effects that could include breathing problems, coma, or even death. Your clients may have no idea they are in this category.
