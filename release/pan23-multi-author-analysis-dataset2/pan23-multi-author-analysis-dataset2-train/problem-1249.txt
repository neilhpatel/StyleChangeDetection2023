Holy hell. Sorry that's just either incredibly brazen or incredibly ignorant. How does someone even get a payroll program to do that?
Can you confirm that this isn't just a statement of what the employer is paying? Does the math work out, based on gross pay and net pay, does that difference = this whole thing, all $141.13?
Yes, it should be paid by the employer. It's an illegal deduction if it's being paid by the employee. She should contact the Department of Labor wherever she is.
NAL, but I am a CPA. FICA is a federal tax so it is the same in every state. The employee pays 6.2% of his/her gross wages as a deduction. The employee also pays 6.2%. Medicare is also paid equally by the employee and employer at a rate of 1.45% each. I don't know about Indiana unemployment tax but I have never heard of a state where that is paid by the employee.
