If neither of you are minors and these intimate videos/pics were shared willingly, there's not much you can do about that unless and until he actually shares them without your permission. At that point, you can contact law enforcement, as he'd likely be committing a crime:
I understand the worry and frustration over his radio silence with you, but there's nothing the legal system can do about that, either -- he's under no obligation to speak with or respond to you, or inform you of his intentions, or delete the media, or whatever.
The hard truth is that this is merely a "wait and see" situation, with potential legal recourse for you for if and when something actually happens.
But if OP's ex is completely incommunicado, it would seem unlikely that that's what's going on, so OP is right back to a wait-and-see situation.
If there are explicit photos/videos of you as a minor and you made those and sent them to him, then in a literal interpretation of the law, you're guilty of the production of child pornography and he's guilty of possession of child pornography, at least in terms of federal law.
New York's state law on child porn sets the age a tad lower than the federal law (18), so New York may not see this as an explicit crime the way federal law would.
How that all plays out legally and what might happen to him or you if these are discovered is unknown.
