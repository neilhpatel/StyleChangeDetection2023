I genuinely have come to hate our news-cycle in the west. In trying to compete with social-media it has turned into a constant clickbait-, false-dichotomy, non-news, hearsay and regurgitation-of-propaganda-statements fuckfest.
But because of our toxic media-cycle, it has become an incredible easy tool to abuse by populists. They can create "news" out of thin air by just talking bullshit and the media gladly reports on it for the clicks. Just look at trump, putin, kim-jong and erdögan. Constant fucking cycle of their statements that don't matter at all. Any US night-show keeps talking about trump all the fucking time but despite always making fun of him they're also empowering him by constantly keeping him in people's minds. Same shit with our media. Gives power to erdögan, to putin, to bad actors who'll use it just to sow this constant stream of shit that they know will make people finally tune out whilst the only ones left are the frothing idiots who believe in their divisive rhetoric.
At this point Erdogan has spewed so much propaganda against Sweden that he cannot accept Sweden into NATO without losing popularity. So at least until Turkish election is over there is no bribe that can get Sweden into NATO.
