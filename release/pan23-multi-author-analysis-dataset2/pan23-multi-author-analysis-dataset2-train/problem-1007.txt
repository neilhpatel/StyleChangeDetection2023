I can see why you might say that (imaging any random schmuck asking this) but we're all very close, loaned money to each other several times with no issues. Theres fairly high trust,, of course there would have to be to even consider this.And we're quite thorough about all terms, contingencies, death etc...
Plus he's not buying all of it, at least not at once. We're just gonna do a bit at a time and at some point perhaps have our parents change the will to reflect our agreement.
Additionally I'm promising to leave at least half my stuff to him or his children. It's really a win win for everyone. He's getting a great deal and I won't have to work. We're not the scummy type to backstab each other.
I should've mentioned I'm also planning on leaving him at leasr half of all my stuff. If I die before him, than nothing. He simply gets everything anyway. If he dies before me without any heirs, than nothing as well. If he dies with heirs, than his heirs take his place of the agreement.
In the US, all a notary does is verify the identity of the person (s) signing a document. The notary makes no legal determination on the validity of the document.
What happens if your parents disinherit you or decide to give their estate to charity or die deeply in debt so that you receive no inheritance? What happens if you die before your parents?
If they somehow disinherit me or die without anything or last minute end up donating it all, that would be part of the downside risk on his part. Just as if they end up richer than our estimates that's all his gain as well. So we obviously negotiate fair value plus discount.
