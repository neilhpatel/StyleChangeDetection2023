ROME, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Italy believes it does not make much difference if the missile that caused a deadly explosion in Poland was not Russian, because Moscow is still to blame for attacking infrastructure in Ukraine, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Wednesday.
"The possibility that the missile falling on Poland was not a Russian missile but a Ukrainian one changes very little," she said.
Talking to reporters at the G20 summit in Bali, Meloni said she spoke to Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
The fascist nationalist doesn't get points from me, 'we're' finally deciding to do something? The good people of both countries have wanted this to stop the whole time.
Amazingly, the west is against the Russian invasion in Ukraine overwhelmingly. Those that suggest it’s based on political party are only trying to divide people for their own political gain. Left and right wing parties can agree fully on an issue being bad while discussing different methods for solving the problem or trying to make it better. It’s very surprising that people can’t see that there is allot of consensus on the majority of issues. Who is pro high unemployment? Who is against economic growth? Who is for starving people?
Right? There’s a world of difference between Russia did this intentionally, Russia did this by accident, and Russia didn’t do this at all.
Don’t get me wrong, Putin can suck a fuck, but this sounds like an accident and not at all worth escalating into WWIII.
