What are they charging her with? If theyre still holding her and its been over 24 hours then they have to have a reason. Call a lawyer and show them the video. See what they have to stay. From the details its likely you can make a case for mistreatment of a disabled person (forcing them to stay exposed to the cold). Get a copy of the police report. Im not a lawyer so im not sure. But try a personal injury lawyer maybe?
"they released her boyfriend on no bail. And ggave her a 2500 $ bond and charged her for assault and resistance of arrest. She is still in jail." is what was said recently.
So her bf was arrested as well? Police responding to domestic violence calls will often just arrest both parties. It's easier to figure out what happened afterwards, especially if both are accusing each other.
Also dont rise to the bait of some of the people here claiming youre covering for grandmas behavior or implying she did something to get put there. Sometimes cops make mistakes and sometimes they're assholes. Theyre no different than any other human being and are capable of doing dirty. If he knew some of the cops in their city jail then he may have known one of those cops that took the call. Consulting a lawyer and getting her out is the best way to help her.
Sorry but this is beyond reddit at this point and you need to get a lawyer to represent your Grandmother immediately. Do not talk to the police first.
yeah, the neighbor saw most everything I think, the police ended up letting the neighbor grab my grandmas phone and purse, luckily the neighbor lady is kinda trustworthy.
Yes both were arrested, she was heavily influenced by the cold weather and the shock from being put through a table though, like they didn't try to calm her down, de-escalate, or be on her side at all. Also she was the only person who was actively injured, and it was her home.
