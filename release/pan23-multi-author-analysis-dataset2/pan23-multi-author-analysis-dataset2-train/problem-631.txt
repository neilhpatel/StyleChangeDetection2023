Do you have pics of what it was supposed to look like from before you moved in? Did you take pics of the current condition before you went to a hotel? You'll want to asap or at least first thing Monday if you haven't already, before they clean any of it up. Keep a copy of your hotel bill and any other expenses incurred as a direct result of being unable to move in on time, preferably itemized. I'd also immediately start keep a copy of all communication you have with any employees of the property, including a written log of when you made calls, who you spoke to, and the jist of what you and they said. Written communication is even better - texts, emails, letters.
From what I saw they’re just responsible for any paperwork answering phones mail getting any payments processed and issuing work orders for maintenance. The manager hasn’t replied to my email yet.
We’ll the property managers aren’t going to be there till Monday so I am staying in a hotel right now since the office doesn’t know when they’ll be fixed and when I’ll receive keys. I’m hoping they could give a refund since I don’t have any keys and was guaranteed I would be able to move in the 23 since I drove a couple hours there.
