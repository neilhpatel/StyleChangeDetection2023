Can you expand on that? How did they show a liking or preference for Trump? How did they help him get elected?
I have a genuine honest question. I'm not from the US. If I was from the US, I would definitely support the Democrat party. With that being said, it doesn't make sense to me that there are claims that the FBI like Trump, when Trump was the one to fire like two leaders of the FBI.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Again, I'm not from the US, so I just want to understand the whole situation more because it seems confusing to me.
