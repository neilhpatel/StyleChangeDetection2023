Yes, she can sue you at any time prior to the statute of limitations. Is your insurance company aware of the lawsuit? If not, let them know right away. They will retain defense counsel on your behalf.
They are aware, I believe I already have a lawyer on retainer because I’ve known about it for a while. But she’s only acting on it now. The insurance company warned us in June or July.
If the insurance company warned you before you were served, they likely knew she was presenting an injury claim. She doesn't have to TELL you or your insurance company that she's seeking medical treatment right away. She just has to present her claim prior to the statute of limitations. A red flag would be if she actually waited months to seek the treatment.
Yeah, remembering the accident, I don’t actually believe that It would have injured her for $17,000 worth of medical and lost wages damages. But she told me that this was the 3rd or 4th accident she’s gotten in the last year and that the car I hit was what she got from the last one.
