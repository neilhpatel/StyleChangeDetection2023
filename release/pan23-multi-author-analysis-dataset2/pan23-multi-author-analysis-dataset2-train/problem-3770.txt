But it checks all the boxes for their law. It is a performance with both genders impersonating the opposite gender (women as football players and men as cheerleaders) in a public space where children are in attendance. To not enforce the law on these would be incredible hypocritical. Anyone in TN should also insist that these are banned because they clearly break the law. Malicious compliance is the way to go here. Also what about all those religious folks in their robes that look like dresses? They better go too, looks too much like a man trying to be a woman.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
