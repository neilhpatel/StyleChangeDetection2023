Idk why it won’t let me post the whole update, but pretty much animal welfare came and Saw m my fence, and pointed out a tiny hole was two fingers wide. Just enough for her five week old puppy to try to get into my fence, but not enough for my dogs to ever be able to put their heads or mouth on the other side of the fence. So basically if my dogs did bite her dog, it’s because her dog was in my yard. The animal welfare man told me she called and made a complaint herself,And that he wouldn’t give us either of each other’s information to contact each other. He told her she just asked to see me in small claims. And then he tried reassuring me that it wouldn’t be a big deal, but at this point it’s obvious to me that she neglected her dog and let it go into someone else’s yard.
If this mysterious stranger would like to claim that you are legally liable for her vet bills because your dog allegedly bit her dog, she is welcome to provide verifiable evidence of such claim. Anything short of that, and she can get lost.
