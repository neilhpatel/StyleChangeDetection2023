The first national census in 1801 gives 129,528 for the modern City proper (minus some modest later add-ons - I think Liverpool Street station was included subsequently), which can be taken as a minimum as soldiers and mariners abroad weren't allocated by place of usual residence (the cause of much confusion about a large undercount - in fact they were just counted separately in a time of war when their numbers were high).
You're right that those high numbers (here probably representative of the 1760s-70s) are for the wider "metropolis", the built-up area or the parishes covered by the Bills of Mortality. The square mile though was staggeringly densely-populated by our standards before wholesale conversion from residential to business use slashed numbers from the 1850s to the 1960s.
Mechanical clocks could not be significantly miniaturized until the 15th century and the invention of spring driven mechanical clocks. If someone wanted their own individual time piece they'd use something else: a sundial, a water clock, a fire clock, a weight clock, an hourglass... While we hear of some rulers creating relatively small (though still large) mechanical clocks as prestige pieces, it would have been more economical of our aspiring noble or merchant to use an alternative non-mechanical time piece.
