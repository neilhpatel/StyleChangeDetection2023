People on a right wing gun sub told me that it was different when Bob Hope and Jack Lemmon did it because it wasnt grooming kids because they "just did it for fun." I dont know how these people tie their shoes.
All of a sudden drag shows are a problem despite being around forever. It just goes to show conservatives’ naked desire for power; they basically just pick something that’s easy to demonize to lock in votes from bigots who might otherwise vote against them based on economic reasons.
It should be really obvious to most people that this is a political sideshow. I have never been to a drag show, wouldn't know where to go to see one, and really will not be affected in any way by drag shows occurring but this is what the GOP wants to spend their time on.
