I’m surprised your mom didn’t get a notice that her home insurance was about to lapse. When I had an issue with my escrow the insurance contacted me directly. I paid and got reimbursed from my escrow company.
She said that she never received a notice in the mail or anything. The mortgage company said the same thing. I have no idea who dropped the ball here honestly.
I am a lawyer. I am not your lawyer. You need to speak to a lawyer in Texas.It is unlikely the new insurance will cover the existing damage.
Lawyer time. There is a way to make them pay the full cost of repair, but you will need a good lawyer to jump on them to make it happen. It is their mistake and it is their job to pay you as little as possible, because it comes out of their profit.
Typically insurance goes from a time period to a time period. The start date would usually be the date the policy was issued. But here, the damage happened prior to it. This means your remedy is likely through the mortgage company. It might be worth taking to a higher up if you can. My gut says they aren’t likely to budge. I could be wrong, but back dating the insurance to a known claim seems not very insurance like.
