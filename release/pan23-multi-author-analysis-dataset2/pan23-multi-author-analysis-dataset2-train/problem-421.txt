This depends on the will, but it's also a point of negotiation the executor needs to work on. Suppose it's a $100,000 house and there is $100,000 in cash. Instead of you getting half a house (?) and him getting half a house and then $50k each, he'd get the house and you'd get $150k. Or vice versa. Or something else. But the will is going to matter.
Depends on the wording of the will. If it just states divided equally then half the market value of the house is yours. The other person would have to sell or buy you out. They wouldn't have to pay rent as half is theirs. The attorney would advise on deed, etc.
Talk to the executor. Not sure I agree but if they do need to pay rent, it would be to the estate, not to you. But the executor might to ask the estate's probate attorney. And also you may want to weigh the value of this rent versus making the settling of the estate contentious.
