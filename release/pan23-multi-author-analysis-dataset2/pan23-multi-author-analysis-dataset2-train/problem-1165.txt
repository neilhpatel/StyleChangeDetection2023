It would very probably (presuming you're in the US) be 1st Amendment protected speech to use colorful barnyard reproductive analogies to tell him about his driving and his approach to the educational mission.
But school discipline issues are seldom governed by criminal or civil laws. If they want to reprimand or punish you for giving the bird to an employee outside school grounds, they might be able to do so. You're also welcome to tell them he was driving too close to pedestrians.
If you are called to the office, that isn't a legal problem. It's a school policy problem, and none of us know what your schools policies are.
You have no ability to "get him in trouble" based on what you've posted here. You don't even know who he is. Nothing has happened and you should move on.
