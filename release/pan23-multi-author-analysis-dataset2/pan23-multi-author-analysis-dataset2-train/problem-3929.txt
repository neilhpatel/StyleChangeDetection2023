And he made it absolutely impossible to refute that it's him by demanding the child support be terminated... If you wrote that in a book nobody would believe someone could be so stupid.
Not every local police agency knows how to handle these types of cases well. If your area has a local Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force, it’s worth bringing this to their attention if the agency with which you filed a report doesn’t do much.
While he did identify himself by way of demanding CS be terminated, proving that he sent it (and not someone trying to exact their own revenge or set him up) is probably where the officers opinion played in.
I was in a similar boat (however not underage photos), although my ex created a website and sent the link to various people - registered the url in my name (the url was actually my name too). But didn't have the sense to mask his IP. It was an awful thing to go through and embarrassing to discuss in court. I'm sorry you have to deal with it.
Depending on the specifics of the images, your ex could be in serious trouble. Distribution of child porn is a five year mandatory minimum prison sentence on the federal side. Production of child porn is a 15 year mandatory minimum. So, again, depending on specifics, he could be facing some serious consequences.
Revenge porn is taken seriously, and that is far worse. That was an incredibly dumb and desperate move on his part.
