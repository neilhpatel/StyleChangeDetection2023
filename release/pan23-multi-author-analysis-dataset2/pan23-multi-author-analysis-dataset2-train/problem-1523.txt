Very true. Thankfully his injuries weren't too severe, but we decided to wait it out to see if he shows any other complications (nerve damage, infections, trauma) to fully press charges.
(Anecdotally, when I injured myself cycling, they contacted me to make sure there wasn't someone else at fault they could go after).
Your brother's insurance might also go after your neighbor. Even though his cost was only $50, the insurance can still pursue your neighbor for their total costs.
Contact your homeowner's insurance, because you can probably get their help to sue your neighbor's homeowner's insurance. If you have a local agent, they probably can give you other resources to use as well and may have some personal connections that can help you.
Would this still apply if they are renters, considering the property isnt under thier name? Regardless, il definitely talk to my insurance. Thank you!
Oh no no no..... Your brother does have medical bills that he deserves to be reimbursed for. It's not the responsibility of his carrier. Sue for the damages.
