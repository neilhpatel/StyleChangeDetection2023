1. Your assumption that the charge was dismissed for lack of evidence is not a sound one unless you have some specific knowledge that was the reason.
Judges have very broad latitude in what kind of statements they may accept in considering sentencing. There's no reason to think that this person's statement should be excluded.
I thought a victim Impact statement was for victims not people who lie & then get their charges dismissed.... just my thought tho.
It was a trial an the judge & jury heard the evidence & after lunch break the judge dismissed 3 of the counts of harrassment against me....he didn't write me a note an tell me his reasoning lol so I can only assume it's for lack of evidence because after they testify the judge dismissed the 3 counts....
Why the court might or might not feel it is appropriate to allow a victim impact statement from a specific individual is entirely up to the court. If you feel it should not be allowed you will need to speak to your attorney to see if there are legal grounds to exclude it.
