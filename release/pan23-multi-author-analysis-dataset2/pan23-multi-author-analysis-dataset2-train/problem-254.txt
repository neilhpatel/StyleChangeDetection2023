Maybe a scam money mule. Phone scammers get people, oftentimes older more trusting people, to send cash caused by a created incident that would get the scammer in trouble, if they were legitimate. The scammers get the people to send the cash to addresses that can't be tied to them and have money mules collect the packages.
Very true however no one ever said one has to be intelligent and understand the various possible outcomes of one's actions to be a money mule.
I mean, that certainly is something that happens. But it’s pretty dumb of a mule to use homes associated with people they know/work with. Usually it’s an ABNb or hotel booked with a fake ID. If the police interview OPs dad, they’ll tell the police about the package mule in a heartbeat. At least with an unoccupied house or ABNB, if the package gets burnt, there’s still nothing to trace it to an identity unless the police do a sting and physical catch The mule or bug the package.
It's definitely some sort of fraud or scam, and your dad needs to stop "helping" immediately. God only knows what's in those packages, but it's 100% not legal.
Edit: Also, this way, they don't have to pay for an ABNB or hotel room. If the scam was created by someone in another country, they have no reason to care if the mule gets caught, just they get the most possible profit.
