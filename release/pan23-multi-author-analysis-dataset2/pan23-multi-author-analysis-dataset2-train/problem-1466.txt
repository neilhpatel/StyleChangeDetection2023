I think Santos voters really care and want a special election, they're beyond pissed including the Republicans from his district. So all this spin from the new Republican Congress is total bullshit, the voters want him to represent him after finding out more shit everyday? Trust me more is coming out this man is crazy.
Because they don't care. They hold the presupposed position "our guy = good, their guy = bad" and adjust their principles accordingly.
Also, it's all about power. If they had seats to spare, Santos might have been tossed aside. However, McCarthy only has a 9 seat majority. If Santos is kicked out and a few Republicans vote with the Democrats on some issue, be can lose it all.
If anything, Santos being so exposed is a good thing to McCarthy. McCarthy will likely use this as blackmail to force Santos to vote the way he wants.
