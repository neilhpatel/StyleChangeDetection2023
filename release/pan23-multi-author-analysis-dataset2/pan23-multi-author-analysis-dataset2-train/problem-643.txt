great, now when the republicans take over the house they’ll do the same thing and use their position to release the biden’s taxes. See how you like that, losers! Oh, wait….
Thanks. I mainly remember the h2-b stuff because I have relatives that, although they live in probably the whitest county in one of the whitest states in the nation, carry on to this day about "Mexicans taking our jobs", so I try to remind a certain uncle of mine every time the topic comes up that Mar-a-Lago probably has more immigrant labor today than ever before thanks to Trump. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I just hate the hypocrisy.
