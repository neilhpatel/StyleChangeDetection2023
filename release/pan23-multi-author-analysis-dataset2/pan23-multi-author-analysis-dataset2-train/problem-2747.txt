I already voted but maybe the Democratic party needs to step up they are getting there ass kicked in the messaging war they do not even try in many markets and media spaces. Right wing propaganda is being pushed non stop on social media, you tube ads and other new media. Its silence from the Democratic party. go to local facebook news groups they have been taken over by the right. Yet i guarantee democrats and MSNBC will blame the left and insist on keeping the same failed leadership.
I live in Calif and all our shit is basically already decided (at the senator level) but I’m gonna get out and vote my ass of. There are local props, city board members etc.
I guarantee you there are places where your vote matters proportionally WAY more than out here. Get your ass out and vote. It’s literally the easiest thing to do. Channel your anger and vote.
