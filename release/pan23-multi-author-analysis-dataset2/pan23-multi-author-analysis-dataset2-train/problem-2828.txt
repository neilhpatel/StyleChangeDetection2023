For the record, burglary does require entering a dwelling. This would be larceny, not burglary. However, you don't need to worry about that since you wouldn't be directly involved in any criminal proceedings against the neighbor except as the victim.
Burglary doesn’t always require entering a dwelling. The “curtilage” counts in some jurisdictions as well - most commonly, a fenced in area or partitioned patio.
Absolutely agree, just wanted to put it out there in case someone reading had different circumstances. Plant theft doesn’t deserve a felony anyway! Best if OP leaf the charging recommendation to the prosecutor. I’ll see myself out.
You're right! My point, though, is that OP shouldn't worry about that. Criminal charges aren't their concern. They should go to the police and file a report-- the prosecutor will decide whether to file charges and, if they elect to do so, what to charge the neighbor with.
(1) A person is guilty of burglary in the second degree if, with intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein, he or she enters or remains unlawfully in a building other than a vehicle or a dwelling.
