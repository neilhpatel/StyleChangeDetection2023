And I'm not saying this because he's a Republican with terrible ideas (Redundant statement, I know). I'm saying this because he answered a question about gun control with an incoherent rant over women stalking men on facebook or something. I'm saying this because the man had a significant debate over the viability of werewolves vs. vampires as if he just got finished watching Twilight. I'm saying this because every single policy question that he has ever been asked has been answered with a random word salad that may tangentally have something related to do with the topic at hand only by sheer coincidence. I'm saying this because he shows signs of dementia as if he's an elderly patient at a nursing home who wandered out into the street again trying to catch a bus home. This man is not capable of making decisions without adult supervision.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
