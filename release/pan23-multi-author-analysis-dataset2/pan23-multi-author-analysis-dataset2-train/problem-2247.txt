Next time this happens, there's an easy and legal practical solution: tell them whatever they want to hear, and vote your conscience. It's not illegal to lie about who you voted for.
As thisistupid94 points out, what your parents are doing by threatening you unless you vote how they want is a crime. It's not clear to me that they would actually see prosecution, and filing a police report about it does run a high risk of provoking them to kick you out to live on your own. Whether they can also take your car depends on whether they own your car, more than anything.
Can you elaborate on how they forced you to vote for a specific candidate? Did they fill out your ballot for you, threaten to withhold something if you didn't show them who you voted for, threaten you with violence if you didn't vote for their preferred candidate?
It shall be unlawful for any person to obstruct, intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he or she may choose, or for the purpose of causing such other person to vote for, or not to vote for, any candidate for state or local office or any other proposition at any election. Any person who violates this section shall be guilty, upon conviction, of a Class A misdemeanor.
Regardless, this was almost certainly illegal. Your state's board of elections will most likely have an election fraud tip line, which you are welcome to call to report this incident. Edit: I see you're in Alabama. You can report election interference by any of the methods listed on the Secretary of State's .
