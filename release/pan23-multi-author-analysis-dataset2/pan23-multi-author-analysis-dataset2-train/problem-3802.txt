This is a way that people with bad money can launder it -- cash a check worth a couple of thousand, then come back later with their bad money and claim you gave it to them and they want it replaced. Of course it would be a non-customer -- he wouldn't try it in a place where he was known.
Now the answer to your main question, unfortunately, is likely that you can be fired over it. You didn't say where you are (US? Canada? Australia?). Hopefully there's some audit trail or camera recording that'll show what actually happened.
Do you know for sure that you passed the bad bill? It seems very unlikely that a stage prop bill would even make it into a bank teller's drawer.
Not common? Complaining about fake bills is laundering 101. I cashiered in a retail store and we were warned about it. The ”money pen” came in handy as 20’s, 50’s and 100’s even from the bank were marked. Someone would make a cash purchase, wait a day, then return an item for cash. Then the next day complain that they got a fake from us. One tiny tap with the pen and the fake was known. And because of our policy it was easy to verify that the cashier did their job. But we get one every so often. Criminals are dumb.
The op was likely scammed. She can be fired, but her guilt or innocence has nothing to do with that.
Well, to be precise, OP (and their employer) wasn't scammed- the 'customer' is trying to (presumably) scam them, but hasn't succeeded.
The challenge through all of this is that the Secret Service not only confiscates counterfeit currency (with no compensation), but also takes the stance of "whoever has it, loses." So, whomever has the counterfeit currency in their possession? They're out the money. (And, it remains illegal to knowingly pass off counterfeit bills as legit currency.).
