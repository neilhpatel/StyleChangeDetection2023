So usually the university will handle something like this in house through a Student Conduct office or similar instead of the actual police (also AFAIK weed is decriminalized in NC so it would be a citation rather than a misdemeanor).
There is likely a popular criminal defense lawyer around his university that represents students in Fake ID, MIP, etc matters (every school has one, if not several). You could try finding one of those and get their opinion.
Your brother likely has avenues to appeal after his initial conduct hearing where he will get a chance to explain himself. It’s not really something lawyers are typically involved in because it’s not actually a legal issue, more of an internal one. But I have seen students at my university hire a lawyer to help them out anyways.
I vaguely knew that schools have in-house hearings for things like this but I don't know much about them.
The biggest thing I'm worried about was having the charges on his record as a misdemeanor since he's never been in any type of legal trouble before. I don't want it to impact his future.
Allegedly a scale was found in the trash can as well. I'm not 100% sure this is true so I only posted the actual facts in the initial post.
I'm not sure how well a Uni based law service would be if Uni is "charging" you, but a lawyer is definitely called for.
