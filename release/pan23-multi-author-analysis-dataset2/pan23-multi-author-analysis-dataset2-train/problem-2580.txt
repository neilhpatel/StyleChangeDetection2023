Michigan defines harassment as a course of conduct (two or more noncontinuous acts) involving (among other things) repeated contact against your will.
Right now, I think there is arguably just the one 'act' (the calls were effectively continuous), but you can make a police report about it right now, putting this incident 'on record'. Do you have his personal details?
Thank you for the detailed reply. I know his first and last name, the city he lives in, and where he works. I'm also storing everything in case I need to escalate. My uncle is a cop so I'll probably also ask him his advice but I'll definitely contact the police if he does anything else.
Showing the twenty calls and "doxing" messages would at least encourage them to start a paper trail, though I would expect to hear "If he does it again, then we will [...]".
You can also report him to the platforms' safety teams in the interim- if you don't have full details, they might be able to provide them to LE if he repeats the behaviour.
I think what the advice is saying is for you to make a police report now, before it escalates more. That way, if it does, you don’t have to start from scratch. You’ll.
