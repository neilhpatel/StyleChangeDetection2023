Was raised catholic by my grandma and I asked her this same question at 8. I also why we had to kneel before the Virginia Mary in the church everything we passed her wasn't she an idol? Never got a response the minute I was old enough to stop I stopped going to catholic church. My argument is if I were to die by a bullet you won't wanna wear the bullet to remember me bu so why worship and wear the cross. I know this is a controversial topic but just my views.
