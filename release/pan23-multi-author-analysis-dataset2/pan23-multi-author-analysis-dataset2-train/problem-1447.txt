Does the paperwork you signed say it's a hybrid? You say you bought the wrong car, but you bought whatever car you agreed to buy on the paperwork. Did you not have an opportunity to inspect this vehicle prior to purchase to confirm it was a hybrid?
There was no paperwork, Everything was done an a desk sized computer tablet and not given to me until the next day when I went back to the dealership to return the vehicle per their return policy.
My assumption is have no recourse other than refinance the loan so they get as little interest as possible and post the negative review they deserve.
Their return policy only says "3-Day Complimentary Return Policy" No other details anywhere. No additional details on the website or in paperwork. Apparently they've never had the vehicle I wanted. I do have emails stating I wanted a hybrid before I showed up and a signed and dated form saying I attempted to return the vehicle the day after I bought it. I also asked about a loaner vehicle and they said no.
But you agreed to buy the vehicle on the paperwork. They could easily claim you changed your mind and decided on a non-hybrid model. Lots of people go a dealership to look at one model and end up on another model. Does the return policy state you can return for a refund or for a replacement?
Do you mean, write me a check for my trade in. Cancel the loan and take the vehicle back? So it's as if the sale never happened.
I did. They said no. They want me to wait until whenever they get a something or trade for something they currently have on the lot. Or just go away. I'm pretty sure they would prefer I just go away.
I know. I know that they know I wanted a hybrid. I know that I attempted to return the vehicle and I have proof saying I did so. They can not or wont exchange the vehicle.
