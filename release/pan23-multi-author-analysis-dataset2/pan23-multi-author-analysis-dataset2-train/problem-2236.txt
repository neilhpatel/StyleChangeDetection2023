Since you had permission to use the land, you cannot claim title under adverse possession (which is what the awful term "squatters rights" references.) Adverse possession requires that the land be occupied, continually, notoriously/openly, and hostile (meaning without permission.).
If you were given permission, there is no amount of time that allows you to eventually lay claim. You're just using land that someone else owns.
I looked up W. VA adverse possession law. It turns out your legislature repealed the prior law in 2016 and abolished the doctrine of adverse possession in your state. It isn't possible to claim land through adverse possession in any case there now.
Could they force you to remove personal property from a building on their land, yes. Could they force you to disassemble, demolish, or move a building encroaching on land they own, also very possible.
You're still being granted use of the land by the owner save for the portion that would be set aside for the plot?
There's a practicality here in terms of going with what the property owner wants to do, or finding a reasonable middle ground, given that you are still benefiting from being given exclusive use of their property.
