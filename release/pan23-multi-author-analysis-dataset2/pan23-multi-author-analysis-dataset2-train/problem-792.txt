The great news for Dems is that the 2024 GOP platform will be a repeat: Trump worship, election conspiracy, fear mongering, strict abortion, immigration hatred, anti gay/trans/black/brown/asian, and Hunter Biden's laptop. If there's any change over 2022, it's probably the addition of anti-Semitism.
Maybe there, however this is by no means all of them everywhere. But you’re right everybody hates a repeated loser and people are being much more vocal about it for sure. For those speaking out he’s finally becoming a bigger negative than a positive but none of that has anything to do with Jan6 or the fact he stole confidential records, he’s just causing them not to win races. However he actually still does have supporters because I have seen others come out in his defense. The main argument is that you can’t expect a fighter to just give up, he’s such a great fighter.
Thing is Trump was the first to be willing to grant the wishes of the most extreme, and he actually got elected and tried to deliver those results. Thankfully you just don’t see that combination except for a Donald Trump. That’s a hard act to follow. Hence the Donald Trump admiration society.
