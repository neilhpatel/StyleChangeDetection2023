A report to the police to start would be prudent. That could likely be trespassing as well as property damage.
The neighbor would likely have been entitled to trim the portion of the tree overhanging his property, but not to the extent that it would kill the tree -- and certainly not the entire tree, on your property.
Some trees are worth a lot, some not so much -- it can depend on both type and age of the tree. If you feel this tree was worth a good amount, suing your neighbor for the value of that tree would be an option -- an arborist would be able to give you a good estimate of what the tree might have been worth.
If it were me, after my neighbor trespassed one time and cut down my tree, I would absolutely not allow them back onto the property again. I'd hire professionals to clean up the felled tree and tack that cost onto the lawsuit against him. But that's just me.
Oh boy. You have stumbled into a situation covered by …. Tree law. Look up tree law for your state. Collect photos, contact an arborist, and have the police file a report and trespass your neighbor. Tree law is designed to prevent logging where it shouldn’t happen so the damages you are entitled to are often magnified depending on the state you’re in.
Definitely contact the police and if needed an arborist to assess the value of the tree. Depending on the age and type of tree it could be worth quite a bit.
