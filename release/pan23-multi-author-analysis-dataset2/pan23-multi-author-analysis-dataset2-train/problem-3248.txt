If you pursue legal intervention, you will only exacerbate the situation. Instead take some deep breaths and try to channel your inner Dr. Phil. Stop arguing with her, smile when you see her and say "hello." Compliment her on the flowers she planted in front of her home. Comment on how much her grandson is growing. Talk about the weather and ask her how she's doing. Blow sugar out your ass if you have to. Just don't let things spiral out of control because if you think things are bad now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
NAL - I'm not sure you have enough for a TRO without a direct threat. I may have overlooked something though. Unfortunately MA is not a one party recording state. I'd do my best to push communication to text, e-mail or voicemail when possible. This is your best means of documenting the situation. Of course what happens in front of an exterior security system is what happens in front of an exterior security system. Be mindful of any condo rules when making changes around the place, of course. Beyond that, for now, I'd disengage and de-escalate. If it continues, you could consult a local attorney with the saved voicemails, etc, and request an "angry lawyer letter" requesting the neighbor change course.
