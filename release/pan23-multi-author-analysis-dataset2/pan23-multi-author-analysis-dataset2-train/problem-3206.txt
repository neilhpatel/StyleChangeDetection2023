No it wouldn't. The biggest wars in human history were fought in Europe, not even a century ago. Before that Europe was embroiled in centuries of war over religion.
And let's not pretend that the situation in the Middle East today has nothing to do with Europe. It was the Europeans who destroyed and dismembered the empire that governed the Middle East and then carved up the remains to be their own colonial and quasi-colonial possessions. Rich of the Europeans to be the ones to say "oh we've become so enlightened, why can't they?" when Europe has been fucking around with these people for decades. The British were happy to use jihadist propaganda to urge Arab revolts against the Ottomans, who bungled Jewish immigration into Palestine and washed their hands of the conflict they helped create, not to mention protecting and elevating the Saudis.
The Iranian people have a habit of putting internal conflicts on hold when challenged by an outsider. Look at the Iran-Iraq war. Socialists, pro-democracy protestors, etc. all put their grievances aside to ally with the regime during the war.
Difference is leaders in the Middle East yurn for conflict. They only understand and respect power and violence.
