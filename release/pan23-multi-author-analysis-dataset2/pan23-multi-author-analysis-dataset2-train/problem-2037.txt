So, NAL, but have seen this happen. So, the first thing you have to do is take the shelter to court and prove that they broke city ordinances, SPECIFICALLY that they did not abide by the mandatory stray hold. This is what is going to get the dog back (hopefully). In these cases, if the shelter had abided by the stray hold and then adopted the dog out, it would be a legal transaction between the shelter and the new owner and there isn’t any recourse to be done really. However, if you prove that they didn’t do the mandatory stray hold, then the legality of the ownership paperwork is null and void. The issue being that you would then have to get in contact with the new owners and see if they will relinquish the dog willingly or if you have to get a court order for them.
If you get an actual lawyer to help you out you shouldn't have too much trouble tracking down your dog via the city. You don't really need advice beyond that, you just need counsel. Good luck.
