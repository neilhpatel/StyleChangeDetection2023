First, try pressing zero. Most automated systems have this shortcut. If that doesn't work, just press the number they request. That doesn't affirm that you take on the debt, no matter what they say.
Most of the shady debt collectors spoof their telephone numbers. In the past I have had to pretend to be the debtor so they would give me more info. At that point you can send a cease and desist letter. I am sure you ask for them to stop calling, be sure to note the dates and times so later you can take them to small claims under the TCPA -> telephone consumer protection act. It is the only way I have been able to get them to stop calling for wrong numbers and reselling the debt to another shady collector.
As a debt collector (and I hate admitting that lol)I can tell you that if you call and tell them it's not you and never call you again they have to take your number out of the system if not you are entitled to $$$ when you get a person on the phone they have to identify who they are and ask for a supervisor.
