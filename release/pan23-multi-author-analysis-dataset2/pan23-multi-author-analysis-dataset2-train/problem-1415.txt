I will not be able to buy the house because my credit has not improved as much as it needed. I was hoping with their expertise and the hundreds they helped, as well as them reporting to experian it would help my credit.
In short, my credit took a tumble. I could have spent the extra $500 a month fixing my credit, but was assured by this company this was the way to go.
My credit wasn't even horrible (645). So I was hoping the extra boost to the credit from her reporting to put me around 700. She never reported, as she stated she would.
What was signed in your agreement? I find it hard to believe that they guaranteed that you would improve your credit.
Well that was the intention of her program. That's why I'm wondering if there's legal action. It was based on inflated/false advertising on her website.
Not even for false advertising? I will lose my money I had in for the down payment, around $10,000. My case seems very similar to the vision properties vs. The state of PA.
I believe 645 will get you approved for an FHA. Visit a local credit union and talk to someone. The threshold is 625 if I remember correctly and they have low down payment options available.
