Free to file a police report. You contact the non emergency number for your county and they'll drive to you same day and write the report.
Reporting the crime will not cost you anything. Make a police report, the prosecutor will decide to press charges. You arenâ€™t suing him just filing criminal charges against him. Reach out to a victim advocacy in your area. They will help.
I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's annoying to deal with, but they will try to help you. If police give you a hard time or suspect misguidance from them, contact your local Harbor House/nonprofits for sexual assault and they will help you.
This part may vary by jurisdiction: They can serve a temporary restraining order asap until a court date is set. The court visit will determine a longer restraining order and/or assault charges, subpoena to obtain his phone for evidence.
Your attorney will be appointed for free, court date might be a month out from the date of filing police report.
As for cost of filing for charges at the court (different from just filing the police report for free), I believe it might be around $30?
