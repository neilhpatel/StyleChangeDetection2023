If contacted by the FBI, you should refuse to talk to them and contact an attorney. You'll want one familiar with technical/network matters, as obviously a layperson might not understand how harmless your actions were. As such, I would suggest reaching out to the EFF. They have a history of advocating for security researchers who responsibly disclose security bugs, and this seems within their purview to me. They might not be able to help you directly, but they might be able to refer you to an attorney.
My gut response here is to not talk to the FBI if they contact you (based on the "never talk to the cops" rule). I'd also maybe start seeking out a technologically astute criminal law attorney in the event the FBI does come knocking on your door.
Do not fear the FBI. It's unlikely that ISP2 will get any kind of audience with them. And even if they do, you haven't broken the law according to what you have written here. If they try to say you did something illegal, you have but to challenge them to provide the log entries that prove it.
In the event you do end up talking to law enforcement, I recommend the "STFU" strategy until you have a lawyer present.
To be clear, I understand what you did and I don't think you did anything wrong. But there's no guarantee you'll get an internet-savvy agent who can see through what ISP1 is feeding them.
In terms of protecting CR, I recommend getting them a wifi hot spot and getting them off that network. But it's worth noting that even that won't protect them from scammers and malware.
I see people recommending that you get a technically savvy attorney. While that's a good idea, I doubt they exist. I have a hard enough time finding technically savvy IT professionals, let alone lawyers.
