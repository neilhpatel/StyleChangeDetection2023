Yes and no - after introducing price cap Russia is selling its oil to India below costs of mining. That means that only India is profiting on this transactions and Russia is at 0 income.
Wouldn't an outright ban result in a humongous "black market", where countries who can afford to not give a fuck just continue to buy Russian oil?
China might ignore a sanction, but nobody wants to pay more than others for the same stuff like a chump.
yep also blocking it completely is probably not possible. Having them take a financial loss and India get cheap oil is the best that can be hoped for really.
West calculated that it is best option. Elimination 100% of Russian oil from market will enormously increase its prices and probably EU couldnt handle it. In this case Russians are slaves working for free and lowering global oil proces. Who knows maybe it is the best solution: anglo-saxons were always best at statistics in warfare.
Long run sanctions on oil field equipment and services probably mean russia's ability to produce declines.
