If there is no specific period to your request, I can recommend Owen Lattimore's paper titled "Origins of the Great Wall of China: A Frontier Concept in Theory and Practice" which is available in JSTOR.
His theory essentially posits that Chinese leaders, then and now, favored rigid frontiers, symbolized by the multiple Great Walls built by successive ethnically Chinese dynasties, since the rigid frontier clearly symbolized the separation of a proper Chinese state and the outsider states that they sought to defend themselves from, which were the various pastoral nomadic tribes who inhabit the areas which constitute modern-day Mongolia.
Lattimore is quite outdated these days, not least because it's become more commonly recognised that the perception and establishment of a rigid frontier began with the contiguous Ming border walls that began to be established in the 1470s â€“ Arthur Waldron's The Great Wall of China is far more reflective of contemporary scholarship.
I'm afraid I may be unhelpful regarding the broader historiography of frontiers, but by 'modern' China how modern do you mean, becuase I may have a recommendation or two about frontier regions under the high Qing period in the 18th century.
