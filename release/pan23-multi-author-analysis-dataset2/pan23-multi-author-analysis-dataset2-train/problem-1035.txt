Under no circumstances should you talk to the police about this incident. They may tell you that they are trying to clear your name, clear up confusion, hear your side of the story, etc. Those reasons are false -- the police are trying to build a case to make an arrest. If you are contacted by the police, immediately tell them you won't answer any questions without your lawyer present.
If you think she's going to go to the police, you might want to go ahead and consult with a criminal defense attorney in the jurisdiction where this took place. That way, you have a lawyer ready when you need one.
An addendum to this: if the police have enough information to arrest you, they're going to arrest you. There is no way you're going to talk your way out of this.
Ask any seasoned police officer, "Have you once, ever, thought to yourself 'i have enough to make an arrest' but then something they say persuade you not to arrest them?".
NAL - Anything you say can and will be used against you and nothing you say can be used for you, as it would be dismissible as hearsay. Talking to the cops is a lose - lose/a best draw situation.
