Yes, they certainly have a case. They own the property and the builder trespassed and modified the property without their permission.
Contact the prior closing agent and file a Corrective Deed- this corrects the prior deed that transferred your lot by accident. The other owners probably don’t even want the extra lot, which they’ll need to pay by way of taxes and assessments.
Along with the Corrective Deed, you’ll also need to do two things: (1) if they got a mortgage on the property, the Bank will file a Release to literally release the “extra” lot listed as collateral and (2) their Owner & Lender Title Policy will be amended to reflect this).
Correcting the prior deed is going to take up to 6 months from what we've been told, so the builder is trying to just buy the lot(s) back. Only problem is that the person who now owns the lot(s) wants $75k and is being stubborn about it, they bought the lot for $21k in January of this year.
I wish it was as easy as correcting a deed but it's not. My fiancé were planning to be moving by end of March at the latest and now we don't have a home to move into so we are paying month to month (1.3x the regular rent amount) at our apartment. If we start the home buying process over again it will take another month to find a house and another month from there to close on it, and that's if all goes well.
I am not sure if I included enough information in the original post to really show what is going on but this is a huge issue to me and a huge issue to the home builder because they are losing money just like I am. If I could have it solved by April without litigation I would be overwhelmingly happy but from everything I've been told by the seller's agent, that's not going to happen.
