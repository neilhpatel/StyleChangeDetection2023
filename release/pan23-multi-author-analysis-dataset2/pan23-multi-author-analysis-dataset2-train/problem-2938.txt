Landlord might also be violating HOA covenants (if the property is part of an HOA) by not maintaining the lawn. Non-compliance penalties usually fall on the property owner not the tenant.
Before going the full lawyer route, you might consider contacting code enforcement. Most municipalities have ordinances on grass height.
Also, a functioning HVAC may be required for occupancy by the municipality and some insurance companies require it for coverage.
Despite what the landlord says, you should report problems you have with the property as they arise, because it's one of your obligations as a tenant.
If all the landlord does wrong is not mow your lawn, or ignore your broken air conditioner, then you can demand what you think is reasonable compensation, once you have moved out, and sue your landlord in small claims if they don't pay.
Your landlord cannot raise your rent until your lease is up, and your landlord cannot evict you without good cause, such as you not paying rent or you damaging the property. Furthermore, the landlord cannot evict you in retaliation for asking for repairs. If your landlord tries to evict you, you can bring up all your documented communications about issues and the landlord's responses to them as evidence of retaliation, not to mention refuting whatever grounds he is trying to use.
You should also prepare in case your landlord tries to evict you illegally. Keep a copy of your lease accessible to you from outside of the house (for instance in your car, or on your phone). If you find yourself locked out or if the landlord cuts off your utilities, call the police about it.
