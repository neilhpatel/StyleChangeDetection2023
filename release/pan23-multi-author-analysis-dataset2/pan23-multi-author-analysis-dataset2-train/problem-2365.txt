There are too many variables that are not explained here such as the details of the contract between you and the management of the complex. You say that they put you in a hotel, then you say you are paying for it. I assume you are paying with the expectation of reimbursement per contract. Assuming there is a written contract, certainly review the terms of the contract. Any communication with the management company should be written, email is great. I would send an email highlighting the fact that you have all of your belongings there and cannot easily just move everything elsewhere. If you need to relocate, I would hire a moving company to handle the move, they'll easily have it done in a few hours, and submit the receipt for reimbursement to the management company. Good luck.
- 2. As a single-occupancy normally minimally requires, is this a single-bed room? (Not speaking about size but number of beds).
So what does the manager or landlord of your complex say when you talk to them? I'm assuming the hotel was the one that told you that the complex added her? What does she say?
