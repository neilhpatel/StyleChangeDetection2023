First off, wikileaks was (is?) an amazing thing and sadly from what everyone around Assange has later told, be it his co-founders etc., the man is a megalomaniac narcissist asshole.
You can easily tell this by the comparison to Snowden. Assange hijacked his own project, wikileaks, to be all about him and his bullshit. He made it about him as if he's some Bond character. Whilst no one ever talks shit about Snowden because all that man did was show the truth. But Assange happily did russia (and other actor's) bidding during critical elections that could've tanked the entire western world.
People don't want to talk about it, but if we'd had a 2nd term trump, Le Pen and boris then the EU/Nato would've most likely been either fuck-stuck in diplomatic meltdown or impotent to the point that no one would've supported Ukraine and russia would've easily rolled the country. Never forget that trump literally extorted Zelensky- and Ukraine for diplomatic bullshit favours.
On the topic of conspiracies, I honestly do believe there were major dangerous forces that might've tried to force an extradition of him if he'd gone to Sweden at the very moment of the original meltdown. A sort of shock-and-awe where whatever forces in Sweden that got pressured could've pretended "Oh we were just following protocol!" before anyone realised the complications of his extradition. It's empirically highly doubtful, since Sweden ranks some of the highest in the world in Rule of Law, respect of human rights etc. but the whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth. Call it intuition and entirely fallible. But after all the reporter-murders, Epstein-associates getting murdered, I've genuinely started to doubt the ironfacade of our legal societies.
I think he's asking for more information about the specific incident in question rather than more opining on an incident it is assumed that he's already familiar with.
