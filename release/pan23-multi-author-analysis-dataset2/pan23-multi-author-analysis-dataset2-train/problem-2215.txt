How was the payment initiated? Did you enroll in some form of auto payment plan when your bill came due that was set to a certain amount or the minimum monthly payment, did you manually initiate a payment manually, or was it by some other device?
i did enroll in automatic payments of $100 biweekly. there’s no way to do it online, you have to call and set it up because it’s a small town bank. So yeah it was their mistake bc there’s no way for me to initiate it online or type in $1000.
You need to call and ask to speak to the loan or loan servicing department. They 100% can refund an overpayment especially if it was their mess up. Don’t speak to a branch or customer service, speak directly with the loan department.
Was this your miskey or the banks? Either way they can refund you your overpayment unless your account is behind then they do not have to refund an overpayment.
You do have to wait until the payment post though on both sides. Can’t do anything when it’s pending.
