This. This should be the strategy moving forward. Repubs have gerrymandered the country to the limit. If you can peel off even 5% of their voters by using their own idiotic perspectives against them, a lot of these races look very different. I tell every regressive I meet two things - one, millionaires and billionaires don't have our interests at heart and two, they already know who is going to win anyway. I'm not wasting my time voting when I could be working when I know they're going to rig the election anyway.

I think it is a narrative that is actively pushed in Red states, because the way they have their states Gerrymandered, a swarm of empowered young voters could bounce them out of their legislatures and the US House.
