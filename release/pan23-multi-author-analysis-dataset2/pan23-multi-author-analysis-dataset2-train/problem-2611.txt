I would not sent money for taxes to a former employer who got caught misclassifying you. You can submit an estimated tax payment to the federal government and/or state government directly. This avoids any risk of the employer simply stealing it by not actually forwarding it on to the government.
If you don't send them back, you could potentially be fired I suppose, but you'd just have to pay the taxes when you file anyway.
It was a seasonal job, I'm not even in the state anymore. It's not the paying taxes I'm worried about, I just don't know if they're doing something funny with their payroll and if I should comply.
This question is better for /r/tax. They tend to have a better handle on how to deal with these sorts of things, including how to file or amend your tax returns.
The answer does not change. The amount you made will be reported on your tax forms, and you've paid less than you should have.
So there will be an amount that you're short when you file. And then you'll pay that amount then, even if you don't send them anything back.
