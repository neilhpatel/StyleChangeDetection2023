He sent photos of her to various people, one of whom was an ex-friend, so of course he sent it to his wife, who proceeded to kick the guy out of his house.
There's audio recording on whatsapp of multiple people getting her photos without her permission, hence the kick up. He's not an ex, just an employee from AT&T who didn't get what he wanted so he decided to hack her.
Except that random dudes who work for AT&T don't have the technical skills needed to hack a phone on a network outside of the one they're granted access to by their employer.
So either this guy has a lot of tech skill and is woefully underemployed (unlikely), or she has stuff backed up to the cloud with a password that's insanely easy to guess (possible) or she provided him the password or pictures voluntarily and doesn't want to admit that (also possible).
Essentially what I want to know, if yes by a small chance given his position in the company, and a generally scumbag nature, could he hack her phone in any way shape or form?
