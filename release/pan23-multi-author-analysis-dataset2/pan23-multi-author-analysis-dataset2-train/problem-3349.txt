When a debt collector contacts you for the first time, you ask them for their name and their address so you can send them something called a debt validation letter. This letter has to be sent within 30 days of their initial contact with you and should be sent via certified mail. A lot of the use of this approach is in gauging how the debt collector responds to your request for their address. If they balk at the request or refuse to give you an address or claim they aren't obligated to verify your debt, they are probably scammers. You can find sample debt validation/verification letters .
Do not give this individual your sensitive details or agree to pay the debt or make arrangements to pay the debt before you go the debt verification letter route.
