Any person is allowed to use reasonable physical force in the defence of another person, so yes, if a child is being assaulted by another, a teacher may use physical force to protect the child and it is not considered to be assault (as in the crime assault).
Note that whether or not the teacher is disciplined or fired by the school is a totally different issue, and a teacher might legally defend a student and still get fired for violating school or district policies.
NAL, but a former HS teacher from a school with multiple fights. The specifics vary by state, but in general everyone is allowed to use a reasonable amount of force in defense of another person. The key word is "reasonable." As an extreme example, if an 8-year-old is assaulting a 7-year old, striking the 8-year old is almost definitely unreasonable under any circumstances. As the students get larger and the ease of restraining/stopping them decreases, more actions are considered "reasonable.".
