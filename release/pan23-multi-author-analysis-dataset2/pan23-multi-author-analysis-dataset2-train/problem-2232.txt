Who ever interviewed, if that was the SPD then I suggest calling their office to see what the process is. There is a chance they wont release the tapes. I added the website link for more information on how to contact.
That is the info I need. So S. Cabrera has the rights to this interview transcript Is there a statute of limitations? If I change the names and don't use the transcript verbatim is there wiggle room? This is the interview. It works so well as a script. You can hardly see what is going on with Dorothea. FYI the actress I am working with is named Joanna Cassidy. She would be amazing. We just want to shoot the interview and nothing else. As a short. What are we up against? We will approach Cabrera. Just want to know my options if he says no. THANKS edit.removed the link to the video (easy google). IF we make a short film without permission and we make zero money how liable are we? We are planning to make it with no budget on digital cameras and editing equipment we own. The actors and crew are no salary. It's almost an extended 'screen test' of Joanna in this role. In a TV movie they would only show a few seconds of the interview but for me that's what I want to see, the whole interview. We'll just submit it to some festivals and show our friends...and maybe pitch a feature...... If you goggle Dorothea Puente 1988 interview you can see it. I just can't post a link here. Thanks!
Thank you. It's actually faster and easier all round for me to just listen and type since I'm formatting it into final draft and cleaning up some of the phrasing. I'm directing it so i need to be very familiar with it anyway. Thanks for the help!
