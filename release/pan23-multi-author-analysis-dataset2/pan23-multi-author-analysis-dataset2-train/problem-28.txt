Using an aimbot is not intentional infliction of emotional distress. I'm sure part of the intent is to annoy you, but the kind of intent and the kind of distress is more akin to doing things like convincingly telling you your wife and children died painfully, when you have no way to verify and every reason to trust them, than making you mad in a game.
Using an aimbot is not negligent infliction of emotional distress, first because of the same severity issue, and second, because there's no negligence. There's no legal duty to play fair, so breaching that duty is not legally negligent.
I can't think of any other tort that would apply, and in the absence of a tort, your damages are irrelevant. Your recourse is not to play with cheaters. If you're playing online, and you don't have control over matchmaking, then play through services that actively monitor for cheating and take action on it. This is mostly a customer service issue.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or youâ€™ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
And if losing to a robot makes you so distressed you need a _lifetime_ of medical support, maybe video games aren't for you.
