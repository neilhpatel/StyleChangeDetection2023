I'd add that if she is not allowed to normally pick their son up from daycare I'd notify the daycare that she is not allowed to pick up the child, she could be a danger to the child because she may be under the influence, and that if they release the child to her you will hold them legally liable for any harm that comes to the child due to releasing them to an unauthorized person. Let them know if she shows up you'd like them to call the police and then you for kidnapping.
Again, this would be if she's not normally allowed to pick the child up from daycare. If she takes the child in a method not approved of by you, the courts, etc. on a day/time she is not supposed to have the child than that is legally kidnapping.
Daycares are legally bound to pick-up lists. You usually provide them when you sign-up there. If she is still on the list, have her removed immediately.
I would just stress the importance of the ex-wife being on the "do not allow to pick up" list. Just call them and re-iterate that she is STILL not allowed to pick up the son, and provide any documentation that defends his statement (court orders, legal paperwork, etc).
I wouldn't mention legal responsibility until they break that rule. I would double check with the daycare first, but presumably they have a clause of not releasing the child to an adult unless they are on an approved list, or not on a not-approved list.
