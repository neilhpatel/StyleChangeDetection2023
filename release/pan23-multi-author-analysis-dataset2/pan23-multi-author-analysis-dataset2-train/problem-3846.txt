Yeah, absolutely - comments like this (GOP [elected position] says that Jan. 6th should disqualify Trump) is the party attempting to protect itself should he run. They haven’t gotten suddenly all interested in accountability, he’s infectious medical waste for them politically and they want him off the board. Nothing more.
Letting him run all but guarantees a win for democrats. He won't win the GOP primary and will run as an independent and split the vote.
That being said, anyone involved in Jan 6th should be disqualified from office from president all the way down.
Trump has done nothing but lose supporters since 2020. Prison, COVID, just tired of his shit. There's no way he'd win again. Dems could put up the worst option and it'd still not even be close because they'll always vote against Trump. Hopefully they'll put up an actual good candidate and not just Biden again.
It doesn’t matter anyway now. Trump won. 3 judges in the SCOTUS will keep his “legacy” in place no matter what happens. Not even a Sanders presidency can turn that around.
