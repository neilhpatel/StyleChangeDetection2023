Her poll numbers in Arizona are abysmal among Democrats who mostly seem to hate her there, and even among all votes she is underwater and well below a majority or even plurality of support. If she ran as an Independent spoiler she might peel away some Independents, but most Republicans wouldn't vote for her (they prefer genuinely racist MAGA types who aren't bisexual) and Democrats would overwhelmingly vote for the Dem Senate candidate from their primaries. It's possible she would even split the GOP vote more than the Dem one. LOL.
