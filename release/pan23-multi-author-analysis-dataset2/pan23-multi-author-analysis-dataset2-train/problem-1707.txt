Please look at the thread, you will see I was questioning someone else's statement to that effect, they wanted some magic set of people to deal with a set of problems that few are qualified for, and for nomoney.
As for the baddies, Teach them a lesson, and force them to be under the direct supervision of mental health professionals. Some of them will reveal themselves to be dangerous psychopaths and one hopes the mental health professionals will exercise their authority to permanently label the psychopaths as disabled, when it comes to police field work.
It should be automatic that every police officer who draws his weapon, or commits an act of violence against a citizen will be transferred to an unarmed division of the police who deal exclusively with mental health and domestic violence calls until the investigation into the incident has been completed. While in this unit their own mental health and conduct will be under continuous review by the mental health professionals they work with, who will be able to prescribe further corrective actions up to termination and hospitalization, if the officer is a certifiable psychopath.
If the officer does not like these conditions of employment, he is always free to resign, unless he is arrested or hospitalized.
We can't get enough police with rarely any restrictions in the current system. You think we will be able to get a whole new group in an underpaid/underappreciated role? Not likely.
