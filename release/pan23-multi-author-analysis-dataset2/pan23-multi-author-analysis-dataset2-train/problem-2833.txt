On a state level, it'd depend state-by-state, but there's no way it's going to pass in red states, which are the ones that need it the most. And even then, it could get raised to federal courts and you're once more faced with the issue of a conservative SCOTUS using some wonky interpretation of Constitutional law.
Unfortunately, the odds of that happening don't seem particularly high; they're still out there calling any investigation into the terrorist attack on the Capitol on January Sixth "partisan," which is just wild to me.
Calling it partisan is calling one side complicit which is WORSE than if it were two sides both against a crime. Calling that partisan is to implicate at least one side, rather than letting the guilty part just be isolated terrorists.

Yikes. Pretty terrifying to see how election denialism and threats have become basically standard operating procedure for a significant section of the right.
