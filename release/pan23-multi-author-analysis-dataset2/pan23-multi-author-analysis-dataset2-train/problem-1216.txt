First off a private individual can’t “file a warrant” - maybe she means restraining order but its highly unlikely a judge would ever grant that without a very real showing of the requirements laid out (imminent harm for example).
If you can't get your birth certificate, contact the circuit clerk or vital records office of the county you were born in and find out how to get a certified copy. Do this before you move further away from the county you were born, because you may have an easier time picking it up by person.
Depends on the state. You can definitely file a complaint to get them to file charges. I am a criminal defense attorney and I have seen plenty of cases where the only statement is a complaint filed by the complainant.
A clarification on this: They can file a complaint. The DA's office can then refile it right into the trash can. While the DA's office can file criminal charges, they're typically not obligated to. The odds of them picking up a case like this with a non-cooperative "victim" are pretty slim.
At least a couple counties I know of, it costs maybe $30 top? You will probably need a photo id and to know some basic info, like your parent's names. I am not positive what the rules are where you are born so please check their website and then call them if you have further questions/can't find the info.
Best of luck in life, it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders despite your mother's parenting. I also want to recommend seeking out a therapist when you get settled. Even if you don't need it now, sometimes the trauma sneaks up on you when you're finally safe.
