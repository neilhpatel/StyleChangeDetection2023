There is no way to guarantee that the landlord would see your email although he probably will. Protect yourself by going ahead and sending him the written forwarding address in paper writing so there will be no excuse or reason for them not to send you your deposit.
If you have emailed the landlord your (physical) forwarding address and they’re refusing to return your security deposit, you can either try to argue or you could just mail a paper letter with it. This is one of those cases where arguing (Even If you’re right) might just be more work than playing along.
Sec. 92.107 does not specify the manner in which you must communicate this to the landlord aside from that it must be in writing, so email should suffice. Should the matter end up in court (hypothetically), I wouldn’t want to be the landlord arguing before a judge why I don’t think email counts as “a written statement of the tenant’s forwarding address” unless the lease or other agreement says up from that you agree to provide it via paper. That said, for many things, certified paper mail is “I’m not fooling around, you have received notice,” so for some things, you might want to use certified mail to signal to the other party not to yank your chain.
