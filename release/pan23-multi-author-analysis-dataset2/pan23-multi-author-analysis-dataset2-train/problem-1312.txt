You can refuse to cooperate with the investigation and let your wishes be known to the prosecutor, but they are under no obligation to drop the charges.
What you "should" do is mostly an issue for your conscience, but I might note that it doesn't sound like your former friend offered an apology or said anything about repairing the damage to your car. She's only told you how inconvenient it is _for her_ to be in jail on charges for crimes she committed, and then asked you for money and help to avoid the consequences of her actions.
You can't drop the charges, but you can ask the prosecutor. If you ask and they agree, expect that you won't be able to change your mind, unless she reoffends at a later date.
If you take responsibility for her bail and she fails to appear in court, her bail will most likely be forfeited and you will lose all the money. If you go through a bail bond company, they will want the entire amount of the bail from you, not just the deposit.
Depending on the offense, there may be conditions on her bail, such as not leaving the area. Even if she is allowed to travel, if “send her home” means some place far away, the likelihood of your losing the bail money is high.
