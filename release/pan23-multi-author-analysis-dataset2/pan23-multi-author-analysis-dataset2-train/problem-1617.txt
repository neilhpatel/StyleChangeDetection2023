This feels like you're dancing around if you did or did not follow policy. Would your facility consider a mother with a positive test from four weeks ago but no negative test to be "covid positive".
It looks like you had an obligation to at least (attempt to) give the form to the parents. Did that happen? It also looks like it's really simple for the parents to submit the declaration if not completed at the hospital...and that it doesn't cost them money to do so. Here are some excerpts from what appears to be the relevant law:
This doesn't make sense, at least as written. If a woman can give actually give birth with your employees present, how is that less (potentially) dangerous than a signature?
According to the CDC people can continue to test positive for up to 90 days after they have covid because of how the virus works. So even though she is no longer contagious she could have not been able to give you a negative test.
There is really no way to ensure that you can collect this signature safely? How are the other workers in the facility safely delivering a baby if the mother is covid positive? Seems like you could be taking the same precautions to ensure you are getting the correct signatures. For the parents to somehow have to figure out how to go to court in a pandemic seems like undue stress that your clinic is causing on new parents.
