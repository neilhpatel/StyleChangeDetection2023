This is tagged "non-US." Location matters a lot with this question. If you're unwilling to provide location, you'll need to speak to an attorney in your area.
Divorce law is state/country specific. Again, your location matters. The idea that you'd move forward with a marriage under these conditions is interesting. You absolutely should speak to a lawyer and get a sense of what's happening before moving forward. Regardless of title, name, duration, etc you should expect that any divorce would be an absolute knife fight and that finding/identifying assets would be a wild challenge.
Not a lawyer, If the properties are in his parents name, then they are not his assets in the eyes of the state. You would get nothing, as legally in the eyes of the state, he has nothing. I look at that as the most solid prenup he could secure to protect himself and his assets. Prenups get thrown out. People fight over splitting assets without prenups. But in the eyes of the state, he himself has none of those assets, so you can never go after them. Those assets are untouchable unless the parents want them to be touched. Your fiancé may have control over those assets, but he legally doesn’t own those assets.
