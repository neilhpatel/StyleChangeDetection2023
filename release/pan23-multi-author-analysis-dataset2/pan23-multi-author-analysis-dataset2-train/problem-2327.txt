Whether there is a maximum percentage on the contingency fee and whether it is applied to the gross or net recovery varies from state to state. What state are you in? The answer to your question is yes, you can negotiate, but first you need to know what the rules are as they relate to contingent fees in that state.
Attorneys usually take between 33.3% and 40% (as a standard rate in the US) of the gross settlement value. Then case costs come out and then any health insurance liens have to be paid (if you were treated for any injuries that resulted from the accident). You get whatever is left after that. You can try to negotiate something different but Attorney fees and costs usually come off of the top.
I don't know that information but I can say most of the attorneys I work with, from all over the US, are willing to negotiate a lower fee if the lien amount to settlement value is low. They want you to walk away with something at the end of it.
I see. I will try to negotiate then. The attorney only writes that it is 33.3% up to first trial, and then first appeal and subsequent trials will be decided later when the time comes. Do you know any standard rates for appeals etc?
Be careful about going with the lawyer who will cut his/her fee the most. There may be a reason why they’re willing to do that, e.g. they are desperate for clients, in which case they may try to settle your case for less than it might be worth, because they want their cut quickly. Unless it’s a great case with significant damages, I think that the best lawyers often will decline to negotiate their rates down, because they don’t need to, and don’t want to get the reputation of doing so.
