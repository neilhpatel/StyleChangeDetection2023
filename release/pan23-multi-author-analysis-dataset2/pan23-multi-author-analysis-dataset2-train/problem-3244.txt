If your mom has a lawyer, your dad needs one, too. He's going to get absolutely hosed if he does into this without a lawyer when the other side has one, too. Both your parents can ask for and will likely recieve 50/50 custody, your mother will likely receive child support since she doesn't work and your father does, alimony will depend on the laws for that in your state. But if your dad does in without a lawyer it's possible that your mom will end up with majority custody because your dad doesn't know what he's doing or how to go up against someone who does this for a living.
The fact that your father already is acting defeated before the case is even started is evident that he needs an attorney. Attorneys know the law. They know the judges. They know how to present the relevant facts to those particular judges in a way that they feel is most effective. They can analyze the facts and give him honest, educated, advice on what is and isn't feasible to do in this particular case. He needs an attorney. He needs to go have some consultations with some and see if they'll work on a payment plan if he can't afford to pay for the complete retainer up front.
This isn't your problem to solve. Your father is presumably has an attorney. If he does, let the attorney do their job. If your father doesn't have an attorney, he needs one.
