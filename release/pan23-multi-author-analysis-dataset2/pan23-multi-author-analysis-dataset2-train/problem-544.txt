Personally speaking, that depends on how you're using Carlin's podcasts, which is really the main crux here. Pop history is good at two things: sparking interest and showing the basics. Visual media is especially good at this, as it can provide the flash that books just lack.
Sorry I can't provide more information, I did some study on Venice and other renaissance places during university, but that was a couple of years ago. In my experience, though, I'd say that if there were any big competitors they wouldn't be mentioned. Da Vinci would have probably eclipsed them a lot, what's the point of writing about some other dude when Da Vinci has just dropped another sick invention or painting.
The Byzantines retained much of the Hellenistic technology: for example, we know that a hydraulic pipe organ was donated by the Byzantine emperor to Pepin the Short, and then to Charlemagne. Liutprand of Cremona in his diplomatic mission described with wonder an automata-throne, probably water-powered as well. But did they lose other Roman technology, for example concrete? If so, why?
