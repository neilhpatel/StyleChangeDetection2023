Yeah my MIL seems to be going through some toxic shit with her family rn. She speaks Español, so I don’t know what she’s saying, but I can tell by the sound of her voice she’s having a rough go. Luckily I speak the international language of hugs, so gave her a huge hug.
I don’t know if this will help, but just remember that these large painful voids come from truly amazing people. I think the pain for him just had no place to go and he couldn’t process so like an injured animal he lashed out. None of us are perfect, so I just really try and hold on to the thought that the best way I could be here for him to process was to endure without absorbing.
Ya my brother felt the week after my fathers death was the time to air out and being up every grievance he had, drunkenly, through text. Things are better now and I understand grief does strange things to people, but while it’s something I can forgive I cannot forget.
Then Brits are all pissed off at Megan and know that she’s somehow a fraud, using him, or vaguely racist dog whistle.
