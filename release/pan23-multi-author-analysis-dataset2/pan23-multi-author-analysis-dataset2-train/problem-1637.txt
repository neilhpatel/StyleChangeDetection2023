The landlord can terminate your lease before January 3, 2022 only if you are in violation of one or more terms of the lease. If you think it might go somewhere, you could try explaining your position, i.e., it's not against the lease, so you can't kick me out, and see what she says. Otherwise, there's not really anything to do until you are actually served with an eviction complaint. If you are, get an attorney.
I assume you’re legally allowed to own the guns you have in your jurisdiction? If you’re on a fixed term lease and there’s no prohibition on firearms, she can’t terminate the lease. However, often these sorts of issues sours relationships and she may find other ways or reasons to end your lease or make life difficult. I would consider continuing your search (with less urgency) while this plays out.
Yes I am. I'm also a registered conceal carry holder. I'll keep looking and planning for my escape later in the year. If we are both in agreeance to end the lease prematurely, will I have to pay her anything?
