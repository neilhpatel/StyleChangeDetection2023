If you or she calls the youth legal aid, fyi it's for 13-17 so I guess be the judge of what you tell them to get an answer to your question. "Does my mom need to release me from foster care when I turn 18" seems to be a simple enough question, but I'm not sure they'll talk to her if they know she's 18.
Generally what happens is when someone in foster care turns 18 they’re out of the system because legally they aren’t children anymore. They’re on their own and can do whatever they want (though they may qualify for certain public benefits because they were in foster care).
Right however she is still in the foster program, and to my knowledge she has no disabilities that would affect her age limitations. So why is she still in foster care?
I have no idea, which is why I said it didn’t sound right. The foster parents can let her keep living in their house if they want to, it’s their house. That doesn’t necessarily mean she’s still “in the system.” Again, who is telling her this stuff? It matters for figuring out what’s going on.
