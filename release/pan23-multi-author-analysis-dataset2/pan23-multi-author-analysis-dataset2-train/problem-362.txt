Ask them how to cancel. Follow their directions, but if their directions don't involve sending them a letter via certified mail requesting that your account be terminated, do that as well. If you do not cancel the contract, they will continue to charge your card. If you prevent them from charging your card, they will send the debt to collections.
Look at the actual contract. Some memberships require for you to submit a written request or complete a cancellation form in order to terminate your membership. If you lost your contract then request a copy of your agreement or ask them written instructions to cancelling.
I never signed a contract. I paid them money and they gave me access to their gym. I don't see how they can keep charging me if I never signed a contract. I have an employee of the gym on recording stating that I have no signed contract with their gym on record.
Have your bank block them as fraudulent and initiate charge backs, and let them investigate, the gym has then to produce a valid contract to prove that it's not fraud, and if they can't you get your money back.
