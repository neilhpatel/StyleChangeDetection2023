Okay here wait, so what if someone took pictures when they were young (naked). The girl sent the guy a naked picture, and kept it... until now, would the girl / man be both at fault or just the man for keeping the pic?
The ex is in possession of child pornography and can go to prison for this. If the photos are released, then the ex is distributing child pornography and can go to prison for way longer.
So if two people sent photos of them selfs naked letâ€™s say at the age 15. And one of them kept it until now and is using it against the other person. The person with the underage photo is at fault? Not the other person?
Wait to make sure you have the right idea, I am just a nobody. One of my old friends were in this situation. It turns out she and the other guy were sending pics and doing stuff when they were 15. He would choke her and almost to the point of blacking out. In fact a few times happened to her. And he would take pictures of her naked while she was unconscious. I know some laws have requirements of bring it up or some expire more so. What could she do? All 3 of us live in Wisconsin.
