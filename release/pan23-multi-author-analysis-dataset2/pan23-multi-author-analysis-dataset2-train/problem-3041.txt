The state brings charges against people that they believe they can prove - if they don't think that they can get a conviction for attempted murder, they won't elevate what she's charged with.
The District Attorney ultimately decides the charges. It comes down to the nature of the crime and the feasibility of the defendant being found guilty. Attempted murder can be very difficult to charge somebody with, especially when there’s little to no evidence to suggest a murder was premeditated (which is generally what is being looked for when considering attempted murder). I don’t know where you live, but I do know that 2nd degree assault, or aggravated assault, usually carries the same punishment range as attempted murder. This can be different dependent on where you live.
Is your sister currently in custody? Realistically, If she has significant mental health issues, it would be unlikely that more severe charges would be added. Talk to the prosecutor, and ask that a mental health evaluation be requested, given she’s a danger to herself and others. With an eval, they may be able to assist her in getting appropriate treatment and/or civil commitment. They can also request medication/therapy a mandatory requirement on her sentence.
