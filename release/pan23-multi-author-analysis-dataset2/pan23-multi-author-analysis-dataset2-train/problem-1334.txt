Yes, it's perfectly legal, as is ending your employment if you refuse to get vaccinated. Some protections you may have include protections offered by the ADA and some religious requirements prohibiting vaccinations.
I have read that some states have laws not allowing this. Would I need to be living in that state or would it be based on the location of the company hq?
Yes, it is legal for your employer to want their staff vaccinated against a highly communicable, dangerous disease.
I’m not arguing the vaccine or the virus, I’m examining the precedent. What other medical information can they request? Will they need to know what medications someone is on? Past medical history? Etc etc. slippery slope.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or you’ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
Of course you are. You didn't take a sudden interest in what your employer can mandate out of nowhere. You don't want to get a shot. No one is going to look at this otherwise.
It is not. Nor will your belief make it so. Further, numerous professions have required proof of a variety of vaccinations or medical tests for decades. Because there is a justifiable need in doing so. Just as there is here.
