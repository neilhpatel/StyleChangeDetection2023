Good, pile on the pressure. We can't let them get off scot free for everything they've done, we can't repeat the same mistake we did with russia in the past.
I still think about the night before the downing when there was a post about evacuating from Iran and a redditor said he was worried about his mom trying to leave to go back to Canada…and then the next day I saw the news of the downing and how Canadians were on board. I’ll never know if his mom made it back safely.
I’d love to think I’m priceless and to my kids I am. But all our lives exists in this horrid capital machine we all built and deriving fair market value is not that hard - and just sucks when you realise how cheap life can be.
I have been valued different at various times - I think the best one was company we built got acquired in Silicon Valley.
Now that’s the valley where your head needs to have been educated for a while, with luck and privilege.
If you look into the space of “value for life” well then it’s a bit off. But the “value for life” metric is like an economic impact and that’s I think over blown for value… since the value is in your spend and growth of an economy .
But that’s an exception let’s look closer - that number they got (above) is actually close to what my life is worth if I die according to the life insurance premiums pay out for wages lost to death. (My kids get a bit more than that if I die) again from my work.
So yeah I’d put myself economically with in this price range (I live in South Africa so usd go way further).
