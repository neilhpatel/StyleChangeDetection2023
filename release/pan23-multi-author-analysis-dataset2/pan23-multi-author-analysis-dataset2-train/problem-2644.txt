If you know what this is all about, it would be prudent to take whatever steps necessary to rectify the issue in the meantime.
Would you recommend letting my landlord into my room so they can smell that no smoking has taken place, or would that be a stupid idea? I think that’s all the evidence I have besides my word. It feels time sensitive, as a smell would naturally fade from my room if the accusation WAS true, so I figured I should get them into my room as soon as possible.
If this is a dormitory or other school-provided housing, your protections might not be as strong as a regular, non-school-affiliated residential rental. Whatever agreements you entered into in terms of this housing would be relevant.
You might ensure there are no other lease violations going on in your room before doing so. The landlord doesn't have to just look for smoking -- if they notice something else they're welcome to take action on it.
The complex isn’t affiliated with the school And as far as I know they have zero evidence besides a roommate complaint because the accusation is false in the first place.

Awesome thank you, hopefully I can walk them through my room. I am not violating anything in my lease to my knowledge, I will confirm that before my meeting with them!
