This contribution is kind of a cheat. /u/Zeuvembie asked a few weeks ago. I found the question interesting enough to do some research for, but never got around to writing anything up.
Floating Features are intended to allow users to contribute their own original work. If you are interested in reading recommendations, , or else limit them to follow-up questions to posted content. Similarly, please do not post top-level questions. This is not an AMA with panelists standing by to respond. Such questions ought to be submitted as normal questions in the subreddit.
As is the case with previous , there is relaxed moderation here to allow more scope for speculation and general chat than there would be in a usual thread! But with that in mind, we of course expect that anyone who wishes to contribute will do so politely and in good faith.
If you have any questions about our Floating Features or the Flair Drive, please keep them as responses to this comment.
