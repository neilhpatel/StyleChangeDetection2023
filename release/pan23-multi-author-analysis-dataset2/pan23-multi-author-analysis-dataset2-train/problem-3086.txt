Fuck you FIFA. You forced Brazil to sell it in stadiums but hey because it's Qatar, fuck your own rules right. Bunch of money hungry fuckwits ruining the world cup.
In Brazil Fifa could probably sue the govt for that, fund an opposition party or run ads against the government.
Not saying Fifa isn't shit or corrupt. But the problem is Qatar that they chose a country where they have very little recourse or control and just have to play along at this point. They aren't "letting" Qatar do it - they have no power in Qatar.
Holding the cup elsewhere would deftly sidestep these problems.... Especially since fans are outraged anyways.
I didn't say anything about Fifa not being shit in anyway. Just that in this situation the fuckup was putting yourself under the control of an authoritarian regime, not being more respectful of Qatar's requests re: alcohol than Brazil's.
They made Brazil sell alcohol to maximize revenue, and as you say they're going the opposite direction this year for the same reason. This whole fiasco is gonna lose them revenue in the long term, however. Every decision they've made regarding this cup has been incredibly short-sighted, from a revenue perspective, from advertising and sponsorship perspective, and from a fan retention perspective... Which really all ends up being the same thing.
