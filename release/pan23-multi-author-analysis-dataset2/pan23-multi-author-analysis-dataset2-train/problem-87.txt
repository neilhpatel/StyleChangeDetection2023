The unclaimed money—what’s the chain here? Grandfather had some sort of account. The account listed Somebody as beneficiary. Somebody died before Grandfather. Mother is Somebody’s heir. Is that correct?
If so, it is going to depend on how the account was set up. If no secondary beneficiary was named (“If Somebody predeceases me, then Other Person gets the money”), then the account might go to the primary beneficiary’s estate or it might go to Grandfather’s estate. It is more common that the money goes to the estate of the account holder, rather than the estate of the beneficiary.
The unclaimed money was a life insurance policy that was transferred to my grandfather from his significant other after death. My grandfather passed away which would in turn transfer to his heir which is my mother according to Nevada statutes.
From my understanding what the state of Nevada needs is a court order instructing them to release unclaimed funds to my mother(heir of beneficiary.).
So is going to court in Florida for probate out of the question? Or would we retain the services of an attorney in Florida? I'm trying to find out if we need to go to Nevada to move this along.
