(a) Your daughter was mopping the bathroom, hit (and broke) the water supply at the back of the toilet, there was a leak, and water leaked into the downstairs apartment. Maintenance fixed the leak, but didn't check the downstairs apartment.
(b) Maintenance thought they fixed the leak, but there was a continuing leak after they fixed it, and (as a result of that continuing leak), the apartment downstairs was flooded.
(c) Maintenance knew that the problem wasn't fixed, but they did some sort of temporary fix to stop the leak, told you not to use the bathroom, and that temporary fix failed, even though you weren't using the bathroom.
If the leak was so bad that it caused the hallway carpets to get wet then I understand it leaking to the unit below you. If your daughter damaged something that caused the leak then you or your daughter (depending on her age) would be responsible for cost to the unit below you. Here is most likely what will happen.
This would be option a or b. We were told the repair was completed and we refrained from using the bathroom due to the wet carpeting in the hall surrounding the bathroom because maintenace was due back the next day to replace the wet carpeting.
One could make the argument that the Maintenance personnel responding to the accidental damage failed to appropriately mitigate further damage by leaving a wet carpet to lie on a second story bathroom floor overnight. Where did they think the water would go? I can see partial blame on the tenants part but it sounds as though they acted in good faith and it wasn't their responsibility to ensure a satisfactory repair had been made, nor did they turn the water back on. This sounds like a mess of an insurance claim and OP should definitely seek out a lawyer if sued.
A. Downstairs neighbors alerts their renters insurance of the damage. Their renters insurance will cover any damage they incurred most likely but will also highly likely sue you to recover some cost.
