I'm not intentionally being over-argumentative, by the way. I've been through this thought process to my wits end so I'm just repeating the arguments I had with myself that led me to the conclusion that i can't suggest to my friend that he files the mechanics lien against the property owner. i'm hoping you or someone else can clarify things.
File a lien on the house where he did the work. It absolutely can be used by a sub or even a material supplier. The idea is that the property owner needs to make sure that the GC pays his subs.
I did actually get the idea from the summaries of the law that this was part of the intent of the law but Isn't it kinda a dick move, though? I mean what if the owner has paid their bills up to date on time every time, and then here comes a sub contractor putting the ownership of their property in jeopardy even though they did everything right?
I understand how that it's legally correct but it seems morally and logically wrong to put that burden on the property owner when it's the contractor who is 100% responsible for any wrong doing in this case. After all, it's not the property owners business or responsibility to make sure of anything other than that they pay their contractor, right?
