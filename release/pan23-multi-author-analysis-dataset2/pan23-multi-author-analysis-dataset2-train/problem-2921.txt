I really don't think you know what communism is man. Also Putin hates Lenin. Also Putin's main source of inspiration for his takes, Ivan Ilyin, is a fascist philosopher that supports social darwinism which is pretty much the exact opposite of communism. Under Putin, socioeconomic disparities have continuously increased while socialism advocates for equal distribution of wealth to the people. Putin likes the USSR only because it was a superpower, not because of its system. He's more nostalgic about the old Russian Empire. To summarize, you should probably re-edit your first comment and replace "communist" with "fascist". Have a good one.
Even from the headline, I would have thought of a Salisbury approach. The Russian government is hardly going to order assassinations of the Russian government. They'd just so a coup, if inclined tbh.
There is a slight problem to that possibility: The affected western power will elect a new leader with an added anti-Russian zeal. This would also just unite the West against Russia even more. Stupid, but a desperate measure.
