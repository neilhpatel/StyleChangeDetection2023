Back in January when everyone was saying this wasn't going to go hot, I moved two thirds of my meager savings into Lockheed and Raytheon. Nothing absurd in terms of gains, but it's been very healthy.
I believe that is SDBII which has a tri mode seeker. Normal SDB's are GPS or perhaps laser guided and I think those are the ones they might give to Ukraine. Basically just replaces the HIMARS warhead with a glide bomb for extra range.
They want long range weapon systems, Wich means advanced air defense (such as the Patriot which they are receiving) and long range missile system (such as Glsdb which they will be receiving and Atacms which they have been denied so far).
All of those weapons are not new by any means, but we have seen how himars have turned the tide and thata a weapon system that is a dozen years old and is already well on its way to being replaced in just a few short years.
The Ukrainians wanted Reaper drones, which the US Navy is willing to give since they have older models which no longer posed a threat while the Pentagon is hesitant because they don't want any advancement by Russia, China, Iran or North Korea gained from recovered tech, even if it is older tech. Having Reapers mean Russia's ground troops' fixed positions would be sitting ducks. Damn thing could stay in the air for a while day, at night in pitch darkness and see and shoot missiles at everything. It'd be endless Hellfires to trenches and foxholes.
