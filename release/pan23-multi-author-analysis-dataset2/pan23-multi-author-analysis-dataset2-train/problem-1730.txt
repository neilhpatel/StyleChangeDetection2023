Edit - Yes, fully aware that CA has a statewide mandate. Also, as being a resident of CA, there are 'strongholds' of intense Trump/Trumpism in certain counties/locations. Since the enforcement of the mandate falls on the local sheriff/police the OP may/may not get much relief. There were locations during the full lockdown that completely disregarded orders to shut down and for the most part suffered little if any consequence.
California currently requires face coverings indoors in public in most situations so most likely the business is in wrong here. In many other states or during non covid times the business would be completely within their rights to do what they did.
So for those that feel that somehow the CA mandate will solve the OP's problem...it's not that simple. Voting with $$ may make a bigger impact.
Right, which is why they can be reported to the local health department. It doesn’t change the fact that they own the property and have a right to tell someone to leave. California also has a statewide law banning trespassing.
The reality is that unless you live somewhere that the local authorities are zealous about enforcing mask mandates, nothing is likely to happen to the business.
Me personally, I would have left immediately without removing my mask or making a purchase and then looked up the appropriate local authorities to report the business to.
Unless your local police department is run by anti maskers that are willing to break the law to make a point, the business can't do much to prevent you from wearing a mask. They could refuse to serve you, but they can't refuse to give you something you already paid for.
Your link says “guidance,” and does not seem to say “binding law that all private businesses must legally follow under pain of legal-type penalty.”.
