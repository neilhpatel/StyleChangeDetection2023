I'd be careful because the way you make it sound, the police and judge are all buddy buddy with your parents, and they've already threatened you not so subtly with harassment charges, and involuntary admittance to a hospital under the guise of a mental health crisis. It wouldn't be a stretch for your parents to get the cops and judge to sign off on a restraining order and then you really won't be allowed back at the house, and even if you found a place it could be weeks until a judge let's you go get your belongings. They are 100% in the wrong legally, but as someone else who knows how small towns work, escalating this might only lead to them escalating it as well, and while you seem hesitant to pursue your options, they don't so if you're gonna come at them, you better commit to it, because I doubt they're gonna roll over.
If the police won't help you, either contact a tenancy attorney in your area to bring a civil action or escalate up the chain to your political representative (mayor, councilperson).
