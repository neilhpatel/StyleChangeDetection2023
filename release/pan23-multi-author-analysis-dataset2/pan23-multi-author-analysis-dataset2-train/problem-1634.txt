All you need to (and should) do is tell your insurance company of the suit. They'll take it from there, and it's exactly what you pay them for. You'll be assigned a lawyer that represents you, but is paid-for by the insurance company. (The only condition of this representation is that you allow any settlement offer the insurance company is willing to make at/under the policy max.).
More than three years is not unusual if that's within your state's SOL, what state? Don't get info from the PD, or insurance, you give insurance the lawsuit and they handle it all for you.
Don't read the suit, don't bother with getting your own copy of the report, and whatever you do, do not talk to the plaintiff or their lawyer.
Just let your insurance handle it. They do this a zillion times a year. You pay them so much so that you don't have to worry, or do anything really. Good luck!
