I’m making an assumption that you are under 18 based on your comments. kryptokatmagick hit the nail on the head, my real question is do you fear for your life? If so you need to go to the authorities. This is from experience. Using a weapon in a fight is incredibly dangerous and severely escalates the situation. Nothing anyone would steal from you is worth it. Unless you have very specific training and are ready to use lethal force you are giving your attacker a weapon.
That bring said if your dead set on a self defense item look into items like mace or pepper spray and check all of your local statutes for where you live. While the state laws are the baseline, your county and town may have more restrictions as well as specific businesses may place restrictions on what they allow you to carry.
And yes a business has a right to deny you service if you bring in a weapon, even open carrying, and no it’s not a violation of your rights.
As long as you have a good handle on what is legal and what isn’t you should be fine, and if your dead set on something for protection best advise I can give:
But overall thank you for your help i will try continue researching the specifics as some things seem fine. Just a problem of conflicting things being said lol.
2. No i dont fear for my life i just want an item that i could use to defend myself if the situation called for it.
Honestly best place to start would be to check your city police website or non emergency line. They may be able to direct you to the relevant information for your area on what’s legal.
