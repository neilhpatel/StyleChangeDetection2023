Typically, (especially in most modern subdivisions over the past few decades), the road is legally designated as a "Public Right-Of-Way" or "ROW".
The ROW is not owned by you, your neighbor, the neighborhood, or any other individual. It is owned by the government, typically falling under the jurisdiction of a county or city. (Edit: this is imprecise, and I apologize. Technically the ROW may be considered an easement, not actually your property. But, in effect and actual process, you don't really control the property anymore. Sorry for my lack of accuracy.).
As the name suggests, a Public ROW is for the public. Anybody (with rare exceptions) can enter the ROW, park in the ROW, drive in the ROW, etc. Unless there is some restriction, (like "No Parking" signs, or some covenant/HOA rule/regulation), anybody can park there.
In other words, if it's legal to park there, then you can park there. And typically, it's legal to park along a street in a residential area.
...So long as you don't block traffic. So make sure that cars can still turn around and stuff. Also, you could call your local city/county to confirm their parking laws in residential areas.
OP you should be absolutely certain you're allowed to run your business on your residential Street. If your neighbour wanted to make trouble for you with zoning they might be able to. So you may win the street parking battle but lose the business in a residential area War unless you have your ducks in a row.
In my town, only 2 conditions prevent a parked car on neighborhood streets. If it is unregistered it cannot park on the street. Period. If it is registered, it can park on the street for two weeks before it must be moved by at least one car lenh.
Your town may have similar or even more lenient laws. Knowing your rights will make most of the stress disappear.
