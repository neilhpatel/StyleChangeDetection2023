Generally pet fees can be looked at as rent you pay to have your pet live there. Just like with the human beings living there any damages caused by your pets beyond normal wear can be considered damages that you will have to pay for.
To cover increased wear and tear to the unit and to pursue the ability to have the pet in the unit.
"To cover increased wear and tear to the unit" Right... which they're not doing. We also paid monthly pet rent.
Every single thing I find on Google tells me it's normal to use these up-front fees for this. I think they might have even called it a deposit at some point, but my messaging account was wiped when we moved out.
It doesn't matter what they called it, your lease sounds very clear that this is a non-refundable fee.
Honestly I think so, because they claim in the itemized list that certain things were "damaged" that absolutely weren't.
I'm trying to, it's just difficult without solid proof. I have pictures of what the place looked like when we left but not like, in-depth videos of everything working exactly as it should. I wanted to ask about the pet fees because that's sort of the opposite situation, where I have proof but wasn't sure if it was shady in the first place. Thank you for the advice.
Sort of. It would have been nice if they'd given me a copy of the lease when I first asked, so I could have had time to read the damn thing before it came down to "sign or die." But legally I realize they're in the clear on that.
I would be less incensed about this if they'd done one thing OR the other. Charged us three times OR put none of it towards replacing the carpet. On top of a bunch of smaller things about living there that just make me ask "What the hell were we paying for?" in general.
