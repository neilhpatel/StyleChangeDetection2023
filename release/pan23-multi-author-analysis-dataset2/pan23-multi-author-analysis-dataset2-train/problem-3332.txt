A famous part of West Virginia history. Yes, they were detained, along with the German and Italian embassy staff. The Japanese were initially sent to the Homestead resort in Hot Springs, Virginia. But when the Homestead wanted to open for its regular season, the Japanese were moved to the replacing the Italians, who had gotten along badly with the Germans and had been shipped to Asheville. The Japanese and the Germans also got along badly, it seems, but all were treated well - much better than the local residents would have liked- and of course kept under supervision by federal agents from the State Dept.
After six months of negotiations, in the summer of 1942, the staff of the Japanese embassy were shipped off to Mozambique, where they were traded for Americans who'd been stranded in Japan.
The Greenbriar ten years later would be fitted with a \- a very big one- to hold Congress in case of nuclear attack.
Since these were resorts, what did the diplomats do during their stay there? Were they confined to quarters are could they use the facilities? Were they still afforded certain courtesies as diplomats? And were their respective governments ever billed for their stays there?
The Greenbriar of course was paid by the Federal government. Whether there was an attempt after the War to get reimbursed by the Japanese, German or Italian governments I don't know, but obviously the reason to treat the embassy staffs with courtesy was to get equivalent treatment for US nationals stranded in Italy, Japan and Germany . That didn't happen- but the Greenbriar hotel bills were pretty small compared to the other costs of the War, and getting them reimbursed after the War, with Europe and Japan hugely damaged, was obviously not going to be easy.
