You are bound by the terms of the contract you signed. If it was for one year, you will owe them one year of rent. Where are you located, that might give you a few other options. And the first contract you signed, when does it expire, in late 2022? Or was it month to month?
I am in Charlotte so it's a "hot"rental market. But another complex I moved into didn't give me this same issue. I think it was for a year so it expires fall of 2022. They said I would need a 60 notice to get out of the contract.
NC does have a duty to mitigate but you'd owe the deposit, and the rent so far, and the rent until they can rent it out again. And they can sue you, and/or send it to collections.
They just mentioned sending it to collections. As for rent I am not sure what I would owe. I know for sure they would not have an issue finding another renter since places here rent out really fast. That particular place was in downtown Charlotte.
I did say I had a family emergency so I don't know if this will work. The lease actually hasn't started and was due to start around Dec 28. I had to look up the lease.
You will need to ask them. Or wait for it to go to collections. When did the lease start, and when did you tell them? You might only owe about two months if they find another tenant quickly. However, they do not have to re-rent your unit FIRST. They can rent other empty units first.
If the lease does not start until Dec 28, what options I have? The unit is also in a competitive market so I don't think they would have much trouble finding someone. Also I didn't need to put down any deposit.
The market doesnt matter. The fact that you signed a contract does. You will need to contact the complex you signed a lease with and determine what they want to let you out of the lease.
Again the market being hot and them being able to find more renters has absolutely zero bearing on you signing a lease. You signed a contract and are now legally bound to those terms.
Depends on the language in the contract. If thereâ€™s no exit clause, then you theoretically could technically be held to the full lease (depending on the laws of your state).
Talk to your property manager, we often come to an agreement where the property is put back on the market, once a new lessor is found the first is released. But the first pays the rent until the second is found.
