Im having a hard time believing they have this sale charge against me. Yes i have sold, but everyone i sold to, i watched them do every last bit in front of me and they are friends who i hang out with and they sleep over at my house and all kinds of things like that.
If they’re not bluffing, there’s potential upside if you do, compared to all downside if you don’t. As to the bluff question, this is where you need to make that adult decision. There may be little harm in calling their bluff, as they (if they’re not bluffing) may still offer you a deal.
The only person who was sketchy was the fake cocaine person. But the detectives arent talking about that charge.
What’s the point? You’re an adult and you made adult decisions. You need to make some more adult decisions, or else they will be made for you. Only you can decide if they are bluffing or if cooperating is worth potentially mitigating a charge or conviction.
I really, really would not recommend cooperating Yes they can lie to you, yes you should not trust anything at all they tell you. Cops do not determine what you are charged with, and they do not determine what your sentence is. The cops at my college pulled this bullshit and turned some 20 year old into an informant, and the kid oded and died a little bit later, was a huge shit storm.
