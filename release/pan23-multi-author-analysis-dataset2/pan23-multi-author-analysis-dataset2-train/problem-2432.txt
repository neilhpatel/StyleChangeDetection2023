He was no friend of Brazil. Wannabe dictators killing their countries like Putin, Erdogan, Orban, Xi, that asshole in North Korea, the whole lot of them.
The Us has a very long history of harboring dictators, failed coup leaders and flat out criminal leaders of countries..Say for example Ferdinand Marcos and more recently Donald Trump. I see no reason why the US wont take Bolsonaro. Heck trump may even try to make Bolsonaro his 'Vice President' when he attempts another coup in a couple years.
Does the US and Brazil have an extradition treaty? Ii do not think that he ingratiated himself with the US during his time. Refusing a visa is an easy first step for Biden. I doubt that Bolsonaro will be able to demonstrate that he is a genuine refugee.
that isn't how it works with countries leaders. Visa rules are for the poor and unpowerful. That isn't even going the back channel and just straight up bribing one of the endless corrupt officials in government. ps, not sure the US has to extradite the guy, since I dont believe he has been charged with crimes yet? if the Brazil system is as slow and corrupt as the US he may never be charged..What has trump been charged with, two plus years after the fact and endless evidence available..
Yes, but he is no friend of the USA or the planet. We will have to wait and see where he ends up. Trump would have welcomed him with open arms and this works against him now.
