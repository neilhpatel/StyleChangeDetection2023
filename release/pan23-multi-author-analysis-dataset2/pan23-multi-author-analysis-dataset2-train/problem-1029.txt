What do your HOA documents say? There are usually specific rules around what are considered to be "common elements" and additionally language regarding repairs that are affecting a certain number of units. This will decide if its your issue or an HOA issue.
Well they are paying for the plumbing issue but I’m more concerned about the lack of emergency from the HOA. If this would of been handled in a timely manner we would occur less overall damage to our property. I’m sitting at home alone right now listening out for the sink to make sure I catch it before it overflows and this has been going on since Friday. The plumber were only here working for 3-4 hours overall and left at 3pm because it was getting late.
Hmm, from my understanding it has to do with how far out the plumbing is from our unit. I’m not exactly sure of the distance but in our case the clog is in a communal vertical pipe so it considered the responsibility of the HOA. Even though it only effects our unit it is being caused by the units above us. We’re not even running any water but we’re still getting the overflow from when the units above us run their dishwasher or faucet. I’ve seen all sorts of water green water, bleach water and just nasty black oily sewage water. Can’t be healthy for me. I mean how unfair would that be that all these units are responsible for causing the clog (including mine to a point) but because it’s only affecting my unit then I should be responsible? I mean these are 40+ year old cast iron pipes. The HOA should of replaced those a long time ago.
I guess what I'm asking is who owned the responsibility? I've lived in condos my entire adult life. I've had some plumbing issues that only impacted my unit. I was responsible to coordinate services. Ive had some that impacted only 2-3 units and we coordinated those services together. Ive had some that impacted enough units to be considered an HOA issue and they coordinated those services on our behalf.
