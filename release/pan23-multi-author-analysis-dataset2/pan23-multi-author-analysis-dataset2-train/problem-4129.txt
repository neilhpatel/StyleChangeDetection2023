I would even argue that this entire strategy is a sign that there is a lack of precision weapons or at least the capability to effectively use them. Simply put, these strikes are a waste. They do not advance Russia's war goals. Knocking out electrical grids for hours or days isn't going to massively hamper Ukraine's ability to fight this war, it isn't going to impact their ability to supply their troops either. So why do it? Why not use these weapons to bomb strategic targets like ammo dumps, hangars, or unit headquarters, or hell even just tactical targets of opportunity. The two most likely explanations are either they don't have enough weapons to actually make an impact with this strategy or they lack the intelligence capabilities to target anything that isn't nailed down. Now Russia isn't blind, they have satellites. So you'd think they'd occasionally get lucky, spot something worth blowing up and launch a stroke. But as far as I can tell, they don't.
Now, give them a brake. They need fixed targets that don't run around. And they need large rockets since the guidance systems is out of scope +/- 1 km accuracy give or take.
