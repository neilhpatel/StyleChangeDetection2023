I think she should start by gathering all documents she can showing that (a) she's his sister, (b) she goes by Peggy, (c) he referred her as Peggy in other settings/documents/letters, and (d) there were no other Peggy Smiths in his life.
Peggy is a common nickname for Margaret. She should escalate this at the bank and try to talk to a manager or someone authorized to use common sense. If she has only talked to tellers, they may have no authority to give money to anyone whose name isn't exactly as listed.
If this doesn't work, and the bank won't budge, then his estate will have to be probated and then she inherits the money if he has no other/closer heirs.
If they don't agree to pay her the money, then she needs to (or an attorney she would hire, needs to) open up probate for his estate at the Surrogate Court. The administrator of the estate can claim these funds and put them in an estate account. Any outstanding debts will be deducted, and the administrator's fee will be deducted and she will receive the remaining monies.
Normally, the bank would ask her to have the administrator show the bank a certified copy of the letters testamentary (the document that was issued to the administrator when probate is first opened) and then release the funds to the administrator for distribution.
I think Peggy's problem is she didn't escalate the problem to the bank's management or legal department to determine what proof they need to clear up the first name discrepancy.
I searched and found Peggy's father's obituary published in the NY Times, referring to her as "Peggy" and the names of the rest of the family. This and some of the birth certificates may be enough for at least some of the banks.
Probate isn't an option and the issue where she needs help is trying to resolve is the first name mismatch issue.
