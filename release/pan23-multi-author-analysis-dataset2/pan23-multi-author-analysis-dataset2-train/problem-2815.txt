You know Coffezilla really did do a good job. I was surprised and nobody was asking hard hitting questions until after Coffezilla had this SBF spilling the beans. But every interview seems to be very sympathetic to a guy that has stole a lost billions of dollars. Crazy times I guess he is just a kid that colluded with government to crash crypto and centralize the decentralized monitory movement.
Gonna go out on a limb and predict none of them give a shit if he goes to prison. Taking contributions from some crypto bro with too much cash is one thing, no one's gonna commit political suicide for him.
He is going to have a hard time making money back from prison. The only reason why he's not in prison is that the investigation just started two weeks ago.
Or maybe there will actually be some integrity to the system, but I won't be surprised if these guys are free for years to come.
They'll just mention something to a different department at a cocktail party, who will mention something to somebody else, and eventually there will be enough of a thumb on the scales of justice that they skate on technicalities.
