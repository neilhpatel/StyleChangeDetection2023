Well with all these down votes I'm sorry. But this is a guy who waited four months to pay a weekly employee. I came in to help him. I quit. Now I'm being threatened. That's the gyst.
Screen shot and email anything you're worried about loosing to yourself. In general, no, you shouldn't loose the messages when blocking a number.
He said I was harassing him when I was just telling him to leave me alone. After I repeatedly explained he said I was harassing him. But I don't want to get attacked. I made sure it was all in text so I think I'm good. I only kept explaining because he kept attacking me or saying he would talk to my new employers about me.
Is my sending a screenshot of one of his threats to one of his bosses going to screw me? He laughed it off. I was not harassing him I was literally telling him to leave me alone.
Id be very careful about that. You CAN report him to HR or upper managment. Unless he threatened violence, blackmail, extortion, or otherwise some other illegal activity I'd be cautious.
