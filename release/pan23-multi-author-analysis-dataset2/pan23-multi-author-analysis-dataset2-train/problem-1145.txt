This is one of those weird parts of the law that hasn’t been fully developed yet. The driving force would be electric. It dosn’t specify that it must be battery powered but it’s probable a judge would go by intent rather then plain meaning. Cant find legal examples of this either which sucks.
Not legal but practical. Would you consider a Tesla an electric vehicle if it had a 350 Chevy small block running on gas powering the electric motor instead of its battery?
Realistically once you put the gas engine on that bike it stops being an Ebike and starts being a moped and in most places would probably fall under the same rules as a motorcycle.
“Defines a low-speed electric bicycle as a 2 or 3-wheeled device with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts (one horsepower), whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20 miles per hour. Excludes low-speed electric bicycles from the definition of "motor vehicle"”.
Being powered by an electric motor constitutes an electric bike. There is nothing about how the motor must be powered. Hybrid cars are still considered electric even though the motors are gasoline powered.
