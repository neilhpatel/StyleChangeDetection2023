That doesn’t mean burning a Quran in protest of Turkey is not a political act in of itself. Erdoğan can’t not respond to such an act given his stance, which will be politically detrimental to him in the eyes of his voters.
It still is, despite Erdoğan’s rhetoric note how Turkey shifted to authoritarianism, not sharia, in the past 20 years.
Officers eat segregated too, they have generally better cooks and weird rules about how to eat and sit.
E7-E9 have their own segregated area that only they can eat at. Staffed by E4 and below like waiters, generally have top tier food and cooks.
For the U.S. Army. A Mess Hall would be enlisted and officers' meal service. Then there would be an Officers Club and an Enlisted Club for relaxing and drinking. I think the Navy may segregate the food service.
P.S. I am from Turkey where I can openly declare my atheism and women can freely walk around without veils, where all legally recognized marriages are still only civil marriages, where it is still illegal for religion to be a basis for discrimination, where abortion is not illegal, where sharia has no effect at all, let alone over the civil code. Consider that Erdoğan had 20 YEARS to change this, but didn’t or couldn’t. Consider for a moment there is more to the story than what you’re privy to.
