It's similar with something like auto mechanics. Yeah, sure there are hundreds of brands of automobiles but the vast majority are internal combustion engines and 99% of them are 4,6 or 8 cylinder models that are more or less similar. They have pistons, cylinders, valves, cranks, blocks, water or air cooling an intake and an exhaust system. This shit is quite generic and people can actually work on their own cars but they simply don't want to mess with it so they let someone else do it. That's not because they can't do it, it's because they don't want to bother with it.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
