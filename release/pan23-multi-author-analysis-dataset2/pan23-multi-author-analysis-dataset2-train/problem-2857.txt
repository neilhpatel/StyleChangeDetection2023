"We had intended to review the documents in closed door meetings. However, stonewalling by the former president has ensured we are unable to thoroughly review the documents before the MAGA republicans take control of the house. Accountability is far too important, and character of the new leadership far too lacking to leave it to chance that Trump's sycophants in the new leadership won't find a way to hide the documents and prevent accountability. Therefore, we are taking the extraordinary step of releasing all the documents publicly effective immediately.".
