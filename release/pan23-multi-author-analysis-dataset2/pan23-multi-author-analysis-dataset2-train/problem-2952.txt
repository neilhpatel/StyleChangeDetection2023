OMG dude, this inspires many parallels between Putin and Palpatine. In the end, Palpatine dies in a nuclear reactor core. I hope life does not go on to imitate art. Also, wonder who Vader would be.

Defenestration must have been quite common in the USSR, which probably led to the window scene written by Lucas' writers.
putin's puny arms and small baby hands only have the strenh to slightly push someone towards a window.
he thinks once they are close to a window they automatically throw themselves through it. because russian windows are dooors that have death on the other side.
