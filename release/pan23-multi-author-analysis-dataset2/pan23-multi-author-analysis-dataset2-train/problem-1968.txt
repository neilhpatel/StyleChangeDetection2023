The practical advice is that if this is the only barrier between you and seeing a doctor, sign it and go to a doctor. Normally, signing nonsense is a bad idea, but in this case, your mother's obligations aren't affected by anything you do or sign, so there's little legal risk to you. Talk to your doctor about your mother's irrational behaviour and about the note she asked for. If you are being neglected, then your doctor, as a mandated reporter, will be well-positioned to help you.
Unfortunately, I would guess that your mother is probably not going to suddenly turn reasonable just because you signed this.
I will do the note as she's asked me to, and take pictures of it as I would assume she wouldn't return it to me. The advice is valid, and if I truly am safe legally than I will do it if it gets me to a doctor; especially if I can then ask the doctor for further assistance. Luckily, I am not having a medical emergency but I am far from good health.
If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911. If you have internet access, then you can also get a VoIP number via services like Skype or Google Voice, and can call an urgent care centre or a doctor's office if you're having medical issues that are not an emergency. You can likely find a nearby hospital or doctor's office on Google, as well. You don't need your mother's permission to ask for help.
I did want to ask, though, wouldn't I need my mothers permission to get myself a doctors appointment?
Edit: I asked the above question because I do agree, chances are just because I do what she's asked of me doesn't mean she will keep her word. I need options if it comes down to her not upholding her responsibilities.
