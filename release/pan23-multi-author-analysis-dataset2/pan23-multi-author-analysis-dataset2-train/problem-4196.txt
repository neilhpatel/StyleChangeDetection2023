This is stretching a little past my knowledge, but I'll try. Hopefully someone better versed in this area will be along soon.
I'd also reach out to a lawyer specializing in real estate or construction issues. If the house wasn't built properly, the cost to repair or mitigate may be substantial -- in terms of both time and money. In that case, you want someone who is going to fight the myriad of tiny little battles on your behalf. You will exhaust yourself going it on your own.
I would consult with a construction defect lawyer. What you are describing sounds unusual and like the project was not completed to industry standards. Eventually you will need expert witnesses to testify if it gets that far.
In the meantime, hiring a civil engineer on your own is a good idea to at least get the situation under control. I would also notify your homeowners, they may be helpful in your fight against the builder as well.
Notify your homeowner's insurance about the issue. This seems like an excessive amount of water, and may indicate defective construction. Most of the time insurance isn't interested until a loss has occurred but your specific situation may indicate an imminent loss.
Personally, I had an issue where my main sump pump failed (due to user error), causing the secondary pump to kick in. The secondary pump kicks in about 8-12" above the primary pump. Once I got the main pump working again it took about 2 days to finally get the water back to the normal level.
I'd echo the point about getting a civil engineer to look at your property to make sure everything is working properly.
This is good advice, OP. You have a duty to mitigate any loss to a reasonable extent, and having a professional (who is not affiliated with the builder, your mortgage company, the seller, or anyone else) look over the construction is an excellent first step.
