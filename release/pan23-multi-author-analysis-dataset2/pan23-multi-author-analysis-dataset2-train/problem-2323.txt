But at the end of the day if I were a devout Buddhist I'd still understand that a swastika isn't really appropriate in the workplace, despite my relation to it.
Your fiance's specific outward appearance of those beliefs extremely closely resembles the practice of Neo Nazis who appropriate Norse symbolism.
--OP's partner wears a necklace that is strongly associated (and possibly primarily associated at this point, unfortunately) with white supremacists.
--OP's partner's Jewish co-worker felt targeted, complained to HR, and the company is acting accordingly.
However, neither the employer nor the co-worker are being unreasonable here. These symbols are also strongly connected to white supremacy, and a person publicly using multiple symbols now connected to white supremacy may just be a white supremacist. It seems they let it slide when it was just one (the necklace), but they feel the runes establish a greater pattern. Even as a pagan myself, I see their side and rather agree, if only because drawing runes on company property is inappropriate and drawing/displaying runes that have any connections or ties to white supremacy should not be allowed in the workplace as it does arguably create a hostile work environment regardless of professed intent.
