edit: what this really does, which would have been obvious if I'd thought for more than three seconds before posting this comment, is to get the spectators out of earshot. You can maybe film something on your phone from 30' away, although it makes details pretty much impossible to make out, (unless you've got a much better phone than mine!) but from that far, it's a lot tougher to get any decent audio. Anything to protect the cops from the consequences of their actions. Add a "malfunctioning" body cam, and gosh, sorry, "qualified immunity.".
This is about getting people to stop filming cops. If you are filming a cop, they'll move towards you, say to get away, then they can arrest you for approaching a cop.
