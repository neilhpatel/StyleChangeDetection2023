I would like to ask serendipity about "qdesha" v "qdeshtu" because it would seem to infer ritual prostitution, as the commercial prostitution has the more widely used term, also found in the the Hebrew Bible, "zona," whereas the lesser used "qdesha" shares the Hebrew root "qdsh" meaning "consecrated", implying ritual.
Anyways, the other place"qdesha" appears in the Bible is in context of "one may not donate (to temple) the amount of a dog or harlot (qdesha) implying that such may have been a locally practiced thing (that was forbidden to the Israelites) and familiar to them.
The post asserts that Herodotus used this subject intentionally as a literary device to demonstrate "otherness" of Mesopotamian culture. I've seen other historians claim that since Herodotus was writing pre-Alexander and pre-Hellenization of the middle East, his errors could have been caused by a lack of good translators - that he simply didn't understand the cultures he was visiting because no one could give detailed explanations in his language. Could something like this be going on as well?
