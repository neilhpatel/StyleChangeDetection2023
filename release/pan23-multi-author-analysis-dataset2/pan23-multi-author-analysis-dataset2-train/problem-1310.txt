It has nothing to do with religion, it is about old nut case wanting to exert his dominance. There are pictures of his grand daughters and nieces(or grand-nieces) with short skirts and no hijabs. Same with many middle-east royal families. Look at Dubai's Queen for example. The royal families of each kingdom is huge, they have different rules compared to the average women in their country. Lot of them live in LA, UK, Toronto and etc. They go to clubs like any other chicks.
The hashtags mean something. Posting on your Instagram stories mean something. Time and time again, the call from Iran is the same, “Be Our Voice”.
Really sad how dictators use religion to oppress their people. He is sentencing regular folk to death. Folk who are tired of working 3 jobs, just to not make enough to live a decent life.
The really sad part is that the culture isn’t responsible. It’s quite literally Islam, with a touch of us cia and oil interests.
I suggest reading about operation Ajax, and the eventual Islamic revolution it caused. There are photos that get posted to Reddit every now and then of Iranian beaches in the 60’s with women in bikinis.
1) Spread information about what is happening in Iran on social media. This is the one social movement where social media is activism. It saves lives and is one of the only tools everyday people can use to have a true and significant impact. Use the appropriate hashtags- iranrevolution, stopexecutionsiniran, mahsaamini, womelifefreedom.
