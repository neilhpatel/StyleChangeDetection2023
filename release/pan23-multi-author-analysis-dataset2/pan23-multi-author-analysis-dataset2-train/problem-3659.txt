I am talking about the average voter. You and I are talking about this on a politics online forum. You and I are not who I am talking about. We are very engaged in politics. The average voter does not. If you go into a factory, talk to an operator. If you go into and office building, talk to the receptionist. If you go into a grocery store, talk to a random person The average voter only cares about those empty promises. They want lower gas prices, lower taxes, higher wages, and lower inflation. They listen to whoever is selling the prettiest fairy tale.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
