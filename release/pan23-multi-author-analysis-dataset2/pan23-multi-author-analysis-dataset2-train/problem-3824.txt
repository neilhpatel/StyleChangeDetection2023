The Ukrainians have had soldiers training with NATO. Within a few weekend the leopard tanks will arrive . The Abrams will take a month or so for the first batch.
This was the last offensive which was successful. Now drop in one modern tank per infantry company.
This guy is talking logistics but fails to mention the superiority of Ukrainian and NATO logistics. Ukraine has experienced tank crews that can train for two weeks o the Abrams and be GTG.
The Ukrainians have been running and gunning and bum rushing the lines when they went on the offensive prior. They use the few tanks they have bolster and institute proper combined arms tactics.
The front is thousands of kilometers long. One tank per 10-20 kms of front isn't going to be a game changer.
HIMARS even in small numbers was an absolute game changer so I donâ€™t know what you people are talking about.
That would be dumb. If the Ukrainians are smart, they'll combine the tanks with the IFVs and artillery support and create mobile strike groups out of them, use them in Thunder Runs to break through fortified positions and then clear them with the regular military that they have.
