Wow. There are already a LOT of unhelpful/anecdotal/off-topic comments, and a few objectively bad suggestions. Please keep in mind this is not a general discussion subreddit, and all responses must be providing OP useful information that applies to their circumstances and jurisdiction. Make sure to read .
If you have neighbors on either side of you, ask them if they are having noise problems with this unit as well. If there are units above or on either side of the problem, approach them about having noise problems. The more people with complaints, the better chance to get action taken. Good luck.
You could also work with your landlord to break the lease and move. I have noisy upstairs neighbors as well and have talked to them multiple times to no avail. It drives me insane. I will be moving when my lease ends. The house I'm in has basically no noise isolation between the floors and even from outside. Very annoying.
We are very aggressive about banning users who ignore sub rules, so please be sure to keep this in mind before responding as we will not give further warnings.
