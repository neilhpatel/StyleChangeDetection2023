And you boomers destroyed it and the nation with your shortsighted greed. You were termed the "Me" generation in the 80s, and you and your ilk have tripled down. Even your post just screams "PAY ATTENTION TO MEEEEEE!" You shamelessly shit on your parents' generational legacy, and continue to shit on your children's and grandchildren's future, just because you can't let go of the narcissistic belief that your generation is the end-all and be-all of existence. So why don't you siddown, shut up, and let everyone else clean up the fucking mess you left.
