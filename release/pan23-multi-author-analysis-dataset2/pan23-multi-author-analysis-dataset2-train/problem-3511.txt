I’d avoid filing this through your insurance as it can create a claim and potentially increase your rates. Try contacting the Sheriff’s office and talking to them about it. If they play hardball go to your county representatives and keep moving up the ladder until they drop this ridiculousness.
If that’s the case you should go ahead and call your insurance and demand that no claim be filed as there was no collision or damage. If your rates increase I’d shop around for a different insurance company. Cause that’s bullshit. To put it bluntly.
Normally I'd agree with you in that a political approach to the situation would work. But I've been astonished by how pro-police Florida politician are. I will take your advice and try the political route but I'm not very optimistic that it will work.
In their letter that they sent with the bill, they indicated that they have already informed my insurance. So I think I'm already screwed on my insurance rates.
If it were me I'd let my insurance handle it and send them that bill. They'll probably tell the sheriff's office to pound sand since there is 0 evidence of an accident or a reason to send that bill to you.
You don't say where you are but the Sheriff is usually a county office. I would contact whoever is in charge of the county that manages the Sheriff. Usually it is some sort of elected official. Explain the situation to them or their staff, they can probably make this go away.
Sorry, I thought that was implied. She did not hit any vehicles. There's absolutely no marks on her car to indicate that she hit anything. She says she did not hit anything. I trust my wife's word more than a random deputy.
