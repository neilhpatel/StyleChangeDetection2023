It may very well be. But... It is specifically targeting uneducated and desperate people. -arguably a very vulnerable portion of society and I find it particularly...gross. I likely won’t pursue it other than to ask the question/understand how things work here, but anyone who has gained a degree in one area would certainly limit their job search to that area. Why would an educated person ever click on a job posting with not enough information unless they were desperate? Earn money is implied.
And then it is disguised as an advertisement and played on YouTube...as If the subject matter (dental assistant/job title) was the currency that is being paid such that earning crypto should make sense as a job title. What do you do for work? “Oh, I earn Pesos!...free pesos.”.
You are missing the point. Scamming people is not legal, but like many criminals scammers have taken steps to not get caught, like locating themselves in countries where law enforcement doesn't care for example.
Anyone aware of the legalities surrounding job postings? Especially when disguised as brain wash? Anyhoo, thanks for the feedback.
