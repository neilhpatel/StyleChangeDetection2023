This is a question for your lawyer, but usually the U.S. Attorney's Office doesn't have the time to chase down every person or company that commits perjury, so I wouldn't expect an indictment to come of it.
But just because they don't go after purjury doesn't mean the lying wont negatively impact them. Punishments/Fines generally have a range and this is where judges can have some free reign when they can't prosecute additional charges. Lets say this offense has a fine that can range between $50,000 and $200,000. If the offense was minor, the company was honest and upfront, and show they already corrected the issue then they get hit with the minimum a $50k fine. But if the offense was still minor, but they lie about all the events, and keep attempting to shift blame. A judge may order them to correct the safety issue and issue a more maximum $150k fine for lying and wasting the courts time.
Their response reads like four different managers lied in their statements to the corporate lawyer, but differently enough that the lawyer couldn't cobble them together in any coherent way.
