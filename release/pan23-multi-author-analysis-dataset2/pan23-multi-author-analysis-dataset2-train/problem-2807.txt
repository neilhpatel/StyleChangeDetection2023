The best thing to do may be to call the non emergency police and see if they will send an officer to escort him into your home to collect his things.
What you can do is call the local police department and ask for a civil stand by. That way they can be there while he collects his belongings.
I understand that you are scared of him, but if it has been weeks and you havenâ€™t returned his stuff and have not allowed him to collect it, you are on the wrong side of the law.
He is also legally in the wrong for refusing to leave your property. You can call the police if he continues to remain on your property without your permission.
Edit: If he was also living there less than a month ago, he probably still has rights as a tenant, so that would change this whole situation. He cannot be denied access to a residence he still has rights to as tenant.
