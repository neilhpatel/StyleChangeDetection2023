Wait until you actually get a claim from a court. Having a lawyer, or even claiming to have a lawyer doesn't mean anything. Getting a sternly written threat from a lawyer to take you to court also doesn't mean anything.
If they try to come after your dog that's more of a criminal animal control action than a civil action.
Anybody can sue you for anything of course, but even a trivial defense should show you the winner as well. And I don't think you can sue somebody to have their dog destroyed.
Your first mistake was giving them your contact info. Stop communicating with them immediately and if they go ahead with the lawsuit and you get served then that's when you hire a lawyer. Until then shut up and seize contact with them.
Sounds like someone's just profiteering. Keep anything they send to you of course, but just wait for an actual legal action.
This is horrible advice as to your civil liability. Your dog will most likely not get put down. But, you are strictly liable for any injuries your dog causes. See . Any injuries she can prove, you are on the hook for. There's no "actually, my dog is nice and that was an accident" defense in civil court.
Nothing in the statute requires a bite or physical contact. Regardless, "I didn't see my dog touch her" is extremely different from "the dog did not touch her." The sole question is whether it caused injury. If the court (or jury) believes the dog touched her, "a trivial defense" will not "show [OP] the winner." If the dog startled this elderly woman, causing her to fall into a brick wall, it is similarly not so cut and dry. Further, contact can be made without "claw marks." Courts don't typically "throw out" cases when facts are disputed.
If there was no bite likely not to be declared dangerous. There is a subset of dog related lawsuits called non bite related injuries which can mean startling or chasing or even knocking someone over. IN IL this is based on negligence, such as a dog escaping.
