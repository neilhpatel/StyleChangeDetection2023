Eviction and notice to end tenancy are two separate things. Eviction is a court process to remove someone from an unit for a breach of lease (most commonly not paying rent) or staying in an unit after being told to leave.
Notice to end tenancy means your lease won't be renewed and you need to be out at the end of your lease. You can check if there's any covid specific regulations, and Seattle has more restrictive laws so if you live there you might have some protection but generally US wide notice to terminate was fine to do during the pandemic as you can find a new place to rent.
I was keying in on the 'notice to vacate' portion of the Moratorium. If you cannot lawfully server a tenant this notice during the Moratorium, would that not mean that the landlord cannot notify us until June 30th that we have 60 days to vacate ? Or maybe the language under that stating that "...if your lease expired or will expire during..." makes him outside that portion on it. I have heard a lot of people mention they expect it to be extended anyway...
