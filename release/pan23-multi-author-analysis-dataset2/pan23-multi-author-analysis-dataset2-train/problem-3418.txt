It's not illegal per se, not illegal for me to use my brother's account and vice versa, but it's a TOS violation and you're going to get sued into oblivion by all of them if you try to set up a service for people to swap passwords.
I am not trying to swap passwords, you'll basically give your password to my service which will basically then generate a pseudo password and let the stranger use that to use the service. Everything will still be in the user's control.
You want to create a service to allow people to share their Netflix passwords with strangers? Probably not a crime but you are definitely getting sued by Netflix and everyone who participates in your service is getting their accounts banned.
Thanks for the advice but sticking to the original question, can you kindly help me figure out the type of lawyer as well so that I can talk to them in detail as well to completely understand the situation?
There's no specific type of lawyer for this, you are just looking for a lawyer who works with businesses. Just go to any law firm with more than a couple lawyers and they will find someone to tell you that you can't do this really quickly.
