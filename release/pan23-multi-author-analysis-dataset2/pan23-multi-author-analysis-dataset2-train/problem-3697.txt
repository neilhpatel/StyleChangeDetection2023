Talk to a local real estate attorney. Many will give you a brief consultation for free, and since you have a recent title search I doubt it would take more than an hour or two for them to do a more detailed review.
My knowledge of Michigan law is limited, but an HOA is typically created by recording a declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions. Once recorded, the CC&Rs run with the land - meaning you would become part of the HOA by virtue of owning that property.
I wouldn't ignore the HOA unless you are 100% certain that you are not a member. In many states, HOAs have the ability to penalize you (including charging double-digit interest and late fees), then record a lien, and eventually start foreclosure proceedings.
An HOA is merely a corporate entity that exists to own and maintain common property. If there is a shared road to be maintained by all the owners, it’s possible that an HOA was created to own the road (rather than each owner owning a percentage of it).
Bylaws just explain how the corporation operates. How many board members there are, how long they serve, what constitutes a quorum for meetings.
Those are deed restrictions, which can exist with or without and HOA. Lots of people don’t know the difference, which is what leads to situations like yours! If they aren’t filed with the county, they may not be enforceable; but you will have to do some research on state statutes for that.
You need to dig into these two things a little deeper. If the title company did in fact get this information from the HOA you may have recourse with them. Also, I'm not seeing how the HOA could exist and not be recorded with the state. This type of thing is the entire reason you use a title company.
Sorry if I was unclear, I currently don't know the terminology! There are restrictions on being able to put structures on your property, the kind of lights you can have, noise, grass lenh, those sorts of HOA things that we were hoping to avoid.
