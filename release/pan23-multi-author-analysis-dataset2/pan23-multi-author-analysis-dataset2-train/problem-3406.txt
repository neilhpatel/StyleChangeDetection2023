/u/shake4489 is absolutely correct in their assessment. I'd also like to add, you mentioned you have sisters. If she's done this to you, it would stand to reason that she's done it (or will do it) to them as well.
You can't get the debt out from under your name without filing a police report and exposing your mother to very serious charges which could lead to prison time. This is a difficult decision people in your situation have to make. So your choice is either you go to the police, or you accept the debt as your own and maybe sue her in civil court. But if you go with the second option the damage to your credit will stay because you're agreeing to take responsibility for these accounts. There's no option where you get the debt out from under your name and she gets off scot free for the fraud and identity theft she committed.
You really need to file a police report, and start working through the steps to repair the damage caused by identity theft. You need to help your siblings check their credit reports and see if they're facing the same challenges as you.
Because she is aware of who opened the accounts and it would not be in the interest of justice to let that person not be held to account. The creditors have a right to know who to go after before letting her off the hook if she is aware of who it is. It wouldn't be fair to them either. Also the general theory of when somebody commits a crime they should be held responsible for that and it should not be ignored by the court if the truth is known.
