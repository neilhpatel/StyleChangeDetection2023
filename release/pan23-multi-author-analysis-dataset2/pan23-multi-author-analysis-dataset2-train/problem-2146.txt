"Will she get caught" is not a question we can meaningfully answer. _Maybe_. If you aren't comfortable travelling with her while she's carrying controlled substances, that's a reasonable position to take - don't travel with her. Even if you're heading the same direction, you can take a different flight, or even just check in and pass security separately.
Okay I thought so, but how likely is TSA going to take action? I want her to get in trouble she needs to learn she’s doing stupid crap, but also don’t want to be dragged into it from any association even though it’s not made or distributed by me or my bf, nor consumed, It’s all her..
True.. Thats fair sorry.. I’m planning on being separated from her in line.. I’m just afraid If she will pull a “but they’re my family” and if TSA is known to drag family into it as reasonable suspicion because of her being already possession of it.. if you know by chance? That’s another maybe question but is that a possibility that they are known to do? Obviously if we pass our checks we are fine.. perhaps bf and I just go first in line so she’s last and can’t pull that card on us.. thank you for your time sorry for being a mess..
