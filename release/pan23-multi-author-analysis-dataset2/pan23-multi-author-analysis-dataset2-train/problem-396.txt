Dad is up here. And no it will not put her there for 6 months. She would have to be in NJ 6 months prior to the filing date which was june 22nd. She got to NJ feb 17th. And the court date is Aug 13th. Unless she has been there for 6 months per law they cant override a custody order.
I remember the post in the Custody sub, it getting put to August puts the child in NJ for 6 months and risks jurisdiction changing. You've spoken to the cops and they said they won't do anything, does Dad live with Grandma? That might be why, they consider it just a custody dispute between two parents. But honestly the vast majority of the time even if you have all the paperwork you need cops still won't help with this stuff.
At this point I think you need to go and speak to an actual family law attorney in your state. It sounds like you might be trying to do this yourself and it hasn't been working and you don't have much time left before another state might take jurisdiction and then it will get ten times more complicated and you'll need an attorney anyway. This isn't DIY territory anymore.
