Your very first steps should be to end this relationship and tell your ex in writing not to contact you again for any reason. If she threatens to harm or kill herself, don't respond and call 911. If served with a petition for a restraining order against you, don't ignore it and contact a lawyer. Since you both are "mutually going back and fourth with eachother", neither of you will find it easy to obtain a RO against the other.
No they wouldn't, like you and most people, they clearly think it's an easy thing to obtain. It isn't, being mean in a text isn't enough cause for one.
Regardless stop talking to her. If you aren't contacting her at all then there is no proof of any type of harassment and no basis for a VPO.
Thanks for the advice, so would her parents be able to get one on me in that case? I never threatened her but we did exchange some inappropriate words to Eachother and mid conversation I did apologize.
