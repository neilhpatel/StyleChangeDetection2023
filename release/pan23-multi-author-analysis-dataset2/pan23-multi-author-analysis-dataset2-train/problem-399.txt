Wait what how ? Are you talking about a change from "Xi" to "Sunny", or from "David Frost" to "Jane Snow" ? In my experience, a college registrar can be one of the most resistant agencies to a name change.
In general, if you are 18 or older, you can follow the procedure of your local County court to file a name change petition and go through the process. The procedures are generally uniform by state, but will differ and other NY courts. The among New York counties that are not in NYC.
Oh I meant that I changed it through the system and not legally! And it's not for gender reasons, so it is closer to the former. And I was concerned about parental support because I am relatively dependent on them at the moment, and have heard about name changes leading to banks/other places assuming fraudulent intent and wanted to have someone to back me up.
Whether or not your parents are supportive, financially or personally, is a practical relationship issue and not a legal matter. Once you turn 18, they have no legal standing to object to your name change.
