At a minimum, it's well past time to supply Ukraine with long range strategic missiles on par, and with better accuracy of course, than what Russia has already been using.
If it's true (looks like it is) there will be finger wagging, Poland will put more troops on their border, and they'll tell Russia if it happens again there will be a strong retaliation. At most we might see stronger sanctions or something similar. No way in hell is NATO going to escalate over 2 civilian deaths from what was likely a miscalculated missile(s).
I am thinking there will be a higher response than this. What else is there to sanction? I am sure NATO knows where the missile came from. I think the closest Russian base is a fair target. A proportional response is both necessary and adequate.
Higher response would be more support for Ukraine and tightening sanctions on or refusing to buy whatever they still get from Russia. 2 accidental deaths are not going to spark WWWIII.
