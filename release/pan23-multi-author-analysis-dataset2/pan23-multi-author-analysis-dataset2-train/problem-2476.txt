Transponders are turned on so they can be seen by everyone. Even the public. Likely as a deterrent or to show the assets being deployed in certain areas or to draw attention away from other operations. But rest assured, there are plenty of other assets out there working much more covertly.
I sometimes watch flight radar and there are AWACS planes from Turkey, the USA, and England that fly in SE Romania during weekdays, usually. Also, drones are up there. I only once saw a U2 taking off from Crete. They are up there somewhere, but have their identification turned off. Then, there are fighter jets that don't show on the flight radar.
Most of those aircraft fly from in Europe at bases in England, and Germany as well as Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. They fly a long way from those bases. It will save tremendous man hours and price on maintenance and fuel to put them in Romania.
if you look at flight radar, there also always are those large us drones that simple circle right before the coast of ukraine , most of those fly from italy iirc. Romania is a bit closer obviously.
