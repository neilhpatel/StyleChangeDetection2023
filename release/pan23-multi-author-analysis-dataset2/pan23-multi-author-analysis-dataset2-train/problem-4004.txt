Thank you! In addition, if you know, they are now requesting her SSN over text. It doesn't seem like the right thing to do though and the employer is saying that my SIL is refusing to give SSN.
They are asking for her SSN ovwr text because they are claiming her services for their childcare deduction on their taxes. The nanny tax starts at around 2400, if she was paid more than that, they owe taxes. In the mean time, your SIL can file her taxes with a substitute W-2 so that she's not out of compliance qith tax law. Its form 4852. She may want to let them know that if they don't provide the W-2 that she will be forced to file the 4852, because her filing the 4852 will likely trigger an audit against their taxes.
They are also probably trying to get their FSA reimbursement, which they need her federal ID info to prove appropriate expenditure for reimbursement. This one is a crap shoot. If they followed proper procedure and had her fill out the appropriate employee documents (W-2), they would have it anyway. Either way, they are kind of digging their own hole here and creating their own paper trail of non-compliance.
Tell them to request her TIN on the appropriate IRS form. For an employee that would be form W-4. For an independent contractor that would be form W-9. She shouldn’t agree to complete the wrong form. Be advised there are penalties for refusing a legitimate request for a tax ID, BUT text message isn’t the right forum for making such a request.
