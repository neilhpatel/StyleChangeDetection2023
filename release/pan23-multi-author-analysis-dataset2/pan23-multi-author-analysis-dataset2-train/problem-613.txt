As someone who works in technology and deals with 'oncall' all the time (20 years +), she does have to be paid for her work after hours.
If she was salaried/exempt, they could argue that it's part of her job role, especially if time to respond is not within the realm of impacting her life greatly (for instance, in IT, anything over 30 minutes has tended to be upheld in courts as 'acceptable'. Anything under 30 minutes to react has been often considered 'standby' and requires extra pay).
If she has to not only answer the phone right away and perform the work fast, they absolutely must pay her, even if she was salaried (the latter, depending on state).
It is probably time for her to have a chat with her local department of labor. If she is required to have a 5 minute response time she may be required to be paid for the entire time she's on call. At a very minimum she is absolutely entitled to compensation for every call she takes.
Get copies of the phone records of all calls involved in after hour unpaid work, get copies of any paperwork she had to fill out and file a complaint with the states labor department for unlawful employment practices. They investigate the claim, look at all provided evidence, and monitor to ensure there is no retaliation up to and including being fired or harassed at the job.
She should also address with supervisors the lack of coverage for her responsibilities. There should be a person who can do her job if sheâ€™s unable to once in a while due to vacation, sickness, etc.
