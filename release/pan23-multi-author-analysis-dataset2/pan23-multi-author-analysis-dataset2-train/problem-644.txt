For what it's worth, I got a vasectomy a few weeks ago with general anesthetic, but it's still a way less invasive thing than tubal ligation or bisalp. Honestly, I had zero trouble getting home, spent the rest of the day with some cold peas on my nuts, and was pretty much a'ok. The next few days after that were mostly a matter of having some extra compression to keep things from moving, more cold as necessary, and taking it easy. Relatively little pain during the whole thing.

On some level, if vasagel were a real option and not perpetually 5 years away, I might prefer that, just as a hypothetical "maybe less damage and complication risk". But I'm also not really interested in having kids, so I just kinda bit the bullet and decided that I'd rather end the risk and quit worrying during sex with my gf.
