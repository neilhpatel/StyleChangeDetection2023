It's not illegal to not like (or to like) people. Whether it's your mother, or a priest, or a friend, or a random person, nobody should ever call someone's boss about anything if the employees are adults and not minors.
I feel like it was all a conspiracy pretty much cus manager A told me she walked in on M ‘s friends saying that they can get rid of anyone now and yesterday was an example now.
3) You called your mother who called your boss (never never should this happen, holy crap) who threatened M?
It sounds like your mother should be happy they're not pressing charges and perhaps your brother should also quit. Nothing here that happened seems to be harassment (except what your mother did).
I wasn’t upset she didn’t give me the mask quickly I was mad that she acted like we weren’t there. And my mom never said anything negatively about M. Sorry if I wasn’t clear enough but she didn’t. One of M friends lied to her and said my mom told her all of those negative stuff about M. The open friend of M has never liked me she tried to get me fired because then to. I just think it was all a joke.
