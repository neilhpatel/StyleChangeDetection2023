Fearful that if I don't do the dishes from dinner that very moment, the landlord will enter and deem me filthy and try to kick me out.
I sincerely doubt a court would order them not to enter given that they have only done it once after posting notice were you to file for some kind of protection order.
That said you can let your landlord know that "blanket notice" on an ongoing basis is to you the same as no notice so you'll want more specificity, and you will deny them entry if they don't provide it with a greater degree of precision.
w/r/t the rest: Dirty dishes are not a valid basis for an eviction, generally speaking, unless your house is so dirty that it is attracting vermin.
I'd keep all the notices you've been getting in a folder somewhere if you aren't already doing so. LegalFAQ bot probably has the right links to get in contact with the right people.
NAL. Looks like Florida Statue 83.53 is what covers landlord access, and that keeping open-ended visiting hours via chain notice should (source: very non-legally-educated hunch) be a breach of the third subsection.
Again, NAL, subsection 2 seems to indicate the 12-hour notice should be only for repair of the premises, not to keep the tenant walking on eggshells or whatever they're doing here.
The history section refers to the Senate or house section, year, and which law that year enacted this or updated the statute. It isnt relevant to you in this situation.
My understanding of what the statute is saying is that your LL does not have unrestricted access to your rental. From your post, it sounds like your landlord is trying to violate the statute's intent via all the notices so they have cause to drop in whenever. I think it would be wise to google for a tenant lawyer and get a consult.
