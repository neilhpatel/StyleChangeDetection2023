Edit 2: Apparently I did not misunderstand. If you're getting a holiday off and won't be working that day, your employer doesn't have to pay you at all for that day (unless you're salaried exempt, which it doesn't sound like you are). If they're paying you 8 hours for that day anyway, that's a bonus. They don't have to pay you 10 hours for Thanksgiving just because you normally work 10 hour days -- they can pay you 8 hours for Thanksgiving, or 0 hours for Thanksgiving.
OP's concern is that OP would normally work for 10 hours on a Thursday, and therefore is getting shorted 2 hours of pay for the week, even though they are getting paid for the 30 hours that they actually worked plus 8 hours of pay for Thanksgiving.
The solution proposed by OP's manager is that OP work for 12 hours on another day, so that OP would receive a total of 40 hours of pay. 32 for hours actually worked and 8 for Thanksgiving.
You are being offered to work 2 extra hours today, but the business will be closed tomorrow and you are still getting paid for 8 hours for tomorrow even though you wont be working. Is that correct? If so it is perfectly legal.
