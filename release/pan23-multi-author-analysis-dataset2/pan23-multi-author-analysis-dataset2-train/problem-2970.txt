Common law married? What state is this in? Only a handful of states still recognize common law marriage, so location matters. If they are in fact married, and your mom died or dies without a will, then her spouse would get all or most of her assets. More facts would be helpful here, including your age (are you over 18?) and location. When you say his house, is this a secondary house that they don’t reside in? Legally, if your mother is still alive and this is a hypothetical, you can see if she’s willing to make a will and leave you certain property. In some states this can be an easy process she can do without an attorney, but in others, there’s a more formal process. If in doubt, err on the side of finding an attorney. Drafting a will is a simple process and won’t cost as much as retaining a lawyer for other matters.
She can write a will, but again, if she and he are in fact common law spouses, it may be more difficult for her to ensure he gets nothing.
I am confused what you mean by wanting to take his house out of spite. Who owns the house? What are you trying to do?
I am very sorry for your loss. If they are common law spouses, he is going to be entitled to some portion of her assets.
