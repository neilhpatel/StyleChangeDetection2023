So, I reckon KSA ought to stop co-operating with OPEC+ (Russia) every time Putin says "hey, lets cut production and stick it to those evil Americans" - particularly when KSA basically owes its existence to Western military intervention. Otherwise they'd be known as "Southern Iraq".
Very curious to what end Israel is even going to let Iran keep their new toys. Depending on what sort of tech, they may not bother. But if it is a significant threat to them, there may be some real "accidents" occurring within Iran.
True, Middle East is not stable, but if Iran suddenly has advanced ballistic capabilities and nuclear warheads, you got a new problem, not because Iran will actually nuke the region, but it will have leverage over its opponents, which would also drive them to obtain the same technologies, and nuclear warheads.
Does Iran’s opponents not already have those capabilities, so technically they would be playing “catch-up” in terms of their own development? Also is the ”nuclear warheads” not just a WMD-esq fearmongering which proliferates in Europe, The US, and Israel? I remember reading about how much material would be required but if you have a link to where Iran is in their nuclear warhead capability I’d appreciate the link.
Thank you, I think most of what I understand about the Iranian inability to produce a functioning nuclear warhead is covered in the report. They don’t have the design, material capability, nor the amount of material required at the required enrichment level at present. The report also states that there has been no move to accelerate weaponising the Uranium since 2003. I think a lot of the Anti-Iran rhetoric is based purely on hatred and little on fact. If a country doesn’t have the capability to design a nuclear warhead, and there’s no proof that they have the enriched material to create the reaction, let alone the materials required to assemble a missile, then it’s all just flights of fancy….
