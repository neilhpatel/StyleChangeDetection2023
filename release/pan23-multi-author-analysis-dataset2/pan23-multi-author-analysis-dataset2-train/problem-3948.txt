Since the "cross" part is more readily recognizable in Russian, any positive use of the phrase was absolutely out question in the militarily atheistic USSR, which officially viewed crusades as evil.
Moreover, the phrase had a distinct politically negative connotation ever since Pius XI's 1930 letter to Cardinal Pompili criticizing the religious persecution in the USSR. He supported the people joining in on a "crusade of prayers".
The Soviet propaganda omitted the "prayers" part and presented the letter as an attempt to start a "crusade against the USSR" (Bukharin got the agitprop ball rolling with an article in Pravda). This phrase (in various versions, e.g. "crusade against communism") remained a propaganda cliche for decades afterwards (source: ).
In general, all actions by the West ("Anglo-American imperialism") during the Cold War perceived as hostile could be said to be a part of this "crusade".
Also, the crusades were a Western-Church phenomenon, not a part of the Russian history, psychologically - something that "they" do and thus hard to use as a catchphrase for something that "we" do.
Thinking about it, the real mystery is how is it possible that it (occasionally) has a positive connotation in part of the western world.
In modern Russia it can be used sort-of neutrally (e.g. a teacher's crusade against illiteracy - though it indicates a bit of (maybe well-meaning) fanaticism on the teacher's part).
