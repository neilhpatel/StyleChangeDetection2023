The real question is, given that Rupert Murdoch is an immigrant who has willfully aided an abetted an attempt to overthrow the lawful government of the United States of America, when do we revoke his citizenship, since it was clearly gained under false pretenses ? Notice that "good moral character" is one of the touchstones. Rupert Murdoch does not have good moral character. He promoted lies that endangered the citizens of the United States of America and the lawful transition of government. He is aiding an abetting enemies of the United States of America. He should be sent back to his home, and permanently forbidden from re-entering the United States.
There are rules about rendering a person stateless, and AUS already revoked his citizenship when he became a US citizen, so we can't really deport him anywhere or revoke his citizenship unless he has citizenship in some other country.
