I had a ticket 2 years ago for speeding and the 24 month period has passed that it says on your license, so at the moment I don’t think i have any other points accumulated. (10 points you lose your license for 30 days and at 6 i think you have to take a driving course).
I think the cop already did you a favor by underreporting your speed, and arguing about the light thing isn’t going to get you anywhere. So paying a lawyer $400 to “fight” the ticket is probably not advisable. But you could pay him to try and get it changed to something that carries fewer or no points on your license, if that’s your ultimate concern. Just be aware that even if the prosecutor/judge agrees to that, it will likely make the ticket more expensive in addition to the legal fee. So it really all depends on how problematic those points are to you.
I don’t believe i was going OVER 85 (because my car starts to shake if i’m going that fast and i would have noticed it) , close to 85 perhaps. But what’s on the ticket says just 85.
