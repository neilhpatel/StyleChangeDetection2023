The issue Erdogan has with Sweden joining is not really about the Swedish application, he's only playing these games for internal publicity in Turkey and in order to lever his negotiations about buying American fighter jets.
As a Swedish living in Finland, I think it's more important to keep unity and instead quietly give Erdogan the middle finger.
I mean of course Finland would join NATO without Sweden if it's absolutely necessary. But we won't do that just to play Edrogan's games, for example if we choose to divide our applications at this point Edrogan might just move the goal posts again and make more demands. No reason to make big moves yet, we're not in that much of a hurry to join as we have security guarantees from pretty much every major NATO country during the process.
I defer to you, as i think it's more important for y'all to sort this out yourselves than some American across the sea, but what do you think about the idea that Finland is on the border, and therefore has a greater risk of invasion. Sure y'all have a border with Russia as well, but it's certainly harder to invade from that point.
