Why would your fiancé's friend go to the trouble of setting up a grow op somewhere only to turn it in to the police? That's just flushing money down the toilet, and people usually don't do that without a good reason.
Because there would be other drugs stashed in the house somewhere we wouldn't know about it. I wouldnt have started growing without a license here in utah which hasn't been allowed yet to my knowlege doesn't really matter. Point is I'm not going to jail and we're pissed enough to sue, and even send this friend to prison for anything right now because of what he was wanting to do to us. We would have fallen for it if my fiance hadn't contacted the brother (an attorney and not sure what he practices) who got all the information for us.i learned that a report was filed in utah, Wisconsin, and California.
You and your fiancé can report what you discovered to the police. So long as your hands are clean, you're reasonably safe, but if you think you might have broken the law or have concerns about conspiracy charges, talk to a defence lawyer before you make a report. Your state bar can refer you.
Yeah there’s definitely more going on here than is being said. You didn’t experience any type of loss so you have nothing to sue for. You can’t really sue for what might have happened. You could go to the cops with what you know but if you can’t give them irrefutable proof, they’re not likely to do anything. Just cut the guy off and move on.
