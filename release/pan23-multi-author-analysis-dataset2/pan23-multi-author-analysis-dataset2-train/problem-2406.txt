Yes they will be security but they'll probably do nothing when the shooting starts. I heard there was a school shooting in Texas where the police stood for an hour doing nothing while the mass shooter was inside killing children. If the US can't solve its mass shooting problem, the 2026 world cup should be restricted to Mexico and Canada because mass shootings are rare over there. Safety of the fans must come first.
I would kind of agree with you though, as the 2026 WC will have 48 teams instead of 32. So Qatar will have slightly better chances to qualify going forward.
They will have way better chances, as the Asian confederation is expected to profit a lot from the reform (8.5 instead of 4.5 spots, with Qatar being listed as the fifth best team of the federation according to FIFA rankings). Though I think that it will become a good option for teams like Azerbadjan or Georgia (both currently playing the UEFA qualifiers in Europe) to switch federations, just like Australia did a while ago.
