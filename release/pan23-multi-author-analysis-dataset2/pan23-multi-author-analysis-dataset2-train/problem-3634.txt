Filing a police report is something you should have done any way. But it won't affect her paying for your repairs. Threatening her that if she doesn't pay you'll go to the cops may be extortion.
You can't force someone to impound her vehicle. If you file a police report, they may take action against her since she has no insurance.
You really have two options: Go through your insurance and let them handle suing her if it comes to that, or pay for the repairs yourself and sue her yourself. Considering that handling accidents exactly like this one is one of the things you're literally paying your insurance for, it seems ridiculously silly to me to not use that service.
This is a question for your insurer, as it's mostly going to come down to what sort of policy you have, what your driving record is, that sort of thing. We can't predict that.
About the same as if you try to sue her. If you use your own insurance, you know that you can't be out of pocket for more than $500. If she's judgement-proof (if she has no money to pay a judgement with), then you could be out the entire cost of your repairs. And even if she does have money to pay you, enforcing a judgement against someone could take months or years.
So Geico will actually try to sue if she does not comply? I have no idea how this works so I assumed they’d just give up after I paid my deductible. I’d much rather avoid the hassle and have them deal with it.
Yea I really should’ve. I should’ve just called the cops when she hit my car in the first place because she was acting very sketch to begin with and was trying to leave in a rush.
What’s more likely is they send her a collections notice and if she ignores, they send it to a collections agency.
