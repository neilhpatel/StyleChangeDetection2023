If you can get fired or laid off without notice, I'm a little disappointed in any state that requires it. It's an inconvenience for the employer, but it's a major event for anyone living paycheck to paycheck.
"Sure Boss, as long as my new rate is (double) you can have me as long as you need. Starting today. Otherwise, my two weeks stands".
There will be a stipulation in the contract after the "two weeks notice" stating what happens if they do not give two weeks notice. Most likely no reference and a pro-rated deduction from the final pay cheque.
If you’re in the USA under an at-will employment scenario, you can give your boss as much or as little notice that you want, quit on the spot, or even give them some lenh of notice and quit partway into that notice period.
Giving notice and working through that notice avoids burning a bridge and potentially avoiding a positive reference, but isn’t legally required.
Contract says two weeks, make sure you have a safe copy of that stored off site (multiple if you can.) If you work your two weeks then they try to withhold pay, you can make complaints or take legal action. Make sure you have dated copies of the notice you gave. (Texts or emails should cover that, but if the email is on a company account, forward them to a private account now.).
However, if you don't already have something else lined up, you may be in a golden situation. They've started they cannot replace you, offer up your own contract that you'll stay for longer, for.double or triple pay. If you're that required, they'll counter offer.
Perfectly legal for her to ask you to stay longer. The company not being able to replace you is not your problem however.
