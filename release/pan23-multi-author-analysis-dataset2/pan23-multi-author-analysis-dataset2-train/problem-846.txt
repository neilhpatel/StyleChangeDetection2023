Of course he won’t allow that, people forget that Likud started as a moderate progressive centre right liberal party and as monstrous and nationalistic as many of its members are now they like all parties still hold onto ideological goals of their past. Makes me wonder how much instability this is going to cause in the new government. This should have been excepted or worked out in coalition talks but the fact it wasn’t shows problems with the communication between these partners.
It was talked, this "correction" of the law is infact in the agreement between the Likud and this specific party.
I have said for months now that Netanyahu will pass a budget and a law immunizing himself and then immediately call a new election.
Reddit for some reason thinks Netanyahu is more right wing than he actually is. Bibi's political opinions aren't even that different to someone like Mitt Romney. He is just way more cut throat politically than Romney would ever be.
Mitt Romney absolutely is a rightie though. Mr. 47% looks down on anyone who doesn't have money and like so many other righties thinks that they've achieved everything because they picked themselves up by their bootstraps ... not because they come from a rich political family.
Only good thing Mitt Romney has done for ordinary people is stand against Trump when it came to his two impeachments. Other than that he's voted lock step with Republicans 95+% of the time.
My entire point is that Mitt Romney is a typical Republican fuckwit and an enemy to ordinary Americans. The only thing he's done that was useful is sticking to his "Never Trump" credentials.
Romney has never had any sort of moral spine. He's your typical "conservative" politician and hasn't done a damn thing to help ordinary people.
