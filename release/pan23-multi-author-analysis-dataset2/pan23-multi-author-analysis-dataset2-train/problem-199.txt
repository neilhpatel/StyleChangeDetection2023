I think at this point everyone is afraid of what else he can start rather than what he can actually finish. It's obvious at this point Russia is completely inferior compared to NATO, but having them even just attempt an attack on Europe (and of course fail miserably) is a horrifying thought.
Putin = Green screen, hidden underground bunker, paranoia so he kills everyone left and right, not able to get even on his lawn.

Would bidenâ€™s secret service be on high alert being in a warzone like this without our own military there even though the Ukraine military is? Or do we still have fighters that follow Air Force one that patrol the area? Not sure how all that works but it must be a huge effort to clear the area of threats while Biden is there lol.
