There was another ballot initiative which passed that requires a per person cost by income level chart for each income tax bill when it's being voted on. I'm hoping that it will help with some of these kinds of initiatives.
If I was making $300,000 a year I would vote for this in a second and wear this as a badge of honor. I'm rich enough that I'm feeding children that might go hungry!? Sign me right fuck up.
I make about that much and in a different state. I just voted to increase my taxes because they go directly to paying for increased quality of life for those using the public bus system as well as local school system funding. I never use the bus and never will. It's easy to do the right thing.
