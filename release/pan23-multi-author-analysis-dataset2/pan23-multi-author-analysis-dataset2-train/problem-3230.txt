There were definitely crimes committed here. It would be up to the prosecutor on whether or not the state will pursue the charges. At the very least you have forgery (signing the credit card slip) and larceny (whatever it's called in your state for stealing $20 from OP. Doesn't matter who actually gets the money. Neighbor stole it and gave it to the driver). With 'white collar' type crimes, there are usually smaller charges associated with the main charges. Could be receipt from illegal use of credit card or anything else. Once the neighbor forged the signature, he accepted goods from a credit card that was not his.
This whole thing is something you can talk to your local PD about. If an officer doesn't want to give you the time of day you can either talk to a supervisor (Lieutenant, Sargent, Captain, etc) or head on over to the courthouse and go straight to the prosecutors office.
Mens rea is important for criminal vs civil, and still often important for the minutiae of civil (e.g. the specifc criteria of evaluating negligence standards). Long story short, there's a good possibility that this isn't worthwhile even in civil, let alone criminal, courts.
Don't pay attention to anyone here, half of these people are posting here just to see their text on the internet. If a crime is committed with absolutely verifiable evidence, someone will start a case if you push enough buttons. Local PD, Courthouse, Mayors office, Governors office, etc. Contacting your state rep directly can also push things a lot quicker. They are obligated to assist their constituents.
The neighbor accepted something that wasn't theirs, knowingly, and not only took the goods but took an extra $20, knowingly, from OP, and tipped that taken $20 to the delivery person.
Pizza delivery guy came to my door, I signed the receipt, and didn't notice anything was wrong until half of the pizza was eaten, and I realized it was from Pizza hut, not Dominos.
