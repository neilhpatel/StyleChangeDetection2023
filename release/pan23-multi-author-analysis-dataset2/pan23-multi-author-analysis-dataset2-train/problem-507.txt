This is possibly the least of his concerns right now. Or the thing that concerns him the most. Does this guy feel concern? About anything? Or is his brain wired differently, where he is but dimly aware of the connection between the things he says and how he might be perceived by others around him? If so, he likely doesn’t care what comes out of his mouth, and he doesn’t seem to foresee that other people might wish to see some sort of evidence for his outlandish claims. Anyway, I hope they nail this prick on these traffic tickets. He’s gotta go down for something, right?
It’s gonna be like Forrest Gump, but he’s present and responsible for all the terrible shit to happen to the country/world, in it’s worst moments.
Can’t wait to unearth the footage of him jumping out of plane number two right before it hit the tower in some unearthed footage, and the clip of him shooting the Shinzo Abe, and him sabotaging Space Shuttle Columbia, and the footage of him mailing anthrax to the national inquirer, and we’re gonna find a video of him fucking an abalone in a chinese wet market in 2019.
