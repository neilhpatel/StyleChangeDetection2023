Well that seems slightly rigged, doesn't it. Can FOIA requests be made (and quickly denied, no doubt) regarding closed door meetings when they discussed this, no doubt very early on, in the pandemic? Probably not huh, I'd imagine those were off the record or they simply will refuse to share that information due to the implications.
There is plenty of evidence that they denied the truth. Changing their story months later seems like an admission of guilt? I suppose incompetence would not equal intent however. Unfortunately the damage has already been done, there are still people that do not understand the implications of airborne transmission because of what was told to them for months. Lives were lost as a result of this disinformation.
What are your damages? Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, if you are personally injured by the governmentâ€™s negligence, you can sue the government for damages. For the government to be liable, there must be harm caused by the negligent act of a federal employee. What are your personal financial damages caused directly by an employee of the federal government? And what of shared liability?
I will agree putting a dollar amount on the total amount of damages (which would be staggering) as a result of their negligence (or deceit, that would require concrete evidence), would be a major hurdle here. This is only speculation, but I'd imagine their guidance decision resulted in a net positive, economically speaking.
It would be pretty much impossible to quantify how their ineffective guidelines - due to the true nature of this virus - affected everyone monetarily, so I guess there is no case here.
