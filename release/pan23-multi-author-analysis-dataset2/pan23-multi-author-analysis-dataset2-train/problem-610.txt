Thank you for your response. I failed to ask if the spouse that did the act and would be charged was later diagnosed with a trio of mental health problems brought on by PTSD and has documentation and has been in medication and in counseling; would that help to mitigate the discipline? Possibly reducing it down to just probation?
If you're asking whether a felony charge will be dismissed before trial, that decision belongs 100% to the prosecutor. The prosecutor can take into account any facts that he or she wants in order to decide whether to dismiss, including but not limited to the facts you have mentioned.
Generally speaking if someone is charged with a serious crime, a lack of prior criminal history may affect plea bargaining or the sentence imposed if found guilty, but a lack of criminal history itself is not a defense to the charge.
That is possible, would likely depend on testimony from an expert witness describing how mental illness played a role in the criminal conduct. In that type of situation, if probation is ordered it would not be uncommon for there also to be an order for mental health treatment.
The person charged would want to speak with their lawyer regarding defense strategies, which are very specific to the facts of the case. At a high level a defense lawyer will, if possible, try to have the charges dismissed, or to have the defendant acquitted. If that's not possible, the lawyer will try to mitigate the effects/penalties of a conviction.
