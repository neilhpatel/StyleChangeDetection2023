My company won't even insure buildings on the coast, and we are an E&S company (we work on riskier things); to give you an idea of how bad it's looking long term.
Coastal erosion, even without the added issue of sea-level rise is going to be a bigger and bigger problem in many places in the near future.
It doesn't help that beach front property can be extremely lucrative to develop and local authorities are reluctant to stop such developments if they can partake in the fortunes being made.
As someone who lives in Florida, the culture here is absolutely anathema to any kind of large infrastructural or public works project like that in a way that Dutch culture very much isn't. Everyone from engineers to inspectors to builders to the people approving the construction are as incompetent or crooked as they come, and projects like that would be actively protested and sabotaged every step of the way by the population at large.
I believe that's a picture of said building, everybody knows that the tide can fluctuate due to many different reasons. Where I live there are NO building directly on the sand/beach because developers know that storms etc can cause the tide to push inland.
Weird, why would you build housing blocks directly on the beach in the first place ? Before I get slaughtered for daring to use common sense...
