Several Redditors have asked for you to provide additional information but it's really not necessary if all you're looking for is advice on obtaining an order of protection.
If you have an intimate or household relationship with the LEO, you should file a Protection from Abuse order (PFA). Follow this from the PA Coalition Against Domestic Violence for an explanation of the process. Click the "Get help" button to find your local DV program. Many offer legal assistance in addition to other resources such as shelter and counselling.
If you don't have such a relationship, you can file a Sexual Violence Protection Order (SVPO). The PA Coalition Against Rape has a explaining what to do. They also run a legal assistance project which "provides free and confidential trauma informed legal advice and short-term legal representation to victims of sexual assault, abuse, and harassment." Click "Help in PA to find a sexual assault center.
I would still reach out and make a call. The shelter in our community does serve both men and women although itâ€™s not something that is widely understood. They often have lawyers that help pro Bono.
If so, Pennsylvania Adult Protective Services may be able to assist you. You can contact them at 1-800-490-8505 to see if they can do anything.
We need more information but you can start by filing a Internal affairs report against the officer. That will help strenhen your case. Our situations are very different but i had the cop following and pulling people over leaving my house. I sell pcs and electronics for a living out of my house so this officer thought i was selling drugs. He pulled people over for no reason searching their cars etc. I filed a IA report and a police report for harassment and they don't dare mess witg my buisness anymore. Sorry to hear that happened to you and i hope you can find justice.
