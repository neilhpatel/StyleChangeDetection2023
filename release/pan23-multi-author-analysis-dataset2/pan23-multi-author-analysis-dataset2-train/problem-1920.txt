China is a NATO problem because of its alliance and colossal support of Russia, from subversion of sanctions to dual use equipment being issued to front line troops. One could argue but for Chinas support of Putin the war would be over.
China has gone along with Western military and banking sanctions on Russia very well for the most part.
When recent attacks on Ukraine's powergrid began China announced they would be sending equipment to Ukraine to help fix the power grid.
Putin's threats of using nuclear weapon have toned down dramatically recently, and there's a lot going on behind the scenes between the US and China on this issue.
If China support for Russia was colossal, you wouldn't see so many stories about Russian troops having poor or no equipment. A war of attrition with China truly backing Russia is not a war NATO manufacturing is prepared for.
Don't be so hypocritical, everyone knows the only problem is that China is threat for the global dominated interests of traditional western countries, especially the US (Five Eyes).
I wasn’t aware of India committing an ethnic genocide, attempting to use technology to transform the country into George Orwell’s wet dream or India instigating or manipulating any other elections in the free world.
