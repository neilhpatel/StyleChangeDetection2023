I mean realistically all he can do is call and ask to speak with the manager. That being said it does make sense that they wouldn't release the food to anyone other than the driver because they can't verify that it's his. The arguing and sticking his foot in the door so it couldn't be closed and then arguing with the staff won't help him.
He might be able to sue for medical bills resulting from the altercation but his odds of collecting after his prior conduct is dubious.
Yes, and get a lawyer or at least speak with one and have them draft a letter. Most instances a letter from a lawyer is enough.
Call the store and ask to speak to their management. Tell them someone slammed a door on said blind person’s foot and that you want to speak to the regional manager, and that you’re planning to escalate the matter with a lawyer. Usually gets people moving, but you can just sue them over smashing your foot up.
OP asked for legal options, contacting management and beginning a suit is my advice, because if someone slammed a door on my foot repeatedly I would sue them for injury.
You said tell management you’re taking legal actions. Management won’t help them after you say that.
But it’s dubious trying to force their way into a closed restaurant after being told they weren’t welcome is a great legal claim.
From my reading they weren’t trying to force their way in, they were talking to the worker who shut the door on their foot repeatedly, if they were trying to force their way in then yeah you’re completely correct.
