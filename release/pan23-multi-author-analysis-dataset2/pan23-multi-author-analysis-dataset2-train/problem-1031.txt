And if they legalized weed, they won't be able to prey on Mexicans bringing weed in. They don't want anything to mess up their supply of slave labor for the prison industrial complex!
AFAIK, no one is really bringing brick weed over the border in quantity like in days of yore. We have so much domestic production. Legal market diversion to the gray market pipeline is pumping hard. I haven't seen Mexican weed in decades. Really since the great BC beasters influx in the late 90's-early 2000's. This is of course just my anecdotal offering so I'm more than open to the idea I'm wrong.
