OnlyFans may have a problem with someone else’s name owning the OF account vs the bank account, ask them first.
If they do not automatically issue 2 tax forms (for example, 1099) you will end up owing all of the tax for the money that is paid to both of you combined.
I don’t know exactly but my guess is that OF will want to know who is getting paid and they may not have a mechanism for splitting responsibility. If this is sort of “under the radar” I would expect them to ban your account if they ever notice (they probably don’t want to enable accounts that they don’t have visibility to see who the performers / payees are for liability, tax or policy reasons).
Right and so since my name is on the W9 form obviously, I have to pay whatever I need to for taxes but legally if OnlyFans let's that go through, there wouldn't be a problem with the money not going directly to me?
My husband because we work on the OnlyFans together an equal amount and I want him to be able to withdraw from it as well but we have separate bank accounts/finances.
you can deposit money into any account you want. it's up to their policies if they allow you to do so.
Thanks for the reply. If I added a different bank account under my husband's name, could this pose a problem as he would have that as taxable income? Would legally he have to file his own w9 form with OnlyFans?
That doesn't seem unreasonable if they were to ban for that reason. Perhaps it would be best to reach out to OF customer support directly to ask them.
