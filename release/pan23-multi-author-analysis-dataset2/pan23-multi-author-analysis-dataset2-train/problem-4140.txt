You're looking to point to the wrong thing because you feel wronged (likely justified). The clause you're referring to is that an application for a safety fence for inground swimming pools can't be unreasonably denied.
I guess I am asking can they deny a request for a koi pond with the reason being it would require a safety fence? That is what I was now being told. Wouldn't that be an unreasonable denial? The last part of my post talks about submissions in general.
That clause says they will allow safety fences only for pools. It doesn’t say anything about allowing anything else that would require a safety fence.
It’d be unreasonable if you made an application for a pool fence and they denied it out right. They could seemingly request your app for a pool fence be changed to conform to community aesthetics.
That makes sense and I need to go re word my post. The bottom part with the quote is another section about any submissions for any architecture chances to the outside. Anything you do must be submitted from a deck to planting tree.
My question is, if I submit for a koi pond can they reasonable deny it because they do not want to allow a fence? Even though it meets all astetics?
The better way is to try to get involved with the hoa and get neighbors to feel the same way. Be apart of the board and get the rules changed.
Understand and makes sense. That is what I tried to do. Go about it thr right way, only 30 ppl in the neighborhood. Go talk with the board. I thought that went well and then they did a 180. Really rubbed me the wrong way to have someone look me in the eye shake my hand and lie to my face. Only reason I'm even considering litigation.
That’s more complicated and not really worth litigating. If you’re wrong, it’s not unusual to be responsible for both sides legal expenses. If you win you’re responsible for yours and a share of what the hoa occurred during this since you’re a member.
