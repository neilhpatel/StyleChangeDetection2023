Inheritances are typically treated as separate property. However, they can become "co-mingled" when marital funds are used to maintain or upgrade the property. If the distinction is easily traceable, they may say 90% of the value is separate and 10% marital (or whatever it works out to be). But if it's not easily traceable; like there are a large number of cash deposits and withdraws into the inheritance bank account; then they may say that it has lost its separate character and everything will be treated as marital property.
So the safest options are either to establish a bank account using the inherited funds, and only use money from that account to pay for maintenance on the property (not marital funds). Or you can maintain totally separate finances with your spouse, and have a lease agreement; depositing that lease money into the house maintenance fund (since the rental income from a separate property is also separate). A prenuptial agreement regarding ownership of the house is also a good idea; although not ironclad.
It's generally very difficult to keep the actual marital home as separate property during a marriage. It's probably better to keep is as an income rental property, and have your separate home for your family.
If you don't want this to happen, see an attorney about ways to keep the assets segregated, although this may involve selling the house.
