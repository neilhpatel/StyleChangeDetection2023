C - Unless specifically asked, do not keep anything that is company confidential. DEFINITELY keep employment records for you and any correspondence about this issue. But normal workday stuff like customer lists, source code, etc...that information is not yours and you could get into hot water if you do keep it. Also do not delete anything that is only housed on your computer. Move it to company servers first and then confirm it is there before you delete anything.
What stuff are you worried about being seized? If it is personally owned tools or similar, take them out of the office just before you make the complaint. Sure they can not legally take your things, but why give them the opportunity to do so and then have to pursue recovering them?
There are laws in place that protect employees from retaliation for seeking enforcement of their rights.
C) If there is company confidential information on it due to being used for work purposes, scrub that after being let go. Hopefully they have a procedure in place for such events.
