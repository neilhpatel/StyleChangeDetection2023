For example, she kicked my son out of her house when he was 16 years old. He was an Eagle Scout, honors student at one of the top high schools in the USA (math & science emphasis), no tobacco, no drugs, no sex, not even a tattoo. Never in trouble at school or with the law. Very respectful, sensitive, responsible and compassionate. And she only had to put up with him for 2 weekends a month, a a few weeks in the summer.
You can't make absolutely sure of that. Custody decisions are always made based on the best interests of the children at that point, not based on prior arrangements. "Who has more money" is not usually a factor, but it is possible that putting the kids into a situation where their guardian is in regular conflict, over their care, with another relative is not in their interests and that they'd be placed with a more neutral relative.
Prior arrangements do have weight, and the parents' preferences often do decide things, though. If your daughter and her husband are on board, they can spell this out in their will or in other related estate-planning documents.
