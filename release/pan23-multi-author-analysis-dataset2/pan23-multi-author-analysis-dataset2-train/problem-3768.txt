It's kind of disingenuous to compare an intelligence failure from 2003 that was the result of Neocon groupthink within that US (Bush) administration that the US has admitted was an intel failure and to use it to paint all US intel going forward as unreliable.
Well that, and if the Russian Federation crumbles, there's a massive land mass of potential new countries, many with nukes, each unpredictable and potentially power hungry. It would be like having a neighbor who smokes too much pot and occasionally gets in paranoid arguments with anyone who will listen, only for them to have a heart attack, and immediately gangsters move in every house on your block.
We all know the story of both Russia and China saying the US was being alarmist and then when it happened they quickly switched from their denial or "yeah, NATO expansion that's why, we weren't lying or being dishonest" (Now to be fair China may not have known Putin's real plans). But the US intelligence was very much on point as to what actually happened.
Zelensky invited Xi to talk over a month ago. And recently again said he wants to meet Xi to talk about the peace plan.
