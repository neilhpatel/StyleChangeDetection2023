He specifically said to call my insurance company to find out if I can get my insurance backdated. He probably thought I meant I had insurance within the month but I didn’t at the time of the accident. I told him I wasn’t insured and that I was getting insurance back through Geico. He didn’t ask how long I hadn’t been insured for so that probably where the confusion came from on that part.
GEICO isn’t going to issue you backdated coverage. Either you misunderstood the officer or he was telling you something to end the discussion without drama.
I didn’t hit the other car, she hit me as I was going through a yellow light but the officer said it turned red as I entered the intersection so it was “too close” labeling me at-fault for running a red light. I have the fines for my tickets, an officer at the department said I could either go ahead and pay them or I could appeal them in court if I provided proof or a record showing I had insurance in the past. I assume that means within the last month or so.
As far as the money, I won’t know how much I owe until court right? This is my first and hopefully last accident and I have no idea how this process works.
