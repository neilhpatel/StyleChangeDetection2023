The issue may not be that they think he doesn't have a right to FMLA, it's possible that they are saying he does not qualify for FMLA at this time. That could have to do with whether he was considered terminated and rehired, or it could be that he has not worked 1,250 hours over the past 12 months. If either of those are true, then they may be correct that he does not qualify for protected FMLA leave, and yes, a woman who also did not qualify for FMLA would have the same problem.
If he doesn't qualify for FMLA, he will need to work with his employer to cover his absences and may be at risk of losing his job if he cannot sufficiently cover them with PTO.
There is no law that entitles him to paternity leave. In fact, outside of 5 states and DC (California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York and Washinon), women aren't even entitled to maternity leave specifically. The idea is supposed to be that FMLA covers up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off for either men or women, but if he hasn't worked enough hours in the last 12 months or the company isn't big enough, that doesn't apply. Maternity/paternity leave policies are up to individual companies, if they don't have a policy then they don't have one and that's that.
