However, there's also no need to expect 100% return on investment for weapons sold to allies. Their very existence and usage against enemies who are also enemies of U.S, without U.S blood being spilled, has a very nice profit in it's own way. I'm willing to bet they're quite willing to take a loss in it as long as the west remains a top military might with U.S in lead. Weapons development losses are covered by tax dollars from U.S. citizens who can in this way stay away from draft and frontlines. It's the reason stuff like lend-lease exist, where weapons are more or less donated in critical conflicts. I think the only reason for steep price tags to allies is that the debt also keeps them allies, and allows for certain kind of pressure should the weapons be used "wrong".
Not only maintenance services but Finns tend to buy access to those maintenance programs so domestic Finnish defense industries can perform them as primary providers directly or at the least as subcontractors.
As one example they have a quite extensive jet engine and subsystem component maintenance capability pertaining to the F-18 jet system and other aircraft because of this.
