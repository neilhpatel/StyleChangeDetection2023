Unless there was a track record of criminals using ladders left on the property to access balconies and steal from them, I don't think this was reasonably foreseeable.
You should be aware that you aren't entitled to the replacement cost of the property -- only the reasonable market value of used property. So if you go to court, you will want to find similar used bikes for sale and bring printouts so the judge has an idea of how much to award in damages. As plaintiff, you aren't only required to prove you're entitled to damages, but also how much.
But it's small claims. It costs about $100 for filing/service and half a day of your time to find out if a judge sees it the same way.
I could see it going either way and there is no way for anyone here to know how a judge will decide.
It's up to you if you want to take the time and money to sue over a used bike. Because if you win, you're judgement will likely be for the cost to replace the bike as it was when it was stolen, not brand new.
Would a series of stolen bicycles be enough to prove that it was reasonably foreseeable? Or would it have to specifically be related to the ladder?
