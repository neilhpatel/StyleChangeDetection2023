Boy, if only we had some kind of computational mega-genius who could have substantially contributed to early AI research and possibly set it on a safe and ethical path in addition to being more responsible for the downfall of the Nazis than any other single individual.
If we did, I bet we would have treated him with tremendous respect, because it would have been colossally stupid, as well as a tragic waste of life and a once-in-a-generation talent, if we, say, used the full weight of the British government to criminally prosecute, publicly humiliate, and then haze him into suicide early in his career because he was gay. Good thing Perfidious Albion isn't actually that perfidious, right? ...right?
Well I have one too. I hold the wheel at 2 and 10 but you have to wiggle or turn one of the scroll wheels every few mins. Even holding the wheel is not enough to the extent I don't use autopilot any longer. I just keep it to the regular adaptive cruise.
But without Autopilot, the customer would have died. Why is it that a 15 minute chase that lead to the survival of the driver is a bad thing? You rather that he crashed the second he fell asleep?
Somehow the article tried to attack self driving when it did the best it could with an irresponsible user. And no one died. Shouldn't that mean the autopilot WORKED?
Artificial intelligence was already on people's minds as early as the 1920s and Turing was well aware of the implications of that as he worked in the '40s and '50s. He could have very easily worked into the '80s, and lived into the '90s. Hell, with a good bit of luck, it's entirely possible that his natural lifespan would have only ended about ten years ago.
