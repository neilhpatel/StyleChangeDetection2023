Wanted to add that if your girlfriend moves out because of abuse she may qualify under the Mckinney Vento act for extra services. These include allowing her to finish school at her current high school even if she needs to move out of district to stay with friends. She should talk to her school guidance counselor.
If she is still in school that may create challenges as she will at a minimum need to stay within the same school district and graduate. If you and/or your parents are willing to house her a judge should find that acceptable as she is no longer a minor and can make her own decisions.
As always, get all documents in order and in her possession. Most important are drivers license or state ID, Social Security card and if possible an original birth certificate.
The day she turns 18, she goes to a new bank completely unaffiliated with her parents and opens a new checking and savings account. If she has any money at an old banking institution next she goes and removes it all, then returns to the new one and deposits the funds.
