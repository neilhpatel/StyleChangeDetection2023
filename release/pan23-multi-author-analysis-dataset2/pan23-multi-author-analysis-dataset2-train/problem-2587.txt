You need to file for divorce and custody. Then you have a court order regarding the house and the children.
You can rent a place if you want to. He can stop paying the mortgage if he wants to. Foreclosures take a lot of time right now. You may be able to get into divorce court first.
If you are still married, you can simply take the children and go. The reverse is also true. This is why you need your own attorney. Donâ€™t take any advice from your husband. Find someone who is completely on your side.
First thing first, you need to get to a safe place. Lawyers and legal stuff can come after you are away. Depending on the area (northern cities is the Refuge/Family Pathways and I know there is a large group out of Duluth) you need to call a shelter and ask for assistance. The most dangerous time for any victim of abuse is when they leave. They have resources to get you the help you need. Take and hide important paperwork such as birth certificates, social security cards and photos in a safe, far away location before you leave.
