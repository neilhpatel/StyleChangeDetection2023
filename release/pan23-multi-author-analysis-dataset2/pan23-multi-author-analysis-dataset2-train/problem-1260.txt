This person was not fucking with you, Belgium is like this with language accommodations. I lived in a commune that had to completely redo an election because, to accommodate the large Anglophone minority, they put on the ballot the names of the offices being voted for in English (along with the other official languages). Every Belgian has to vote in every election, so that means the Flemish state made every person in the commune come back in and vote again because the commune made accommodations for English-speakers.
If your workers aren't technically residents of the property (and thus don't have renter's rights to water that might get an emergency request through the administration) you are probably out of luck. I'd highly recommend making sure someone who speaks the local language is around to check mail and talk to officials in he future.
Well, people in government institutions are only allowed to help people in one (or two) specific languages. Depending on de region in Belgium that would be either Dutch, French, Dutch and French, or German.
Am from Belgium am not completely understanding all of your post. From my experience, water and government are not related? (as in water providers) You can choose any water company and neither are related to "the government".
That story about me going to a government institution is a separate thing that happened, I just wanted to share that moment because to me it's ridiculous that an employee there isn't allowed to speak english.
So I might be missing something in your post, or might be the language barrier, or might be I'm just misinterpretting something, or I'm just dumb, don't know. Either way, I was raised speaking French and Dutch so if you need help translating anything in those languages, I can help. My German is basic at best though.
