Because COVID is not an ADA issue. No federal law prohibits employers from asking employees why they are out sick, if they are getting vaccines, taking vitamins, etc. They are free to ask questions such as how you are feeling, if you went to the doctor, when you expect to return to work. They may also require you to provide proof of sickness or vaccination. However, if you have a condition that is protected by the ADA, then your employer may only ask questions related to your ability to do your job.
Do you have a contract that requires you to give notice of any number of days? Because barring that, your employers is entitled to say “sorry we no longer need you “ as soon as you hand in your notice. Or at any point afterwards.
So you quit. And then after you quit (and said, "I quit, but let me work until Friday" and they said "okay for now") someone asked you why you didn't go to their clinic (which isn't a banned question) you talked with HR, and then they terminated you a day early, is that what happened?
You were wrong that it was an EEOC violation and I suspect your previous employer decided you were too high maintenance. And thus decided they didn’t need you to work out your notice.
