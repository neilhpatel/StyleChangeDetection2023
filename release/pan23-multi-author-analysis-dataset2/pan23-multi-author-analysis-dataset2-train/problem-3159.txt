Why do they think this will frighten us? It will harden our resolve to remove them as a threat. Remove their wartoys, push them back into their own country, block trade that will allow them to do this again.
Yes, cause we can understand why the meat/milk/egg industry are doing it. We might not agree with it or support it, but we can rationally understand it.
What do you think they do when it's not financially worth it to raise males? What do you think they do when they can no longer get enough milk from the mom's, which is at 1/4-1/5 of their natural lifespans?
Calves are separated from their mothers very soon after they are born, and quarantined in small cages so they can’t walk, which tenderizes their meat when they are killed very early in their lives, sometimes only a few days to a few months. Their meat is what’s colloquially called “veal”.
My point was that a lot of people get strong feelings about animals being killed arbitrarily, and at the same time pay people to have thousands of animals killed.
