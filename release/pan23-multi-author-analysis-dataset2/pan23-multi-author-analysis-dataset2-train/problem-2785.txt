It's going to be a long fight, but if we can make it through the next few elections republicans are going to be fucked by banking on the strategy that millennials will naturally get conservative as they get older. I'm an older millennial with a good job and a house, and have gotten nothing but more liberal as I grow older. Millennials should have already shifted to being more conservative if we followed the same pattern as our parents. The world is different than it was in the 70s and 80s and republicans have spent the last decade doing nothing but attack education and cry over children's books. They offer me nothing but tax breaks, which isn't going to be enough. I would happily pay double the taxes if we started aggressively fighting climate change and helping the poor. Here's to hoping the fuck you got mine attitude does with baby boomers.
