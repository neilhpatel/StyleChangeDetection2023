You should be able to request a copy of your BC from the county of your birth. Start there, give them a call.
You might contact the county clerk in your birth county, and ask what online notaries they accept. You may be able to get a CA Online Notary to meet with you on video with a family member.
>You must complete the online authentication or send in the notarized Certificate of Identity. Please be sure to follow the instructions on the VitalChek site. If you do not live in California please have the notary strike out "California" on the Certificate of Identity and put the state in which the form is notarized. It will be accepted with the change.
It was lost, but already expired as of last year. I have given them a call, but all attempts to request it forces me to notarize it, which they say they cannot help with. Is Vitalchek the ones who handle these claims because I've only been directed to them who demand a notary.
I cannot get my file notarized by anyone without any form of identification. I've already attempted this twice, and both times required a notarization. All offices who handle them, including my own bank, reject me because I lack my ID or SSN card.
I think the easiest place to start might be an Illinois state ID card. (I'm assuming your lost ID was from California and this would be your first ID in Illinois.).
