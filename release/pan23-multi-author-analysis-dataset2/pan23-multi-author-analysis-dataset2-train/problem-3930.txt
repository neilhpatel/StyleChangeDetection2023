I saved a pdf of this when I did it, but I had to factory reset my computer because of some software issues I was having a while back. I forgot I had them on there, and I assumed I would be able to get them back if I ever needed it. My fault for assuming, and it’ll definitely be a learning moment for me.
I started doing that, but creating an account took forever. So I just found my paystub from December 2019, and used the info from there.
I hate to be that guy, but start storing important documents in at least one cloud storage service, if not two. You can get free accounts with Microsoft and Google, but there's plenty of them.
Yeah I have a Google drive, and I pay for extra storage in iCloud Drive. I’ll be doing that for sure going forward. It’s definitely a mistake I won’t be making again. What makes this an even dumber mistake on my part is that I’ve been doing tech support for 8 years, and I give that same advice to people I talk to.
They don't have to make past forms available for you in perpetuity for free. It's legal for them to charge to access them.
Being your info, you're free to print out copies of all of them and not rely on a company to provide them for you.
Thanks for your answer. I guess it wouldn’t be worth calling my AG then since it’s perfectly legal. I do have to say that this bullshit shouldn’t be legal. This is my personal tax information that I should have free access to. But my opinions don’t matter in this situation, and the law doesn’t care about how I feel things should be done.
