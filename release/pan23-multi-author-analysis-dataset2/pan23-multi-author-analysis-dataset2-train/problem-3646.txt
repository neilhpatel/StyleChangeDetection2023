Obviously the Ukrainians would also like American M1A1 tanks as well, which the US has been reluctant to provide, but they at least have a more reasonable explanation: there is no good infrastructure to maintain them, supply parts and repair them easily in Europe — which there is in abundance for the Leopards — and, from a cost and logistics perspective for Ukraine, it would be much better for them to work with a single main platform rather than a patchwork of Abrams, Challengers and Leopards.
They just want that all of NATO pulls on this together and the decision to send MBTs to Ukraine is carried out by all the big NATO states.
Yes call them „cowards“ or what you want but you won’t get Germany to get into Wehrmacht-Mode or anything that resembles any kind of leading military power or supplier anymore. Sorry to say but these times are over. At least for the next years to decades.
same thing with US equipment. its standard. the south korean stuff is different because poland is paying for tech transfer. so there is nothing stopping poland sending their k2s.
