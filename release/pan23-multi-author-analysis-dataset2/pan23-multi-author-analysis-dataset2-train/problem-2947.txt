Fucking finally, although this is just temporary and Orban will get another chance to meet the requirements and unblock the funds (likely in several installments).
Wonder if they can take a portion of the blocked funds and do an investigation as to how the voting is manipulated by Russia/China to favor Orban as a blueprint to be repeated in other Western elections.
This is especially sweet to me, because you are our neighbors and what our government is doing to help russia is despicable. I visited Ukraine many years ago and I have great memories from there. I hope I'll be able to go back again soon.
I live in Hungary and it isn't a secret. The government controls all TV stations and media. Imagine if Republicans controlled all English language TV stations, newspapers, and advertisements.
I often bring up the current Republican party (as distinct from the one before they went full traitor mode) as an example of this because I believe they are trying to build the exact same stratified reality distortion field using the exact same source material. The only difference is they don't have supermajority powers to legislate other media out of existence like they did here in .hu. But they are really trying to pull down every other media outlet to their level instead, and have already succeeded making "choose your own reality" the accepted norm. I never would have thought they could get so far in the USA.
