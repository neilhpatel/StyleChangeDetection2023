That happened here in Canada with our school support staff (everyone but the teachers), they went on strike and the government legislated them back to work using some law to force a deal and limits wage increases. The union told them to get bent and said they are striking anyways even if they faced fines. Other unions across the country stood up and supported them and the government ended up having to walk back the deal that they forced through. I mean what was the government going to do fine and arrest 50k workers ? The power is with the people we just need to start realizing it.
Wow. So if you strike for 10 days, you’re not getting paid that year. Why go back to work, then? Seems counterintuitive on the government’s part if they’re trying to get workers back in their jobs.
Well technically they could quit the job and not be fined. However that means the company can replace the "lost" worker. The idea is to basically say: either quit or work because we are saying striking for this particular reason is "illegal".
Assuming they could collect, where was that money even supposed to go. It sure as hell wasn't going to be a rebate to the taxpayers that were afaffected by the strike.
