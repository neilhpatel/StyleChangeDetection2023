A 3rd party being present during the search generally doesn't mean the evidence is inadmissible, but you would need to go over the specifics with an attorney.
I talked to 3 attorneys while in jail they were bums and were just chasing pleas. Just bailed out now I can start to press. Seeing if someone ever heard a similar case. I’m sure more than 1 state would turn federal.
There’s zero basis for your belief that more than one state would “turn federal,” and even if the US Attorney prosecuted you, the states could also prosecute you without running afoul of double jeopardy concerns.
Now, as to your chain of custody ideas... the defense could certainly argue for planted or mishandled evidence. But the mere presence of another jurisdiction’s police officer would not vitiate the required chain of custody procedural steps.
In other words, it’s perfectly legal to have fifty detectives from fifty states visit a crime scene. You’re free to try to convince a jury that one of them did something wrong. But there’s no automatic disqualification.
