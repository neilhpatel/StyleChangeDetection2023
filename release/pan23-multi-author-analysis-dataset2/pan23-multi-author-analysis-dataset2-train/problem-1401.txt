This isn't a debate club, kid. At least here most of us can live without being murdered any where near as much. I've seen what queer qataris who are victims of acid attacks look like in person. I've seen a queer Saudi whose fingers were cut off. I've seen a gay ugandan who barely escaped being burned alive and has burn scars over thirty percent of thier body, and a Russian lesbian who was raped so violently for being a lesbian that her uterus had prolapsed and she will now never be able to have kids and has constant uterine pain for the rest of her life. I've seen things that honestly make me nearly, nearly hate straight people as a group. You have no damn clue what your talking about.
FIFA: "They're is no possible way we could have foreseen this, nor was there any point we could have stopped it from happening. So, we should just try to enjoy the games.".
If we hear a shocking thing for 6 years, and cease to be shocked by it, that's "shifting the overton window." What part was unclear? The activity didn't change, only your perception of it changed.
