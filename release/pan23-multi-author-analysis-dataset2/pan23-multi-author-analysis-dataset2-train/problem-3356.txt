They also have all the sets, curtains, designs, etc. Makes it cheaper and easier to do than trying to do something new and needing to source and spend the money to buy or rent everything to put on the show.
My understanding is the Nutcracker is the only profitable show of the year. Every other show is there because of “generous donations from people like you”. The Nutcracker will run every year forever.
The AKM and its variants are still widely used, although they are starting to age out. The Russians dumped a ton of Ak-74s on the market in the early 2000s, though.
Ukrainian leadership also runs around like a bunch of Don Quixote always trying to make everything about them, it's exhausting. It's like if you give a mouse a cookie they always want one more thing, but not everything revolves around you, Ukraine. We are giving you people billions in arms deals already, maybe pick your battles and don't pick stupid ones like ballet?
Yeah, we have one higher quality company at my venue that does a pretty traditional nutcracker with a full orchestra that flies in a couple of people every year to play the leads. The other company does a bastardized version of the show with one and half casts that do all the parts. With main goal being to squeeze as many kids as possible onto the stage. And they just dance to a track.
