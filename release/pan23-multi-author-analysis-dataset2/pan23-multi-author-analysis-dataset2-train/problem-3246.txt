eta after skimming this the only relevant portion is that you tried to pay to have your license reinstated, the MVD seemingly failed to inform you of what needed to be done to successfully complete the process, and this caused your license to be revoked. Which resulted in your vehicle being impounded and fees you cannot afford. When you edit your post, please focus on concisely discussing this issue. It's not clear to me at this time that the MVD had an obligation to break the process down for you, but I'll try to read up on it.
So the only important information I read was that the MVD failed to have you fill out a packet when you first got your license back which caused you to get pulled over and have your license revoked. Then you didnâ€™t want to fill out the packet and wait 45 days to get your license back. Is that correct?
Whoops. Your post contains 2 formatting issues that makes your narrative impossible to follow. I initially tried to help by copying and pasting one such section to a comment, but that section in itself was super long and so is the other one. You need to trim this way down.
Ok thank you. It's hard to write about this because there is so much info and a lot of it is emotional as hell. I'm manic as hell and unfortunately I write how I talk and it's all hard to follow. I'm trying to cram way to much into something people will actually read and it's difficult for me. Thank you for your advice.
