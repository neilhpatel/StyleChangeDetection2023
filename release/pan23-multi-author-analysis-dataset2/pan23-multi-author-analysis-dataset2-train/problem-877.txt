Pete being a stooge who will not go against the profit interests of rail is not an unpopular opinion on here, but if you think republicans want regulations on rail out of this or any other meaningful solution you’re out of your mind. The GOP will be very careful how they criticize this and will never bring up the corporate shortcutting regulation, safety protocols and staffing for profits. The GOP wants to attack the Biden admin but actually do support the inaction taking place so they need to make it about something else. Charlie Kirk claimed it’s about Democrats disdain and disregard for the white working class for example. Incredibly stupid thinking even for him, but he can’t say “Biden busted a union that warned about this and his SoT will not take any action that undermines rails operation making as much profit as possible.” That’s the actual criticism, but the GOP fundamentally agrees with those decisions.
By voting for politicians who support removing regulations and gutting worker protections that are meant to prevent this kind of thing from happening.
