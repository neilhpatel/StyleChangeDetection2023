Then Quebec had the non-violent Quiet Revolution which drastically transformed their society. Then they had wannabe violent revolutionaries in the form independence terrorist groups like the FLQ. They bombed stuff and famously did some murder/kidnapping.
Also the North-West Rebellion. Louis Rielz Gabriel Dumont and and their lot were revolutionaries, though they were of the religious variety. That was after Confederation and fought against the Canadian federal government lead by John A. Macdonald. They lost but there briefly an independent MÃ©tis-run Provisional Government of Saskatchewan.
Yea Canada has something called the notwithstanding clause in our charter of rights and freedoms. It basically allows the government to "legally" infringe on our rights and freedoms for a 5 year period. This clause only applies to specific bills (except for Quebec in the 80s).
