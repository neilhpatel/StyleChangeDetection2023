That said, if he does send you real court papers (they'll come either by a process server, or registered mail) don't ignore them. If you're a renter and have some renter's insurance, you might have some liability coverage there (might being the operative word), so call your insurance company. Otherwise, you might need to pay to consult a solicitor and work out how to deal with this. If he files in small claims court, he's not getting costs and all you need to do is explain the situation to the magistrate presiding. It really is a lot like Judge Judy - the person with the most plausible story and who is most respectful to the magistrate wins. Tell the truth, don't embellish, but do print out the price of a brand new power washer from Bunnings - make sure it is the same make and model (or updated model) as the washer you borrowed.
If he filed a lawsuit and was awarded a judgment because he proved you destroyed it, he'd almost certainly only be awarded monetary damages for its depreciated value (replacement cost of a similar pressure cleaner of similar age in the condition it was in when he gave it to you to use). But there doesn't seem to be evidence you caused the fuel leak and you didn't state that he said there was additional damage he believes you caused. So if you had evidence he told you to continue using it and that he waited 4 months to tell you about additional damage you'd likely prevail in a lawsuit (in the US).
