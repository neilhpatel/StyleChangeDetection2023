As a note, they can also prevent registration for future classes, as well as put a hold on your transcript in case you think you can just transfer to another university to avoid things.
I should have added this in the original, but my car is not registered to the university. If that changes anything. I think I’m going to pay the tickets though. It’s just a bonafide grift.
How is disobeying parking laws a grift? It's literally written down in the code of laws (and likely on the signs around the parking spaces) what you need to do to not get a ticket.
The law isn't meant to be fun. It's meant to be followed. If you have issues with your school about their parking policies, take it up with them or go to a school that has parking more to your liking. It's an issue irrelevant to what the laws are. It's a bright line, if you violate them, you're guilty of violating them, regardless of the reason why.
Wow, you’re a lot of fun. I pay $25k a year in tuition. There is no cheap place to park on campus for my 1 hour class once a week (my only in person class). I live off campus—a 45 minute walk from the class building. My only options are to pay $500 for a parking pass, which I would use for 12 hours throughout the semester. Or to get mammoth parking tickets. My Uni has lots of ways to make students pay exorbitantly for being a student. Sounds like a grift to me.
