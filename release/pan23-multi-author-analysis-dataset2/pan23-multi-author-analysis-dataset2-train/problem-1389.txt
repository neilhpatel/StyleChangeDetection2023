Are you a Canadian Citizen? Is there anything in writing that would suggest you married him to help him in the immigration process?
Find a family lawyer (if you are low income google low income family lawyer Ontario or something like that). Don’t tell him.
Thanks a lot for the advice. I am thinking of getting a restraining order because now he randomly shows up to my work and stalks me, or stays for hours outside my house in his car. He gives me really evil looks and I honestly get scared.
If he is threatening your physical well-being call the police. Do not wait for it to escalate further.
Yes, I am. There isn't written proof that he asked me to help him with immigration. I tried calling immigration to say that it was a marriage of convenience, and they said they can't help with that.
I’m surprised immigration dismissed you. It’s fraud. Try calling again and get someone more receptive.
Definitely call the police non-emergency number and file a report. File a report for every incident going forward. Get the paper trail started. It’s not so easy to get a restraining order.
If you have been using the phrase "marriage of convenience" that may not be helping you. Generally I have heard that phrase used when two people mutually agree to get married for a reason other than romantic love. You were manipulated and defrauded into marrying this man. He committed fraud against you and the government.
