A third possibility is that there are more submissions/comments being made, as the subscriber base grows. This would necessarily result in more deleted posts and comments, simply by volume, without indicating either a decline in quality or an increase in moderator zeal.
Never forget, if you think you have a good topic you could make a well informed, detailed post on, never hesitate to put something up in the Saturday Showcase or Friday Free For All! Not to mention I hear through the nerd vine that it's always possible to arrange to have remarkably helpful questions put up on a topic near and dear to you...
This is a good insight, and one I was thinking about too. I figured it would be a reason why discourse has gone down, though, rather than a third, entirely separate thing, but I recognize now that that doesn't necessarily follow - the quality of the discourse can remain the same, but increased discourse means increased moderation as a result. Thank you for that, I appreciate the insight.
I keep waiting for my chance to post a good response, but so far nothing has fallen comfortably within my wheelhouse. I'm patient, I'm sure my moment will come.
Of course, this method assumes that the level of moderation has remained constant over the years, something which is obviously up for debate. But this gives us a nice ballpark, assuming the moderation has not become vastly stricter over the years.
Perhaps someone can do an analysis on the change in the percentage of comments removed over the years, to get an idea of whether discourse levels have really fallen.
You seem to be arguing a point that I'm not making. I have no issues with the moderation policies, or enforcement - I'm looking to get insight into the delta between deletion rates today and a few years ago.
