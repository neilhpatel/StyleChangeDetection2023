You should speak with a lawyer immediately about your next course of action and how best to protect your children. Step-parent adoption and your daughter walking with her class at graduation are the least of your concerns right now. She and you are taking a great risk by cooperating with the police without the assistance of counsel. During the course of their investigation, the police may mislead you about whether they see your daughter as an unwilling bystander or an active participant. A no-contact order won't prevent your daughter from having to testify if she is subpoenaed.
It's always best to have a family attorney if you can swing it. You could file for the emergency orders without one ideally with the help of legal aid/law school/DV shelter. Looking into adoption will definitely require a lawyer but you're putting the cart way before the horse with that one, that's going to be in the timeframe of years. You should probably delete this post if there's a safety concern as this is a pretty popular subreddit.
My ex doesn’t use Reddit. And not a lot of people know it was him who did it as the news stations haven’t released the names involved. Why is putting the adoption first bad? I’m just asking? My daughter is 18 in less then 6 months.
I’m so sorry this happened to your daughter. You need to file for a restraining order immediately. Right now you need to focus on keeping your family safe from the ex and worry about terminating his parental rights once he’s captured.
