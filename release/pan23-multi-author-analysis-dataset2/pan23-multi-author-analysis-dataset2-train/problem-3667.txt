Amid the wreckage of Republican hopes for a sweeping midterm victory, party activists are looking to cast blame, and the former president will likely receive much of it — for good reasons.
WASHINGTON — There’s a lot we don’t yet know about the midterm election results, but one outcome is clear: Donald Trump‘s road back to the White House just got much steeper.
Two candidates whom Trump hand-picked for Senate races — Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Herschel Walker in Georgia — lost or trail in states where Republicans had high hopes of winning. The Trump-endorsed Blake Masters in Arizona is also badly behind. Their failures may hand Democrats another two years of control of the Senate, although the final outcome may not be known until December, when Georgia’s race will be resolved in a runoff.
