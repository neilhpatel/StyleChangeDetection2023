Nah yo, I’ll upvote that. That’s one of my biggest beefs with Democrats: this idea that if Hillary won, things would be better. The major outlines of our corporate ruled lives wouldn’t really have changed at all. Wall Street favored her for a reason. And she was a big fan of the surveillance state that Obama expanded rather than contracted, to say nothing of her position regarding interference in the Middle East. Sure, the Supreme Court would look different but what does that get us in the end? Still the same corporate rule, BUT NOW WITH ABORTION! It’s all in service of placating the oligarchs we’ve allowed to control every aspect of our lives.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
