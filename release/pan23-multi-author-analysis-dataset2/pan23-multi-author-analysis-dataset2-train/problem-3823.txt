Med mal can be a very complicated area of law. Most, if not all, personal injury attorneys will offer a free consultation and will only get paid if you get a judgment or settlement. Therefore, you donâ€™t have anything to lose by consulting a local attorney. As far as self help goes, you may look into his licensing credentials and make a complaint if warranted.
i want you to be prepared to be turned down at medmal offices. It's really a dying practice here in Texas due to the caps placed on damages. You may need to consult multiple firms. Even if you don't end up with a viable medmal claim, i wish you good luck on getting help.
Save all your records as well. If you don't have a copy of the MRI they did at the ER, get that as well and the radiologists impression.
Not sure if you're commenting on his specific situation (lack of insurance, vague diagnosis), in which case you may be right, or general practice, in which case I'll have to disagree. As a neuroradiologist I read spine MRI from the ED all the time. Ordering practices vary though, and perhaps you are more prudent than some.
