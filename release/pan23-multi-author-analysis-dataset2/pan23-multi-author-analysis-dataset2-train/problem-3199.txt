I doubt any amount of talking will ever satisfy SK, they really like beating them over the head with it. No reparations or apologies will every be enough, and both have happened. It's kind of like a trump card they like to play when it's convenient.
Nah, even when confronted with proof they still try to justify and coverup their war crimes. They go so far as to go after other countries for putting up monuments to the victims of their atrocities. Just last summer they did it to Germany over a memorial for the "comfort girls" that were enslaved and raped to death by the Japanese military.
Japan could get the war criminals out of Yasukuni, dismantle and rededicate it though. It would be pretty easy to do that and it would make it a lot harder for SK to hit them with the albatross attack every time they think they're losing an argument.
The main issue is Japan has its own MAGA movement, the Ultranationalists, who are just as insane and have been for decades. They hold a little too much sway in the LDP and it will probably be another 20 years before we even get close to that happening.
Don't really see the current Japanese populace at large trying to seize Korea or mainland China. Even the Kuril Islands dispute is mostly right wing populists.
I'm not aware of specifics in Asian/Pacific ocean region though, other than Japan being on the wrong side - hence the question.
