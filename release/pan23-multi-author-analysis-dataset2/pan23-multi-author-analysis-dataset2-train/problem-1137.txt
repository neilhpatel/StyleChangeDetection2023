The only part of the rifle that would need to have a serial is the lower receiver. This is a <$100 part from most online stores and he could have it shipped to an FFL to have a by the book rifle. Everything else on the rifle is not tracked and doesnâ€™t need to be replaced.
Now he has a gun thats transferable in another state or he can sell via consignment via an FFL holder.
The firearm should have had a serial number applied to legally transfer it from the original maker. The "gift" was an illegal transfer.
This is the correct answer. He should take it to a gun shop and have the non-serialized lower receiver replaced with a serialized receiver. The gun shop should destroy the unmarked receiver or hand it over to any local LEA.
The ATF has guidelines to add a serial for the legal transfer of a home manufactured firearms though.
NAL but ran a class 3 FFL for 8 years and am pretty well versed in both my state (MN) and federal laws.
Edit: to answer the actual question, just send it to a licensed gunsmith and they are able to serialize it. Then he can legally sell it. Or, as others suggested, buy a new receiver and swap the parts, it would be cheaper than having it engraved with a new serial number. He would then have to destroy the non serialized receiver using guidelines below because a receiver is still a firearm even if it is not built.
One thing to add to this is that CA requires home manufactured firearms to have a serial number. - PDF.
One word. "untraceable". I wouldn't worry, I'm only answering OP because "his friend" wants to go by the books.
Full disclosure, I've personally sold 2 firearms I made without serializing them. But I know the people who I sold to have permits to carry and pass background checks.
The gun is no longer in CA, of course, but it could be an issue if the origin of the rifle comes up.
No state that I know of requires serials on pre 68 guns with no serial number. They are federally exempt as far as I know.
