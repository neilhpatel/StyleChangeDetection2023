Most drones, made by any manufacturer, use parts made in dozens of countries. The drones that have been attacking Ukraine lately even have a few Ukrainian-made components in hem.
Fuck, it's the same situation with Bayraktar drones. I hope Canada will take no shit from Iran since Bayraktar retroffited their drones really quick. You don't fuck with Canada.
Why the fuck does any county ship anything to Iran? They should be on the shun list like Russia. Yeah I get how world economics works. It just shouldnâ€™t be that way.
How can you compare Iran to Israel? Fucking ridiculous comparison before the protests considering half of the terrorists in the middle east are funded by Iran. But now that they are openly executing their population for fucking hijabs?
Children who would not be in harm's way, throwing molotovs and stabbing, if there wasn't absurd terror funding from Iran and Qatar. Contrary to popular belief Jews don't like to kill children. Now after 100 years of terror Israel is becoming a far right shithole. It's pretty insane to say Israel is just as bad when the whole fucking martyrdom movement is funded by Iran and co.
