2. I'm not sure what the officer was implying when he suggested you "fight it". "Not Guilty will require you to provide a counter to the officer providing proof of your speed. Unless you have that, I don't know how you would "fight it". You can't go up and state Not Guilty and shrug when the judge gives you the chance to challenge the officer's proof.
You can ask the judge to reduce it to a non moving violation and see if he goes for it. It’s like a parking ticket that won’t effect your insurance. They don’t have to do that, but with court costs and the fine it can be equivalent to the original fine and they’ll give you a break.
Most jurisdictions have mitigation options available for drivers with a clean record who did not annoy the cop. It sounds like your jurisdiction is one of those. You'll need to either find out the options in your local area (city-specific forums can be of use there), or show up and wing it on the appointed day, or pay a traffic lawyer to deal with all of it for you.
