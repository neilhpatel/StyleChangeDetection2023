Michigan still needs to do that part (Dems got a majority though so I doubt they drag their feet on rubber stamping it).
It goes into effect December 23, 45 days after election. Constitutional amendments in Michigan can be passed by citizen initiative, the legislature is not required.
But also, if fetuses are people then why don’t they get citizenship rights when they’re conceived in the US instead of at birth? Why don’t pregnant mothers get child tax breaks? Why aren’t fetuses counted in the census? Seems like the law doesn’t exactly regard them as people either.
Viability takes quite a bit longer than the “first couple weeks” of a pregnancy. Before Roe was overturned in the US, viability was where the law drew the line nationwide.
Before fetal viability it’s really just a clump of cells, it’s a glorified tumor. After fetal viability it was never really legal to abort anyways, and I think most people would agree with that approach.
Mate they’re never going to limit abortions to just the first few weeks which is the only period you could legitimately call it a clump of cells. This sort of stuff always pushed later and later meanwhile actual fetal viability gets earlier and earlier as medical tech improves. As for legal classifications that’s a bad faith argument, there’s always stuff you can do at some ages and not others. Why can 18 year olds vote and buy guns but not drink alcohol etc. it’s not a proof of anything.
