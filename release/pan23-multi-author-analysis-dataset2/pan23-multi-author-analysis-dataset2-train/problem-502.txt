Your desperation to believe these objects are extraterrestrial is why the terminology was changed from UFO to UAP recently, as also quoted in your article:
Thus couple that with law makers doing the same on capitol hill then it's not outside the realm in which republicans want to look into defense aka Lockheed martin and Raytheon.
Which leads to the fact that these "objects" can stay afloat with out any visible means of known physics and are maneuverable, which means they're advance tech and "alien" to us.
‘UFO’ does not mean ‘alien’. Yes, there are national security issues here that must be assessed, but it’s irrational to leap to ‘advanced alien technology not in US possession’.
That’s not at all what’s being implied here. All they’re saying is they either don’t know yet or aren’t ready to share exactly what they are.
