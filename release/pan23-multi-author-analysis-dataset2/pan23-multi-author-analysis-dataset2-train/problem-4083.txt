While itâ€™s easy to understand the thinking behind student loan forgiveness, the reality is that even Biden has the legal authority to cancel it by executive order.
And yet followed her statement from over the summer, so this article OP shared, while new, is actually relying on an outdated statement from Pelosi thatâ€™s since been retracted by her. Even in the linked article Republicans are insisting she act on her uninformed (and incorrect) legal opinionâ€¦.while completely ignoring the actual law - that sounds familiar ðŸ¤”.
And if this were actually the case then the first lawsuit would have been filed with legal standing - that is clearly not the case.
Of course she walked it back. Itâ€™s politically impossible for Pelosi to say now that Biden lacks the power without destroying any remaining chance it has of being upheld by the courts. The fact that itâ€™s been blocked by multiple courts is further evidence that it relies on novel legal arguments that are anything but a sure thing to be permitted by the courts. That being said, itâ€™s not impossible. Our Supreme Court allowed the wall to be funded by executive order with even less legal basis, but of course, thatâ€™s a Republican priorityâ€¦.
