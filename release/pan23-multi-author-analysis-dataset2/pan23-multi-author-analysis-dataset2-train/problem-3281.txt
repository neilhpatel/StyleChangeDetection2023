Very interesting. Thanks for the reply! Might I ask, does EEO not apply only for unpaid internships or is it the same story for paid ones as well? I'm not very educated in really anything dealing with legality in employment and am simply curious.
This is an interesting question. In most of the country this would be legal, and it's legal federally, the EEOC wouldn't get involved. But in California there's :
I'm surprised it would be legal in most of the country. I would have thought that the EEOC at the very least would be interested in a job advertisement that specifically excludes certain protected characteristics.
I'm assuming this internship is paid since the ad doesn't specify unpaid interns. If so, it seems that according to the 2011 guidance from the EEOC this internship may very well be covered, but I don't think we have enough info to say for sure.
One might imagine a large company would have its attorneys figure out why 12940 does not apply to them in this situation.
The DOL has a very flexible seven-part test. Basically if the "primary beneficiary" of the internship is the intern, they are not considered an employee under the FLSA. In California, Niemann v. The Getty put 12940 to the test.
