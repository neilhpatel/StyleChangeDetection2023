I think it'd be more accurate, but still unduly charitable, to say that they view it as saving other kids from those evil woke trans kids who might have the wrong genitals in the bathroom or possibly win a sports medal... oh, and.. collapse all of western society by breaking gender norms.
I would definitely say that is a more charitable way of describing it having grown up five miles outside of a town of a thousand and being forbidden from playing with the only kid for miles my age because they were queer.
Honestly, it's still saddens me because we had a lot of similar interests and I was homeschooled in a family of five and could have used some time away from my siblings.
I guess what I'm saying is that this is the way that they perceive themselves and they don't care who they harm in in their self-righteous crusade.
I get that it's necessary to keep making new humans, but the extent to which they fetishize it is really bizarre.
Sex cult. They focus on sex more than my heathen friends and myself! I don't think about everyone else's sex and sexual activities. Weirdos and perverts is what they are. My gay bil and his husband are a million times safer to watch my kids than the Duggar like families.
I've only seen clips of the Duggars because of news events they have found themselves in. I have not searched out much more because it hits too close to home.
