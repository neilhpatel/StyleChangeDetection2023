If your lease doesn't say what happens if the property is sold, then generally, the new owners of the house inherit your lease and tenancy.
If you're willing to be out by October 30th, you're welcome to negotiate with your landlord on what that might look like -- getting your moving costs covered, maybe your first month's rent at a new place, etc. Otherwise, and unless your lease states otherwise, your lease is presumably valid for that property until March.
That is what I told my landlord but she advertised the house as a house with no tenants and it was sold so I don't know what to do.
:Edit the new owners don't know about my lease or that I have a right to live hear till march and the bought the house.
It sounds like the former owner might have failed to disclose material facts about the property and its inhabitants, and the new owners are in for a surprise.
Just to be clear: you have a standard, run-of-the-mill, fixed-term lease, entitling you to the entire property, that runs through March 2022?
