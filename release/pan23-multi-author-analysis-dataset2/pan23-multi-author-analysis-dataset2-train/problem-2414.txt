Like many of the other states that legalized cannabis early for medical and recreational use, California has almost no employee protections for cannabis users. The Ross v. Ragingwire decision from 2008 or so is still the guiding law in California, and like Washinon and Colorado, it doesn't even protect medical users who test positive for THC.
The policy text you posted does take pains not to specify cannabis or alcohol or distinguish them from street drugs or prescription drugs. But I think it's very clear that cannabis is included under the category of "intoxicating substances" regardless of its legality.
My reading of the policy is that it prohibits you from being intoxicated by cannabis while at work, but not from using cannabis while offsite and off the clock.
If you were a heavy cannabis user for whom a THC metabolite blood test would show "excessive amounts of otherwise lawful controlled substance", that could result in discipline or dismissal. Such a policy and action would be consistent with California employment law.
The latest effort to protect cannabis users from employment discrimination is AB1256, which is still at the committee level as of the last legislative session.
IANAL, but to my untrained reading, this does not appear to restrict weed while off duty, just says that you can't get high/drunk/etc at work or while doing work but not onsite, you can't come to work high/drunk/etc, and you can't have illegal drugs in your system.
In a place where weed is recreationally legal, it's similar to alcohol; don't use it at work or come to work affected by it.
That would depend on how long the substance stays in your system. Effectively, if you maintain a standard work schedule, I do not see how you could consume any illegal substance without risking violation.
I read the policy as all “illegal drugs”. If weed is legal, it would be excluded from this policy unless so much was taken that it impairs the completion of job duties.
