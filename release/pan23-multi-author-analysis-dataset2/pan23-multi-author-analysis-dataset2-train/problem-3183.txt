Ehh, I would if some of those people didn't pay like crap. Seriously, I've discovered that the whole DOD Contractor making bank thing is a load of bull.
I am a DoD subcontractor (the contractor couldn't even be bothered to do their own job????) and I can absolutely attest that not all of us make bank. When people talk about the contractors raking it in, that's the uppermost echelons (CEOs, CFOs, board members, etc), not the whole companies.
The best part is when the subcontractor originally made the equipment as a replacement for a more expensive thing being used by another branch. Then the DoD chooses to "streamline" things, so rolls the maintenance contract for the original expensive thing in with the cheaper one.
So, not only is the subcontractor still working on the same equipment, but now there's multiple extra layers involved. Removing the cost advantage. Which is why the original 2nd project was created in the first place!
It is a very, very good strategy. The Finns have a huge reserve army, and have been stockpiling weapons since forever. Their assault rifle is a better version of the AK and fires the same round. Helsinki has serious civil defense bunkers. They have been planning for decades exactly how they are going to pop a can of whip-ass on Ivan.
The Finns have a plan for defending against Russia: a Finn hiding behind every tree and bush with a Valmet, a MANPAD and an antitank rocket (and now, likely, a drone).
I'm pretty sure even Putin isn't stupid enough to fuck with the Finns. Although, I was wrong about him invading Ukraine, so there's that.
