It's much more the latter. It maybe seems a bit weird, but this is the "official" way to do it. They can give a press conference or whatever to say they don't like what Iran is/was doing (which they did), but that is still them just talking to the world/press. It doesn't mean Iran "hears" it. So, they also formally summon the ambassador to complain directly to him. He represents his government, so this is one country delivering a formal complaint to the other country. Unlikely anything changes from it, but it does make it formal.
They know and that's not a reason to just ignore Iran. The ambassador gets summoned and has to explain why Iran is executing protestors. If the answers aren't satisfactory, the minister will probably mention possible sanctions (they are already working on some) and/or other consequences. The ambassador will then probably inform the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs or something.
Diplomacy requires talking to people you don't like or agree with. You'll only get further escalations when you stop doing that. The cold war would have been a lot warmer without diplomats talking to eachother.
Remember when the iranian nuke complex at Natanz was sabotaged with stuxnet virus? It was done by a dutch operative that worked inside the complex...
