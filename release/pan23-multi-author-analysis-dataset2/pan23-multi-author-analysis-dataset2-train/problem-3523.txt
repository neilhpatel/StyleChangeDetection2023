So not a lawyer first off but you will need to document that someone was moved in to the apartment on the 6th. Take pictures with time stamps. The apartment is already offering to prorated you back the money in rent for when the new tenant moves in so just document that it's already happened. Contact the landlord and let them know you are aware someone is already moved in to the apartment and will be expecting a prorated return of rent from the day the new tenant moved in. I would also give them a 24 hr notice that you will be turning off the water/ power that is in your name. Inform them you have documentation of when the new tenants moved in. Give them a chance to do right by you but don't push too hard because this sounds like an informal arrangement and you don't want to piss them off. Be polite but firm. Good luck.
If not, you may need to take the landlord small claims court. I need to double check Florida, but other jurisdictions allow punitive damages when landlords act in bad faith.
Ok so the landlord appears to have tried some bullshit, so what you want to do is document every single event (emails, create the timeline, state you showed up and did not have access, etc). This would be a material breach of your lease AND it shows the landlord is acting in bad faith.
You are entitled to a refund on rent. Request it. Once you list how the landlord fucked up, I don't suppose they will give you issues. They likely will pay you to shut up and leave.
