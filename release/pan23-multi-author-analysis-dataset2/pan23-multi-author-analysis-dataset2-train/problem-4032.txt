Credit Union employee here. Every endorsement is guaranteed by the presenting bank. Contact IRS. Make a claim of fraudulent endorsement. The bank will have the amount of the checks charged back to them. You will receive new checks. It will take a few months, but you will get your money back.
Does not matter. If the woman has an account there, the checks will be charged back to her account and the money taken from there. If she does not, the bank will be out the money. Most likely she forged your signature then signed it herself so it was cashed as a third party check. Also, take this man's story with a grain of salt. She may have taken it to a check cashing place, liquor store, Wal-Mart, etc to cash it so you do need to contact the IRS and get a police report.
I also keep in contact with this lady, we are kind of setting her up atm, we told her we want to give her a reward for helping her and shes kinda going with it. so well see if we get her arrested.

Note: Both of you should freeze your credit. Even if they aren't going to go after your ID, unfortunately there are scammers who will. A freeze will help protect you and is free. You can also do a freeze/unfreeze for free, so it is worthwhile.
