Is there supposed to be correlation to either of these and Roe? Dred Scott was a regression of constitutional precedent and federal/state law, which I assume is your point, but Brown v Board was also a regression of those things, overturning Plessy and banning segregation. Dred Scott took a lot of power from federal/state legislatures regarding slavery, while the overturning of Roe returned power to state/federal legislatures regarding abortion. I doubt the issue is technical given Plessy and Scott are fundamentally different cases, as one occurred prior to the 13th and 14th amendments. Iâ€™m definitely not getting it.
