Our intelligence department hacked the offices where Russian officers were managing "independent" hackers who were involving themselves with US elections, proving Russian interference.
Organize, protest, and most of all hold others responsible for the bullshit they spew forth (politicians) or try to get away with (cops murdering innocent civilians).
Yes and Russia made it impossible for a recovery crew to get to the aircraft for weeks. During that time the Russians looted all of the passengers/corpses of their cash, jewelry and passports.
For those wondering, yeah, MH17 caused a massive shift in how the Dutch saw Russia. The flight was from Amsterdam so it was a majority Dutch people, and Russia has done nothing but attempt to shift blame. I personally knew two people on the flight and me and everyone around me has been on the "Fuck Russia" train for a decade now.
As far as I understand Indonesia attempted to kick us out, but we stayed by means of terrible bloodshed. Only after pressure from the international community, especially the US, did we end our oppression in Indonesia.
I have never heard he didn't want to apologise because his parents live in Indonesia. That's very strange, especially considering he is apologising on the behalf of a country, not his personal or family actions.

We have a rather flat society, everyone gets heard, consensus and coalition are how our policy making process works.
It also helps that everyone has an opinion and is not afraid to vocalize it. And the moment you start talking drivel you are called out and shamed publicly, unlike in other countries where stupidly insane and just plain dumb leaders are more the norm.
You could start by not ignoring the things that are just plain right stupid, evil, racist, or geared towards excessive profits for the unchosen few.
