They may have a case. It's critical for you to have at least three backups at any given time of all work, and at least one being offsite (or in the cloud). "My hard drive crashed" might've been a lukewarm excuse in 1994 but in 2021 it is ice cold.
That said what you were contracted to do is important. Look at the language in your contract exactly. Perhaps it will protect you.
That's a problem for you. If you had a contract that did not involve stems, specifically excluded and only included a FINAL mix, then you'd be protected. Since stems are a universally normal and expected deliverable, without a contract a court could very easily find against you. If you have emails though that explicitly state the final mix only, that will be helpful.
This is so loose that if it were me I'd probably do this. I'd sent them all the materials I had, and then decide if paying out of pocket was a good business move or not. If they want you to pay for someone else to do it (you said they were not happy) then that's probably a non-starter.
Interesting I did not know that. If the session was done Jan 24th, 2020 is it not considered reasonable to expect that request to be made at an earlier date?
On second thought, that seems like it wouldn’t matter. A better question would be - if offered, would it make sense to agree to pay for the featured artist’s “fee” as compensation for the lost files, or simply let the legal side play out if it comes to that. The cost would be around $1500 including the cost of flying the artist to the studio I work out of.
The easiest thing to do would be to offer them a full refund, and then see if they in fact do sue you. They would have to sue you in your jurisdiction.
Thank you for the advice - I’ve offered reimbursement in full and will see what they say. My assumption is if it’s not agreed to then it will go to court in which case it would be ill advised to continue posting on this thread.
