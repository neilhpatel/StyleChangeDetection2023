IANAL but it's very likely that UOM would not be liable for weekly COVID tests and that requiring weekly tests would not qualify as discrimination. You have multiple choices: get the vaccine, exemption/frequent testing, or transfer schools.
Requiring someone who is not vaccinated to frequently demonstrate that they are not likely to spread an infectious disease is not discrimination.
There are plenty other vaccinations that are required for students to go to school, and yet students are not required to get tested for several diseases every week. Only covid-19. Overall there are many of these cases floating around that have higher numbers than covid in some states. Logically it doesn’t make sense. Legally I would hope that there is some type of protection for students so they don’t have to get milked an extra $100/ week on top of the very expensive tuition cost that doesn’t cover the weekly testing, because they believe something different than some other people.
That would be great, but for now those would seek the religious exemption, could either do the weekly testing (which I agree, is ungodly expensive) or transfer to another university. They could also challenge this rule in court. That would be an interesting case to see.
1. Right... but most of those diseases have been either nearly eradicated or they number of cases is too low to justify frequent testing. As for COVID-19, we're still in a pandemic, it is highly infectious, can be spread asymptomatically, and cases have been spiking in various states (and in particular, among those who have not been vaccinated).
Lots of places are starting to require vaccinations or mask wearing or frequent tests to ensure that the number of COVID-19 cases continues to go down so we can contain it.
