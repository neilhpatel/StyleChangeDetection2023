I can't find it right now, but just after the 2020 election, like, after it was called but even before Jan. 6th, somebody posted a very interesting comment on how some company that made voting machines that was owned by a very vocal right winger just happened to be the sole supplier of voting machines utilized by a number of states with GOP voting officials or State Legislatures that had races that conveniently just so happened to swing in favor of GOP candidates by margins that were again just so happened to be just large enough to rule out recounts or legal challenges, sometimes even going against all polling prior to election day, as if fully 20% of voters suddenly changed their minds, and always somehow in the GOPs favor.
So ideologically I'm not aligned with either party so traditionally I have no affiliation. However, I live in Florida which has closed primaries meaning I can only vote in my party's primary. My status prevented me from voting in those elections. I recently changed my registration to remedy that and therein lies the answer to your question.
