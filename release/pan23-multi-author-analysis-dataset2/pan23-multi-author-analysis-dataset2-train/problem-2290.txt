The first is "can the truck owner assault the bag owner for getting their bag out of the truck." The answer is almost assuredly no, but it also depends on how the bag owner is trying. If they're trying to do so by assaulting the truck owner, then yeah, the truck owner can use proportional force to defend self. (Or vice versa, although see the second part) But that isn't what happened here.
The second question is "can the bag owner reach in the truck to get their bag," and is more nuanced. Texas does in a strange roundabout manner allow for someone to retrieve their stolen property, but beyond saying that can be a thing that is legal sometimes, I cannot explain it since I do not know the law well at all. I don't do crim and I am not in Texas.
Lol... I know it's some low hanging fruit. But since the property was within someone else's truck, I wasn't sure if there was some hidden law jutsu that prevents the backpack owner from just opening a car door to pull their backpack out.
Did A call the police at the time of or shortly after the altercation? I ask, because practically speaking, something that happened even a few days ago becomes a lot less likely that LE will investigate or refer to the DA to determine if charges will be filed.
As an aside, you probably should spend a little bit of time taking inventory of your friends and determining if you wish to remain in the orbit of people who refuse to return property and slug another friend because they were bickering over what, without knowing a thing about it, am sure was not worth 2% of the drama it caused. It is exhausting to have to keep up with that sort of constant conflict and hassle.
Thanks for the detailed response. It's an odd situation, and I'm glad to not be either party in this. This was person B's attempt at defense in our friend group... So happy to hear it likely isn't going to hold water legally.
