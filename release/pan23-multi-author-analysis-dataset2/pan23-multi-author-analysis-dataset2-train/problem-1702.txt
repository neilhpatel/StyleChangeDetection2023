Essentially, yes. They didn't have authority equivalent to the King, but their organisation was independent of other branches of the government, reporting directly to the King. Therefore, no member of other branches of the government was above them in the chain of command, or had any authority over them. The investigating officers had access to the King himself, to prevent other officials from trying to block them.
This organisation was modelled on the Chinese Censorate, which was first established by the Qin Dynasty (the Qin were notoriously hardcore when it came to law and order, and applied this to their own government). The duties, power, and effectiveness of the Censorate varied over time, but their two main functions remained the same:
The Joseon Dynasty Korean Censorate (called Samsa in Korean, 三司 in hanja, 삼사 in hangul, meaning "The Three Offices") performed the same functions, and also played a stronger advisory role for the King, including educating the King in history and philosophy (i.e., Confucianism). The Korean Censorate had been established by the Koryo Dynasty, and the Joseon continued and strenhened it.
A modern parallel for the investigative role of the Chinese and Korean Censorates is the British , which investigates charges of police misconduct and corruption. As they say, "We are independent, and make our decisions entirely independently of the police and government". That independence is important for the performance of their duty.
Many thanks for the detailed reply! It's very interesting to see that they even provided education to the King himself. Though they were tasked with monitoring other officials for abuse of power, is it known if there were cases of abuse of power from within the 삼사? Sounds like this kind of power could easily go to people's head.
