Regarding civil options (recovery of damages), you can sue him for damages. Your damages seem tiny, though. You could potentially win for medical expenses (like any doctors' bills that resulted from the punch), or for damage to your property (such as if you needed to fix the scratch on your glasses). But if you don't go to the doctor and you keep using your glasses as is, I'd figure you'd be seeking something like $50.
If you think there's any chance you will actually want to pursue either of these options, you should preserve evidence. Get a copy of the security footage and save it (give police a copy if you report it to them). Get pictures of your bruises. Get pictures of your scratched lenses. That's useful information for both the police and for a potential civil lawsuit.
Also definitely don't do anything on the civil side without having a doctor check you out. You'll at least want to have a full picture of the extent of your injuries and how much they're worth.
It is not extortion, nor even borderline extortion, to notify somebody that you will be filing a lawsuit against them unless they pay for your damages. It is called a demand letter. Settling out of court can then also avoid the cost of filing fees should the defendant lose.
This is the entire quote from Dyvcast, not just the one sentence taken out of context, proving that the advice was to not ask for any compensation in exchange for (not) filing a police report:
>I hesitate to advise anyone to ask for compensation in exchange for filing the police report. That particular issue requires guidance from an attorney in your state and perhaps your local jurisdiction and perhaps securing representation to get specific advise.
