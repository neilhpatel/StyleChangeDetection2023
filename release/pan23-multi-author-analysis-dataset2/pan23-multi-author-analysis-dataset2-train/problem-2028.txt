If that’s what happened, then my best guess is someone who claims to actually own the copyright in that image complained to Reddit that you were posted the picture that they took without their permission.
A photographer generally owns the copyright in a picture they take. “Copyright,” is the legal right to control when and how their photograph is copied. So what likely happened is you took a screenshot of “Google,” which contained a picture of Rachel Cook, posted that picture, and incurred the ire of the owner of the original copyright of that Cook photo. That person complained to Reddit, and Reddit removed your picture.
Reddit also advised you that you have the right to dispute this person’s complaint. “I took that photo of Cook myself, at Cannes,” you might indignantly reply. Or “That photo is newsworthy within the meaning of copyright law, so the context in which I posted it is fair use.” If you have some defense along those lines, you can give it to Reddit.
If you agree that you don’t own the copyright and don’t otherwise have a legal rationale in defense of publishing the photo .... do nothing. The strong likelihood is the matter is over.
I don't know, honestly. Thanks for your reply though. I was being an idiot and just took the photo off Google images to upload it to the sub myself. I'm really confused and don't have a clue what to do next.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
