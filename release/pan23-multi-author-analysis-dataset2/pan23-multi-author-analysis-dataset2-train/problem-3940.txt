If you pay rent in exchange for living at the property you certainly are in a legal agreement known as a lease.
So even if you don't have a written lease it doesn't matter? We just pay cash every month and they give us a receipt but there is absolutely nothing written about any kind of rules and any agreement. If that's the case why does anyone bother doing a written lease?
The written lease you previously had very likely includes a clause stating that it continues on a month to month basis. But you don't need a written lease, it's fine to he verbal.
Many places require a written lease for fixed term leases and it allows everyone to have a clear outline of all rules and responsibilities.
There was a clause in the old written lease that says we were not to make any changes or repairs to the home? I also figured her home owners insurance would cover it.
If they cover it, which they may or may not, the insurance company could tu b and sue you for the cost.

Alright thanks for the help. It just blows because I'm not even supposed to be living here. I bought a house in January but the remodel has been taking forever and now I have to deal with this too.
