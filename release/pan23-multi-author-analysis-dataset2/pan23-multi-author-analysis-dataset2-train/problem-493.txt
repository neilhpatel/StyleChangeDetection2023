Call the school financial aid office and inform them of your change in circumstances. Since you don't live with that parent and they have effectively stopped all communication, you could qualify for financial aid based on your income and not your parents, worst case scenario you take out the loans you need to finish school, go all out and pay them off once you graduate.
Contracts between family members that boil down to "be good and I'll pay for your college education" are hard to enforce via specific performance, at least, and are often hard to enforce _at all_. It's usually seen as an extension of your parents' interest in raising you the way they believe, and it's likely that the remedy would be to terminate the contract based on breach (freeing you up to ignore the rules without further consequences), rather than to compel payment of the rest of your tuition.
I wish I could agree, but this particular parent actually had very little part in raising me (their choice) and this contract had to be made in order for them to contribute anything at all and not leave me and my other parent with the whole bill. They hired attorneys, had them write it up, and I had to sign or I would lose the relationship with the parent as well as any support. I also have had this contract sent to me over and over and been reminded of the terms nonstop over the last few years. Could I have just not done that if itâ€™s not a legit contract?
