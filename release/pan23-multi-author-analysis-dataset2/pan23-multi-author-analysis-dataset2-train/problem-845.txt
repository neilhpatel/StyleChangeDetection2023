Tesla was shitting all over legacy auto in the production game BEFORE he shat all over the market. Tesla's production is miles ahead of Ford, GM & VW. Huge fully robotic plants compared to Ford/GM assembly lines straight from the 1970s. Tesla has single plants that can do 500,000 of the same model each year. Legacy auto is a long way behind. However Musk destroying demand for Tesla cars will give legacy auto the time to catch up.
Almost all of it went to a few stockholders and board members. People who were already rich, who called another rich guy's bluff and forced him to pay up.
