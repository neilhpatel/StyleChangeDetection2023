Either way I think your only option to save your credit it to make the payments he’s missed. It’s up to you if you want to let him keep driving “your” car after that or if you want to take it since it’s yours.
If the car is still in your name, you can go to the house and legally demand the keys to it, and if he refuses to hand them over, have the car towed. It will suck, because paying the guy sucks, and then put it in your garage if you have one, otherwise get it booted so he cant steal it back by just using the keys. Other avenues are court to reimburse yourself for making the payments yourself, or allowing the car to be defaulted on and just make the remaining owed payments before taking him to claims court anyway for the money you spent. NAL, but yes NEVER allow someone to use your credit for any circumstances because they're not the ones who usually wind up getting screwed over because of it.
Also, think twice about letting the car get repo'ed or voluntarily surrendering it. If you do there will be huge fees from the lender and they’ll auction it off at wholesale which will likely be far less than the purchase price. The result will be a huge shortfall that you will be legally on the hook for.
