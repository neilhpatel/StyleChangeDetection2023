"To make it go away". No, WC is still a process. But it makes your company move their feet. It's by no means easy, but if you've been doing this without filing WC, then you'll see a huge improvement in progress. Which state are you in? That normally dictates the timeline on when you can file a report, but from your time frame, you're almost certainly ok.
Ohio, and it's been approximately 6 months. Does the hospital handing my bill to collections change anything? I very much appreciate the help, by the way.
In Ohio, you have 1 year to file workers comp, so you're good on that regard, but you really should act asap. The medical bills though is iffy. Have they already handed them over to collections? I'd try calling the hospital, explaining you were never informed you needed to fill out WC forms, and ask for an extension on the bill. Or a payment plan or something. You're responsible for the bill still. Call the hospital's patient advocacy program and ask if they can help you.
Do you have health insurance? Some insurance will pay medical bills if WC is being disputed and settle up later. You could call them and see if they're able to help here with your bills. This would likely also mean you're subject to your policy (deductibles, copays, coinsurance, etc), so it shouldn't be used in replacement of WC.
