Do you have your own job that could potentially be good enough to sustain yourself outside of your parents household? If so, you could look into Emancipation, but Ohio, as I recall, has a pattern of putting children and young teens into foster care before granting Emancipation. Next best bet before even considering that would be trying to find a sympathetic family member that isn't close to your parents that would be willing to take you in.
“In Ohio, children under 18 who are not emancipated must have parental consent for any vaccine. A parent or legal guardian generally should accompany the minor to receive the vaccine, unless the administration of the vaccine occurs in a physician’s office, school-based or school-associated clinic setting or similar setting, DeWine said.”.
Because you're in Ohio, you're in a really sticky situation, which for your case with the details you provided, isn't stellar, easy or cheap to get out of.
I'm proud of you for being so mature and responsible, especially with parents that sounds like they aren't. I wish I had some better advice but unfortunately I don't know all the answers.
