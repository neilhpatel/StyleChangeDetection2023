Hey, I just want to point out that lobbyists are actually a good thing that’s been perverted over the years. For example, the reason we have nutrition information required on food packaging in the US is because of a lobbying group. It’s supposed to be a group of citizen representatives meeting with politicians to try and persuade them one way or another, not some corporate stooge with bags full of money.
but of course they did...republicans seem to only serve one of two functions any longer; they're either a massive distraction via their destructive/regressive antics or they're busy serving their über-wealthy overlords.
Question is, why haven't the Democrats not expanded it either? The GOP is very honest about how it's priorities are to dismantle the Federal government until it's reduced to just controlling the military.
But the Dems are for a centralized welfare state. Why have they been unable to increase the IRS's resources so far, and even ordered them to concentrate on 600$ transactions recently?
I feel we should really start criticizing Dem incompetence more. The GOP's incompetency is helpful to us, but the Dem's isn't.
