This isn't a legal question. It sounds like they already denied you for the loan. And for being in the loan. So, sounds like your dad is buying a house for you to live in but it won't be your house at that point.
My understanding here is that the best way to do this is to have your dad be a co-signer on the loan. A co-signer generally is someone who backs the primary borrower and is willing to take on the burden of the debt should the primary borrower default, but that it's still the primary borrower's responsibility to pay the debt and the primary borrower holds the main financial interest in the property. If your dad were to sign as a co-borrower instead of a co-signer, it says that he has an ownership interest in the house.
Depends on loan type and your credit profile. If you have zero credit, but can prove alternate credit (lease, cell, cable, etc) then itâ€™s possible to go FHA, however loan terms are not as favorable. If you have established credit and established income it is possible conventional, but again loan terms will be based on lowest credit score.
If mortgage is in dads name, you can be added to title to establish ownership and you can make monthly mortgage payment, this will assist in the future (after a couple years of established payment coming from your sole and separate account).
