I don’t, I’m just saying it would be nice if they just released shit when it was ready, without alerting the media that it’s upcoming. This will literally consume my mom’s whole day tomorrow lol.
One thing we won't see is where he cheated on his tax returns. Tax returns alone aren't enough to show fraud. We'd need to see ledgers and bank statements to have something to compare the tax returns to. Tax returns don't generally show individual transactions - they show a summary that is an accumulation of the transactions for the year. We'd need bank statements and a ledger before we can even hope to identify where the cheating took place.
I'm a former auditor. The biggest damage that will occur by releasing his tax returns will be that the public will finally see how little taxes he paid. In all fairness, we learned about this last week when they released the summaries. We learned that Trump had tremendous carryover losses that helped him to shield income and pay very little in taxes for at least 3 of the 5 years we saw summaries for. Essentially, he had accumulated those losses because he's a shitty businessman.
