I appreciate your response. I completed the mortgage application a few weeks ago and just found out about the suit on Friday, so I don’t feel I’ve misrepresented. I just need to decide if I want to go to the lender now and risk spooking them or if I should wait. I don’t see why I would be named for something at work so hopefully I can be removed by my company attorney. The home won’t be completed until late summer.
I'm confused. Are you named in the caption as a defendant in the action? The caption is where everyone is listed as defendants. Or are you just named in the lawsuit body reciting facts?
If you were acting on behalf of your employer, they should defend you and pay any judgement on your behalf. Talk to your company's lawyer before you disclose to the lender.
I see a lot of mentions online of title companies finding judgments but I would close long before the trial would even begin - assuming this even makes it to court. Do you know for sure that title companies see pending lawsuits by chance?
