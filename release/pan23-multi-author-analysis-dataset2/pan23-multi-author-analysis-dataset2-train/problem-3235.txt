No, we were never given a copy of anything. I have not gotten an attorney yet - just trying to get an understanding of my options before contacting one. I wasn't sure if I can file something against the probate bond taken out by my mother and uncle or if I would have to sue. I live across the country from Wisconsin so cannot easily access the records, but the county sent me about 25 pages worth of documents. Sounds like a need a lawyer either way?
Getting the copy of the will was a good first start. If it is convenient for you to visit the county courthouse to look at ALL of the documents in the probate file, that would give you a better understanding of exactly how all of the estate affairs were handled. But if you are getting an attorney, getting the documents may not be important for you, since the attorney is going to review the documents anyway.
You want to ask your attorney if there are any steps that can be taken to recover monies from the personal bonds that were obtained.
Another thing you'll need to consider before trying to recuperate your inheritance is, if the money is spent already, what is the likelihood that if the court agrees she owes you $150,000 that you will ever see that money? If she's employed you could garnish her wages with a court order, but you'll at least want to think about that aspect and discuss with an attorney if you decide to retain one.
