I am not a lawyer but a psychiatric nurse. I’m not sure about your state, but in my state you may petition a person for mental health treatment for reasons you mentioned (threat to self or others), but also if they are not able to take care of themselves due to their illness, as in their activities of daily living. If she is neglecting to shower, feed herself, etc on her own, she may be petitioner for a physician to determine whether she needs involuntary treatment. In home treatment may also be available with a physician referral, I worked as a home care psych nurse at one point and made visits to assess how medications were working and if they needed adjustments. Your county may be able to offer referrals for such services if she is uninsured. I hope you find her help.
