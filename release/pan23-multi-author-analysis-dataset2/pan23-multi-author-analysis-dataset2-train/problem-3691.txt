If you are looking to pursue full custody, you should plan on hiring an attorney to help you with both the divorce and custody. If you are already seeing the writing on the wall, it would be best for you to begin your attorney search sooner rather than later. However, a diagnosis of BPD alone will not be enough for the court to award you full custody. There are fit parents out there with BPD, and BPD does not make it impossible for a person to be a great parent, especially if they manage their illness.
What's going to matter are your claims of neglect/abuse towards the children, how serious those are, how well substantiated those are, and whether the court has concerns about her fitness as a parent because of them. Talk those over with your attorney, but be prepared for your attorney to tell you that pursuing full custody is not the best choice. It's an incredibly high bar, and trying to cut one parent out completely without sufficient cause can cause the court to become concerned about your motives.
I have spoke to a lawyer and I do understand my rights and how to get divorced and starting the process of deciding on a lawyer that best fits my needs and understands going up against BPD. This is someone I know will be integral in my kids future and want to make the best choice.
I appreciate the insight. I suppose when she has a "flare up" is when my concern kicks in. She has invited guys she has never met into our house with the kids while I was not home. My sister inlaw was on the phone with her when she said that and when she was bad talking me to the kids. I know she can put on an act to hide her inability to manage her illness though. Considering child abuse runs on her side of the family I am very aware of the statistics and what my kids face under her care alone without me. That is my biggest fear right now is when I am not there.
