Probably only if she can convince a court that your ex-wife is unfit in some way. Would have to consult a family attorney.
Speak with an estate planning lawyer about a trust. Yes, the trustee can be someone else like your current wife. Though I'd recommend your parents (if they are healthy) or a sibling. I'm sure you and your wife love each other very much. It's not very fair to expect her to be dealing with legal matters for the next 15 years when your ex asks for a disbursement from the trust. In any event, I'm sorry and hope things work out for you the best they can.
Although an estate lawyer was involved, it was not a difficult process to set up. Furthermore, there was no added effort needed despite me living in a different state than the beneficiary of the trust and the person who funded it.
OP, Trustees can also be officers at your bank (most big banks have will and trust divisions), a neighbor, or even a carny whose meth addiction is well-managed. Your attorney will have a roster of people he or she has worked with in the past and can help you identify who is best for you.
In the trust I am involved with, there is language in the trust document that states it will be funded by the parent's estate upon death as a POD instrument, which means funding of it does not go through probate. It is treated just as a life insurance policy or other POD instrument would be.
I would like to also add that it is possible to open a trust with your child as beneficiary, and to fund it with a minimal amount of money.
