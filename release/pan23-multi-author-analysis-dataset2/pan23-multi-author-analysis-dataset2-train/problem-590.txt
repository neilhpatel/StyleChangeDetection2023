It depends on the language of the lease but it's likely a pretty broad clause- some are as broad as 'police activity.' If it is that broad just the act of the husband being arrested by the police at home or the police searching the property would allow her to be evicted.
She would only be evicted if she receives a court order to vacate. If she leaves on her own, on terms agreed by both the LL and her, there is no eviction on her record.
The courts are extremely backed up now, so the likelihood of her being legally evicted in the near future is slim. She should work with the LL to make a proper exit.
NAL. But I know they would be unable to evict just one tenant. If they cosigned the lease they are essentially one person under the lease. Now obviously, the management will want to evict the husband so that includes the wife as well.... but that doesn't preclude them from entering a new agreement with your friend only. They don't HAVE to...but it's worth an ask. They would probably want him barred from the property, so if she's filed a restraining order (not sure if there are kids in the home) that might help convince the management, or at least help her show the next landlord that she won't be bringing him along once they find out about the reason for her prior eviction.
