Your best recourse if they won't make payments to you or negotiate with you is to file against their employer if you are able to. I have a judgement for $3,000 against a past roommate but have not been able to find who he works for, I would probably need to hire a Private Investigator at this point. Or if you have their bank account numbers you can try filing against their bank directly. This is much harder to get unless provided on original rental agreement.
I do know where one works and banks (at least banked when we lived together), but not the bank account number. For the other one, I know the company that she works, just not the exact location. How would you file against their employer?
I was able to find out where one works at by getting on a friend’s Facebook account to view their account. I am blocked so I’m not able to see the account. Have you tried LinkedIn in incognito mode or specific googling?
Keep in mind, they may allow you to add costs to the amount of the judgement, so keep your receipts.
The other states. The foreign judgement domestication allows AL or FL courts to recognize the matter and allow you to pursue collection per their laws.
Just to add that if the debtor claims head of household status (providing more than 50% of support to a dependent) they can have a wage garnishment stopped.
