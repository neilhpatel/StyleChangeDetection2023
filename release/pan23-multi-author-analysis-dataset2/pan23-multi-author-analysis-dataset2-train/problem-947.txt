If he had said the rent was 1200 every month, and you agreed to that, and on the lease it say 450 every month, you'd know it was an obvious error. But modern contract doctrine requires only objective manifestations of assent, you can stand your ground and see what he does, but to be clear did you agree to 795?
I had verbally acknowledged the amount over the phone. Stupidly, I did not double check the deposit amount before signing, thinking she sent me correct stuff. I paid what she put at the bottom of the contract. She pointed out her error to me. There is a clause that says specifically verbal contracts are not valid. Only the document is.
This is a clerical error, both parties agrees and intended for the deposit to be 795. They are asking you to sign a revised lease to make it easier. If you insist you can go through courts and have them decide but you are not likely to be successful. You were previously fine with 795, pay the 795.
I thought I had already paid everything I owed her. I didn't see the error until she pointed it out and I went back and looked. I don't have and extra almost 500$ to just give her and my work already does shady shit with payroll/scheduling to start with. My next check won't cover the rent and that, let alone food, so I'll be eating whatever I had before the move and hope that lasts until the check after that. This is harder than I thought it would be, but staying where I was with that roommate was absolutely not an option. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.
