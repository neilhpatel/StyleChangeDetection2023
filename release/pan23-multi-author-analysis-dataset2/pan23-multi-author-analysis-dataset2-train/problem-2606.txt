It's state dependent. I don't know washinon. But generally, this will be a bench trial. The judge is going to order the truck sold and you'll split the equity. Honestly, it probably gets resolved at pre trial because this is stupid as hell.
The judge can order Attorneys fees in some cases in some states - but the general rule is that fees are borne by the party that incurs them. Besides, if he doesn't have the money to get a truck loan, he doesn't have the money to pay for the fees. You basically just get a paper judgment that says "x pays y." Good luck enforcing it.
The court can't force a financial institution to make a bad decision (loan to someone with bad credit). In any scenario you are paying off this truck loan and waiting for your ex to pay you back.
The court is probably going to make you sell the truck. If the truck has negative equity, that has to be paid up before the truck can even be sold.
Unless your ex has a significantly higher income than you, it's unlikely that the judge will make him pay your legal fees. You can discuss this with your lawyer, but remember that the lawyer will often want to drag out the case in order to make more money.
Also, it sounds like people are misunderstanding your question. Maybe post again later in the week without the information about the rent and include the offer of judgment in your original post.
Not sure why you're being downvoted for providing additional information. Does your ex have the ability to pay and is just trying to control you? Or is he unable to pay? That may change things.
My advice is let him keep the truck and move on with your life. Think of this as a business transaction, not an emotional one.
