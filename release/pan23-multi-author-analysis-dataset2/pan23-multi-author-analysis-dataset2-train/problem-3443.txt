From a legal standpoint, as a parent, your child has no real privacy rights against you, however, there's a reasonableness factor here, and this is objectively unreasonable behavior by your ex.
I would definitely go through family court and revisit custody. As she gets older, her opinion carries more weight with the court, so if she says she doesn't want to go back because he keeps walking in on her, then that's going to be taken into account.
I would also talk this over with her pediatrician and consider whether she needs to talk to a counselor or therapist.
Family court is your best solution. You don't want to leave this up the authorities to decide what to do because it's not their jobs to figure out what's in the best interest of the child. That's the court's job. The police are there to look for crimes. CPS is there to look for neglect and abuse and their ultimate goal is to reunite the family where possible.
One possible avenue would be to report this to child protective services immediately, BUT to get back to court ASAP for a possession and access (custody) modification.
If you do not have funds for a lawyer, there may be staff attorneys at the courthouse library who can help you file a modification.
