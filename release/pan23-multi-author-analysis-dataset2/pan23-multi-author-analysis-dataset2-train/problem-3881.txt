That will never happen & gun laws only effect the honest citizen. Criminals will always have them laws or no laws. Don’t take me wrong I’m no crazy that sleeps with a gun under my pillow. However I am most definitely into competition shooting & hunting and will vote against any politician trying to take away my rights to do so. Just yesterday I was coyote hunting with the dreaded AR 15 yet no one was hurt. Why should some politician tell me I can’t own that rifle? I guess it really won’t matter the gun grabbers are on there last big push now & there overreach will be there end. Won’t be to long & the Supreme Court will put an end to the whole let’s ban assault rifle nonsense. They never learn there over reach earned them Heller & Bruin soon New York & other gun grabber politicians will force the hand of another decision dashing there hopes & dreams.
And it’s so different that once we get rid of guns we can be super sure another trump like politician won’t try to run us into a fascist he’ll scape, we totally don’t need those pesky safeguards no way!
