Misleading headline it's a Brussels to Berlin service. Eurostar London to Brussels CHANGE there. The Eurostar fare will probably cost more per Km than the sleeper service too! How it compars in cost to flying is important too given the time sink of a train.
Yeah, once anyone has to get off a plane or a train for any reason and drag their bags with them, it's no longer a direct service, no matter how much someone insists it is.
I just want to be able to take a sleeper from Edinburgh to Geneva or Milan, why is that so hard (I know why)? I donâ€™t care if it is slower than planes.
Are European trains a time sink though? Several times I've compared the time costs & frequently found that city centre to city centre trains are far faster than planes.
Yes, so long as the journey is via one or perhaps two high speed rail routes I agree, if we define national as the euro zone.
What really brought it home to me was , which shows you from any chosen train station the 1,2,3..5h hour isolines.
Which considering that check-in, bag drop, security, boarding, bag pick up etc. already adds around 5h to a 2-3h flight without getting to & from an extra-suburban airport we quickly realise that high speed rail is far faster.
All this meant that I could go from home to a Paris hotel in a little over 6h by train or 8h by plane.
