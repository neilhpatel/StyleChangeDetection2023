Not so sure it would be an easy victory. Lots of Trump supporters out there despite years of failure, corruption and several pending criminal indictments. Desantis may prove more damaging to the USA.
Trump did a lot in 4 years to build up negative electability to the point where he is radioactive to the party even out of office.
I think Trump would be the easiest victory the democrats could get right now. He's a burned asset. People aren't willing to let him slide into office to "stick it to the establishment" or "see what happens if he shakes things up" again.
DeSantis I am worried about. He's a sadistic manipulative ideologically fascist monster. But he's young and has nice hair and knows how to pull on those "they are coming for the kids!" heartstrings that have seen dictators rise to power throughout history.
Doubtful, he’s a paper tiger, sending migrants from Texas to Massachusetts showed that. He’s completely stopped after getting called out over it. Trump would never have been shamed so easily.
