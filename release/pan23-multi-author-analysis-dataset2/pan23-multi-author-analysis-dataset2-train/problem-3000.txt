On the 10 year memorial of 9/11 CSPAN aired an interview with Lieutenant Penney where she discusses their plan. It was haunting to hear her discuss what she was prepared do.
"I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and its way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense.".
This is trained military. I’m a veteran, I was an enlisted nurse. I was trained to give my life without question if directed for my country. That’s one of the points of basic training, to break you down and then rebuild you back up to be a soldier- to take direct orders to go into war and sacrifice your life to protect your country and constitution. We sign over our constitutional rights to give our lives to protect it. I’m not asking for thanks, but that’s literally what military personnel are trained, and volunteer today (or were drafted in the past) to do. Does this surprise people? I feel like it should be common knowledge, if it’s not.
We in the military all say we defend our country, but rarely since the Cold War has there been a situation that so clearly is in defense of the homeland as this.
