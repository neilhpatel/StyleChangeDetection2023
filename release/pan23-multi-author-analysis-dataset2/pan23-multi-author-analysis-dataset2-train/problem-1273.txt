You would need to purchase or license the rights to use the image from the copyright owner. You would need to do your due diligence to ensure that whoever you were buying the rights from was the legitimate owner of the IP rights.
And does it mean since this logo is registered on the Adobe stock website but probably not as an official trademark that i could just register this logo as part of my trademark?
Licensing the rights to use an image for certain purposes may not grant you the right to use it for other purposes. E.g. a general-purpose usage license may not cover using the image as the logo of your business or register a trademark for it. You will need to read the licensing agreement carefully, to ensure it covers your needs. If you have concerns, you may want to consult an IP attorney in your area, who can advise you about your specific situation.
You can't use someone else's artwork as your logo without permission to do so. You would be infringing on their copyright whether or not they have registered it as a trademark.
Someone owns the copyright to the image you want to use as your logo. You will need to get their explicit permission to use it for that purpose, create your own logo or hire someone to do so for you, or go without a logo.
Yes i understand its also stated in the description on adobe stock, however i was thinking since this logo is ‘just’ registered on the adobe website it probably isn’t officially trademark registered anywhere right, soo i would probably be able to recreate / use it and register it as my brand identity or would this not possible?
