Putin's attempt to spin the war as Russia defending itself from NATO is 100% bullshit, and it won't make Europe safer from Russia to go along with lies whose only purpose is to justify Russia invading other countries.
Also remember, Russia already signed a treaty in 1994 to defend Ukrainian sovereignty, and invaded anyway. Any peace moving forward can't be based on trusting Russia.
Trying to negotiate with Russia is bad idea with Putin still in power. Besides Putin made it clear he will continue the war however long it takes.
Sounds more like a way to escalate arms while trying to de-escalate the fact your giving them more arms.
The priority here SEEMS to be getting them more arms while only encouraging talks. It's not as if the additional arms comes with a seemingly aggressive requirement for peace.
Nukes are a bad deterrent even though they sound powerful. Take the Crimea for example, would Ukraine have used nukes when russia took it? No. Its just not worth it. They need NATO.
Yeah right Hungary, Poland, Czechia, Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria are all top fairly easy military targets right next to Russia and all part of NATO. Turkey may as well be on the last too since they are both troublemakers and in a highly strategic area that Russia would love to have if they could.
It seems like you have no clue about what countries are in NATO or what countries the USSR had taken over in the past and would be prime target. Almost all of them are now in NATO, unfortunately Ukraine is the one big one that isn't.
