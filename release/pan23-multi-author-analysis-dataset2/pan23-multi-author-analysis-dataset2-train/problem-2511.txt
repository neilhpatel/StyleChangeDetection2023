I find it interesting that Republicans are condemning the white nationalist for having dinner with someone, but aren’t placing any blame on the person that actually ate with the white nationalist.
Remember when Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar spoke at a conference organized by Nick Fuentes, who before introducing Greene, asked for a “round of applause for Russia.”.
These GOP are openly supportive of white supremacists, and in Trump’s case, he had lunch with an anti-Semite and a Nazi. The Republican Party should push Trump and these people to the ash heap of history. But they won’t because this is the Republican Party.
Didn’t trump already give away the game.. Trump has dirt on all of them.. He was pretty clear that he would use compromising information about Desantis.
