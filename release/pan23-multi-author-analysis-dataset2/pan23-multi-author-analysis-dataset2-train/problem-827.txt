But the details surrounding the thing are probably relevant. Just because something is legal to do doesn't mean the context in which it's done can't make it something else illegal.
That's not illegal as a general rule. It could be defamatory, depending on the facts. It's possible that, depending on the nature of the "public figure," there is some rule prohibiting this.
It could possibly lead to a successful civil suit for defamation, as another commenter stated. You should speak with an attorney that hands civil suits regarding the accusations.
She leaked the person’s full name and told her followers to let the person know they’re going to jail, also leaked some of their social media. Does that help give more clarity?
Posting someone's public information, in and of itself, is not a crime. That's just publishing information that anyone can get.
Posting someone's public information, and then calling for people to contact and harass that person, or some such thing, can be illegal.
It's not perfectly clear that that's exactly what's happening here, though, but it sounds like they could be dancing somewhat close.
