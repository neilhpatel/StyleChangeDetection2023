They all immediately backed off. The VAST majority of these lunatics are "normal" people that have been sucked into this quagmire. It's like their sports team - in sports you can get "crazy"...and it's encouraged but there are really no chances of consequences. Win or lose, you return home like nothing happened - this is exactly how they saw their insurrection at the Capitol. Look no further to the woman that was crying after the insurrection because she was pepper sprayed - things got real for her, it was no longer a sports game. Those that saw the traitor die unceremoniously, as should be the case for traitors, suddenly realized that could be them. That was one dude with a handgun, he wasn't taking out an entire crowd. If they really wanted to keep going they would have kept going. Which is telling on both sides.
