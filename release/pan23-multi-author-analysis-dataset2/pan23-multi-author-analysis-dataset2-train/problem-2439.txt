It sounds like he is being defensive and inappropriate. There is no harm in reporting him to the medical board for being and ask. If he did and unnecessary procedure that you didn't consent to, you need to reach out to your insurance company to make sure you don't pay for it. he could be committing fraud. If he is assaulting patients, they can help direct you to somewhere you can report him. I'd advise not going to the police quite yet but that is an option.
Then have your insurance look for a charge. You can also contact the Florida Board of Medical Licensing and ask to speak to someone about this.
Get a copy of your medical records. You are legally entitled to them. They should include your consent form. If he refuses, bring the medical board down on his head. You should determine if you signed a consent form for whatever procedure was done. You should discern it if the procedure that was done was appropriate to what you went to him for. To create a wild example, if you went in to look at a hemorrhoid and he decided to do an upper endoscopy, it would make no sense.
