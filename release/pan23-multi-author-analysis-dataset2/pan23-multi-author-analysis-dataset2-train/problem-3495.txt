Yes, for transmission lines, they can take anything in the easement to grass. They can also go into your yard, off the easement, and cut/ trim any trees they think could become problematic between then and the next trim. They have formulas they use based on the tree species, age of the tree, height of the tree, and distance to the closest power line, but typically, it’s too expensive to do this for every property owner, so you need to request that the power company send a representative to meet with you prior to any work being done on your property so they can mark which and how much of each of the trees that will be cut and make sure other things that are not a danger to the lines are left alone. The next time they come to trim (likely in 5yrs), call the phone number on the pamphlet and let them know you require a forester from the power company to mark the trees that will be trimmed. I’m sorry this happened to you.
You want a lawyer. This is a specific field of law and they are likely on the hook for 2x or 3x the monetary damage, depending on state (i did not google for you). Absolutely seek counsel.
