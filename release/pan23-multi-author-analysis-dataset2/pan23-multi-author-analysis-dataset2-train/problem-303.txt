You do realize the post office has been removing sorting machines and consolidating the sorting centers for years before Dejoy right? Wasn't anything new on his part, just part of an ongoing program. Same with removal of corner mail boxes. And it's the POST OFFICE . . . not an election agency, any piece of mail they receive should be treated the same as any other piece of mail in it's class. Overtime SHOULD need to go through an approval process based on the Post Office Budget.
