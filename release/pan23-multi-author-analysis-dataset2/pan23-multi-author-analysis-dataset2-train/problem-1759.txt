Extortion includes using the law to threaten, even if you actually did do something illegal. It's the fact that you're saying "do this, or this bad thing will happen to you".
It's blackmail, but then it's also stupid for her to threaten your job. Let's just say she does get you fired and now what? You have no money to pay the child support because you're out of work, so your ex-wife is essentially being stupid.
If you have texts and emails from her with the threats, then I recommend you print those and send them to your boss as a warning of her potential antics. But do not cave to her demands. You could also file a police report for extortion, and sue her for defamation. She can't do anything if you haven't done anything wrong. The threats could also lead you to more custody of your children, and a reduced child support amnt. But the reduced payment, I wouldn't recommend unless you'll have the children the majority of the time. Still gotta make sure the kids get what they need, right?
Last thought, you might want to have her investigated for what she's been spending the child support on. If she's asking for more than your agreement, with threats, she may not be using it to actually support your children.
