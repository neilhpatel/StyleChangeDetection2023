I called and they asked for my DOB and last 4 of my social when I called back. They said they needed to verify who I was to give me any information. I didn’t provide any info so they wouldn’t give me any details.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
If you're on Facebook or many other social media platforms, it's trivial to find your hometown and parents phone numbers.
There really isn't any such thing as "legal notification by telephone" for debt collection or civil or criminal court procedure.
The vagueness about the topic and the use of intimidating legal-sounding terminology, the solicitation of personal identifying information, and the refusal to identify the caller all point to a scam.
Check your credit report to see if you have any outstanding debts that might be in collections, but I'll give you 90% or higher probability this is a scam.

There is no law against giving a scammer four random digits and the date of your dog's birthday. If they're legit they will apologize and state that they have the wrong kativt. But an even better course of action is to ignore.
This sounds like a social engineering scam. Your name, plus DOB, plus last four are a proxy ID that can be used to open small lines of credit in your name, draw the limit, and vanish. Which could lead to actual debt-collection calls later and a mess to untangle.
If you are actually served with an actual summons, then do not ignore it. But until then, which is in all likelihood until hell freezes over, this is probably safe to ignore.
