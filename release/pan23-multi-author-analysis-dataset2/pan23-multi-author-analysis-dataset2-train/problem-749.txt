The Will is required to be recorded within 30 days in IL. It should be recorded in the county your great uncle resided. The most important thing is to ensure the Will is recorded for safe keeping.
The person in possession of the will must file it with the court. That’s basically “Hey, court, here’s this person’s will.” The next step would be for the person named as executor in the will to formally petition the court for appointment and to begin probate. When the executor makes that petition, they must notify anyone named in the will as an heir. If you have not been notified that either means the executor has not yet petitioned, the executor has screwed up, or you are not named as an heir.
When a will is actually submitted for probate, it becomes a public document. You should be able to get a copy from the probate court in the county where he lived at the time of death. There may be a fee for this.
There is something else that may be happening. Wealthy people often have most or all of their assets placed into a trust. A trust is not part of the estate for purposes of probate. If everything is tied up in the trust, there may be no need to probate the will.
The trust should say who gets the assets in the trust when the trust-holder dies. The trust should name someone, called a successor trustee, to take care of distributing the assets in the trust. It is quite common for a trust to be in the name of both both spouses. In take case, the surviving spouse takes over the trust and usually keeps all the assets in the trust. The surviving spouse can then completely change the trust.
