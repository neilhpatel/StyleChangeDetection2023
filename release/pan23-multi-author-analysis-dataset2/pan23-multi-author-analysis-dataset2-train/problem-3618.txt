"What can you learn about a military from its band? Usually, not much. But putting on great performance requires some of the same skills as conducting a military operation. It requires recruiting the right people with the right talents (and many militaries, including the American military, use bands as a recruiting tool). It requires equipping those people with the right technology—often highly specialized—so they can do their job. It requires training those people to work together to perform complicated tasks with impeccable timing. It requires developing young leaders, managing logistics, and maintaining high morale. The sergeant I spoke to observed that what came through in the Ukrainians’ performance is that they wanted to be there, they wanted to be great, and their leaders were inspirational.".
Some heart wrenching stories out there about some of the people who died. There was a retired major who got caught in artillery fire while driving around the battlefield looking for dropped weapons and checking corpses for ammo and grenades - that's how desperate it was.
Let’s not ignore that during the initial mobilization many Ukrainian conscripts got poor training and equipment. They have luckily ironed that out now that the situation has stabilized but Ukraine had their issues as well.
yeah, we remember watching the RPG gunners and MANPAD launchers being shot by dudes in jeans and tee shirts in WW2 army helmets outside Kyiv in the first two months of the war.
People forgot pretty quickly how close that decapitation strike on Kyiev came to success. They were handing out assault weapons on street corners and pointing volunteers (as in, literally people who showed because they saw it on the news/heard the artillery and went to help) in the general direction of the Russian advance. There were local militias, random groups of mates, police, etc, mostly in civvies and mostly dying. They won, but it was very close.
