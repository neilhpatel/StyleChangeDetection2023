5) Not entirely sure about this one but I think the judge was making remarks about the religious beliefs and significance of cow in Hinduism and these completely baseless (Both scientifically as well as Religiously, yeah, Coz the concept of radiation totally existed when the holy scriptures were written) yet very popular (especially among indian equivalent of Boomers) myths were also brought up and maybe even the judge may not believe in them but was merely stating that these type of beliefs exist but since everything said in the court by the judge goes on record, this one ended up in the official transcript of the verdict.
3) Cows are considered sacred in Hinduism and illegal smuggling for the intention of slaughter is strictly prohibited in that part of India (not the case in the entire country). The man was caught smuggling the cattle in a truck in pretty inhumane conditions, they were tied closely packed with a considerably short rope and covered with a tarp to conceal them. There was no food or water for those animal back there. Two animals died as a result. So yeah, you could argue the basis of laws that arise from religious beliefs but even if you ignore them, the man was still responsible for starving two animals to death. So it wasn't like the man was completely innocent.
The actual atrocity of sending a poor man to prison for life is what we should be furious about, not the nonsense statement made to divert our attention.
The prosecution claimed that on July 18, 2020, a truck carrying 16 cows and bullocks was seen at an intersection between the villages of Nava (Tapi) and Ashrava (Banas Kantha).
