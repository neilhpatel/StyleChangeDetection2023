Used to think the 1/2 crazy guy at work always going off about the government was pretty harmless. Now? Now the rhetoric has changed, it's all about the coming civil war.

These people are in LEO, military and among other critical places in society. Hell, its easier to spot as they are still on about fighting vaccines & flying flags with their ima patriot.
