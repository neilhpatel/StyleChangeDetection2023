Pennsylvania, like many states, has a strict liability statute regarding dogs. You're still liable for any medical expenses your dog creates because of a dog bite, regardless of negligence. If you're found to be negligent, you could be on the hook for more than medical expenses, like lost wages if a person had to miss work because of their injuries. It doesn't sound like you were negligent, here. So, the worst (arguably your girlfriend and not you because she owns the dog) is whatever it takes to treat those 4 puncture wounds. And that's if no defenses apply. I'm not sure there would be one definitive enough that would dismiss a suit should one be brought. In any event, they don't even go the doctor about it, it's going to basically nothing because they didn't incur any expenses. Having said that, your home owner's policy may cover this situation should more serious medical attention be needed. While the law is fairly strict, there doesn't seem to be much damages here to worry.
It’s more about incentivizing dog owners to make sure their dogs aren’t aggressive. As a commenter mentioned above, dogs jumping against a fence and/or at something isn’t a good thing, and can and should be trained out. You simply can’t watch a dog 24/7, and you need to ensure that they can be trusted in any situation. I happen to live in the same state as the OP, and now that this dog has bitten a person, its owner is aware that the dog has “dangerous propensities,” and if it bites again- under any circumstances- the owner is open to a whole host of liability.
