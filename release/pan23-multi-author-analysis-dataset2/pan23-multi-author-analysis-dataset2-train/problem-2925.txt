Without a clause in the lease that allows you to break it early, you are on the hook for rent either until the end of your rental term, or until the unit is re-rented.
If the landlord is willing to let you out of the lease and only charge you half the security deposit, you might consider yourselves lucky. This may not be a situation where you want to start demanding too much; you may wind up being legally right but on the hook to owe a lot more money than half your deposit.
So if the unit it re-rented, we are entitled to the full deposit? Is there a requirement for her to find a new tenant or could she decide to just not find one?
In NY, if there is unpaid rent, the landlord can keep all or part of your security deposit to cover it.
Without a clause in your lease that gives you a way to terminate it early, you don't have a way to terminate the lease until it's end date - in this case, April 2022. (There are a few reasons spelled out in law that allow a tenant to unilaterally end a lease early; your situation is not one of them.) However, landlords have a duty to mitigate damages. What that means is that your landlord is not allowed to just leave the unit sit empty until April; even though you have violated your lease, she must attempt to minimize the damages against you by finding a new tenant.
Until the unit is re-rented, you are responsible for rent/bills/fees as defined by your lease, and you could be sued if you fail to pay.
In addition, because your names are still on the lease, removing you from that lease could mean formally going to court and evicting you.
You could be sued for: any unpaid rent, any legal fees, cleaning costs for the apartment, or any other fees that the landlord incurred because you violated your lease and terminated it early.
If the only thing the landlord wants in exchange for letting you walk away obligation-free is half your security deposit, that may be a beneficial arrangement for you.
