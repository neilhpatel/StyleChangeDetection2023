I still say a Russian rope tied in a noose is the cleanest way out. I was holding up hope when I saw the conscription offices getting attacked. Havenâ€™t heard a lot since.
Reddit has no idea when it comes to reality, I swear. The idea that Russia is anywhere near capitulation is a farce. I can be as pro-Ukranian as all get out and understand that Russia has the ability to freeze the conflict/reignite at will.
It would be a good reason to rebel in every way possible. Rob all of the businesses doing business with him. Avoid paying taxes on products/work in countries normalizing him. Even actively dismantling the infrastructure of corporations that are appeasing him. There is no reason to be civil with him anymore.
Show the Russian people a way out and give them a chance to rebuild the government. Make sure it condemns the invasion and reward them when they make changes. You make Russia divide itself. Not saying give them military aid but allow them to re-enter the world markets on our terms.
