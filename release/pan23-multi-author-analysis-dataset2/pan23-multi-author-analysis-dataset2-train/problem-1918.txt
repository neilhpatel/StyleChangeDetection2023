I'm not familiar with Texas law when it comes to this so don't take my advice totally seriously - someone who knows better will hopefully chime in - but I believe this is a matter between the husband and wife and ultimately a matter for the divorce court to decide when splitting up marital assets. The proceeds received from the sale would come into play there but I don't think you will be under any obligation to return it.
One way is to have someone abuse their authority to the license plate registration database and match the plate to an address. That act alone is a crime, so it doesn't speak highly of this person's integrity.
You're not obligated to hand it over. This guy could go to a court and show that the wife improperly sold his property, and then seek replevin (court order for the return of goods), but until then you have nothing to do. This seems like a scam.
I have a system with eight 4K cameras around around my house that I got at Costco for like $800. The video playback is definitely more than enough detailed to see cars, faces, license plates, etc.
