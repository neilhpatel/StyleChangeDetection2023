When it comes to her death and probating her estate, you will most likely have to sign pieces of paper declaring that you refuse to be executor and you disclaim any inheritance. You can just wait until someone hits you up about signing. If her lawyer or someone else calls you to ask if you will be starting probate, you tell them “Nope, not interested. Send me a form to sign.”.
If a doctor or hospital has a copy of a healthcare POA that names you, they will contact you. You can say “Sorry, I am unwilling to act.” That’s the legal way to say it. You may or may not have to get nasty and tell them to go away if they persist.
It is unclear if your grandmother is still alive or not. Either way, you can legally decline to serve as someone’s Power of Attorney, Health Care Representative, Personal Representative/Executor, and/or Trustee, and you can also decline to accept any inheritance. If all else fails, you can donate any inheritance to a charity. Note that her debt (if any) will not become yours.
