We are not sending a good message to children when school staff is armed and conducting active shooter drills. We're telling them schools are dangerous places to be, places they may die, and more kids are going to be struggling with school phobia/PSTD.
We'll outside of schools we have police and soldiers that are armed performing active shooter drills, preparing for war, etc. Schools are places people die just as people die outside of schools.
I get what you're trying to say, but maybe the impression that schools are incapable of violence and safe havens is the wrong approach.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
