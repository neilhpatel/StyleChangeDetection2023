I’m not sure I understand your legal question. You’ve described no defense to the citation. It’s possible you might get some sort of plea bargain if you go to court.
I defended that that I have safe-driving records for five years and I never did that. But I have to go to pee and there is no Rest area around 50 miles on highway, I speed up my car. He told me no reason is good reason for speeding up, and tell me never do it again in any situation.
He came up to me and asked me do you know why I am pulling you over!? I told him that yeah, it should be for speeding. He told I guessed it right. And asked for license and Registration papers. He went there in his car with my License and car registration paperwork and came back, told me I am issuing you citation, you need to pay money by calling number shown below. I asked the cost and he told its somewhat around 200$ and I was scared as fuck so he told me to drive as per rules and he was kind enough to not write down notes on my driving records. Sorry I just remember this conversation.
