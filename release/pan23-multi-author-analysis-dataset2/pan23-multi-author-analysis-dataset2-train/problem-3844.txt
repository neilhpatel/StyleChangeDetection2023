Your contract that let her stay for those 30 days almost certainly contains a clause outlining the penalties for holdovers. If you used a real estate attorney for closing, contact them. Otherwise, consider consulting one, especially if you don't think she is actually planning to leave soon.
We contacted our agent right after she told us this, but our agent is still figuring this all out as well. We have all the paperwork and have been going over it ourselves but there is just so much and we aren't really savvy in this area.
I know people have suggested looking at the holdover clause of your sale, but I suggest a different tack.
She doesn't look like the type of person to lie about something like this, and honestly the kicking her out part was just a nuclear option if things ended up going sideways. She contacted us again and let us know she'd be out by Monday, now we're awaiting what she responds to with our suggested payment plan.
If it's only going to be 4-7 days, consider pointing out the holdover clause, but making an offer to just have her cover your costs. That would make it more likely you can avoid an adversarial showdown, where most outcomes end up with you taking damages that either aren't worth pursuing legally, or end up being long and drawn out. You don't want to create a renter situation in any way, shape, or form if you can avoid it.
If she truly does have COVID, no one's going to move her anyway. It's also unlikely a court would grant an eviction in such a short time frame - even if you managed to get in front of a court, a judge would likely give her some grace time.
