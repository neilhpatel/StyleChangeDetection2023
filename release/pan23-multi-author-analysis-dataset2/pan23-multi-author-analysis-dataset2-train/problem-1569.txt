I own my property. The times they're around I'm usually at work and then I come home and its crowded. I was thinking of leaving a note on the windshield of the vehicle to let them know they need to leave more room... I was gonna give the lumber a couple more days before saying something about that.
I figured it probably would be but I wasn't sure. Cause if it were something like a vehicle, that has a title and ownership and all to it, but something like lumber, I wasn't sure.
As I said, I have zero desire to actually take it--that would be a lot of effort and I wouldn't have anywhere to take it nor anything to do with it. But I was curious.
If your neighbor is over he should know better. If he's got a contractor over there, they may that nk it's one big property.

I would just push the stuff back onto they're property, but its a bunch of lumber and siding and I'm pretty sure it would take me a good extended period of time to move it all. Its not really "pushable". I'd have to pick it up piece by piece to move it to another location.
