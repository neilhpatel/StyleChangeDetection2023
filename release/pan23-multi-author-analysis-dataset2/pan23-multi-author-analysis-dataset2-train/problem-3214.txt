Medical malpractice is extremely case specific so you need an attorney who specializes in such things to advise you.
No, it extremely expensive to take these cases to trial (which is why most settle, but that's still expensive). And your OOP costs are minuscule compared to your health insurance's OOP costs. If you were to somehow establish responsibility in court, which again you'd already be thousands in the hole in legal fees, then any hypothetical reward would have to be subrogated. (And if your health insurance thinks they can go after someone else for this, they will.) But that aside, it is simply not possible to go into small claims court to do this. There are depositions, subpoenas, months if not years of process. It's not as simple as "X happened, then Y, so I believe Z was the fault of XRQ." In this hypothetical you'd also be up against multiple attorneys.
I am not a lawyer, but do have a background in medicine, but am not a doctor. Like with above I don’t think it would be worth it, or you would only have a slim chance. However, if you’re determined to take it to court I do have some suggestions.
Right. And medical malpractice is more than someone just missing something. Hypothetically, if someone else is at fault (which would be impossible to prove without spending thousands of dollars on subpoenas and pretrial and trial experts) and even if you were to be successful, the money would all go to your health insurance company through subrogation.
It is very possible that they did everything they could, but the antibiotics weren’t effective against the specific bacteria that caused the infection. Likely the only way you would have a malpractice case is if you can prove beyond a doubt that the dermatologist either knowingly, or through a lack of proper examination and/or testing, gave you the wrong medications, treatments, or care instructions (like you need to go to the hospital).
