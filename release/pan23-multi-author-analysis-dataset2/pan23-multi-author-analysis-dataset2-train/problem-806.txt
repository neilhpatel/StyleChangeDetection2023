If your lease does not allow for pets without approval or without pet fee/rent, then you are in violation of your lease. In Florida your landlords can give you a 7 day notice to fix the lease violation, after which they can start the eviction process.
They can tell you all they want that you have to move out or get rid of the cat in a day, but that is legally not enforceable, what is is giving you the 7 day notice to fix it.
The first line says it's up to the landlord to accept pets. If you did not get landlord approval you were in violation of your lease. Florida law then allows your landlord to issue a 7 day cure or quit notice.
The landlord is under no obligation to allow you to have a pet. If they don't want the cat you have 7 days to get rid of it.
You have no grounds to fight this. You didn't follow the rules you agreed to. This situation is 100% your fault.
Compassion or a lack thereof does not change the pet policy. The policy you agreed to follow and then didn't.
