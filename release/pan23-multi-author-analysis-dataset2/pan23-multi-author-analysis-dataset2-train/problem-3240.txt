Tips always belong to the employee. Are you a contractor or employee? My understanding is most strippers are independent contractor, but you can file a wage claim for the money you are owed. Also location matters, this thread will need it. lANAL.
Yes, I would go to them and use this specific terminology. Tell them that it’s illegal to withhold tips from you and that if they do not give them to you immediately you will be filing a wage claim. Have a witness there who can confirm you told them this because if they try to fire you after you tel them that, they can then be sued for “retaliation”, as you cannot be fired for taking action against them for doing something illegal.
Personally, unless you are regularly pulling in 1000 dollars in tips on these days, as soon as your check is short, I would refuse to come in until paid. (And still file a wage claim because she is late with your pay!).
The tips belong to you. She cannot do this without a prior arrangement (like a tip pool). Tell everyone that you do not consent to her taking any wages out of your checks. If you are missing any wages from your check, your action to remedy this is to file a wage claim with the labor board.
