Hopefully someone will be along to tackle your question properly, but let me recommend some reading while you wait. /u/b1uepenguin discusses Polynesian and Austronesians explorers .
Some good answers here, just one minor point: it seems fairly likely that some Polynesian seafarers did arrive in Australia before the arrival of Europeans (since then of course there has always been Polynesian immigration to Australia). In the late 13th century, very shortly after the settlement of New Zealand, a group of Polynesians sailed on and settled Norfolk Island (which today is part of Australia, even if that isn't exactly what you were thinking of). The settlement did not prove permanent, and at some point before the late 18th century it was abandoned. In the 1920s some members of the newly-formed Anthropological Society of New South Wales were at Dark Point in looking for Aboriginal artefacts during their Christmas break, when they found what they identified as an . Further analysis of the adze showed it to be most likely from Norfolk Island. The authors also talk a bit about why they think it's unlikely the adze arrived in recent times.
It doesn't exactly answer your question but it would be remiss of me not to point out that Australia was inhabited and filled with a significant number of people with a long history of their own. They pretty clearly discovered it quite early.
Awesome addition I knew you had something on it somewhere, but couldn't search easily at the time. Thanks.
