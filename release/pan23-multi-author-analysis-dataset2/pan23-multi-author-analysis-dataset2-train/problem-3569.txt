Seems like the question would be if OP's Mom is paid for travel, or only paid when on job site. Even if paid for travel time, it appears the vehicle is merely used for transportation, not actually a vehicle for hire.
Here in the UK it would be classified as "commuting" at the very least, but as the job involves driving between locations it's most likely business use.
Here when selecting insurance you have to specify what the car will be used for, the options are usually.
Commuting is driving to and from work, where as business is actually using the vehicle for work. As she is likely carrying cleaning supplies and tools between job locations, most insurance companies would treat it no differently than say a plumber using a company van to drive between sites.
If she only has personal and leisure insurance she certainly isn't insured, if she has commuting it'll come down to the specific wording of her insurance company.
US insurance does not have this determination, even if you are a ride share driver. Uber have an article which explains this well:
In the US you're covered by personal use policies on your way to and from work, and usually a long as you aren't literally using your car for hire as in a taxi. While this might be a grey area, as long as she is paid per house not hour her own insurance will cover it.
UK citizen residing in the US here. Insurance is not even vaguely similar. UK is quite strict when it comes to this stuff and you need business insurance if you’re doing more than driving to and from your place of work.
That said, it may be desirable for the business to have a company car policy to exclude the employer from liability whilst employees are driving between job sites. As you can see from the Uber article, that’s exactly what they (and many other employers) do.
