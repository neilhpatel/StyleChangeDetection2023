Oh, in a runoff where it would decide Senate control, no offense to Georgians, it's basically a coinflip.

Hear me Georgia? Please do the right thing. Christ if you even LIKE Herschel Walker vote against him. He’s the biggest rube they could find and he’s going to be SO unqualified and embarrassed.
Tommy couldn't even wait until the end of the swearing in to start grifting. He was asking McConnell about back door deals on a hot mic in the celebration rotunda.
Your state absolutely did the right thing before on not “finding” 11k votes (how tf does a President even think this).
However, if Catherine Cortez Masto can retain her seat in Nevada now, she alongside Kelly and Fetterman are the Democrats' 50th vote, meaning that the best sell Walker would have as to why it'd matter if he were elected is that he'd be able to be a 'moderating' presence against a Democratic majority.
In a runoff where Dems already have that majority, where Walker's the only candidate, I don't see Walker making a particularly strong case. He was carried this round on Election Day fervor and sharing the ticket with Brian Kemp.
