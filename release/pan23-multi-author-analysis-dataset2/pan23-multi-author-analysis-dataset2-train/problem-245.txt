Call the builder and open a claim with your insurance company asap. Is it normal in your area that this much water would be entering the basement right now?
No, it’s not normal. There are two pipes that run across my basement that are obviously drainage pipes and they plugged the drain they ran to and that’s the main cause for most of the water, it does leak a bit into my basement but there are inches of standing water in places.
Title: Recently had an inspection done on a brand new home, inspector capped a drain to test water pressure and never uncapped it.

I am confused at how capping a drain was related to water pressure. They are completely different sets of pipes. Water is pressurized on the supply side to get water to all your fixtures (showers, sink, appliences, etc.) It drains through unpressurized pipes using gravity to the sewer.
