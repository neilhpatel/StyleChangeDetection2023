Title: Speeding Ticket - offered point reduction offer if I plead guilty as opposed to fighting it in court. What would you recommend?
An attorney in your area upon reviewing the facts of their case against you would be the best route for an informed answer. Any answer here would be gross speculation. That offer could be amazing or it could be horrible.
Gotcha. I guess my concern is paying more than the actual ticket in hiring an attorney. Still, I'll do some looking around. The court date is March 3, so it's pretty soon.
You have short and long term considerations. Short term: Paying the ticket is likely the cheapest way to go. However long term impacts of a guilty x mph over conviction on your insurance might eventually end up to be a much higher number.
The points don't really matter where it hurts...which is the insurance increase. All your insurance carrier is going to care about is the guilty for 14mph over.
That being said, fighting this in court may be a losers game as well depending on the evidence. If it was me, I'd risk the 300 bucks for a consult and let them guide your decision.
Cops are subpoenaed to appear for these trials, they will show up unless they have some type of legitimate excuse.
Odds are that the plea deal you take will remove the speeding charge and will change it to a defective vehicle charge. If you have a legitimate case against the speeding ticket you can always take the chance, but understand if you choose to fight it in court you can face the full charge of the ticket.
