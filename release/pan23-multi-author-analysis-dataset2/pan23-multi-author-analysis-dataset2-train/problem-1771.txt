Ohio has state laws protecting you and your service dog and it looks like this includes allowing their dog to assault or injure your dog. Scroll down to Ohio.
First step you can take is contacting your 888-278-7101. Call them and ask them who enforces the state service animal laws and ask how do you file a complaint against someone who has broken the law by allowing their dog to assault your dog and render it unable to work.
Where are you, and did you report to the police and local animal control? As for small claims court, this is an interesting situation. Can the dog be re-trained to not be scared of the elevator? (No idea if that's a thing.) If not, how much would it cost to get a new trained dog? Talk a local attorney about possibilities. This might be a hard case to bring in small claims court, maybe not the right venue to make intangibles into tangibles.
Yes animal control issued her a warning and management is talking to her about the issue. The dog can likely be retrained but will need professional guidance. I asked her for 200 dollars to cover several lessons and she won’t even pay that. I don’t want to go to court but my dog is my lifeline and if he is afraid of elevators and other dogs, he cannot work in public. Location is Ohio.
this is Ohio legal aid. You can search for an office by location, or call the Ohio State Bar Association if there’s not one in your area. Ada.gov may also have some resources on legal aid. I’m so sorry this happened.
Right, that's why she owes you $200, through negligence. You mentioned $200 in retraining. If through her negligence you need to spend $200 then she owes you $200. If she won't pay then small claims court. But I'd imagine more than $200 plus the time and other expenses.
Yeah i was thinking that as well. I just don’t want to seem greedy. And I am not sure how to get the court to agree that this is necessary? But i will start with filing a claim on Monday.
