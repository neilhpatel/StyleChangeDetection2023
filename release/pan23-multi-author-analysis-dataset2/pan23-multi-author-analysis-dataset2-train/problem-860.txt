They handle claims less than 10K. I don’t think I will be qualified for small claims court because the bills is over 14K.
I'm not a lawyer or anything but if it were me I would send a letter certified that you don't agree with charges I'm assuming you took pics when you left maybe include them. If they don't let it go then go to your local courthouse and get small claims paperwork, there's usually a small fee to file save and document everything. Pictures communication between you and them everything. And include in the claim. Also there are usually instructions online or in court for how to fill out.
Yeah that may be tricky. Double check the limit in your area. I'm the actual courts websites. If the communications are you questioning charges or flat out denying you owe then I would use those. But 5 year later and they haven't put you to collections seems fishy. There may even be a limitation of some kind for that kind of stuff. Check your tenants rights in your area for deposits and damages.
You are not responsible for renovating a property you once lived in They can not charge for normal wear and tear If they renovated my guess is that’s what they wanted to do and are trying to bill you for it. Take to a small claims court because that’s not legal.
