In an interview after 9/11, I watched on TV (remember TV?) , I believe on 60 minutes, Musharif explained how President Bush Jr called him to open Pakistan’s airspace to the US in pursuit of 9/11 perpetrators, collaborators and financiers.
Musharif replied “_He told me …you will open your airspace, or we will bomb you into the stone age.”_.
With the exception of maybe China (maybe) the only real question in whether the US will militarily do something is whether they are ok with the consequences of that action. Musharif thought maybe they wouldn't be and W called his bluff. And maybe he was bluffing too but we'll never know.
As heated as the American public was at the time I think W was likely not bluffing. We were going in and anyone in our way was going to catch jdams all day til they weren't any longer.
I lean more towards "he would have fuckin' done it" as well, I was more just pointing out that the threat of the US acting on that kind of talk is never 0 because the capability is nearly always there. It's just a question of whether there is also the will and the willingness to deal with the consequences.
