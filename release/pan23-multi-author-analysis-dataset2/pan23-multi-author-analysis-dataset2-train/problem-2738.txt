You will have to get clarification from the bank about what would happen if direct deposits continue to come in under the decedent's name and the decedent's name has been taken out of the account. Technically the bank should deny the deposit if they only are checking by name. If you want the payments by direct deposit discontinued, you should notify the entity that is making the payments and inform them that no more payments should be sent to the particular account that they have the routing numbers for.
depends what the source of the payments is, many sources become invalid upon death, like social security if that money gets used after death they do notice and do pursue it.
pensions can have a provision to go to a spouse (maybe others too? ) upon the primary recipients death.
If you are referring to stimulus payments that belonged to the decedent or an income tax refund that belonged to the decedent, then those are very specific incidents. If you are not sure whether the joint account owner was entitled to receive those payments, you should first do your research.
The joint checking account ownership is also referred to legally as right of survivorship. When the primary accountholder died, everything automatically goes to the secondary accountholder.
