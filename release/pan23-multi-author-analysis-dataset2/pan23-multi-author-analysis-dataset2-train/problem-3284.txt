For the uninitiated: SWIM in internet parlance means Someone Who Is Me. Somehow, someone got the idea that the third word was 'isn't' and that posting 'SWIM' instead of 'I' or 'me' would be the one weird trick that prevents the FBI/DEA from arresting them. That someone is probably in federal prison.

Sorry, so I’m just concerned that they might bring up in court that there are messages regarding weed being sold to try and get me in trouble. The people who assaulted me are honestly pretty crazy, and it wouldn’t surprise me if they do something like that.
It may be a concern depending on why the assault occurred, how much weed was involved, etc., and imo those are things you probably shouldn't disclose here.
