For the cost of zero US soldiers, and almost no impact on the US economy, we've let Russia demote itself from near-peer, to completely irrelevant. That multi-polar world contest the DoD was preparing for? its gone. there is only one near-peer, they've never built an aircraft carrier and still can barely manufacture their own jet engines.
and we've 'given' about $20 billion worth of stuff we already had, like surplus hardware and training and other services, like satellite intelligence.
We got a unified NATO with two potential Scandinavian members, and most of the EU scrambling to start meeting their NATO military investment commitments. We all might be a little ambivalent about a re-armed Germany, but I'm glad they're on our side.
And on the matter of hardware from stocks, lets talk about 155mm shells. The US doesn't really use them much, because we have precision guided air-to-ground munitions. Where \_would\_ we use 155mm if we ever did? in a ground war against Russia in Europe. So we're allocating shells for the originally intended purpose, we're just using Ukrainian labor to fire them.
