Like you cannot delay this or else you will not have your child returned to you. Basically if a parent removes a child from their country of habitual residence, they have to return them but that can only take place if the application is made nearly immediately after the child is abducted.
You can contact the consulate near you and contact a US family law attorney in the area you reside in in the US. One with experience with out of country custody problems.
Ok listen if your wife still dosent let your daughter return, you need to contact Office of International Judicial Assistance (if you are resident of the US) ASAP. You may need to make an application under the Hague Convention 1980.
You cannot force her to return. You will have a difficult time forcing the child to return due to the child's age. If the child is safe in Brazil and wasn't abducted, judges are always hesitant to enforce Hague Act stuff. The law may be on your side, but I'm speaking only of practicalities for you here.
If she wants to live in Brazil, one of you is going to go loooong stretches without seeing the kid. It's going to be awful. I'm very sorry. As others have said, you need a Family Law attorney be with Hague Act experience asap. Like today. In Brazil and in your home city.
You may consider what is best for you and your child in this. Getting an enforceable order is good and you should do it. Actually trying to enforce it may be a different story, as you might be able to more effectively coparent with your (likely soon to be ex) wife the more amenable you are.
