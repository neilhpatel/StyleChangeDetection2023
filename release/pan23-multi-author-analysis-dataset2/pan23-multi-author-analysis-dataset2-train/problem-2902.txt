We have a meeting with one on Tuesday, but this Sunday is supposed to be nice so we were wanting to get the siding replaced then. I just don't want to get into a needless confrontation.
We already have the supplies, and were planning to do it before all this. Thought it might help going into court with their main concerns already resolved. I just want to know if there is anyway they could legally stop us from doing the repairs.
It's only a small section of the siding with holes, will only have to replace 3 or 4 planks of the lap siding. It really wasn't a lot of money and won't take a lot of time.
Are you 100% sure you haven't missed any, or your dad hasn't thrown them away before you got involved?
If so then you may have more of an argument in court, especially if you can show that once you were made aware of the issues you started sorting them.
They have already voted to proceed with the demolition so it will have to go to court. Yeah, no guarantee but we are really hoping the judge will see reason. The township never sent any notices of issues with the place, suddenly just sent the letter of intent to tear it down. At the hearing, refused to give us any chance to repair problems. It seems ridiculous and very unfair to me, but I am obviously biased.
