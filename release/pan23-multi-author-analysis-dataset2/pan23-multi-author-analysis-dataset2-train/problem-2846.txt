Of course. Japan is famous for having stupid fringe ideologies run amok (conspiracy nutjobs, fucked up sects and cults, and various related extremists etc).
Aum Shinrikyo, Pana-Wave Laboratory, Happy Science, ESP Kagaku Kenkyuujo, World Mate, RÃ¤elism, Scientology, Jehova's Witnesses, Ho No Hana Sanpogyo, Sukyo Mahikari, Shinji Shumeikai, Mahikari, Unification Church, Zenrinkyo, Makuya, Kurozumikyou, etc to just mention a very small fraction of them.
And that it's inspired by the Japanese 2ch to begin with, which hosts the dregs of society and just like 4chan has a looooong list of rapists, pedophiles, murderers, etc among its frequent users.
I for one am glad our groups in the US are dumber on average and probably think Sarin gas is what hybrid cars fuel up with. Aum Shinrikyo in the 90s was some scary shit.
More or less. However, the original owner sold the site at the peak of Gamergate, after his then-girlfriend was doxed.
Just to clarify (I think you had the correct intent) the person who shot him wasn't connected to the cult. He killed him because Abe was connected to the cult, as were an uncomfortable amount of politicians in the Japanese Diet.
