hey so i wrote this in a bit of a frenzy but for reference my shop is a woman’s vintage shop where i’m the model in the pictures. he did not buy any items that were not modeled on me which is why i said that. i also sell my art on there which he purchased as well. he would unfortunately not be able to deny the fact that he didn't know it was me.
hi an update: i got covid and the flu back to back and fell behind in school and wasn’t able to file a report w the police. two days before vday he now bought 1000 dollars from my sisters used clothes site. she wants to confront him via message function do you think there’s a way to ask a question or should we not engage and go to the police.
Cancel the purchases, refund the money, and make a formal report to the police in writing. They may not be able to do much as he can claim he didn't know je was purchasing from you, but having it in a formal file/complaint I'd the important part.
