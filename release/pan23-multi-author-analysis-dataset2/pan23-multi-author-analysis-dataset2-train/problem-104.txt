Are you asking if they are required, legally, to give you a more in depth or thorough interview than they did?
Well its more the fact that they did not really interview me for the position at all and the questions were not relevant to said position. I have hired for the company before and was told by HR that it was required to at least interview the candidates exactly the same but that might just be a company policy.
And FWIW, it's at least as likely to be an indication of "this guy is so obviously getting the job that the interview is a formality" as it is to be "we're required to interview this guy so just bring him in so we can blow him off.".
The reason I bring this up is the consistency of interviews. When I was learning to onboard and interview with the same company I was told that I had to ask all candidates the same questions and that I can be held legally liable for any discrimination.
There's absolutely no law in any state I have ever heard of that requires identical questions for all candidates for a position.
I guess the consistency is just a way for them to make sure the hiring managers are making good decisions when hiring.
I also have received emails that said we needed to complete the evaluation forms because someone was coming after the company for the same issue that I had.
Companies are allowed to reinterview you however they please even if you're requesting a transfer. Honestly you're not even entitled to the job.
