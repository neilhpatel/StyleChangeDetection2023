I wonder how Cook Political Report forecast the post-Dobbs elections in New York, Minnesota, Nebraska, Alaska, and Kansas? My prediction is that the Dobbs decision will increase turn out in women and younger people, and I think the polls will be proven to have been biased too much in the Republicans' favor. I'm with Michael Moore on this one.
Yup. People on this sub have been bitching about Manchin for the last two years, I'm sure they'll be happier with the Con that replaces him in 2024. Tester will probably lose too. That means the GOP will be pouring money into Ohio to oust Brown.
