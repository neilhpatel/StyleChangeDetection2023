Was just going to say this. Focus is notorious for tranny failure. 2012-2014 being the worst model years all around for the Focus. It was bound to happen. I too suggest trading it in.
Maybe just get it fixed and trade it in towards something more reliable before the tranny goes. It is worth your time to do research on major purchases like this.
Those transmissions are known for failure on the focuses. I don’t know if sold you a lemon is really what happened. You purchased a car without enough research. I don’t think that’s the dealerships fault.
Unfortunately, you bought the car “as is” can’t be considered a lemon as it is not “new”. My suggestion is to find another dealer that will take the car as they can take it to auction.
It is unethical because they sold a car with known transmission issues. Just because it is legal doesn’t make it ethical. Sure consumers have responsibilities to research before hand, but there should have been mention of this. This was clearly unethical and predatory behavior on the dealer’s part. At the very least, it’s extremely unfair and unjust to screw people in poverty out of hard earned money.
