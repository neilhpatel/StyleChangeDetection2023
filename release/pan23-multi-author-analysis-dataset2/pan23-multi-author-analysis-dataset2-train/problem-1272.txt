I've definitely seen other people say that they didn't notice it. I don't regularly do the crossword so I didn't look at it until I'd already been warned by this article, but it did actually take me a minute to see - something about my brain not being sure where in the design I should be looking for the swastika. (The black empty space? White space? Etc.).
Yup. And ever since he got his God Complex (a loooong time ago), he is using his brain for nefarious and selfish acts.
The problem is that there are so many people here in Israel who actually feed his god complex. Ugh... It's so damn frustrating.
What are you trying to say? It seems to me the person complaining about Don Jr is the one who doesn't understand. Rich people get to use any excuse. Poor go to prison.
It is bullshit in both instances. Negligence shouldn't be get out jail free card for people working in the federal government, and I don't give a shit what color tie or skirt they wear.
So, it's pretty clear to me how the NYT didn't catch it, given that there were probably only a small number of people doing any sort of checking. And while the NYT has been accused of having swastika-shaped puzzles before, if you check out the one that was supposedly swastika-shaped in 2017, it... doesn't look anything like a swastika. So I wouldn't be surprised if this was just not a concern on their radar (though hopefully it will be now).
Notice how in the article mentions that the constructor called it a "whirlpool shape". One way they might not have seen it is, the constructor sent it in with notes mentioning how it was shaped like a whirlpool. Sometimes when someone tells you an association like that, it "infects" your brain - and you wind up not seeing other possible interpretations.
