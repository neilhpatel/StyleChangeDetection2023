Which means thereâ€™s a fundamental process issue with how staffers and the national archives personnel process official records after someone leaves office.
And further demonstrates the difference in how individuals respond once classified material is found among those records.
At least we all can agree someone should be tracking these documents and making sure they are returned. In fact I see no reason for classified docs to ever leave an official office.
The way I see other politicians, whether it be Adam Schiff or whatnot, is that these records are to be carefully viewed and protected, and while it's not cool being next to Biden's Corvette, or Pence's playhouse.... there is a damn difference between that and what and how Trump handled this... Hell, remember he was trying to make a "deal" for them? wtf?
But you are so correct... the fact these things are just walking out of there is ridiculous on all parts...
Some of the criminality may have occurred prior, but that is not the way Merrick Garland's wording on the search warrant and whatnot read at all....
I'm not a Mike Pence apologist, nor do I think he is a hero for doing his job on January 6th, but his cooperating and getting in front, as well as Joe Biden's, have NOTHING to do with the criminality of Donald Trump.
