What do you mean by "paternal agreement?" Because that is not really a thing. If you mean prenuptial agreement, that can't include anything related to child custody or support. It's for assets only.
The issue with an agreement like this is that many of the rights it addresses are the rights of your future children, not you or your wife alone. You cannot contract those rights away on behalf of your kids. For example, a contract purportedly controlling custody can be set aside in the interests of the child having a relationship with both parents.
As I said, you cannot make any enforceable agreement about child custody or support in a prenuptial agreement. Or postnuptial agreement, for that matter.
I feel like I'm not being clear? You can't make ANY enforceable agreement about child custody or support before such an agreement is needed -- which would be at the time you separate.
You can write down whatever you want, and if you're both willing to abide by it at the time, great. But if either of you doesn't want to follow it after a separation, a court will not enforce it. It doesn't matter what you call it or when you enter into it, if it's prior to a separation, period, full stop, it's not enforceable in a court of law.
Agreements regarding child support/custody are not legally valid if (a) the children donâ€™t exist and (b) you are still married and intend to remain married.
It doesn't matter what you call the agreement or what hypothetical future children it applies to. It will not be legally binding or enforceable in any way.
