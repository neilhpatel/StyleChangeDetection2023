You are fine. Remove the material from your computer and just stay on the well lit parts of the internet from now on. You learned your lesson.
Your ISP has a record of your activity, even if you've wiped your drive. They probably don't have the content (unless you downloaded from a non-secure server), but they have the IP addresses.
Key thing missing here is clearly intent to break the law/obtain illegal material. Especially if the content was mislabeled as you stated.
I would not speculate how likely the law is to act on this or even how likely it is to have drawn that kind of attention. But I would definitely delete this thread.
Remove the material from your computer, don't tell anyone, go back to browsing the Internet normally. And maybe stay off the darkweb for a while.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
