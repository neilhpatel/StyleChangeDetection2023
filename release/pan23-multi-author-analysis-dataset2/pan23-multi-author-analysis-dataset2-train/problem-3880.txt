You can request an accommodation under the association provision of the ADA. Whether or not it is going to be considered reasonable in your situation is indeterminable but the avenue for the request is there.
I feel my current management staff will help me out regardless of any legally binding paperwork. I am just trying to set myself up for protections if there are any staff changes or things start sliding back to the way they were.
I truly believe it would have minimal impact on operations. There are other avenues and employees that can make sure these things are done correctly and promptly. But by nature of it being an accommodation, it will obviously have some.
I came across the association provision when I tried looking it up myself. But I read it as an employer cannot deny employment based on a relationship with a person with disabilities. The examples given being; HIV positive friend or family member or a relative with a disability that may lead to an FMLA leave in the future. I didn't see any language establishing reasonable accommodations at the job site the same if the employee themself was afflicted.
