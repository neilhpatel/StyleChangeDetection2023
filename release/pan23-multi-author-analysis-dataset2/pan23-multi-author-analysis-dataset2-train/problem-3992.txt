How much did Germany invest in Nordstream vs Russia. I got the impression the end result was Russia investing a huge wad of cash for no benefit. Not saying Germany was smart to think Russia was a good long term partner but it seems like it turned into a sucker punch.
Bud, the western world put bookends on Russian ambitions with just money. I know china is complicated in a way that's indescribable, but they can also shut the fuck up about a little island that has almost nothing to do with them. Spend money, use diplomacy, and use force when necessary. Taiwan matters a lot symbolically. That's tough to deal with. It's at least as important as Ukraine.
'Little island' with one of the most transparent democracies in the world. 'Little island' that fabs 90% of the world's semiconductors. 'Little island', who goes to war and renders the supply chains of the world's most advanced weapons broken.
This 'little island' is the lynchpin of our modern life and matters a lot more than just symbolically.
