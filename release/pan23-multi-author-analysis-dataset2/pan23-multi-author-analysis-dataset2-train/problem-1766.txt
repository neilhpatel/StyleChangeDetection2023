You can't just "break the news" to them. They (and management) have to agree. There's no unilateral move possible. If they do not sign the paper, you owe rent until the end of the lease. And it really depends on the piece of paper in question, what it says, as to what happens if they do sign it.
Good point. I'll clarify-- it's a deletion form that will need to be signed by both of us. It just says that I'll be deleted from the lease when that form is turned in along with the $100 deletion fee. The property management people explained to me that once it is turned in, I'll be removed from the lease. I figured I've screwed myself by telling my roommate that I'll pay May rent under the condition that they sign this paper, but I just want to make sure. Because I hate them. So much.
End of July. If it doesn't get signed, I'm not entirely sure what to do. I don't want to pay rent for a place I'm not living in, and I don't want to be financially responsible for the damage they're doing to the house. I would have to find a way to get them out. They genuinely make me feel uncomfortable and while I do have pictures of the damage they're doing and the drug paraphernalia they leave in common areas, I don't have proof of the incident that is provoking my move. Any advice if it falls through?
Good point, thanks Sorry if this was dumb. This is only like my 3rd roommate ever and I don't really have a good frame of reference for what I'm experiencing. Thanks so much for your help.
