Sure. I assume you have an actual legal name to go with that cell. Because cell numbers are like underwear now a days. Some people change them daily... but not everyone.
This is a long-standing scam (all over much of the world, and going back decades.) The gist of it is:
had like half a dozen boxes of 5.1 home theater system in the back of his truck. said his bosses would just give them to his golf buddies. thrusted a stsck of papers with $500 shipping prices. idk what i was looking at. they were good actors ig. said it's a $2k system. pulled up on me in a parking lot after going to get some glasses fixed. followed me to the bank and i gave them cash for a speaker. their urgency was a huge red flag but i have made decent money flipping electronics before, albeit normally ones i can actually google. this brand doesn't seem to be legit. there are a few of these listed on ebay but i saw none had sold.
They'll show the victim ads, brochures, "magazine reviews" or invoices with a grossly-inflated price, while charging the victim some amount far less, usually $400. They only take cash.
It's a slick scam, because the merchandise is not, in fact, embezzled/stolen, but since the victim thought it was, they are reluctant to go to the police. And the merchandise functions on some level, so the police (if anybody bothers to contact them) are more likely to consider it just a routine consumer dispute instead of outright fraud. The vans are rentals, which makes it far more difficult to find out who the perpetrators are. And the scams are highly-mobile; by the time the police get enough complaints, they've moved on to the next town.
The victim will be approached by some guys in a van (always a white van, both because they are non-descript, and because most of them are rentals.) Maybe there will be a magnet affixed to the side with a generic business name. (usually a fake one).
