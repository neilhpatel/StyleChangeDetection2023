I forgot where it was, but at the height of the anti-mask madness, a county level health department official got a threatening email that included photos of her daughter playing on a playground - kids aren’t “off limits” to the alt-right. Children are just another screw to twist so they can intimidate people.
Caroline seems like a sweet kid. I can't imagine what she's going through in that household, being bi and living with bigots, being used as an excuse when flyin' Ted Cruz abandoned his constituents in a crisis, and being front and center on that float as the crowd jeered and threw things.
I really doubt his daughter would describe him as "strange". Probably more like "craven", "abusive" and "disgusting".
I hope she pulls through, hunkers down for a few more years, and gets rich off of a scathing tell-all.
