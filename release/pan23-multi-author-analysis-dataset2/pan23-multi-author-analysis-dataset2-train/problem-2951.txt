Check to see if you can find a property damage attorney. They are going to most likely know how to get things started to help you and to see if you have a case against the city.
As for the asbestos, the seller of the property honestly could of not know their was asbestos. A lot of time with these tiles and even wood, if it’s not disturb then you don’t need to wor try about it. But most likely the contractor tested it as it’s an older tile and since it came back positive you would need an asbestos company to remove the damaged items. There are usually laws for this type of demo as well with putting up plastic barriers and all that. I don’t think you would have much of a case against the seller, unless you can 100% prove they knew the tile had asbestos. But just timing over it won’t be it.
I don't like public adjusters much but they are an option, especially in a situation like this. It is disingenuous to say that they don't have uses in specific circumstances; while the insd might be able to get everything on their own, they need much more knowledge than the typical non-insurance person has to do so. A PA is not the first or second step to resolution and should be utilized as a last resort. The PA won't take the file if there's no money in it for them aka there is no coverage.
