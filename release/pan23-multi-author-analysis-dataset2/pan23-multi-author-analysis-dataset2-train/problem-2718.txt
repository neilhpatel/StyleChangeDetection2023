I mean, there's nothing that you can do to get that money right now. Speak to a manager when they are at work and alert them to the issue.
If they refuse to correct and insist you did not work that day, you can file a wage claim with the Department of Labor for your state.
Not a lawyer, but I work in HR. When there's a mistake in payroll, we always confirm with the manager. I would speak to your manager and ask him to correct it with HR.
Failing that, if they insist you didn't work, as was mentioned by /u/PM_ME_HOLE_PICS file a wage claim with the Department of Labor.
I have a video cause somebody threw up right next to my press and they wpuldnt clean it up but as im new and this place is extremely unorganized I plan on looking for a different job that cares a little more about their employees i just kinda needed the full paycheck today but seems it wont happen sorry for format am on mobile.
Because it was my second day on the job i didnt have a clock in card yet and my manager was suppised to clock me in they didnt even know my name when i went in this week. They are saying i was a no call no show which is automatic termination but i worked 3 days this week since my supposed no call no show.
They have to have a shift tracker where you clock in and out. Did you ever clock in? That has to be marked somewhere. That's how they add up hours and overtime.
