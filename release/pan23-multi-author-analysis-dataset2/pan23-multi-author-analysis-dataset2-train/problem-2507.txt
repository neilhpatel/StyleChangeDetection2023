They’ve been sanctioned to the point that most people rely on grasshoppers as their primary source of protein. Other than invading them and overthrowing the Kim regime, there is nothing left to do to them.
The reason for sanctions on those governments are also all different. Cuba is because of communism and internal US political pressure (Cuban immigrants and the right), Russia is because of the war in Ukraine, and North Korea is because of the truly awful way they treat their citizens and their constant threats to nuke their enemies. Those aren't the sole reasons, and the original reasons may be different, but those are the main reasons (even if the US won't admit it regarding Cuba).
Cuba and North Korea are entirely different situations. NK has more in common with Russia than Cuba. This applies to how they treat their citizens, their culture, and how the government works.
Not advocating it at all. I’ve actually spent 2 years of my life in the Middle East, been apart of those failures, and seen friends lives change for the worse as a consequence. However, it has worked more times than it has failed for the US.
