In 2012 the RNC ran a "post mortem" on Mitt Romney's failed presidential campaign; they concluded that Republicans needed to step up outreach to socially conservative Latino voters, there was ground there for them to gain...
They started moving that direction in 2014, but then the extreme right-wing won more races and started fighting against the plan... Which led to Trump being elected and the plan was essentially set on fire and forgotten.

The autopsy for 2022 is likely to come to the same conclusions, but because the extreme right-wing of the GOP still essentially holds the reins of power in the party; nothing is going to come of it.
