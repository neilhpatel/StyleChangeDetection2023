It makes sense (for safety reasons) for them to prevent you from having the toys, even if you think/know they are safe and harmless.
If you're being taken into custody by the police for mental health reasons, it's nearly always going to be because of a suicide attempt.
I could probably run over and break my fingers with my wheelchair, if this happens again should they take that too? I get it’s only their job but if that’s the attitude people can seriously hurt themselves with their own teeth.
It may seem silly to you but a person who is set on hurting themselves (or others) will use anything at their disposal. Plastic, glass, metal, cloth... doesn’t matter, everything is taken away for safety concerns.
It was literally a baby toy, a cat figurine and one of those game things you press buttons and try to get the rings on the things?? Lmao sorry idk how else to explain that but I’d 100% understand if they were glass or something but I couldn’t even swallow the cat lol I really don’t know how any of those could be dangerous in any way.
