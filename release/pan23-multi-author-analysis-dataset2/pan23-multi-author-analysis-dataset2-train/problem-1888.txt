Whether that system has election every year, every sixth year or something else - and whether it has a provision to expel by 2/3 majority or to recall or not - that is irrelevant to the principle. The Pro-Lie politicians have the right to stand at the election, and it is up to the voters to choose between the Lying Scumbags party candidate and the Decent Honest party candidate. If Lying Scumbags carry the election, then random redditors just don't have the standing to demand the election overthrown.

Any two variables can be represented by a curve. The fact that empirical data doesn't support the hand wavy extension of Laffer's curve doesn't change the fact that it's a real curve. With real ink (or pixels) and everything.
Well yeah, in the sense that a guy name Laffer came up with the curve and told everybody about it. I guess that makes it real, in the same way that flat earth theory is "real.".
