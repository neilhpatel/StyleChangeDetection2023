I think it's very unlikely that Chang Frick paid Paludan's permit it to further a Russian agenda, and I'm saying this as a person who very much dislikes him, his politics and pretty much everything he does. He's just anti-Muslim and anti-Turkey, and possibly racist.
Afaik, Chang suggested that Paludan burned a Turkish flag, not a quran. The quran was Paludan's idea, and that's what he's been doing for years. At least from all I've heard from him when he was active here in Denmark, I'm pretty sure he would've done what he did at some point either way. At most, Chang nudged him to protest it at the right place and time.
The first instance of this proved to be Kremlin-orchestrated. To irritate Turkey (which it did) in order to influence Erdogan on Sweden's acceptance into NATO (which it did).
Chang Frick has indeed had ties with Russia and been pro-Russia in the past, but he has been critical of Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and he's is currently supporting Ukraine, at least publicly.
