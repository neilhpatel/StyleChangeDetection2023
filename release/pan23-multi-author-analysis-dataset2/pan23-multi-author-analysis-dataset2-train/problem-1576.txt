Automation is here to make our work more complex and not shorter! Work 14 hours then drink 3 hours with your boss after then commute 2hrs every day then sleep 3 hours after eating and internet. Also dont forget to pay taxes and have kids, gg no you cant have more money yes everything is double in 5 years time. Please tho have kids and no i wont pay you for them.
Parts are but not most of it. There's about a dozen clusters of super dense skyscrapers, but by land area the vast majority of metro Tokyo is single-family homes. Drop a pin on Google Maps and chances are it's going to be on a quiet street with buildings that are 2-3 stories tall.
Go to west Tokyo and tell me itâ€™s crowded. People really seem to think Tokyo is one small area around Shibuya Crossing or something.
went to Japan for the 1st time just before covid. arrived at Narita, got on the shuttle bus. watched the bus hop on the highway and started conversating to pass the time. was absolutely shocked that after 2 entire hours on the highway in very light traffic that we were still in tokyo.
Out of curiosity what is the theoretical max a current tokyo resident can earn from the government? Between the Japanese government paying people to leave tokyo, paying people to drink more, and paying people to have kids, and I'm sure some other programs.
