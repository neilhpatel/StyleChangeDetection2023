Modern hydrogen bombs don't irradiate, they just vaporize and create shock waves. If that were to happen, I'd rather be in the center than be a survivor.
I get what you're saying and I agree, though. There is definitely a zone of hell, and I'd rather be farther inside or farther outside, for sure.
Modern hydrogen bombs detonate a half a mile or so above ground level. It creates way less radioactive isotopes than the older cold war bombs. They are typically three stage, which uses fusion triggers to create fission, hence higher yield of energy given the amount of fuel source.
You do know that in order to detonate a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb and create the temperatures and pressures necessary for fusion you have to build it inside of a fission bomb with traditional radioactive material like plutonium or uranium right? Hydrogen bombs still have radiation, though I’ll be honest I don’t know the difference in radiation levels between a straight up fission bomb or a fusion bomb detonated by fission.
So far there haven’t been any documented FSB leaks and, further, FSB would likely have minimal insight into Putin’s nuclear calculus.
The headline reads like it’s probably more of the weird fan fiction that racecar driver releases on Twitter.
Air allows the energy to spread quickly. The closer to the ground the more you are wasting energy in pushing all that excess matter, and all the nasty isotopes of uranium, cesium, thorium, iodine, etc.
