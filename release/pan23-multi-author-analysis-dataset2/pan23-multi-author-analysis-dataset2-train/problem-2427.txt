Is the value of the vehicle (if it was working) anywhere near the amount of the loan plus the repair cost? An easy way out if the lender approves it is to essentially give the car away with the new owner taking over the loan.
IANAL You do have the option of just letting the car be repossessed. You just stop making the payment. The bank will repossess the car, sell it, and come back to you for any difference between the loan balance and the amount the car sold for. This will certainly have a negative impact on your credit rating, so this should be your last option.
Optionally, you could try to find a place to park the vehicle while you continue to make your payments. Based on your balance, this could be quite a long time. You may have to move it occasionally, so that it does not get towed. Do you know anyone who will let you park it on their property?
One more option. Since the balance is so much more than the value of the car, you could repair the vehicle and continue to drive it until the loan is paid.
