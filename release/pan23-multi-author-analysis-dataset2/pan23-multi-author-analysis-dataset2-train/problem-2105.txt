I'm aware of that. Why offer to let me move in then? I did everything we agreed to when I moved in. Signed it and everything. She was told by her mechanic that I need to sell my car and we both knew that I need a car to get around and she actively prevented me from selling my own car and buying a new one. Threatened to call the cops on me and proceed to kick me out. After kicking me out I developed plantar facitis and the bone spurs and flat feet from all the walking I was doing from being homeless and struggling financially to get my life together. I want her to help take responsibility for my injury because she in part caused it. She won't listen to me.....I'm just trying to not be in pain and no one can help me or cares.
She offered you a roof and tried to help with a car that anyone could tell you want worth the money to get it running again.
She had and still has no obligation to provide a roof or any support. No one is required to help you. it's called help for a reason. If they had to do it or would be law.
You need therapy and a new foot doctor. But no one is going to pay you because your life went to shit. No one is required to make sure your life doesn't go to shit other than yourself.
