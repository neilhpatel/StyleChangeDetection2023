They blurred out half of the sign, and it alters the message a lot. Definitely not representative of what I️ was protesting. So i feel as if I’m being misrepresented without my permission.
I’ve been a pro photographer/videographer for 35 years. I doubt they altered your sign. Far more likely is that part of your sign was blown out and the camera sensor could not handle the brightness. This very common, is different from glare, but similar. It can look odd sometimes depending on the sensor type.
Does the change harm you in some way? Does it misrepresent your position? Does it expose you to reputational or financial damage?
If you want to get the law involved, your best bet is probably to call your local bar association or browse their website to get a consult with a defamation attorney, which will cost you a few dozen dollars. If you have any hint of a case, they'll probably suggest a cease and desist letter, which will cost you a few hundred dollars but will probably get the new station to take the photo down or prove that it was glare. If you don't have a case, the lawyer will say so and you should listen.
Ok. I'm not a lawyer and am not familiar with Utah law in this area, but you might, with emphasis on the might, have a claim for defamation if you have damages (meaning that you have been harmed financially or by reputation to the degree that people are less likely to do business with you or to hire you).
