Your renter's insurance is a condition precedent, meaning you have to do it before they must perform under the contract.
Are you under the impression that you could have purchased a renter's insurance policy, and refused to give them proof? Could you just say, I have it, I'm not required to prove it, give me the keys?
If not, then verification was an expectation. Just as if you had mailed it the day of, if they didn't receive it, it can't be verified.
No, only that by emailing my proof of insurance before business open and trying to collect keys after business close- I fulfilled my obligation per the lease.
Typically a court is going to look at what is reasonable under the circumstances, so the question is, is it reasonable for you to email same day and expect it to be received. I would assume the answer is no.
Why post a question and argue with everyone who gives you an answer. There's zero chance you make a recovery in any court for what you're claiming. The landlord acted reasonably.
And I’m arguing because as it turns out, I’m right. I spoke with two local tenant lawyers who both agreed I can ask for moving fees to be reimbursed.
I'm an attorney, I've done quite a few landlord tenant matters, and I don't agree. I would take your case and make a principled argument for you as long as you're paying my hourly fee, because I don't think it's frivolous. But by the same token, I would advise you that I don't think you're likely to make a recovery.
That's not the issue, as I stated above. During the Covid pandemic my state allowed service of motions, not process, by email. Guess what, you still needed to add days, just like mail, to allow people to receive it. (e.g. - 10 days to answer + 3 days to receive it = 13 days until response due).
