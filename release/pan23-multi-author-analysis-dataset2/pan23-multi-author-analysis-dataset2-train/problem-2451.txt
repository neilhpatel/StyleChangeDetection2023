Is it possible that one of the plants that he is growing is honeysuckle or another invasive plant? Honeysuckle can grow up trees, so if you kill the honeysuckle it can look like some of the tree’s leaves are dying. And honeysuckle grows through runners underground, so spraying some of the sprouts on your side could weaken the plant over on his side. If it’s an invasive plant like honeysuckle, though, then most municipalities would allow you to kill any portions that came on your property, even if they harmed the portions on someone else’s property. Municipalities are generally more worried about invasive species spread than they are about property damage disputes over nuisance plants. Also, generally, anything that could be killed by spraying 20ft away is invasive (I.e., was in the process of spreading at least 20ft away). There may be some delicate plants that are exceptions to that, though, so that might be something a future lawyer would work through with you.
Yes, if your actions are contributing to the death of your neighbor’s plants, they can definitely sue you for the cost of replacing them. Additionally, Roundup isn’t meant to be applied in bulk, you can just use a small spray on an individual plant to kill it with little to no overspray.
