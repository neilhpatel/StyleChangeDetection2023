... because Kanye was at the same dinner, making this that statement allowed me to imply Kanye was a white supremest, something that while not entirely true, does call out Kanye for his recent racist and anti-semitic statements with a measure of sarcasm and humor as long as I don't have to explain it...
There is a deference between talking shit about someone, and denouncing their antiemetic behavior. True, Trump had talked trash about Kanye, but it was to call him crazy for daring to think he could run against or with Trump. Not one word about his views on death on level threats to Jews. Plus, as posted below, what does that have to do with Fuentes?
Trying to say he didn’t even know who Fuentes was. Wouldn’t he need to be known to the USSS since he is in close contact with Trump? If not, then Trumps whole argument about securing all those classified docs falls apart even more. Randos walking around him doesn’t sound very secure to me.
In that context I will concede that’s pretty funny and I will probably steal it in some form. Sorry it’s getting harder and harder to tell humor from legit nutbars.
Man it's like Kanye is writing these replies.... Cause he has no sense of humor. This was just an opportunity to employ sarcasm to call Kanye a white supremacists cause humor.
