Not as much legal advice to start but...learn from this. By not telling your parents when it occurred, you have possibly made things much worse, depending on who this person is and who he represents. If you were on your parents’ insurance policy, they will need to be involved if there is a claim by the other driver. If that occurs, their insurance company will contact them and your efforts to conceal this will only look worse for you. And they could seriously harm your parents’ interests: Depending on what happens they could be accused (incorrectly, as they were apparently never informed but nonetheless) as committing insurance fraud if they deny an accident took place in one of their insured vehicles. Their rates could well go up, they could lose their coverage, they could be sued and this policy may not protect them anymore. If someone claims injury they could lose a judgment for real money. Accidents happen and owning up to one’s mistakes is a sign of maturity. Legal advice: Tell your parents the truth and let them help unravel this, before it gets any worse.
If there were no injuries and no damage to any property, why was there a report? Was this report made to the insurance company or to the police? Something isn't adding up here.
You said you were there. It's it really that hard to imagine that the other party wouldn't take down the license plate, which would track back to you?
Or that your friend gave them his contact info and they just recently called him and got your name and info?
