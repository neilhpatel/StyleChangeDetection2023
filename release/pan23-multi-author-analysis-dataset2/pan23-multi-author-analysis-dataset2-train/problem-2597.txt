Wealthy people often involve law firms and the trust departments of large banks in their estate planning, either one of which can provide desired oversight (and in some cases be the executor). That level of estate planning can involve significant fees so would need to make sense given what you think the value of your estate would be.
Everything I found online seems to indicate that they're bound to do it but I'm just a little paranoid and I'm not familiar with the process.
Do you know what mechanisms or who is responsible for ensuring the executor is executing the Will as written? (That person X received Y, etc).
Thanks for taking the time. I'm not familiar with the probate process. If all my assets are liquidated and my debts paid, what's stopping the executor from taking that money and distributing it however they please?
If it goes through probate then the probate court judge has jurisdiction over the estate, but normally a judge won't look behind what's filed in court unless someone objects. There is no third party with the duty of routinely checking (i.e., with no one complaining about something) to verify that executors are acting appropriately.
Also should mention - lots of people give copies of their wills to multiple people (friends, family, the people they intend to inherit, etc.). If you're worried about an executor failing to carry out your wishes, it makes sense for a bunch of people to know what your wishes are and to have a copy of your documents.
