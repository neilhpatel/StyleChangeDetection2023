There’s a debate about the proposed vote for self determination (or statehood) with some saying only indigenous people(the Chamorro people) and their descendants should vote on it, which is argued to be racially discriminatory. Not to mention that the island is home to huge Filipino, Micronesian, and other Asian populations who would be left out.
The previous referendums have shown that 53% of Puerto Rican’s want statehood out of half of registered voters. It’s not as clear cut as many people think.
That’s not exactly correct. The question on the 2020 referendum was, “Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?” Voting no does not mean keeping the status quo, it means any option other than statehood. It could mean independence, in addition to status quo.
Now you want to lump together statehood and status quo. My original comment was about statehood alone. The results are not as clear cut as you’re making them out to be. You don’t address free association either, which is one of the options here. It’s a complicated situation and it’s not just statehood, status quo, or independence.
