Ammunition is pretty limited still. The US has already given something like 100 M777s and they use the same caliber. The US buys like 100k 155mm shells a year, while the consumption rate in Ukraine has been many thousands per day during the fiercest fighting. US doctrine was never focused around mass artillery shelling so they don't have huge stocks of ammunition, and I'm unsure of how much the US is willing to deplete its reserves. There is work being done to expand production in the US and Europe, so that will hopefully alleviate the problem. You are right that the US could supply many of the guns themselves, several hundred is certainly realistic.
With how bad Russia's communication and command, you have to wonder, even if Russia was completely honest about a cease fire, if they could even communicate to the front lines to cease fire.
The Central Asians are more than a little rooting for Ukraine. They likely assume two things (1) if Russia is successful in Ukraine they're likely on the menu too; and (2) do to geography they can't expect significant or likely any outside help.
