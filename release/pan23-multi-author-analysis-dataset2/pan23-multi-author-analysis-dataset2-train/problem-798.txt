In this case, you are not a tenant within the meaning of Ontario's Residential Tenancy Act because you live with the owner's child. So the Residential Tenancy Act does not apply. The RTA is what provides most protections to tenants.
However, the common law (i.e. judge made law, created by centuries of legal precedent, does). Under teh common law, a landlord must provide "reasonable notice" to end a tenancy. There is no fixed definition for what is "reasonable". It depends on the circumstances, but most judges find that one rental period (so here, 1 month) is usually reasonable.
What intrigues me is she's saying you're not tenants. That suggests to me she's just been taking your money under the table, without reporting the income on her taxes. She could get in biiiiig trouble for that.
She has been, also without letting ODSP know that she has been receiving the income. Honestly, weâ€™re at our wits end with her and have been looking for a place since the end of 2018, but rent is crazy high in my area.
in this case, what matters is Ontario's Residential Tenancy Act. It doesn't apply if you live with the landlord or the landlord's child, and share a kitchen/bath with them. OP and her boyfriend are not tenants within the meaning of the RTA as a result. They have common law protections but no statutory ones.
