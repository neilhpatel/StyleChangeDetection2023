A deal with between the EU and Mercosur has been on the table for so long but never quite seems to materialise. Though this is a good way for Lula to frame it, it would give Mercosur leverage versus the Chinese negotiating position (which is something that's in the EU's interest as well).
We have in Europe lots of registered brands and foods and drinks with names you cannot use. Champagne, cheeses and other geographic related names. In some South American countries you have brands selling stuff with the same name that cannot be sold in the EU. France is the biggest claimer because it protects it's luxury brands tooth and nail, but almost every European country has some some of veto against the free trade agreement. This happens with all trade agreements, not only this one.
Can you explain this further? Because I think I read that the French were not happy with the US Inflation Reduction Act because they considered it protectionist as well (and it'll hurt their economy). It seems a bit two-faced?
