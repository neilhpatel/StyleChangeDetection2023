Sure, get everything they do on video. Every interaction. You need to make a strong case for their harassment and any other illegal activities you can catch them doing.
I'd go to talk to the local cops. Sometimes there is a community liaison officer. Explain that a neighbor keeps making false reports on you to harass you due to a previous parking dispute and you want advice. Three things might happen - they might go talk to the neighbor and tell them to knock it off or they might put a note in your address, so the cops know this is ongoing harassment. Or they might do nothing. NAL but family member who is a cop gave me this advice when I read your post to him. Also, forgot - cameras.
I would also invest in some cameras for outside. I would blanket your entire property, and record everything you can see from your house. That implies that if you are recording your driveway and see their house, it's legal to record their house.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
