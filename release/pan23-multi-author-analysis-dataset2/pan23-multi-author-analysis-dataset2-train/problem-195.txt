Despite the legality (or illegality) of doing so, blocking someone's vehicle in is a horrible idea, and your apartment/rental manager likely has zero legal authority to tell you it's ok to do so.
The only reason to block a car in is if that car is trying to leave, and if they're trying to leave, then no tow is necessary. And if they ram into you trying to leave, that's likely a criminal act, maybe even one on your part, and that would be a matter for the police, not your landlord.
This seems to me like it's taking a bad parking situation and potentially turning it into a disaster situation. I'm incredulous that a landlord would even write something like this.
How is this "billing" thing going to work? How will the landlord know how much to bill for? Is the landlord the one that's going to be doing this billing? Are they going to bill the tenant, then... what, cut you a check? Hand you cash? Work with your insurance? Keep the money? What if the tenant refuses to pay? What if they're not even a tenant at all, and merely someone's unknown guest?
Thatâ€™s not a bad idea. In Texas property managers have the right to boot. The reality is this stuff usually happens late at night when managers are home for the evening.
The only reason to block a car in is to prevent it from leaving. If they're trying to leave, problem resolved itself, and you can remind the person driving the car that they can't park on your property.
