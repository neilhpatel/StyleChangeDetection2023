The current case is literally a direct challenge to Section 230. The supreme court is being asked in this case to determine whether the immunity granted to big tech by Section 230 also extends to platforms when they are not just hosting content but also making “targeted recommendations of information”. The tension is also heightened because both sides of politics have counter arguments - that the platforms should both be less aggressive in content moderation but also at the same time they should be more liable when they don't moderate content enough. Republicans claim that platforms have suppressed conservative viewpoints while Democrats are arguing that the platforms’ algorithms are amplifying hate speech and other harmful content. That doesn't really sound perfectly compatible.
I don’t think you understand what “recommendations” really are. It’s all a black box, and google of any other tech company that uses algorithms to “recommend” user-generates content have no idea what’s actually being pushed other than broad trends. And they make money off people looking at ads not the videos. I don’t think your point holds up when these things are considered.
