When I got my concealed, as I understood it, the general rule in FL was without it you were not allowed to have access to it while driving.
Ie, it had to be locked up and out of your reach. That was some years ago, so I may be off base on current rulings.
Also, personal non legal advice here, having lived in Miami, don't have a holster of any kind visible in your car. It'll make you a target when you come back to your vehicle if and when someone sees it, empty or not.
Keep your windows up, doors locked, and don't be an asshole and that will remove most issues while driving.
You can carry your firearm in a car with a Florida Concealed Weapons License or a CCW permit from a state that Florida honors. Without a permit, the firearm or other weapon must be securely encased or otherwise not readily accessible for immediate use. “Securely encased” means in a glove compartment, locked or unlocked; snapped in a holster; in a gun case, locked or unlocked; in a zippered gun case; or in a closed box or container which requires a lid or cover to be opened for access.
I’ve read the statute, but I also read somewhere that if it is in a holster, it has to be a full coverage holster with something over the top of the gun like a snap flap or other covering. I just can’t find anything to back that up.
I’m getting my CCW, but I start the job next week and feel rather naked in that neighborhood without a piece. I definitely will get it squared away PDQ though.
