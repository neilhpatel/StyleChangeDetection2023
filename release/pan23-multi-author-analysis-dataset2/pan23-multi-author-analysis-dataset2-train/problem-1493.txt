The first answer is that neither of you received tax returns, you received refunds. A tax return is what you send to the IRS.
The second answer is that a $2,500 refund is bad planning. It should be as close to $0 as possible. You can ask more about how to maximize your income vis-a-vis taxes on /r/personalfinance.
The third answer is that we have no idea how he could get such a large refund. Presumably he paid a lot more in taxes throughout the year than he owed. Or it's tax fraud. Someone would have to review his taxes and verify his supporting documentation to know for sure. But if $2,500 is bad (and it is) then a legit $8,000 is more than three times as bad.
A tax refund (not return!) is what you receive for any overpayment of taxes during the year. It’s not free money. Ideally you want to pay just the right amount during the year because otherwise you’re giving the government an interest free loan for up to a year.
So your $2500 reflects the amount by which you /your employer(s) over-deducted from your paycheck last year. I have no idea where his $8000 comes from without knowing anything about his actual situation. Some of it could be benefits, tax credit carryforwards, etc.
