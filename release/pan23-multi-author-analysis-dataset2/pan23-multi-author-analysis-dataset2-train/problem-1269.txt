Jiang was the most liberal and highly educated of all the Chinese leaders, and probably had the greatest personality of them all too. RIP Chairman Jiang.
That cult is so insignificant and largely sits in the elite class. The poors and middle class dont even remember or care about him. He hasnt been relevant for literally a decade. Nothing about his rule was all that attached to any cultural feeling or event in China despite a lot of things happening during his time.
Some leaders death is the perfect reason to gather peacefully without the government rejecting such mourning.
I dont think you have even the minute understanding of how Jiang Zemin is perceived in the general Chinese population. If anything youâ€™re just demonstrating complete ignorance. This is like saying the death of George Bush would set off mass mourning and people demanding a revolution in America.
I do know you are just saying nonsense and demonstrating ignorance and delusion. So that is enough to call you out. Especially when this is a period of misinformation and misrepresentation.
