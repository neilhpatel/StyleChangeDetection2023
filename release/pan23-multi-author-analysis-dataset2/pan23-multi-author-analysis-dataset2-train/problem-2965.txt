Honestly probably yes. But Russia seems to be paying them a pretty good price, and many of the Chinese soldiers have at least some frontline experience. If it works out well for Russia it could be a very bad thing for Ukraine because it means a drastic increase in manpower against them and China absolutely does need to protect its interests in Russia.
Yha...its shocking they think human wave is the way to go, when its been proven the infinte ammo perk in recent history unlocked by one nation is a direct counter to it.
There have been much older people being recruited in Russia, but the actual numbers have been blow way out of proportion by the media. Elderly volunteers like that are not common at all in the Russian army and are more of an exception than the rule.
Russia really wouldn't need to recruit a whole army of 60 year olds. They're still taking volunteers from Eastern Russia and Belarus, and now also have a lot of Chinese volunteers/mercenaries signing up to fight as well.
The Fukushima 50 are a great example of why you're wrong in microcosm, whereas Ukraine itself provides a great macro example, given that it's typified by a broad range of ages fighting for its future.
