• Contact Support for the company you filed with. Tell them what happened, and escalate the issue if you have to.
• File in Small Claims Court. If he shows up and you've done your homework then he may have to testify under oath. If he doesn't show then you get a judgement against him.
• Record phone calls with him and bait him into an admission of guilt. (If it is legal in your jurisdiction.).
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
• If an agency tells you they will not pursue the issue then request their reason in writing, or a link to the relevant policy.
• If he signed your name (even digitally) under false pretenses to perpetrate the theft then it's another criminal offense.
I did contact the bank, like their exact branch, and they told me they can't do anything. I ended up speaking with the actual branch manager, just because nobody else had any clue what to do.
It sounds a bit like the law enforcement people you've spoken with view this as more of a civil dispute between two people that had some sort of relationship with each other at the time. There's nothing you can do to force a criminal prosecution if the prosecutors decline.
I mean, there's nothing civil about stealing that amount of money and destroying someone financially. Like, I ended up living out of my car for a few months because I was depending on it to pay certain bills.
Only reason I havent... skirted the legal system, is because its someone I used to actually give a shit about.
Title: My 2018 tax return was stolen and I still haven't been able to file criminal charges. Just wondering what avenue to take.
