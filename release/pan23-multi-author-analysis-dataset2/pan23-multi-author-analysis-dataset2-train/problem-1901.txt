Abortion will be on the ballot in plenty of states in 2024. Don't you worry that the fact that it will be presidential election might cause some referendums to go against choice? Referring to Louisiana that overwhelmingly voted to deny right to abortion in 2020.
Also, the ballot initiatives so far have largely been dominated by pro-choice money and effort. Part of that is because the pro-lifers are still hungover celebrating the SCOTUS ruling. But I would expect them to organize on the state fights by 2024. I think the real abortion fights will happen in 2024 mostly on the state level.
C'mon, I'm not in the mood for horror stories, because the last part that anti choicers might be heating up for 2024 is scary af. I hope that no one gets complacent any money will go.
