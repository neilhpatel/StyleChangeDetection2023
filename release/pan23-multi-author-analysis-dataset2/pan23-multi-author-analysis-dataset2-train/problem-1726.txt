> “I made it clear to the American representatives that we stand behind the IDF’s soldiers, that we will not cooperate with any external investigation and we will not allow interference in Israel’s internal affairs,” tweeted Gantz.
Yes, Israel has already investigated this, said it is likely one of its soldiers killed Abu Akleh while fighting Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and that this matched with the prior US conclusion from what it received from both sides earlier.
I'm not sure you are aware but innocent journalists die in the middle of conflicts all the time, this isn't something new and it is something that the journalists are well aware of. They know they are in danger when reporting from conflict zones. Israel was there to apprehend terrorists who had been murdering innocent civilians all summer when they were fired upon by those terrorists.
Except they were shooting specifically at the journalists wearing protective blue vests that marked them as journalists. There was no fighting going on in the immediate vicinity.
