Do you have a record of what the list looked like when you booked? And do any of your communications with the other vendors reference the approval list, too? Having records that your vendors knew about the approval list when you booked with them will be helpful if you do speak to an attorney.
NAL but work for a venue that does weddings. Your contract would have to be grandfathered in since you even said it states "Guests must use approved third-party services for catering and food service, etc." It does not say you have to use their in-house services. At the time, they were approved third-party services. If they refuse to honor the original contract that allowed these services, then it's time to lawyer up.
First, have you spoken to whoever actually owns/manages the venue? Lower-level employees may not be able to do much, so you have to go up the chain.
If that fails, then legally, you have a pretty good case for arguing that they cannot retroactively change the vendor list after giving it to you. So your options are to either get a lawyer to send them a letter and hope they back down, or switch to their approved vendors and then sue them later for the additional cost. Either way, given the amount of money at stake, you might want to talk to a lawyer now about your options.
