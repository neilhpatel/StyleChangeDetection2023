Hard pass. They don't need it. And really there are no emergencies in which they would need it. They can send you money without it. They can send money to a bill collector without it. There is literally zero need for it.
Don't do it. Seriously. Your are an adult. Don't give people the ability to take your stuff, control your stuff, or put you in a bind.
Your next of kin do not need a HIPAA waiver to help you in a medical emergency. A financial POA would give them control over your finances. In an emergency, they can use their own money to help you - they don't need to access yours. You don't really want them to be able to learn about every piece of medical care you receive - to know if you saw a psychiatrist for depression or took medication for an STI. You don't really want them to be able, for example, to legally withdraw all the money from your bank account and not return it (which a financial POA would allow them to do). If they want either of these, I would only do so if you both worked with a lawyer to have them written so they were only in effect if you were incapacitated.
I think there is some website out there for parents of college age students that tells parents to get these documents in case of emergency. We get this question with reasonable frequency.

Personally, I would only sign them if the state they only go into effect if you are incapacitated as verified by your treating physician. A POA is also revocable by you at any time as long as you aren't incapacitated.
