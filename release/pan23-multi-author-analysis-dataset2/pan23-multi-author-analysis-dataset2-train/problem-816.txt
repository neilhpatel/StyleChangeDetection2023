The USSR and China were close competitors to Europe and the USA in terms of technological, engineering and scientific innovation. What has most of the religiously dominated nations of Middle East, Africa, South & South East Asia and South America have accomplished? Oh yeah that’s right, nothing short of being the countries statistically with the highest per capita amount of constant war/civil war/sectarian violence, political corruption, ethnic cleansing, poverty, famines, terrorism, crime rates, beheadings, stoning, burnings, looting, shootings, rape, killings and stealings for the ongoing past 5000 years. Recommend you go take a look at the content from sites like elblogdenarco, documentingreality, r/narcofootage, r/NSFL__, r/eyeblech and you shall see that all the constant heinous shit that occurs on the daily in most religiously dominated countries that make North Korea resemble a civilised utopian paradise, which is not an opinion I’d like to make lightly. Religion has done nothing to make these countries better, more often that not, it is a contributing or direct cause of these problems that have made the living conditions of the people in these countries worse.
Exactly, the Hong Kong protest was ascendant when the police used violence liberally, and quickly died down once the police learned to put up a facade of restraint in public view, while more radical elements of the protestors turned violent.
