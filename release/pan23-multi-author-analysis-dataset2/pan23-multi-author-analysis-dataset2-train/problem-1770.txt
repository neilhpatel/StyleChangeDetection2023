Is this a "my father has custodial accounts for his children god bless him" situation or a "my father had committed multiple acts of identity theft and we've held off calling the police but probably should do so now"? How old are you all now? Have you all checked your free credit reports? Do so tonight. Not exaggerating. Have you all frozen your credit? Do that after checking it, tonight.
We are concerned with identity theft now that you are mentioning it. We are 28 y/o, 30 y/o, and 32 y/o. We didn't know calling the police was what we should do.
This is bizarre, since you're collectively 90 years old and at this point...you suspect? Know? Maybe think? That dad has accounts in your names, since when you were children. Do any of you own homes, have mortgages? What does your credit report say (or the three reports) are all the accounts legit?
These account holders would have issues, to the IRS, tax forms for these accounts if they are attached to your social security numbers. So every year, you do your taxes. Has the IRS ever said, "hey, you didn't report the interest income"?
So you are saying you don't do your own taxes, your father does? Or do you do your own taxes? This is critically important.
