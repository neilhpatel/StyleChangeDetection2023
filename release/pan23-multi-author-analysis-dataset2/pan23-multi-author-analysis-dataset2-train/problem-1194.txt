I'm aware of the laws regarding lost and/or abandoned pets in a couple states. They're pretty similar, when you take the animal in you have to do everything reasonable to locate the owner. This includes having the animal checked for microchips, posting the pictures of the animal to lost pet websites, posting flyers, taking the animal around the area, and just diligently look for the owner. After a set amount of time, which varies from state to state, you can then choose to simply adopt the animal or turn it over to a look shelter.
You met most of those requirements and certainly waited out any reasonable time frame, so you'd probably have a solid argument to being able to keep the dog. Did you get the dog licensed in your name by chance? Cause that'd really cement it for you.
In my state you just take proof of rabies vaccination to town hall. They will give you a license tag. My dogs was $6 this year. You have to renew it every year. A quick google of your city/town/county + dog license should tell you where to go.
Have you gotten the dog microchipped in your name and licensed with your country animal control? Licensing typically requires providing current ownership information (you) including address, showing proof of current shots, and paying a fee.
