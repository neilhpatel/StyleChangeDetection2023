Unless they can prove you colluded with the customers or otherwise let them do it (which you clearly didn't because you alerted your manager) then no. It is 100% illegal to make you pay for it. But it is still a common practice somehow.
I'm not sure what they could possibly expect you to do. I'm sure they wouldn't want you to physically try and prevent people from leaving. That could be potentially way more costly than a single meal. They could potentially fire you for a dine and dash, because employers can fire you for pretty much any reason, but if so, you'd be eligible for unemployment. If they did withhold money from your wages or tips, you would be able to file a wage claim.
They can't make any such deductions from your wages without your consent, and they can't do it at all if it takes you under minimum wage. It's up to you whether you want to address it now or cross that bridge when you come to it.
Also call the police? If the boss says they stole from YOU, not the restaurant, then you would definitely report this to the police. And if you suspect a table may be planning to dash you could also take a picture of them to give the police if it happens. If you boss doesn't want the other customers to see the police there taking your report, then point out that boss says you are the victim and you choose to report it. If boss doesn't want police there then they can take the hit instead of dumping it on you. You'll get fired though.
I'm sorry that those customers left without paying. If there is a particular way you'd like me to handle a situation like this in the future, I'm happy to do that. But covering the cost of their bill is not something I can do. What can we do to move past this?
