Step one is to find out whether this is actual legal service or some sort of scam. There should be a court and case number listed on the front page of the documents. Call the court (or check online records) and see if this is an active case.
Assuming it is an active case, then service to you may be proper. Generally, service can be proper to any adult at a defendant’s last known address. If “Jung” lived there before you then it may be OK to serve you at that address.
Until there is an order from the court against you (not Jung) you should continue to pay your rent as normal. If there is a court order (that you’ve verified with the court) then you should comply and give your landlord a copy of the order.
Is there a legal stamp on them? If so, maybe take a picture of them a reverse Google search then to see what type of document it is for. This honestly sounds like some kind of scam. May want to contact your local police about it.
A legal order that is binding on you would have needed to pass through some organ of the state, like a court. So we would need to know more about these legal documents. Do they have a state seal or government letterhead? Do they explain who has given the order, or provide contact information for the office that drafted them? If they do, I would reach out to them. If not, I would question whether they have legal force.
First off, I don’t think you are living under the table. At the expiration of your lease you began living under a month-to-month rental agreement automatically, with the same terms and conditions otherwise.
