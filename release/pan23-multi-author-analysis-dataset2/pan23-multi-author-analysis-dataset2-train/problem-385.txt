Smoking gun (memo, witness testimony, etc), trend of discriminatory behavior, suspicious timing, etc. It can certainly be difficult.
It can be very difficult to prove that an employee was terminated for a bad reason. The proof varies depending on the specifics of the reason trying to be proven. Sometimes it is easy, however. It all depends on the specific circumstances. And yes, you are correct, employers can, and often do, abuse the fact that it is difficult to prove these cases sometimes.
Hmmm I see, so when they seem to contridict their reason for firing you like you said hiring someone else after they said they didn't need anyone. But couldn't they just say they messed up and changed their mind so they hired someone else? Assuming there were no witnesses and your work performance was average, I feel like the employer could pull the "your too slow" card. Seems tough to actually prove the reason was not malicious.
At will is often described as being able to be terminated for any reason or no reason. There is more, however. The complete definition includes, “but not a bad reason.” A bad reason would include discrimination and other reasons prohibited by law.
