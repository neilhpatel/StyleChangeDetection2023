This is abuse. If you think he is about to kill himself and actively in danger, call the emergency medical response in your country to provide him with help. Otherwise block and ignore, change phone numbers, alert the authorities for protective orders if he could show up to your home/ work.
Report him to the authorities as a self harm threat. This way, you are actively trying to stop him hurting himself, and with a legal trail to prove it. Take screenshots of his threats where you have begged him to not hurt himself, and where he is trying to blackmail you into things you do not want to do, send them to the police then block him everywhere.
The first thing you need to understand that nobody else here is saying is that he's not your boyfriend and never has been. A boyfriend is someone you choose to be with and your choice was taken from you by force using threats and physical violence. It doesn't matter who he threatened, it's still a crime. He's just a dangerous criminal who targeted you and unless he's under 15 years old, he's likely done this to others before and will likely continue doing it to others until someone stops him.
The most important thing to do first when a dangerous criminal has targeted you is to escape safely. The second most important thing is to report everything to the police immediately. You're the victim of a crime so you're not going to go to jail.
You are not responsible for his life. What he chooses to do is his problem. I'm sorry you're dealing with this.
