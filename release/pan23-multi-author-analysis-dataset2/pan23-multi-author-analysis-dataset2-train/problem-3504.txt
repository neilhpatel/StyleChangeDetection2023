I do not practice in Idaho. But in the jurisdiction I do practice in, prior to closing, you have to be given the HOA docks and then are given 48 hours to review and sign off on them as part of the closing. In this case, the signing off means that you acknowledge you have seen them. And if you do not approve of them in the 48 hour window, it gives you a valid reason to break the contract. This is so you are informed purchaser who is aware of duties and obligations on the property. By not giving you the DOCs, you likely have several remedies. But once again, I would have you check Idaho requirements and the city, county and local jurisdiction. You will find that some locations will have more sophisticated rules for these depending on how common HOA's are.
Deed restrictions generally don't get dissolved from disuse, there needs to be a proactive vote to dissolve the HOA, and remove the deed restrictions. If the deed restrictions and CC&Rs were present before you bought the property generally they are still valid, and can be activate later if enough homeowners participate.
