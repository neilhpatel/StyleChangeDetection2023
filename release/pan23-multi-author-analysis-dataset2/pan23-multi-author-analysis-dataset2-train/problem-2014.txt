No. They cannot be part of a pre-nup or post-nup. Child-support and custody would be determined at the time of separation or divorce, with consideration given to the parents' current situation and the best interests of the child.
In Arkansas, pre and post nuptial agreements cannot determine child custody or child support. Courts determine that based on the needs of the child and the parent's ability, or the respective financial situations at the time of divorce.
Ultimately custody and child support are ordered in the interest of the child, so it can't be determined in advance, and it certainly can't be determined in a way where no one advocates for the child's best interests.
But regardless - if you are trying to make a legally enforceable post-nup you need to consult with lawyers to make sure it's done right. And you should have your own lawyer to make sure your interests are protected.
Keep in mind the post-nup could also protect you from unforeseen circumstances for example if he becomes disabled or is unable to make the same money you could be the one paying spousal support. This may sound far fetched but I have seen it happen where a high earning spouse gets Parkinson's and low earning spouse now has to pay spousal support for the next 10 years.
Also while a post-nup must not be unconscionable it doesn't have to be equal, meaning you can protect yourself and make sure you will receive support if the marriage fails.
One thing that might be in your benefit is if the alternative to entering into this prenup is him divorcing you. Do you think he would?
