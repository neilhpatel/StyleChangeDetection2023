That's a fundamental difference between liberal/progressive thinking and conservative thinking. There's a reason the phrase "bleeding heart liberal" used to be common: left-leaning people tend to have greater empathy and will vote in favor of social programs that benefit others even if they themselves won't benefit. Right-leaning people tend to be the opposite, more selfish and tribal, and will oppose such programs unless they or members of their "tribe" will benefit. This also relates to the "in-group/out-group" theory of conservatism.
The Republican party seems to attract people who are unable to relate to anyone's problems until after the same problem has happened to them personally.
Conservatives also have a history of mocking or belittling this attitude of liberals. From phrases like "bleeding heart liberal" to "pussy liberals" to "virtue signaling" to "performative" to "woke", they consistently depict the empathy of liberals as either dishonest, or as a sign of weakness.
Unimaginative and low in empathy. Their ingroup-outgroup thinking means they are quick to blame people rather than circumstances. Just in case those circumstances have been deliberately created by the ingroup.
