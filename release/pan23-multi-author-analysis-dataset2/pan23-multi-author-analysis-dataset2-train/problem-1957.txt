You’re going to find a lot of buyers who are reluctant to make a deal with you on these terms. Understand that if someone came here and said “someone wants to sell me their car but they don’t have title” we’d say “there are better ways to get a car than this.”.
Your buyer should make their check out to your lienholder for their own interests. They need you use that money to payoff the loan and get clean title, and should take steps to ensure you do. Better still they should likely ask you to meet them at your bank.
I take the check to my you meet the Buyer at the lending bank and pay off the lien. You instruct the lender to release the title to the Buyer.
The Buyer takes the signed bill of sale and the released certificate of title to the DMV to apply for a title of their own.
The goal is to be sure the Buyer doesn't have to trust that the Seller will apply the money to pay off the loan, get the title, and release the title. The Lender acts as the trusted party to apply that money and release their interest in the car (the lien).
You need to contact your lender and ask them for a "payoff" statement /demand... This would be the amount your lender will require before they will release the lien. It will not be the same amount as the outstanding balance on your loan because interest charges come into play. This amount will have an expiration date listed.
That's the general course of action. It's easier for dealerships because they have the electronic title and lien systems and pre-existing relationships with major auto lenders.
