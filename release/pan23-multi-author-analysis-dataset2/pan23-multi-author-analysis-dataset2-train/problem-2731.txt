1. Sever the tenancy of your property. This will stop it from passing automatically to your husband as the surviving joing owner. If you have any other joint assets then remove your half and place it in a seperate account so that it doesn't pass to your husband.
1) check whether you hold the property as joint tenants or tenants in common. If the former, you will need to sever the joint tenancy. Otherwise the property passes in full to the surviving owner, and you don’t have a “share” to leave to anyone so your child will lose out.
2) remake your will ASAP- it should be made with a view to dissolution of the marriage so that whether you manage to achieve the divorce or otherwise doesn’t affect your succession planning.
3) check your paperwork for any pensions or life insurance policies you may hold, and find out how to change the beneficiaries from spouse to child where possible. If there is a lump sum payable on your death, in most cases you can organise it to be paid directly to someone so it doesn’t pass through your estate and is therefore not subject to inheritance tax in the same way as if it were lumped in with your half-a-house.
You should disclose your health conditions to your solicitor and ask them to exert all possible efforts to push it through as quickly as possible. Bearing in mind, your health may not permit that, you need to make an “exit plan” on the assumption you will die within the marriage and/or family home, including thinking about power of attorney for your medical care in the event that you become incapable of expressing your wishes. At the moment, your husband will be next of kin and entitled to make decisions about your care.
