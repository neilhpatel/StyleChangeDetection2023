What if because of Hunter's financial dealings with foreign governments that he couldn't get the top secret security clearance?
Of course he should be, but Merrick Garland is a fucking pussy wimp and will be the cause of the next insurrection. His limp noodle treatment of the fucking insurrectionists just encourages them.
What if President Biden had appointed Hunter Biden as his Senior White House Advisor and his job was to broker peace in the Middle East and pursue diplomacy with China?
What if Hunter failed to disclose during his security clearance process that he was 1 billion dollars in debt?
What if President Biden overruled counterintelligence officials and just gave Hunter the top security clearance via fiat?
What if once on the job Hunter brokered the deal for the US to sell Saudi Arabia 100 billion dollars worth of weapons and during this process Hunter went to our weapons manufacturers and asked them to give Saudi Arabia a discount price?
DeSantis has the backing of the Republican elite (Northeast primaries) and the Christian base (South), Trump has the backing of the angry-post industrial base (Mid-West). I'd say DeSantis is the front runner. Nicki Haley is the obligatory John Kasich of this cycle, an acceptable Republican that the media will half-heartedly try to promote but doesn't have a chance.
Now imagine if after all that Democrats still had Joe Biden among their front-runners. Nope, I can't even imagine that but I have to accept the other stuff is all real - just replace the Bidens with Trump and Kushner.
