Assuming you didn't prank call 911 (you didn't say you did) and assuming you didn't threaten the scientologists, the police aren't likely to do anything else. (If either of these apply talk to a lawyer) Don't talk to the police without a lawyer. Don't talk to the scientologists at all. Don't act like a 12 year old. You should be fine. If you get a subpoena or other legal documents see a lawyer. You may have talked to a member of that scientogy church(?), who was also on the police force, and/or the police officer was just trying to scare the stupid kid that you acted like.
If the police arrest you (which might seem somewhat unlikely over harmless prank calls, but you've provided next to zero detail about these calls, so...), step two is to continue to not speak to the police until you've retained a criminal defense attorney and that attorney tells you to talk to the police.
There's really no "talking yourself out of this to the police" if that's what you're getting at -- the time and place to talk yourself out of it is after you've been arrested and charged with a crime, in court, on your court date, with the assistance of your attorney. And if this never gets that far, then there's nothing you need to talk yourself out of.
So you poked the gigantic bear, on more than one occasion, and got growled at. And now you're not sure if the bear is backing off or coming back more aggressively. Not sure what you expected to happen; that's a pretty predictable outcome.
Don't talk to the police, or the scientologists, and, if arrested, keep your mouth shut until your attorney says to open it. That's pretty much it.
