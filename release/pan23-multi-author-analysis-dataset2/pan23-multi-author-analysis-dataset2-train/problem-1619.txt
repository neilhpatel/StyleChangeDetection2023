Believe it or not, the status quo. All of this bullshit is just a game to keep the status quo for the upper parts of North Korea going. They are seriously not going to nuke anyone. They just need to make a few people have to respond to the saber-rattling once in a while.
By continuing to be a threat, they are engaging in the same racketeering scheme as a criminal syndicate. Their saber rattling is their signal to mean “give us money or we start blasting”. And most of the time, it’s deemed safer to keep them stable and supplied than to confront their bullshit and call them on their bluff.
US Military just line hauls in all kinds of food, medical equipment, medicine and just everything you can think of for the people.
Probably the Kims just don't want to die. Give them an easy life a house and some money, move them to Switzerland and they would probably say goodbye to North Korea and never look back.
I mean imagine being born into that Regime and then realise that you can never get out of that alive, you either prob up that regime and rule with terror or get killed by internal forces, the military, uprising or through external forces.
