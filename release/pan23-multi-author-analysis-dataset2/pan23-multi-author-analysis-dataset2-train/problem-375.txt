It's insanity. Cities run up massive debt then the facilities degrade over years. I really like the idea of a single location for the Olympics. Make top notch facilities that are maintained and upgraded. Athens is the clear choice for summer. Winter would be more difficult to determine though.
True. The IOC asks cities to build facilities for sports hardly anybody plays or watches and continuously changes the events making old facilities useless.
Edit: Olympics needs to be in quotations because it’s the IOC’s bastardized version of Olympics. There could be other versions if people wanted to build them.
They even tried to remove wrestling one time. You know one of the few sports that’s near universal to humanity since antiquity and in the original Olympic Games.
Honestly people need to realize the IOC is an international body that does not “own” the Olympics. Greece should just launch its own and declare itself the home.
Athens can't afford it without support. Countries won't be willing to support because hosting is a prestige thing. IoC has no more power than the countries who fund it allow.
