It turns out, when the authority figures you respect and listen to tell you for 50 years that you're correct smart and special, you believe them, because the alternative is you're just a fucking idiot who doesn't understand that you're the fascists and that you have no fucking clue what words like communism and socialism actually mean.
Why can't conservatives just accept the fact that their vision for an aggressively anti-scientific theocratic fascist society doesn't appeal to the majority of Americans?
Because through gerrymandering and propaganda the republican party gave them an overinflated sense of their actual numbers. They think they're the majority, they think they're the smart ones, and they think they're on the morally correct side of things.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
