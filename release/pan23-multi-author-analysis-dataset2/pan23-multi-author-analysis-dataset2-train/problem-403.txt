I would contact your local police and let them know your ex escalated his threats to death threats, rape, and revenge porn. You should also report the rapes even if it was a long time ago.
Whether it’s just words or not, this situation should be taken seriously because he is threatening not just your safety but your boyfriend’s as well.
Contact some lawyers in your area for a free consultation and they will definitely be able to give you options to consider such as a restraining order.
I don’t know if it’s legal but during the phone call when he started threatening my boyfriend I started recording so I have an audio file of him making the threats.
I cant prove the rpes, will the police still accept the report? Also are restraining orders expensive? Im moving out of home and I don’t know if I’ll be able to afford one just yet but fingies crossed!
Also will the restraining order stop him from calling me? I always thought they were just to stop people from harassing irl but I don’t know a thing about legal stuff lmao.
I would not respond to your ex at all. Document every threat and attempts for contact your ex sends, and then block him. He is trying to control your life even from afar, so every time you let him do that he has power over you. Don’t let him!
