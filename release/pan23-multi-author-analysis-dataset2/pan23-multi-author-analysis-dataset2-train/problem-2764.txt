I would check with the court to see if this is a legal subpoena, since the process server is usually law enforcement, an agent of the court or someone over 18 not involved with the case. This investigator doesn't seem to be qualified as a process server in this case.
Defense has the right to summon witnesses they think are helpful to their case and cross prosecution witnesses but only the courts can grant subpoenas.
In light of what you've posted, I would not be surprised if the investigator shows up with some other legal document and then wants to talk in-depth. Several times he has referred to the fact that he needs to complete subpoena service, so there is no misunderstanding about what he's claiming.
Next time, ask for the court (jurisdiction) and docket number so you can check why a defense investigator is trying to serve it and not a process server assigned by the court.
Investigators for defense absolutely can serve subpoenas issued by the court. Process servers are not assigned by the court.
OP, you are not obligated to speak to the defendant’s investigator, but there’s really no reason not to. If the accused don’t have access to potential witnesses, the deck is already stacked against them. If I were in your shoes, I would speak with the investigator, but decline to speak further IF you think any of their questions are inappropriate or cross the line in any way. I think you’ll find that the investigator will be very professional and simply attempt to understand the nature of your testimony/the evidence against the defendant to prepare for trial and/or settlement negotiations.
