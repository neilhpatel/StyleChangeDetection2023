I know this is an unpopular opinion, and it goes against a lot of our shared concerns about it possibly being abused, but I think until we come up with a better idea, we need to help people who cannot do basic care for themselves. It could clean up the streets and help people.

Thanks for sharing this. This is really good to know - particularly about requesting a "crisis officer".
Law enforcement has been saying for over twenty years that it is a problem that we can't arrest our way out of.
Body cams aren't a deterrent unless the footage is made public or subjected to review outside of the law enforcement agency. If the cops know the people seeing the footage are on their team, they don't let the cameras deter them.
To be fair, the article says it would only be used against people who could not care for their basic needs.
