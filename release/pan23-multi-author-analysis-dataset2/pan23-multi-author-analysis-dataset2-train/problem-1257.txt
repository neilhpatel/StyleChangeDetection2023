Ironically says nothing about it where i signed. Just says i know what im financially responsible for and of course a nice little statement about how i can be charged more at any time if they deem upgraded services necessary.
But im refusing service at this point, im almost certain that meant while working on my teeth if the doctor “discovers” a new issue or insists upon like a crown instead of a filling. Otherwise what would stop them from endlessly charging me. Which is why i dont want to start any treatments because i know this will happen now.
Alright, well that would suck but can you help me here. Thats what im supposed to pay granted insurance does what they estimated. If i still let them keep that money but lets say insurance was gonna pay less for the filling.. they can’t charge me more money at that point can they???
Yes, they can. As long as the contract you signed is legally sufficient, which is extremely likely, you owe the money you agreed to pay. But by the same token you can still require them to actually perform the services you paid for.
Dentists give you an estimate based on what your insurance will pay and the total for the work to be completed. Many dentists ask for the patient portion to be paid prior to starting the work.
You should be given a partial refund for things they have not yet done. There may still be a charge for your initial visit where they did an exam and X-rays.
