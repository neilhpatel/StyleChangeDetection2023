They never said they wouldn't stop processing the check, they said that the check would still be processing and that the funds could be deposited. I find it weird that they would continue to process a check that was already cashed on the same day that I mobile deposited it. I only cashed it because it didn't tell me how long it would take until after I did the deposit as I thought it would deposit same day with Cash App.
Since Cash App and the check cashing place both gave me money, who do I refund? I got money from the check cashing place first if that helps with an answer.
There are laws about how quick funds must be available to you, but checks are still antiquated. They are presented to the bank that is associated with the check and they verify the check is good, and the account has money then pays the bank/company that paid you. This process can take weeks (why there are laws about how fast you can use the funds). We can't tell which one is going to be first to get paid and which is going to get rejected.
I contacted Cash App Support the very same day that I got the check cashed at the check cashing place. They said they were still processing the check. I thought that so long as I explained what happened, which I did, that Cash App wouldn't cash the check.
