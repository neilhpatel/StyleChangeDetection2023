Have you talked to "the post office" as in a letter carrier/desk agent? It sounds like you are dealing with one bad worker or there is some misunderstanding. You cannot 'split' your addressed mail between two addresses at any given point but you can have mail forwarded to a vacation home...so you can have 'two' or even more addresses.
There are many things that a postmaster can do. You might want to consider that this is not their fault if you have someone actively changing and redirecting your mail. I would be suspicious that your landlord is either purposefully or accidentally listing your unit as undeliverable. Given this seems to be an issue with Amazon, I'd be a bit suspicious about that, too.
The post office is not required to help with bad landlords or chase circles getting the right information. Make a list of the occurrences, get informed delivery and then speak to the postmaster, not a desk jockey.
At some point your packages are being legally intercepted and changed by someone in the post office because of bad information that they have.
So if there's a business forward at the address, everything for that business would be forwarded. There's no individual forwards for a business.
You can send yourself mail wherever the fuck allows you to address it to yourself. But you can't tell the post office that 123 ABC street is your home and you want packages to go to 567 Towensen ave and letters to go to 89 Bird street. You have to choose to direct all your 123 ABC street mail to one or the other. And if you send ABC St mail to Townesen you have to change directing it from 123 ABC to Bird street.
Thanks. Yeah I spoke to a front desk person and they said that my address was previously a business (????) so they just forwarded packages to the address the business had packages forwarded to. It makes sense... sort of... but for it not to be fixed after I went in is frustrating.
