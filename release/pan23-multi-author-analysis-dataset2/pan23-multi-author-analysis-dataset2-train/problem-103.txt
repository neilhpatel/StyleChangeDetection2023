This system works really well in that Senators can slow down legislation by secret hold (or by an unwritten, arguably unconstitutional, rule called the filibuster), keeping the lawmaking powers of the House in check. The fact that all bills requires votes in the affirmative in both chambers to go to the President for signature or veto means that bills that originate in the Senate can be voted down in the House (and vice versa). The House AND the Senate checks the Executive Branch (including the President) in that all funding for the Government must be appropriated by Congress, as well as the power to override a Presidential veto on a bill (which requires 2/3 of BOTH chambers to accomplish). The Congress also checks the Judiciary in that, like the Executive Branch, the Judiciary's funding must be derived from appropriation of funds from Congress.
