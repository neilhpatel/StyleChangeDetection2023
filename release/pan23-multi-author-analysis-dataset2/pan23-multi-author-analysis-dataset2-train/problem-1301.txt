Nah the goal of our justice system is to be petty punitive and torturous. Not even about disciplinary. We are one of the few wealthy western nations who care so little about prisons or prisoners one way or the other. That we treat prison rape like a joke and immortalize it as a gag in films constantly. No one outside of rapists maybe, deserves to be raped. Our prisons are where people we don't like go to have their rights strip from them and largely be forgotten. There is no disciplinary or rehabilitative qualities to it. And anyone who does manage to rehabilitate is an exception and not the rule.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
