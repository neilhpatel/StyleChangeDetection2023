Sorry, we don't allow . It's not that your question was bad; it's that these kinds of questions tend to produce threads that are collections of disjointed, partial, inadequate responses. If you have a question about a specific historical event, period, or person, feel free to rewrite your question and submit it again. If you don't want to rewrite it, you might try submitting it to /r/history, /r/askhistory, or /r/tellmeafact.
It would be better to ask for more general sources and scholarship on Mississippi riverboat travel c. 1850, or for primary sources of travellers (diaries, newspaper accounts, etc.).
Are you really serving the public good? I'm trying to enrich a historical PC game with interesting real-life personages. I really want some help on this from legitimate historians, and if some would like to help me, why should you prevent me from asking?
On the whole, our legitimate historians tend not to choose to answer questions like this. If you're trying to enrich a historical PC game, I'd suggest you ask instead about books to read to better understand this setting beyond the stereotypes; these books will, of course, give you people to include as well as a more accurate understanding.
