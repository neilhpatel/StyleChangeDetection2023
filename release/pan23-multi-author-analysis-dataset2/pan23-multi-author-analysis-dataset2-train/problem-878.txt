Statutory Damages remove the burden from you, the copyright holder, to prove that the alleged infringement caused actual damages. Under the Copyright Act, damages can range from $750 to $30,000 for each work infringed, in addition to a judge's choice to award extra damages of up to $150,000 for willful infringement, or reduce damages to $200 for unknowing infringement.
If the infringed makes a profit of more than $2,500 within a 180 day period, the infringement becomes a criminal felony with a maximum fine of $250,000 and five years in prison for first offense.
Edit: with 7 Million views, even though the video is short, unless the video is demonetized odds are the profit for this creator is well over that $2,500 figure.
YouTube has its own copyright takedown process. If it's any good, you'll be able to demonstrate that you uploaded your video to TikTok before they uploaded the same video to YouTube, all the money from that video on YouTube will be given to you, the YouTube video will be taken down, and the creator will have one more strike, once all is said and done. I'm not an expert in how the YouTube Copyright Takedown system works from the copyright-holder's point of view, so it may be different than that. Nonetheless, lawyers' fees can rack up fast, so it may be best to pursue this course of action than going through the court system.
I think because it’s a Short(which is a new thing you can upload on YouTube now) and not an actual video it’s not ranking up that money. I looked up a video explaining it and apparently you receive about the same as you do on TikTok, crumbs.
I would recommend you create a YouTube channel and begin posting every video to both platforms. That way copyright disputes are easier because the YouTube auto copyright claim system will know that the video is aldready associated with a different account. And of course, it's more money for minimal work to upload the same video to 2 different platforms than just one.

Title: YouTuber took my TikTok Video and claimed it as theirs, it has over 7Mil views and counting.
At the moment, YouTube Shorts videos are not able to be directly monetized - That being said, there are indirect ways it can be used to generate income which could be considered of value.
