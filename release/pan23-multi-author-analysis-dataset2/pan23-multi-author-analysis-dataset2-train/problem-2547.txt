You can have a document drawn up that says anything they want, but a document will mean nothing unless the employer agrees to it. You can't unilaterally force liability on the company.
There are many workplaces that already require certain vaccines or other medical precautions be undertaken by employees, and I don't believe employers have ever been held liable for any associated side affects.
In other words, I don't see an employer being liable for requiring a vaccine or other precaution for an optional employment function where that precaution is determined to be reasonable and safe (as these vaccines are) with or without 'complete' FDA approval.
For comparison, nurses and other healthcare workers are required to keep a number of vaccines up to date, and must get the flu shot every year. That's required by their employers. If a nurse has a severe side effect from the vaccine, that isn't the employer's fault. There are a few corner cases where it may be covered by workman's comp, but generally not even that.
It's similar to how if you are required to drive a car to work, your employer isn't generally liable for the car accident you have on the way.
You could try to force this through a court case, but there would be little point to that. By the time such a case got to the point of a judgement, one of the vaccines would already have full approval, so your purported objection wouldn't apply anymore. (Pfizer's vaccine is likely to have full approval within a couple of months.).
