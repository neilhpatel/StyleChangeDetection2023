IAAL but not yours. I’d look into whether your state has a “bona fide” or “innocent party”purchase law. It would be state specific but basically such laws allow a third party who buys personal property without knowing about the disputed ownership to obtain clear title. It doesn’t work with titled assets like vehicles but tractors it likely would. In that instance the true owner would typically have to go after the seller (ie your neighbor would have to sue the son) for damages.
That all being said, I assume you plan to live next to this guy for foreseeable future so IMO the neighborly thing to do would probably be to try and get money back from son and buy a new tractor.
IANAL but it sounds like the son sold property that was not rightfully his to sell. If this man can prove the tractor is rightfully his property, then you have no claim to the tractor and are required to return it. Then you can sue the son for selling stolen property to get your $3000 back. But TALK TO A LAWYER FIRST, because I don't know what state you are in, nor am am I a lawyer in your state.
