If i read this correctly, you're asking whether the university needs to honor an agreement you claim exists to grant you some form of financial aid for this semester? Where is the aid coming from ? Is there a written document acknowledging you would receive financial aid this semester? Are you otherwise qualified for aid?
I am not eligible at the federal level for aid due to my gpa. They had falsely sent me an email stating that my financial aid would be eligible and that I would get my full aid package.
Due to the university messing up my account I was expecting financial aid, I wasn't informed that I wasn't eligible till after.
seems to me you received an email in error about your eligibility from the school - which has no bearing on your actual eligibility under the federal guidelines - and they corrected it. It also seems like they offered you some form of courtesty for the error last semester in the form of financial aid (which they didn't have to do). Did you sign anything to receive that aid (possibly a release?) Even so, there's no obligation for the university to pay for your education for you (absent a scholarship or other grant money you're given...which is not the case here.).
