Both civil and criminal liability are totally fact-dependent in situations like this. The best thing you can do now is offer to assist the police with whatever they need for their investigation.
You can speak with an attorney about civil liability, but until you know more from the police, it may be difficult to get any kind of assessment.
In that case, your next step is probably an attorney. The attorney could file suit on your behalf against the boyfriend, but you still need to establish that what he did rose to the level of actionable negligence. Also, if he doesn't have any assets, then getting a judgment against him doesn't do much for you.
This doesn't mean that the boyfriend faces no civil or criminal liability. If there is evidence that he assaulted your sister, or that he withheld her inhaler intentionally, it's possible he could face criminal charges. Because Ohio has an uncommon "feticide" law, he could face charges for her unborn child's death as well. I would encourage detectives to seek some surveillance video or witness evidence before closing their investigation with a ruling of accident.
The usual civil exception is if the other party created or contributed to the "peril", or if they had a special custodial relationship (like a parent/child or teacher/student) to the injured person.
In some awful similar situations, the fleeing witness can be charged with failure to report a death, or the obscure crimes of "abusing a corpse" by leaving a dead person unattended and unreported. But your sister was alive when her boyfriend fled.
