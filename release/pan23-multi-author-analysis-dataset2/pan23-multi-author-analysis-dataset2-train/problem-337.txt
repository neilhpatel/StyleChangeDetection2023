I don't see where any of that is relevant. Unless your lease says that your office will sign for and store packages for longer than 24 hours, they don't have to do either.
If it was "illegal" for the property management office to hand mail back to the carrier and ask them to take it back, do you think the carrier would do it?
I understand that they can refuse to accept packages. The memos is saying packages that have been left for 24hrs, there’s no one tracking this 24 hrs and there are multiple carrier deliveries a day. These are not packages that are being refused upon delivery.
So it doesn’t matter that they built a mail room and have been accepting packages for the past 10 years? I don’t understand how a person who the package is not intended for can send it back 24 hrs after it’s already been delivered.
Because they have no legal obligation to store your stuff in their space. The alternative is that they just refuse to accept packages for tenants at all. They could convert the mail room into a ping pong and nude pinup chamber and never let any of the tenants in there to enjoy either because it's their space to use as they wish.
