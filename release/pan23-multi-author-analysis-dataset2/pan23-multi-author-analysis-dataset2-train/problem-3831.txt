He is an adult and can come and go as he pleases. That being said, he should leave a note explaining that he left by choice and is not missing. His parents will likely report him missing anyway. He needs to keep his phone on and answer when the police call (he can ignore everyone else). He may need to tell them his location, but most likely he can just say that he left by choice, is safe and doesn't want to disclose his location to the family.
There was recently an 18 year old in my town who left home by choice without telling anyone. She went for her daily walk and didn't come back. The whole town went bonkers about this poor girl who was kidnapped or dead in a ditch. It ended up with homeland security getting involved (she was a refugee). She was found safe and happy out of state but only after several days and lots of taxpayer $$$.
In addition to leaving a note, have Jake go to the local police preemptively: he's leaving his parents house at 123 Fake St., is happy and safe, and doesn't want to be contacted by his parents. He thinks they'll report him missing both under Jake and other name, so want to simplify everything for the police. Five them a copy of the note being left as well.
