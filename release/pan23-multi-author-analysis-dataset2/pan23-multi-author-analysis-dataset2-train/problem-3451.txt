The anti-Israel crowd knows that Israel will not cooperate with the ICC on anything because it infringes their sovereignty and implies their justice system is broken so they always try to get the ICC involved simply for the headline "Israel refuses to cooperate with the ICC on an investigation" because "implications"(propaganda). Most developed countries would not cooperate with an ICC investigation for the same reasons.
Number of stories on the abuse of gays, women, journalists, bribes, and the whole World Cup fiasco: 0. Oh sorry, there are a few that justify the government, my mistake.
Didn't Israel, and the US already investigate this, and basically concluded it was an errant IDF bullet?
but even assuming there was no investigation, isn't the ICC supposed to be for crimes against humanity, not individual killings?
Yes but there isn't enough evidence to conclude either way. The Palestinians obstructed a proper investigation from the moment it happened. They handled the scene and the body and wouldn't allow any 3rd parties to be involved. When they finally handed over a bullet it was so badly damaged that it could not be forensically matched to a gun. Plus due to how the Palestinians handled this, we don't even know if the bullet they handed over is the one that hit her. So there is really no way to move forward and make the determination.
