Ex is the biological mother right? You can’t and you shouldn’t do anything. Seriously. Your son stated a fact—your fiancé is not his mom. I don’t understand why you have a problem with what your son said. You may not like it but it’s a fact—your fiancé is not his mother.
In the legal sense no she isn't but in the kids heart she is. There bio mother shouldn't try and change there minds on it. It's more about what her mom said about my fiance.
There mom is a recovering addict that has started her journey to being sober. She is slowly getting time with the kids and had a few hours with them today. My fiance has been in there life and has treated them like her children. In that they have started to call her mom. Now the bio mom is upset when they talk about her as there mother. Today my kid told me that there mom told them that she is there only mom and shouldn't be calling my fiance mom. When I called her on the phone with him sitting next to me she claimed not to have said that and for him to tell lies.(I should also mention that she herself has a huge problem with lying) right after that he refuses to talk about it anymore. Now this isn't the first time this has happened. My son acted the same way when she was dating an abuser. The guy threatened to punch my son in the face. One convo with mom and all of a sudden it never happened.
