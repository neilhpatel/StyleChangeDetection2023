This doesn't pass the "smell test." Are they only moving your water meter outside? If so, that seems odd. If they are going to move everyone's water meter, why don't the people at the water dept. already know about it? Don't open your door for them until you get confirmation from the water dept.
Ok. Did the water dept. tell you this or the people digging up your yard. This sounds like a huge capital project for the water dept. Maybe someone messed up and forgot to announce it. But when you called, the person who answered didn't know about it, and said he/she would have to call you back. That makes me very suspicious that the project isn't real. I wouldn't take any chances until I got confirmation. By the way, don't assume someone who calls you back is actually from the water dept. It's very easy now to make a phony number appear on your caller ID.
You should consider the police. Its a possible you are being scammed and by allowing them to complete the work you essentially enter into a verbal contract. Dont surprised when a bill shows up from a 3rd party company that is charging you for what the borough was about to do for free.
You’re a pregnant woman concerned about an unmarked van pulling up in front of your house unannounced claiming to be working on your water meter, but the water company doesn’t know what’s happening? If you really think the police would laugh at you for a call like this, then you are not safe in that town.
Why are you assuming anything? You should have called the police the moment an unmarked van pulled onto your property and unidentified men also entered your property.
