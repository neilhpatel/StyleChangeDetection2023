What you should do is hire a lawyer ASAP (definitely before your hearing), and do what they tell you. An underage DUI, at double the legal limit, with injuries, is not a DIY-able offense.
The fact that they took you to the hospital to be checked out isn’t a good sign. Any injury, even to occupants in the vehicle, may result in felony DUI.
As it is, blowing more than a .15 may lead to a minimum of a two night stay in jail and possibly far more.
Your beyond taking advice from Reddit and need to speak to a local DUI lawyer asap. Your freedom is at stake along with some hefty minimum fines.
Aside from that, the police officer taking you license from you is suspending it. By going to the dmv and filing for a replacement you must have checked off the “is not suspended” box which is giving a false statement.
I went to the dmv to get a new ID since the officer took my only form of identification and the dmv told me i couldn’t get an ID and had to get a replacement license since there was no notice that my license was suspended. They told me until I get any notice saying it’s been suspended, My drivers license is still valid. So that’s not my fault, I made it clear I no longer had my license and simply needed identification. So When these blood test results come back in a couple weeks, you’re saying that’s when I’ll be arrested and charged, possibly thrown in jail?
Do not drive on this license. You just gave yourself a whole lot more pain by getting a replacement under false pretenses. (And hence the far more jail time as above as the judge may look unkindly on the fact that you immediately attempted to drive on the suspended license).
