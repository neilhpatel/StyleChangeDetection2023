Of course they are. Anything the American people want this court is against. I guess they want us to tear it down. Might as well. Don't need 9 old robed oligarchs controlling our entire government and sabotaging it for their own ideological desires. Scrap it. We don't need it. The Appellate Courts do all the heavy lifting anyway and the Supreme Court has so much authority its completely corrupted. These frauds are totally unaccountable to anyone, have absolute no oversight and are completely immune to all the other standards and practices every other judge is required to follow. Get rid of them. Since these extremist conservatives took it over, they've spent every moment proving how out-of-touch, authoritarian and irrelevant that branch of government has become.
Only in really narrow cases can you sue on behalf of someone (and usually only in cases where you're legally someone's guardian), and none of the loan servicers, even the ones that the states are claiming to represent, ever signed on to this. This feels like the ACA lawsuit all over again, where the Supreme Court is humoring the merits of the case before throwing it out on standing.
