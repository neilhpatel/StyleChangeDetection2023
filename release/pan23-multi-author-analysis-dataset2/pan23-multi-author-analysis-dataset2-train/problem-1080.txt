No we don't and neither does law. I guess that's why I'm even talking about this. This is why murder isn't man slaughter. It's why gun stores aren't responsible for the act of murder that one of their clients committed. You can blame the parent for being a bad parent, but you can't arrest them for murder. And there are laws for child negligence which is what they would be guilty of. They're not responsible for the crime their kids committed, but the are responsible for the kid. That's why murder is not child negligence.
What logic is this? Iran still flies US F-14. Since we sold Iran weapons, therefore really it's American's who are responsible? That's some really broken logic.
That's not that bad of a leap. That's like saying we shouldn't blame the parent who handed a loaded gun to a five year old because thats one too many steps away.
Obviously the amount of hands the item goes through is relevant, just as the steps to prevent misuse are relevant.
The difference is having knowledge of the end userâ€™s intention. If we sell weapons to a country, and we know that country will use it against this other country, we are partially responsible for those deaths.
