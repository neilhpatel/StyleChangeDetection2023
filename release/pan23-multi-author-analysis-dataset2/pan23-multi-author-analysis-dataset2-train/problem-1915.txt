No technically they typed up a policy sheet we all had to sign saying the trucks werenâ€™t for personal use and could only be used for work but they understand we do use them on occasion for personal use but he does not have us keep track of personal miles and charge us based on those miles which I would be fine with. I clean pools and get paid per pool he takes $3 for every pool I do (which is about $650 to $740 a month depending on time of the year) for the company truck and instead of documenting that pay loss being for the truck he just makes it look like I get paid $3 less a pool for no reason.
In terms of company vehicles, the employee cannot be charged for operating those. Some companies will allow employees to use the vehicles for personal use, but they typically have rules about that, not least of which is end each day with a full tank of fuel, and start it the same way (or sometimes just work weeks, given not many people rack up a lot of miles after work on a weekday).
Also to note if they are classifying OP as an independent contractor it is very possible that is illegal. There are requirements to make someone eligible to be an independent contractor and it is quite possible the employer is not meeting them.
