Thing is that they’re not restricting their capital. They have a larger middle class than the US and have pulled more of their citizens (both gross and percentage) out of poverty than the US too. Of course there’s the whole Taiwan argument and the freedom of speech argument. But that’s kinda them playing the long game just how you said. Because, yeah you’re right, USSR fucked up hard. The two pieces of legislation that killed the USSR was parastroika and glasnost (sorry if I spelled those wrong I’m on mobile). China basically has taken a lesson from USSRs failing and says “oh. So the free market thing worked for them but as soon as they got liberal with their freedom of speech the whole thing crumbled” and now it’s the law that you’re not allowed to neither endorse nor criticize the government there.
Very interesting that everybody wants to mention the BRI, but fail to acknowledge that Africa and China have had good relations since the sixties due to being labeled as developing countries together by NATO / UN.
It was already 19 countries plus the EU, so for consistency, it would only need to increase to G21, assuming Russia is not evicted.
