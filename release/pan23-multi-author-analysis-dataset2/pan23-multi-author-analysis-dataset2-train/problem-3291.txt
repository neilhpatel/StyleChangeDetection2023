The evidence is inarguably and widely available from various, reputable sources. The fact that you choose not to believe it because it contradicts your worldview doesn’t mean the proof isn’t there, it means you’d rather ignore it.
Remember when Schiff was going on TV all the time saying he had proof against Trump? Blatant lying like that caused faith in institutions to be eroded.
State and Federal prosecutors feel the same way or else they would have charged Trump by now. If the prosecutors feel that they can't charge Trump because of political pressure stop wasting time/money on him.
Charges/indictments may well still be brought once the investigations are complete. This is the normal way investigations work - they don’t charge and then investigate, they investigate and then charge - especially when the target of the investigation is a former president and the entire process is under intense scrutiny.
