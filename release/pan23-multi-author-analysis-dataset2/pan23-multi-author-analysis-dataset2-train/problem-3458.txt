OR... there's a tendency when places are popular that people crowd the space and eventually water down what initially made it cool until it's all about who can yell the loudest. It happened with older and intolerant people on Facebook, now it's happening to Twitter. Don't be surprised if when everyone abandons Twitter that they find and ruin another cool spot to be. Reddit is probably the biggest online forum after fb and Twitter (except maybe LinkedIn), so i kinda worry that people are going to migrate here and start rapid posting stupid shit without understanding the platform. It's a theory i call "blowing up the spot". There's nothing that annoys me more on social media than people who try to convince people just by being the loudest. It's not even about the message either, just their constant need for attention and validation. If your message is good then you don't have to yell.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
