It's payment over time. Most of the weapons will be paid for in the future hence the lemd lease. Not to mention Ukraines rich lithium deposit and endless grain fields. The world has interest in keeping Ukraine free and intact.
I'm not sure how, Russia is at its limit militarily, nobody is going to willingly help them as long as they remain the aggressor. NATO will not attack, its a defense pact.
Well unfortunatly, they do have the nuclear option. Whether or not they use it remains to be seen. Id think that Putin would realize doing so would mean the end of civilization itself, but at this point, idk if he cares anymore.
If thereâ€™s one thing to learn from this conflict, then that russias capabilities are vastly overstated.
The sooner we can end their aggression forcefully and return to peace + reparations, the better. For Russia, giving up immediately would be the cheaper option.
Sorry to say this but it seems usa and Nato want this to continue there making a literal killing with arms deals. It's been said before but it never had to get this far it was allowed to but governments who say a opportunity to make money and trust out new military equipment. Only difference is Ukrainians have fought bravely and continue to fight.
