Beep beep paging u/WelfOnTheShelf ...While this specific question hasn't been answered before, let me give you some links about crusaders and cultural interaction. When Europeans conquered the Levant they became a ruling class over a mixed society of not only Arabs/Bedouins of various Islamic sects, but Jews including Samaritans, and various Christian sects of Greek Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, Armenians, Nestorians, etc. If you're looking for a book on the subject of Western/eastern Christian interaction there's.
But if you'd like to read something for free, there's two very relevant dissertations (Szoke, Schaller) and a paper (Jotischky) on the subject that I think you'll find helpful:
If we're talking about beliefs that the Roman church considered heretical, like the Cathars in southern France, they were already there before the crusades. It's possible that increased contact between eastern and western Europe during the crusades made it easier for heretical groups to spread westward but these groups were already present in Europe (Bogomils, Paulicians, Manichaeans, among the various names they were called in the east).
I guess this could also be referring to the supposed blasphemous initiation ceremony for the Knights Templar? But that was mostly imagined by the inquisitors and obtained by torturing prisoners. So I'm not sure the question can be answered, but maybe OP could clarify?
Oh this one definitely caught my eye when it was posted! But I haven't been able to answer it yet...as far as I know, crusaders didn't bring any new religions/cults back to Europe, so I'm not sure where to start answering this.
