Most likely not. Even if you were above 18 you would most likely put on 72 hour hold. But over all I think it’s a good idea that you go if you attempted. Psych wards aren’t for “crazy people” it’s not like the movies/shows at all. It’s for people who are in pain and there their too keep you safe and get you help. I highly recommend you go especially if you’re struggling with depression. You got this. And best of luck ❤️.
I'm not a doctor but I have been in the psych ward in the past. You're not being sent to the psych ward because you're "crazy," you're being sent to the psych ward because you tried to kill yourself less than 24 hours ago. They have a duty to monitor you and treat you until they feel confident you won't try again as soon as you're released and alone again. There's a medical wing in the ward where you'll probably start off and it's like a hospital room with vitals monitors and nurses checking on you.
You can attempt to check yourself out, but either your parents, the doctors, or both can force you to remain. Even if you were an adult, you would likely be placed on a hold right now.
If you no longer need medical monitoring and you are not actively a danger to yourself (slamming your self around) or a danger to others (starting fights) then you will be free to walk around the locked ward. You will get food, you will speak with doctors, you will get a blanket and pillow to sleep though it may be in a recliner instead of a bed, you will have access to showers, you will have access to books and some art supplies to draw, you will have access to a landline phone that you can use to call a friend or family member but there will be time limits. They will write down the numbers for you if you don't have them memorized.
