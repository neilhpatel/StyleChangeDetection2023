1543a (driving while under suspension for non-DUI reasons) — There is no mandatory sentence on a first offense, but some district court justices do give jail time. Subsequent offenses are punishable by up to six months in jail.
1543b (driving while under suspension for DUI or breath test refusal) — The mandatory minimum sentence is 60 days (maximum 90 days) on a first offense, a minimum of six months for a second offense and a minimum of two years in jail for a third offense. If the person has any alcohol or any drugs in his or her system at the time of the arrest, minimum jail time is 90 days.
"If you drive before being officially reinstated, you are subject to all the statutory penalties as if you drove your car during your suspension period. In fact, many people unknowingly rack up six or more suspended license violations in a short time, which can trigger a 30-day mandatory jail term.".
I would suggest using an alternative way to get to work not to chance it. They may impound your car as well.
Nope, been living in my car. Haven't heard anything from anyone but I am 2 days over. Thought maybe if I call in the morning they'd give me an extension before suspending me. I certainly don't want to risk getting pulled over tonight being as how I sleep in my car.
I had 10 days to call but did not because of money issues and living in my car. If I call tomorrow, explain, and ask for an extension will I be fine? Should I risk driving?
