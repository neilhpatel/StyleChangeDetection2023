Further evidence that Russian efforts to use energy as weapon have failed. Hopefully this will herald permanent move to renewables (and nuclear) over the coming decade(s).
You could argue that Nuclear is a renewable given it's possible to build reactors that produce more fissile material than they consume as well as recycle spent fuel into new fuel, and increasingly economical methods of extracting uranium from seawater.
Uranium is common enough, energy dense enough, and can be stretched enough that we have enough for something like millions of years at current energy usage with current technology.
Nuclear energy is just stupid expensive and requires the safe and secure storage of extremely dangerous material for an order of magnitude longer than any human governing entity has ever lasted.
Nuclear energy is one of the cheapest forms of energy once it's up and running and is the only form of energy production where the waste products are properly disposed of.
Coal powerplants produce more radioactive waste than nuclear ones, but unlike nuclear waste, coal power vents it's waste directly into the environment.
