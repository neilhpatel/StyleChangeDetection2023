If what you are saying is true, you should tell them you never noticed the problem, and if the inspector didn't catch it, it is likely a brand new problem that the brand new homeowners are going to need a brand new pair of windows for.
In summary, you can politely decline the new owner’s requests for money to fix something. Even better, you can tell your real estate agent to do so on your behalf.
I am not a lawyer, though I have bought and sold several houses. Almost every jurisdiction respects a “caveat emptor” rule when it comes to buying a house: once the house has been sold, the new owner cannot legally compel the old owner to pay for any issues the house might have. The only exception would be if the old owner intentionally misrepresented something about the house and the new owner could prove that in court (which is very difficult to do).
D) Can not be found via home inspection. Eg, inside the walls, you can't open up all the walls during a home inspection because that would damage the house.
If they can prove that you or your agent knew, or even ought to have known about the issue, they may be successful against you or your agent in court.
