You're spot-on when you describe those intriguing populations (coal miners, for example) that he swore he would help: revive the industry, blah, blah, blah... The same people supported him again. Somehow, he inspires faith in people he's lied to, misled, or whatever he can dream up to create a moment of hope mingled with confusion--but that sad hope seems to linger. In some, that hope foments some sort of twisted angst against imaginary causes that helped create the January 6 riots. Thank Heavens all of that sickness was captured on film. I can't stand to watch it anymore, but for that fool to claim innocence, blatantly abuse his former inner circle for being honest about their roles, and most importantly, his cheering on that mass of ignorant and disgustingly disrespectful szuzzballs, to think that Anyone would believe that he was innocent? That is even more laughable than his banana-colored comb-over!
