So for the locked gate... not at all. Because the gate is not the nuisance, nor the cause of the child's injury. For the OPs issue, the garden hose would have to be the attractive nuisance (kids wanna play with water in summer) but a hose is not likely to cause serious injury so owner would not have known a garden hose in a fenced yard would harm children by being a tripping hazard.
There is nothing in your yard that seems to make it likely to attract children such as a pool or other enticement. Your yard is properly fenced from your description. This does not sound like an attractive nuisance.
There is a difference between criminal and civil trespass. A closed gate, even without signage, is enough to signify the area is private property. Regardless, civil trespass does not require knowledge on the behalf of the trespasser. It rather defines the duty owed by the property owner to persons on their property. Higher duties are owed to invited persons than to trespassers - primarily duties to warn of known latent dangers.
