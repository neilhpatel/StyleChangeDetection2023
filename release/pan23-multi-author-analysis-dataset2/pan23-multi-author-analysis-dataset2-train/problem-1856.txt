he managed to subvert the democracy in the country sufficiently through his corrupt control over 5 terms so that he was able to win the election. it's an election won through the fruits of his corruption, therefore undemocratic. we have term limits in the us to prevent this sort of authoritarian dominance by a single politician. his party is the right-wing, war hawk party, and he maintains dominance in a classically fascist manner, rallying support by stoking fear of enemies, projecting strenh against them, and enriching himself and his supporters by plundering the spoils of his people. in this way, he is able to ensure loyalty and maintain dominance, thereby winning the "democratic" election, which in actuality is unfairly rigged in his favor by nature of his corrupt control of the country for 5 terms. it's basically the philippines, only he's a bit more subtle. there can't be a functional democracy in a country that has had a corrupt politician in control for 5 terms. if it was functional, he would be in jail.
do you know how long netanyahu has been in power and how corrupt he has been? does that seem like a functional democracy to you? the philippines are a "democracy" as well only in practice they function similarly to this, as an authoritarian dictatorship. hell, the US is barely a democracy, it's much closer to an oligarchy due to the influence of moneyed interests in politics.
The new government said that they'd "look into" undoing conversions if they werent done in an Orthodox manner. Like, literally telling Jewish people the weren't Jewish enough so it doesn't count.
