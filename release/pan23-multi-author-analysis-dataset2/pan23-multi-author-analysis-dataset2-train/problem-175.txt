Oh good grief. Call up whoever you talked to from the estate and tell them that you need an actual written agreement to terminate the lease early. The estate signs that, you sign that and you tell this "owners representative' to suck on a rock.
Also, this person is not the owner's representative. He might still have a contract with the estate, but any power he had to act on behalf of the landlord died with the landlord.
I will request the letter for formal termination of lease from the owner. I am sending a registered return receipt to the owners rep writing to confirm termination of the lease - merely to start a paper trail. They never answer email - they only call - so I indicated any further correspondence should be via email or certified mail. Thanks for your help.
The lease is to the property. When a property with an active lease gets sold, the lease transfers to the new owner. You would never continue to owe rent to the person who no longer owns the property. You would owe it to the new owner.
If the sale ends up falling through then you may end up owing the rent depending on the specifics of what all is in writing.
If the sale goes through as planned then it doesn't really matter what the owner representative thinks since they would no longer have a claim to the property. In this case, the new owners already expect you out anyway so they surely wouldn't bother you further.
