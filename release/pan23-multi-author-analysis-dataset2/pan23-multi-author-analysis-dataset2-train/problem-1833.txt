Generally you go to your own uninsured motorist coverage, and they segregate against the owner of the car.
Owning a car is basically a strict liability offense under our current regimes, so the driver doesn't necessarily need insurance if the owner of the car has insurance. I mean the owner of the other car.
And the reason you desperately need uninsured motorist coverage is for the case when neither the owner nor the other driver have coverage. Or in the case where one of them does but you don't want to be on the possibly end of things .
In modern America you definitely want car insurance even if you don't have a car just for the uninsured motorist coverage.
I was hit by a car while on foot and my health insurance went after my auto insurance, so I filed it under motorist claim and got the difference between what the health insurance demanded of my car insurance, and what my car insurance offered for the accident .
Thank you for the reply We looked into what would be covered under the uninsured motorist insurance for my friend but that only covers medical expenses in their case. Thank you again.
Thank you for the extremely quick response. I’ll have my friend reach out to see if we can get more information to see if the other party’s insurance maybe takes affect same day.
That's a very strange policy. Medical expenses For sure, but most uninsured motorist coverage also covers general losses presuming you have any sort of comprehensive coverage at all. It should be there to quote make you whole close quote .
