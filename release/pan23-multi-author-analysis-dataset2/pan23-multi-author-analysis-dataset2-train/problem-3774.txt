You should contact the property management corporate office to let them know what happened so they can take appropriate measures.
The OP is correct that it certainly seems like the neighbor only asked if they were hot tubbing that weekend in an effort to find out if they'd be around. To me, that clears up any muddiness - permission was not given by OP for him to use the apartment that specific weekend. I understand that prior agreements were made when he could use it, but not for that specific weekend.
The problem is that you gave him a key so it becomes a bit muddier, legally speaking. If you want to take civil or criminal action then I recommend contacting an attorney licensed in your state, as well as filing a police report. This is a very muddy situation in which many different domains of law are at play. It could very well mean that you're SOL and can't do anything about it, or you might actually have a case against him. Either way, I wouldn't take the advice of laypeople here because of the complexity of this problem.
