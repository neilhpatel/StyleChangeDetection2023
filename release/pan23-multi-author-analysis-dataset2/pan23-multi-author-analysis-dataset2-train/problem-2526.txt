Looking at laws on attorneys' fees in PA, it looks like generally each party bears their own costs. So absent some sort of contractual provision, it seems unlikely they would be awarded attorneys' fees, even if they were to prevail.
Furthermore, and I am just going off spending a few minutes reviewing PA laws on unfair trade practices, you may be able to allege fraud. Remedies for this include treble damages and/or attorneys' fees for you.
Second, you should not be scared of this if you have a good case, which it sounds like you do. You mentioned the promotion was verified in writing. Make sure you have this. Something in writing, if explicit, is even better than an audio recording. So it sounds like a winnable case in small claims. (You may want to contact the company one more time and provide the written proof you have of the promotion being tied to your account.).
So you may want to call around and see if you can find a lawyer to take this on contingency. You probably will not be able to prove up the fraud claims yourself, as this is getting more technical, but the award of attorney's fees may help you find a lawyer.
You're not going to take a lawyer for a case where the losses are around 1000$. This is small claims territory, which you'll just need to pay the filing fee and bring your evidence for.
I have sent them the written proof multiple times and they keep saying " I'm sorry my colleagues told you this. But they were wrong". I don't know that I want to get a lawyer involved as it's not worth it and I'm already super stacked with school and life. Thanks for the info! I might give small claims a go.
sorry, I worded that badly. the quote was what the support guy said. he was referring to his coworkers who previously talked to me. I am not an employee. I'm a gig worker.
