Aye, I agree. They've got to be residents. Residents don't have to be primary residents, however, and determining who is a resident is a 10th amendment issue. The federal government has not taken away the power to determine who is a resident of a state, so that is a right reserved for the state. So long as there's a definition of resident which the state uses that can be considered sufficient to logically be called a residency requirement, the state has general latitude in whether they wish to only include primary residents or any resident as an inhabitant for the purposes of running for office. If a state's law was "anyone who wants to be a resident can say they are", that'd be struck down. If a state says "you have to own/rent/live on property for X time here" that's going to easily be sufficient. And that means states don't have to require that a resident running for office has to be a primary resident. Again, it's a bad idea, but they can do that. Not all residents are primary residents.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
