The trees fall within the “eminent domain” part. However, since the eminent domain, an older neighbor behind us has even installed a driveway over the eminent domain (the eminent domain affected four lots, but is basically ignored as the county chose to leave it as is).
Since the county decided not to put the walkway in, they just left us to our own devices (they basically claimed eminent domain, but then decided they don’t need the space... so it’s weird).
If she owned the property prior to eminent domain, do you believe she will have a stronger case than the new neighbor?
If the property was taken in eminent domain, then it's owned by the city/county/state and he'll need their permission to do anything with it.
They promised her that the value of her property would increase due to connectivity and travel availability (the mayor of Baltimore at that time). However, it has decreased the value by 30,000’ish dollars, as now the train comes through once every 15 minutes with loud bells right in the front of the house.
Generally (and we should wait for someone more familiar with this to chime in and confirm) when something is taken by eminent domain, the government is required to pay fair market value for the property.
I guess one question I have is if they actually took ownership of the property, or simply used eminent domain to force an easement. For stuff that runs along the road, it's much more common to just get an easement for the use of the property rather than to actually split off a piece of the property.
If she didn't get paid for the value of the property, this makes me even more lean towards "it's an easement" since part and parcel of invoking eminent domain is that you MUST pay the person the property is taken from.
