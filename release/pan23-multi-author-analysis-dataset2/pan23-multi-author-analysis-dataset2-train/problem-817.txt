If they over paid her then she needs to pay it back. If they under paid her she would expect it to be corrected right?
If she does not pay it back they could sue here and likely would win — and they could ask for fees — and once judgment entered if not paid they could start adding interest.
Judge would wonder why someone would not question 10 months of pay being doubled — and why all of that money was spent without once questioning it — you are close friends with owner and never mentioned — does he seem that generous to double the pay of his employees during economic uncertain times?
The business owners are reasonable and are willing to work out alternative modes of repayment, e.g., work around their house.
I'm a broke graduate student, she has a few small gigs that add up to poverty level income, our rent is going up in 2022 and there are no affordable alternatives for us. She can't afford to repay, even 50 a month would cut into our grocery budget. Maybe, they might be cool with waiting until I make that industry coding money (They're very well off).
I'll be honest, i added some sparkle to the story (celebrating the 'raise'). Truth is, I found out about the double play two weeks ago and just found out about the entire situation today. I wrote the introduction in an angry inebriated state.
She certainly should have questioned the double pay. It sounds like she assumed it was an undiscussed raise and rolled with it... For 10 months. She's good at that kind of stuff.
If she keeps an amicable relationship, I don't see this going to the courts. I'm just going to tell her to document everything, keep things organized, and hope for the best.
