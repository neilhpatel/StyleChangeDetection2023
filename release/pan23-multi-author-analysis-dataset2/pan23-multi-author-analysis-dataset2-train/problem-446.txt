We have this in Canada and I think it's great but at the same time, this is giving a pass to companies to keep jacking prices. We are basically ruining our public funded programs to let the rich conglomerates off the hook.
And the average billionaire owner of grocery chain will just raise the profit margin on the products that now have no VAT. Uncontrolled capitalism will be our downfall.
That said, this shows the dangers of inflation. When companies grab more of a population's money, the government, being responsive to the people, may lower taxes to ease the burdens on the people. This then hampers the government's future ability to create and maintain a prosperous society. Further, it doesn't work because to a corporation there is never 'enough'. There is no natural mechanism nor safeguard to prevent them from continuing to raise prices. Meanwhile, there is a floor to tax cutting and at some point, the government becomes dysfunctional. The correct response is to create a progressive tax on corporate profits such that the more profit you make, the greater the tax to ensure that the tax burden couldn't be unduly passed on to customers.
