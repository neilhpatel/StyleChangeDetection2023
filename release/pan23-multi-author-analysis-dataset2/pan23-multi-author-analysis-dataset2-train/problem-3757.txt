I'm with you. The millions of trolls, young and old, gaslighting for the past 6 years across every public forum on the entire internet to drag unsuspecting political illiterates down their rabbit hole of hate in the name of making Donald Trump an emperor and purging everyone who doesn't agree with them are just as bad or worse, then any Tucker Carlson or Mitch McConnell. They aren't even getting paid! They are just so full of hatred and bloodlust they willingly volunteer to spend their days inserting alt right talking points and "just asking questions" in any conversation, even non political ones. Everyone wants to do the diplomatic thing and let these snakes that's make up the online conservative presence off the hook but you can get rid of a hundred Donald Trumps or Mitch McConnell and these ghouls will still be there doing what they do.
