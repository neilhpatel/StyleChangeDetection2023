The act of living your life will almost certainly leave behind enough information that any halfway competent PI can find you. However, if they harass you, you can pursue your new state's version of a restraining order.
Basically assume anyone can find you, but make it hard for them to do anything about it, and easy for you to notice and avoid them if needed.
I don't know if you can make it impossible, but I would get a P.O. box, and use it for everything you possibly can. This will make it more difficult to find where you live, but short of joining an Amish community or moving overseas, there's always a chance someone can track you down.
yeah, I think the best practical advice is select a place to live that is either something like a gated community, a large apartment building that has a doorman and multiple exits, or a rural location on a street with no parking, etc.
Rent a street address box at a UPS store or something similar in a different zip code. Use it for everything. Change your phone number and use no contract month to month service paid in cash. You have to give them an address. In my experience, they aren't picky about it. Use an address to fast food restaurant or something similar in town picked at random for social media that has an option for location and turn off location service on your phone.
Avoid using a credit card for a couple months, avoid paying for a phone bill in your name, go pay as you go. Use debit as much as possible. You could also get a new phone line in a different state with an incorrect address, or get a PO box in that state as your "billing address".
