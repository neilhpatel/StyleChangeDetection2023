In this situation, you failed to collect your own money. Your negligence caused someone to be able to take your money. It was your responsibility to take your cash back.
The store has no obligation to provide you with another $30 because you left it behind. The store isn't at fault, you are.
Riddle me this though, if I slip over and fall in the shop, I can get compensation. If someone steal from me in the shop, I cant?
If you slip and fall in the shop because of some sort of negligence on the part of the store (like leaving a spill on the floor) you could be compensated. If you trip over your own feet, or another customer trips you, you are owed nothing by the store because they weren’t negligent. The store wasn’t negligent in this case (you were the one leaving your money behind) so they don’t owe you anything.
: a slip and fall is due to the store's negligence. They did not keep the floor clean, and you slipped. It was their responsibility to keep the floor clean.
A slip and fall is the store's fault because they didn't clean up a mess on the floor. It was their responsibility to keep the floor clean and not slippery.
