Even I am surprised by this because I have been using the individual year ATF trace reports and only ever calculated 67%-70% intrastate origins.
California appears to be the source for its own crime guns 85% of the traces. I think that really blows out of the water the porous borders argument people use to defend Californias failures to address its gun violence.
