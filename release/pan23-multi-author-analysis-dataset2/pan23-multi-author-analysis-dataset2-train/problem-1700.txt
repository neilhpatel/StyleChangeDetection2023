Since you're in Arizona, you're in luck that court records and corporation records are publicly available. Look up his history and make sure he's not being sued all over the place by other 'investors' (note, court records are run by each county) and that he's not got tax liens or other signs of shadiness going on. A google search only means someone put the right keywords in some internet articles.
But yes, have an attorney review. Maybe you stumbled upon a one in a million, but this reads like every scam ever.
This is how scammers work. They meet people in seemingly random places like "the parking lot of a hotel." They appear to be "extremely successful as a business owner, inventor, and philanthropist" and they have "very high end" cars which are probably leased, and they always say something like that you "reminded him of his younger self" and then flatter you with "driven, passionate, young investors and entrepreneurs." And they always have websites to make it seem like "everything he said about his businesses and philanthropy is legit.".
