Care to provide a source for that claim? To my knowledge the AMA ethics guidelines only requires that the charges are reasonable which in itself is very open for interpretation and should vary based on the physicians experience, time, skill, and the overall quality of care. Which besides if it's an AMA guideline then that would be licensure issue not a legal issue for a client or employee.
You say your husband has an employment contract - those are pretty rare in the US. Is it a contract or an offer letter? If it's a contract, there should be some language about termination and what happens in that case. If it is an actual contract, the contract will tell you how he can be terminated and what he will get.
You should also look for language that states he is employed at will. The vast majority of people in the US outside Montana are employed at will and can be terminated for any reason unless it is specifically prohibited. Telling the CEO how you think he's running his business badly is not one of those reasons. This is not a case of wrongful termination.
