>In just one hundred days over 800,000 innocent Rwandan men, women, and children were brutally murdered while the developed world, impassive and apparently unperturbed, sat back and watched the unfolding apocalypse or simply changed channels. Almost fifty years to the day that my father and father-in-law helped to liberate Europe—when the extermination camps were uncovered and when, in one voice, humanity said, “Never again”—we once again sat back and permitted this unspeakable horror to occur. We could not find the political will or the resources to stop it. Since then, much has been written, discussed, argued, and filmed on the subject of Rwanda, yet it is my feeling that this recent catastrophe is being forgotten and its lessons submerged in ignorance and apathy. The genocide in Rwanda was a failure of humanity that could easily happen again.
From what I can recall, and what I can find, the “never again” statement comes well after 1994 – in 2014, in fact. Deputy Secretary-General (at the time) Eliasson gave a identifying precisely what measures that the UN took in the 20 years following the Rwandan genocide. It’s a useful source, and one that essentially gives you the second half of the answer I’m going to give below. (edit: /u/theradbaron explains better below).
