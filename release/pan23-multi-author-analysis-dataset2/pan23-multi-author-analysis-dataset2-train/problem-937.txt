Deere's stuff works at a level above what most US military equipment is running at, where 'above' means 'further away from the metal'. This simultaneously makes it more abstract, and by most definitions 'higher tech', but also makes it horrendously more vulnerable to attack, because those abstractions are well known and have far easier ways in. US military equipment is typically coded in a far more custom/purpose built way, closer to the metal, and is far more difficult for your average hacker to penetrate as a result (it requires far less common skillsets). Which is of course why it's done like that, even though it's slow as fuck to develop comparatively.
I guess they're trying to cut down on third party knock offs? >.> I could make so many piracy jokes here. Presumably this is easily reversible if the US actually decides to supply ATACMS.
Everyone already knew the US had provided Ukraine with the medium range GMLRS missiles, but had refused to provide the long range ATACMS missiles. What this article adds is that the HIMARS launchers in Ukraine came with custom DRM that would make them reject ATACMS missiles even if you...sourced one in some other way.
