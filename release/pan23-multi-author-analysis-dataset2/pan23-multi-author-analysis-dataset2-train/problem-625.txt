Ya, I think people here really underestimate how real life works in these situations. Erdogan has built defenses to his position around himself over decades in Turkey, having changed the constitution there and marginalized opposition. He is an authoritarian in everything but name now, and it's sad, as I had high hopes in the beginning for Erdogan when he came to power all those years ago. The West treated him with kid's gloves way back when as he was beginning to pivot his way toward tyranny and absolute party control, that he was able to get to the point that he's almost untouchable in Turkish politics. It'd be akin to saying to the people of Russia or China that they can make the choice to change their leadership - no, they can't. The State, and the party/people who have coalesced that power around themselves, have effectively neutralized rivals, and elections are just the lipstick on a pig to call it "fair". Or like Lukashenko in Belarus.
I thought that was Facebookia. Did the Party retroactively change that again? My newsletter hasn't been delivered yet - my local mailman got ambushed by the Avacado Toast Bandit and isn't allowed to leave the hospital until his bill is paid.
