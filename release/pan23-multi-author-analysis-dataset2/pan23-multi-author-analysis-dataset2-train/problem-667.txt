The policy is illegal, and if you are fired or reprimanded for talking about wages (save in some very limited circumstances) you can file a complaint with the NLRB. You can do so now, because even having you sign something like that violates the NLRA, but that's up to you.
If you are, you have no right to section 7 protected activity. If you are an employee rather than a supervisor, you would file an 8a1 complaint with the NLRB.

However, they can ding you for talking in meetings about off-topic subject matter. Talk about pay with coworkers at the bar on your own time is fine; talking about anything during meetings on the close is only fine if boss allows it.
As long as you are not in management, with the authority to act as a supervisor, discussing pay is a protected activity under the National Labor Relations Act. You can make a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board, as the policy that they're asking you to sign is not legal, and enforcing it is even less legal.
