This is very confusing. Are you simply paying twice for the current month, b/c you have leases at 2 properties? (Or did you renew your lease on the studio, and have two year-long leases). While it sucks to pay two rents for the overlapping month, it's not weird. No one is going to sublet an apartment for the remainder of March.
If you're totally out and they haven't begun marketing again, you should request they put it on the market for (as soon as they get it repaired). What makes sense is not that they would have "found a subletter", but provided you the opportunity to stop paying rent if they found an entirely new year-long tenant.
If it is for a full year renewal and you're on the hook for it, start marketing. Facebook Market & Craigslist are very easy, but you can also post to Zillow/Trulia and a few others.
This was after in September that they said my broker can find someone to take over. I have proof of that email. I just can't seem to find proof of the email saying they'd give me March free. That was over the phone and an email confirmation (twice). I'm usually fairly organized but for some reason it's disappeared.
I'm more frustrated by the lies and the back and forth of "ask your broker for help" then "talk to management" and then "figure it out yourself." But on a positive, I love my new place.
Yes, I'm paying for two leases. I told the old place I will not renew after the end of this month, and my current lease started mid January this year. The old place ends at the end of this month.
(Also, rental requirements are pre-set by the owner, so it’s typically pass/fail. Not much you can do if someone fails. That’s why they hired managers).
