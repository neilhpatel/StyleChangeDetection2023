Took a break from non fiction after "Why Dinosaurs Mattered" and worked through some sci fi, but I'm back in the saddle. Reading through @war by Shane Harris on the rise of cyberwar and fighting on the internet. Good stuff so far, although I'm not super taken by the writing style.
Are there any books that look at the early history of dinosaurs? By that I mean the study of them, particularly in the 1800s and early 1900s. Read a lot about it when I was really young, but wouldn't mind getting back in now and seeing it from a more serious perspective.
I read it a while ago but I remember The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs by Steven Brusatte covered some of that, although not extremely comprehensive, it may be worth looking into.
Hello, I'm looking for a book about the China Warring States period, possibly written by contemporary historians rahter than ancient accounts. Does askhistorians have any suggestion?
Also rereading "The Library Book" by Susan Orlean. All about a massive fire at the LA Library in the 80â€™s, as well as a look at libraries across North America and in general. its a good mix of history and also the challenges facing modern libraries as they try and switch over to becoming more 'community centers' and having to choose between cutting down on books or what else to do.
I bought a copy of the book because I couldn't get it through the library and I enjoyed it enough that I've been literally pushing it at people. "Read this. Borrow my copy, read it.".
Really did. The writer clearly loves the subject and the writing was good. Plus I love dinosaurs so he was preaching to the choir. It was interesting enough that I went and tracked down the attached tedtalk for a bit more.
Oh I bet the audiobook would be fantastic. The tedtalk he just radiates passion for it. Do you remember off hand how long the audiobook was? I might give it a listen just for him.
