In 2019, if you were salaried exempt, you would have had to be paid at least $455/wk. It would presumably have been the same weekly salary, you didn't need to sign anything, no contract, no new contract, etc. "You're hired" and "fill out this W4 and I9" is enough in the United States.
There are classifications beyond, and to the side, of "manager." But, "I was put in front of a distillation machine, trained, and preformed production level work for 80% of my time" does not sound like it could be classified as salaried exempt work.
You can contact BOLI over this, but the statute of limitations on overtime wage claims in Oregon is two years, so do not delay. (You have six years to sue over contract disputes.) If you were truly part owner, then you will have to sue, not file a BOLI claim. Maximum is $10,000 in small claims court.
Their defense to BOLI may include that you were a part owner. But that doesn't sound accurate. A lawsuit, doesn't matter.
For what? You either file a wage claim or you sue. Sure, you can demand that they pay you the OT, but I'd bet 99.99% they ignore the demand.
You can file a claim, but there is a 2 year SoL on overtime claims in OR. The other factor is they don't take claims in a business that you were a partner, owner or had a direct financial interest in. INAL so I don't know how the small equity stake and/or the clawback would impact that.
