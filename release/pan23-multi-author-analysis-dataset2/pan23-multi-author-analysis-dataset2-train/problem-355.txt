I kinda feel like complaining to his department would do more harm than good. Just kinda figured complaints go no where when files on an officer. But yea it was only because of the large equipment, but his cars are on the only public road that I can get to my house on. There will be more excavation to be done, as I just moved there so there will be more equipment coming down that road.
Call code enforcement, your neighbor will be an ass about it. Film all interactions with him on the future. Him threatening you is considered a crime in some places and he will face consequences at work because it violates police ethic codes/policies. That’s on him, not you.
Thanks for the advice fam. Will definitely give them a call. I had the same thought to record or voice record our next convo. Would have this morning but didn’t anticipate this happening. I’ve heard neighbors say he’s a sick but I was in disbelief when he started going nuts.
Nah no curb the street leads straight to my driveway and dead ends at my house. He’s just parked as close as he can get to my property line. All 4 tires of the vehicles are off his property and on the public street. There is barely room for a car to get out of my driveway.
