Yea, just read up on specifics... It's Griddy specifically. You pay $9 a month then pay pure whole sale prices... makes sense on paper but when it jumps from $1,200 to $9,000 a Mega Watt things go south real fast.
The only people that paid the super high prices (other than the providers) were those that purchased electricity through services like Griddy, at market price. I'd be shocked if the terms they agreed to didn't point out they could end up paying super high prices if the wholesale prices skyrocketed.
Interestingly enough the ERCOTO order I linked below manipulated the market, Griddy prices would have immediately jumped 8x when that order was signed even though it was directly manipulated and not the state of the market at that exact time.
Basically the pricing was raised to the maximum level by this order, therefore not gouging and working as intended.
