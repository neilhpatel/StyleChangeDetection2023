This is a disaster waiting to happen. You will make it harder for the police to arrest and for the DA to prosecute. You "evidence" you collect won't be admissible in court. Just report whatever you already know so they can be properly investigated. And so you don't break any laws yourself.
First of all, I really discourage the untrained in doing investigations of this type. Not because I don't believe in your abilities, but the legal field is a minefield that can result in you jeopardizing the case, or worse, get yourself into trouble.
Now that being said, from what you've said I don't think you're at that point, but if you have a name, I'd save the snapshots as pictures or something else with metadata. Then since it's the internet and wired communications that crosses state lines, you'll want to contact your local PD AND the FBI field office in your area.
I'd avoid doing anything like committing to meeting up, but don't cut ties either. One reason is obviously for your safety, but the other is thst the LEOs may want to use your connection to him to get him to a place where they can interview and possibly make an arrest. But you've done some leg work and now it's time to hand it over to people who can get the appropriate subpoenas, warrants, and other legal devices to catch this guy.
Local PD: Call your local government and they can give you the local PD business line, NOT the 911 hotline which should be used only in an emergency.
