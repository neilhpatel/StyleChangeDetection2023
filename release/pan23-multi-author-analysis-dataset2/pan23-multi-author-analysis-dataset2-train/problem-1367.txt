Other than mere speculation/concern, is there anything to substantiate a wage theft issue exists? Do paystubs match pay rate and hours worked?
There have been instances where wages are...not getting paid in a timely manner? A new employee didn't get his first check, not the "first one the employer keeps" but the actual first one he was due to get, but got the second, third, fourth, etc. It took him roughly 5 weeks to get that check. There have also been instances where multiple employees paychecks come days later than the payroll date with no clear reason given by management.
In my opinion, those instances paired with the lack of a supervisor (who again, is the one who sends payroll each week to upper management) lead me to believe there may be cause for concern. I suppose it's not wage theft until it actually happens, I can't accuse them of anything for certain. But with the contract dying and the security company essentially abandoning the half of their employees who wanted to stay at the post, I wouldn't put it past them to pull something like that.
NAL, but an 18 hour shift is most likely legal, barring any state laws or union policies. Does your friend have access to a restroom and allowed to take their meal breaks?
We're in Indiana by the way, but my crappy googling I couldn't find maximum shift lenhs. He doesn't get a meal break or any 15's, we usually work 8 hour shifts with no meal, but thank God he was able to door dash or order pizza to get through this. There is a restroom.
Yeah I never questioned the lack of breaks or meal. The issue I had was with him having to work an 18 hour shift. They usually just eat whenever business slows down, which is fine.
