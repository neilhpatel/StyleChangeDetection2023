Not really - the XKCD you probably got that info from is outdated. Dictionary attacks go after common words (hence dictionary) and common substitutions. If it can be found in that dictionary, it is functionally 1 unit of complexity and not really any better than a single character.
If you want the easy to remember, impossible to brute force, pick a sentence and use the entire thing, punctuation and all.
Just be careful you don't use common phrases. If it's common (e.g. knowledge is power), the whole thing might appear in a good dictionary and then it becomes 1 unit of complexity.
E.g. the above sentence is 22+ units long (i.e. too long to dictionary attack even with a good dictionary), will never get guessed and is easy enough to remember.
In a comment further down I specify that adding adding some characters like dashed and backslashes would be better. Capitalization and numbers would help, too. But still, password123 is better than Pass123.
Would stand up against a dictionary attack, but a clever cracker might test for random strings of letters. Could start with the alphabet sequence. Would be best to add in a dash, or forward/backslash every few letters.
