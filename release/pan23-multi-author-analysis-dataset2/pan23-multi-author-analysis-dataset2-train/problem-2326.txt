Here time is basically against you, as if you don’t show up past the 30 day notice you could be considered to have breached your contract and abandoned work.
I didn't mention it to the boss until the school board actually voted it through (in which it passed about a week ago). I was holding off on talking to him until I did some investigating. From talking to people at work, I've heard his legal team thinks letting me go early is acceptable.
Really this all depends on what your contract says. We can't know that. You need to have an attorney look at it. They could just be claiming that they can cancel it assuming that you won't fight for what you're owed and just let them take it. Saying "I've heard his legal team thinks letting me go early is acceptable" is taking advice from your your opponent, it's the hens in the hen house listening to the fox.
Your new boss’ legal team is not your legal team. You will need to get copies of the policy at the time you were employed and a copy of your contract, along with whatever termination notice they gave and go to an attorney as soon as possible.
