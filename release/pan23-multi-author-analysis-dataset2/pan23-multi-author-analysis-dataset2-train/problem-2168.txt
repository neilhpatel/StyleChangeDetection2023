I am only giving you information that I am aware of you can google both SSDI or SSI and you can search the Social Security Administration for your state ..
I am confused you say that your Father is disabled and on Social Security . I find it hard to believe that if he is on SSDI or SSI that he does not have health insurance . I have a few friends that are on one or the other and I remember in conversation one on SSDI saying that if he did not get health insurance (which he had to pay $2.00 a week once the Affordable Health Markets opened in our area around 2015 ) that SSDI said they would stop his payments if he did not purchase heath insurance .
There are 2 types of Social Security the 1st one is SSDI where you either worked long enough to qualify or you were disabled before age 22.
This SSDI on the Social Security website states that every worker that receives this will have Medicare -{ which pays hospital stays , Dr Visits pus more } automatically 2 years after you become disabled .
The 2nd is SSI which pays benefits based on financial need ( SSI is when a person did not work long enough to qualify for SSDI } In most cases of a person having SSI they have medicaid which also pays hospital stays , Dr visits and prescriptions in most cases .
When he gets medical bill he has to still pay a good chunk lets say from 30k he pays 3k-5k I believe it’s not fully covered. Now he’s going to be in the hospital for an unknown amount of time it will add up Really fast. My mom understands bills don’t need to be paid off immediately. But he wants to sell the house to have it paid off since his name is on the deed so he is not trying to pay it off for years.
In my area I do not know anyone that lost their home immediately to healthcare debt . Don't get me wrong they can sue your Dad but where I live this can take a few years and it looks like this just happened to your family . also I was wondering ?? see below.
