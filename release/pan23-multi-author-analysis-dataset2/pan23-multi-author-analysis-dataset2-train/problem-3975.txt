This isn't just an act of malice. It's an election tactic. When your enemy starts winning, start setting fire to everything.
Then when you're defeated, and your enemy needs to pick up the pieces......blame them for being unable to pick up the pieces fast enough. Then you win the next election.
This is exactly what happened in the province of Alberta in Canada. The province's main conservative party had been in power for 44 consecutive years without any interruption until 2015 when the NDP (New Democratic Party, Canada's main-stream left-wing party) won the election because the conservatives had fucked shit up so much.
The NDP did the best they could trying to fix the shit the conservatives spent nearly half a decade breaking, and when they couldn't get it all fixed in one term, people got mad at them and voted the conservatives back in 4 years later in 2019 and the conservatives have been working diligently on breaking shit again since then.
And then the Tories will blame all the current problems on Labour, and Labour will waffle around and not commit hard enough to actually get anything done, so that the Tories are right back in a few years.
Even if they commit hard on fixing the shit the Tories broke, people will just get mad that they can't fix everything in one term then vote the Tories back into power.
It's so sad to know that out of the options we have to lead the country, none of them actually inspire confidence. Especially infuriating is the fact that there has to be people out there who know best and would absolutely do what it takes to put us on the right track, but that these people are extremely unlikely to ever be given the chance to make any meaningful decision.
