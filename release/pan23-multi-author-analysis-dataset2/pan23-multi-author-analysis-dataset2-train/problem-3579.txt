The fact bbc was ripping on the Var call, then at half made fun of var on how they’d call on the pk taker, had me dying.
A few years ago I think the initial approach was a fine of $1000, when there were many court cases for this. But, if gran doesn't pay the fine....
I live in a very inconvenient location for them to just send someone. Last time it happened I told him I'd look into it and closed the door on them. Didn't hear back for a couple of years.
They do show up eventually I told them they can’t come in and closed the door then sent them a email revoking the right to implied access and hasn’t seen or heard from them since.
I am now on year two of receiving a final notice indicating the beginnings of an investigation. I get one every month or so. The red envelopes are nice.
Just email n signup. Fake name or whatever. They don’t ask for addy when signing up for bbc account. Least i remember. Or just Google one.
E: make sure you are logged into UK area on vpn BEFORE opening the web browser and searching for bbc itv. It must recognize your location to work.
I use express vpn. Because it’s the one I’ve had for a few years. Never had any issues. Can connect all devices. Sure a bit pricey ($100/year) but been worth it.
