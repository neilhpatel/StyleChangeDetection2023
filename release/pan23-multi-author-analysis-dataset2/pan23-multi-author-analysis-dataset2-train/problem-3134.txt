As a background they're both recovering addicts who have been doing great the last 3 years. Holding steady jobs and taking care of themselves. They slipped up a month ago and apparently have been using ever since. They got into a fight last night and she called police to have him arrested. He's damaged me, and my family, financially a number of times due to his addiction. I am trying to stay as removed as possible as I do not want to be involved directly. Not sure if that's possible though.
If you use the AAA road assistance you have to be present as the card holder. Ran into this issue stranded at a grocery store when my mom was 8 hours away.
A young woman clipped a curb and popped a tire in front of my house a week ago. She had a flat spare. I called triple A for her, they filled her up and changed it, no questions asked. Worst case you tell the truth, towing my brother's car to his house. They say no.
The issue is that I do not want to be there. His ex is on meth amphetamines and is unpredictable on a good day. He lives at the apartment too but not on the lease.
