I would mail a certified return-receipt-requested letter(these are different things, I would do both) to the appropriate office (keep a copy). In the letter I would nicely ask for a printed/written copy of the sleep study report (a part of your medical record), including the interpretation and final diagnosis - give them a good address to mail the report to.
Mention that you have been unable to have an appointment made with the doctor who ordered the test and (factually) explain what has happened.
If you are still having bothersome symptoms that could be caused by a sleep disorder, mention whatever these ongoing symptoms are and that if this office is unable to provide ongoing care in a timely fashion you will be forced to seek care elsewhere, for any necessary treatment.
I would ask also if the responsible doctor could either call you on the phone or have a video conference or include a note/letter with the sleep lab report that explains what it means and what (if any) treatment or intervention or additional testing he recommends.
In addition, legally you are likely obligated to pay for the sleep test that was performed, although you could argue that the test is not complete until you are informed of the results - which has hot happened yet. If an insurance company is involved, see what they say about you paying or not paying the balance of your bill before you are informed of the test results.
I just want to jump and say that certified and return receipt are two different things, but you must pay for certified (or other applicable service) in order to qualify adding return receipt.
