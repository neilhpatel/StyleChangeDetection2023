The Civil Rights Law of 1965 bars discrimination based on "race, creed, or national origin", so a country-exclusive criteria was exactly what the law was created to stamp out and it's hard to create some kind of litmus test for discriminatory leanings.
No, but if immigrants continue to discriminate against other immigrants based on the old country's caste system, that not technically against the law yet.
"Caste" doesn't cleanly fit into any of those protected classes as it's not explicitly racial or religious, so it loopholes out of enforcement.
I've seen Indian caste discrimination first hand, and it's just as ugly as any klansman. It was shocking.
I've seen it too. Tech workers are mostly brahmans. Some lower classes snuck in because the government has affirmative action in India. Oh boy, it's rough. I've also seen them mistreat indian taxi drivers, etc. They know the caste,.for me.thwy all look the same. But yes it's a thing.
