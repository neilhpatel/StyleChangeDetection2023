If money is an issue NOW, who is to say that later on if they become financially strapped they wont attempt to find some way to make you financially responsible?
They are certainly not hurting for money right now. Both the friend and her partner are individually successful. It's more of a comfort thing. They know me. They know I don't/didn't have health issues as a child. Good friends with my mom. And honestly my mom wants to be a part of this child's life - she's already a part of the friend's other child's life. That's what gives me most concern. I believe that my mom being a part of the child's life will, by association, create some sort of parental dynamic between me and the child - which the courts may be able to use to compel me to pay child support in the future.
With a second parent adoption that’s very unlikely. Basically, once you have a court order defining two parents, neither of whom is you, it can only be challenged based on a few circumstances (eg fraud).
We are in loose contact with our donor’s parents, and open to a more significant relationship. Even more than that, he’s a friend and part of our lives. We have photos of him holding our kid as an infant. It’s great to have that open door so if she has questions it’s not a black box, and none of the lawyers we spoke with were concerned about any of that.
