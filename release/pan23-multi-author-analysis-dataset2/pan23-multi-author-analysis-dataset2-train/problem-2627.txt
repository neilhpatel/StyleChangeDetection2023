Hi. Former SBA construction loan specialist here. First off you are correct that any changes to the contract need signed change orders (for this reason), secondly I would submit payment for the remainder of the contract balance and keep your receipt. Next, if he was a licensed contractor, contact the state board and ask their opinion and you can also file a complaint with them. Extortion is illegal. The shitty thing is, they can file a lien on your property for non payment but that’s not the end of the world. Hopefully you can get it resolved before that point. Lastly I’d try to find a real estate attorney in your area. They’ll be knowledgeable enough in this area to assist you. Sorry you’re dealing with this. There are some shady contractors out there. Going forward alway verify they have a valid license and always ask for their references (not google reviews) and call them to ask how the job was done and if any issues arose during the project.
If the contractor agreed to a specific scope of work and that changes required a signed change order (you should double check your contract - sometimes there's slippery language), you should tell him to get wet.
If he makes good his threat of a lien (that would be crazy; he probably won't) you should consult a lawyer.
I reached out to multiple lawyers, and they all essentially said it wasn't worth their time and I'll likely have to go to small claims court.
