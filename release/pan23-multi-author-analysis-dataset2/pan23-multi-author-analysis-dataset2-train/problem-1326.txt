The FSB does have the force to dictate realities. But they lack legitimacy to make such changes, its bigger than them.
Pick an oligarch. Any oligarch. They would all love to see him gone so one of them can take his place. It's just that Putin very effectively uses his military and his security apparatus to prevent that outcome. The oligarchs know it so none of them are dumb enough to pose a threat to him, much less challenge his authority. They know what happens to anyone that crosses Putin. Putin didn't get where he is by playing fair or being Mr. Nice Guy; he did it by killing or co-opting his rivals.
Russian oligarchs want whoever is in place of Putin to secure their wealth from the popular resentment, and to not hinder their ability to live luxoriously, to compensate for foreign sanctions and other from the state budget.
Because they don't have force to replace anyone, that's the part of the deal for their security: they don't mess with politics. And those who did were singled out and stripped of everything, or worse.
