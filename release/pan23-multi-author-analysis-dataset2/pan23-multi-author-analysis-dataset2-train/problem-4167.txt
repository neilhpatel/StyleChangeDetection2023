Your tenancy continues until the property is vacated and returned to landlord or your roommate signs a new lease not including you.
Not sure what you mean by extending the lease? If any terms of the lease are changed, you both would need to sign the “new” extended lease. If you signed the extension, you are responsible for the terms in the lease.
I forgot about this very complicating detail: we paid a fee to end the lease early since I got a job offer and had to move and she didn't want to find a new roommate. We initially had to pick a move-out date (8/7) to calculate the prorated rent that we would owe and she keeps moving that date back.
OP’s tenancy continues until the property is surrendered back to landlord. As does the obligation for rent. Their lease has apparently ended (though this sounds messy). They’re not obligated to a specific term, but their tenancy can’t end until the property is vacated and surrendered.
I would argue the property WAS surrendered and OP vacated by 8/7. In my mind, this means that OP’s obligation under the lease are effectively over. The landlord agreed to extend the date KNOWING OP was no longer a tenant. This is an issue between the current tenant (roommate) and the landlord.
This is well settled law. The property is surrendered when vacated by tenant and returned to landlord. It has not been.
Remember that in this case “tenant” is the two of them. Again, this is a huge challenge in co-tenancy.
