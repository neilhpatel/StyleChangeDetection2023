Honestly my job is dime a dozen so I’m not worried about the job specifically, but more about my reputation. I also know his family and would hate for them to think I’d do something so awful. I don’t think he would lie to me about being told my number was registered to his phone, so I’m really just flabbergasted as to what the hell happened.
Verizon doesn't tell people that information, so immediately the story is suspect. Perhaps this person is fishing for a confession?
We can't really speculate about what he was told or what it might mean. Except to say that cellular carriers can block the IMEI of stolen phones to render the phone useless on their network.
He said it was a brand new phone so the serial number was never used and when he filed a claim with verizon they were able to see it was already registered to my number. I am not very tech savvy, but I know that people can disguise phone numbers through apps. Could that be a possibility? I’m just so confused about what happened and how my phone number is now connected to a phone I’m not using.
