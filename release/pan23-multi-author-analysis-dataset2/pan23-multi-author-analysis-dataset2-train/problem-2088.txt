Tell your work to cancel the cheque if it hasn't been deposited yet and reissue the cheque. If the cheque has been deposited then tell the police and the bank.
In addition to having the check cancelled, get direct deposit so your pay goes from work to your bank.
Bear in mind you might have to pay a fee (because work will have to pay a fee) to cancel that check. Also, if she's managed to cash it, your workplace will not be able to help you.
If she’s already cashed it the workplace can still help. They would need to contact their bank and report that the check was fraudulently endorsed. (OP can also report this to the bank the checks are issued from, although it’s much easier if they work together.) The bank will likely have OP complete an affidavit saying they did not endorse the check, and that it was endorsed fraudulently. Then employers bank should be able to get the funds back from MILs bank, and the employer can reissue the check to OP.
Well money does make people do crazy things, I would definably recommend using direct deposit in future. this way the money goes directly to the bank.
