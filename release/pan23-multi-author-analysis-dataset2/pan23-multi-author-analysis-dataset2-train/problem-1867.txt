Megaraptors aren't dromaeosaurs (raptors), (they may have been feathered, but this is unclear). They are a medium sized type of dinosaur with a large sickle claw on their hand (similar to Baryonychine spinosaurs, Noasaurs and Neovenatorids... it appears many dinosaurs had hand claws). The featherd dionsaur being referred to is the Dromaeosaur Unenlagia.
I've been terrorised by a few Canadian goose on my time. Honestly moose park would be just as majestic and terrifying. Probably couldn't have made it into the kitchen though.
Unless I missed it somehow, the article doesn't talk about finding any evidence of feathers at all.
Reuters' title gives the impression that fossils containing evidence of feathered dinosaurs were found.
The megaraptor remains they found "also include some unusual remains of unenlagia, velociraptor-like dinosaurs which likely lived covered in feathers.".
Deinonychus has feather quill knobs and hollow bones. With this and other evidence Ostrom moved raptors into the category of feathered dinosaurs without the fossilized remains of feathers. Their feet were made for running. They had cartilaginous rods the lenh of their tails to stiffen them as rudders. They likely used wing-assisted running and it is speculated they jumped on prey, held on with wing claws and feet and began biting their prey with their 72 serrated teeth. They caused their prey's death through massive blood lose and organ damage. All that from skeletons and devoted research. I bet these raptors have evidence of the same.
