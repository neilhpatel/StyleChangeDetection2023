When the Trump news broke I was thrilled that this was serious enough to send him to jail and end his political career. Since this Biden fiasco came about there are 2 options and they both suck, 1) Bidens is swept under the rug and Trump gets charged. This proves those people right and makes Trump look stronger or 2) they both pay the price for mishandling classified information. Gray area comes in the Russia Investigation in which Mueller said the DOJ wouldn’t indict a sitting president. Which means Biden would be indicted in 2024 as there is a greater chance he would not be re-elected, so what’s the point of waiting?
I think it extends to a lot of high level politicians. As overblown as the Clinton Email scandal was, there was an element of truth to the claim that it was mishandled classified information that should have been more properly handled. Obviously this should never be equated to the willful hiding and possible sale of classified information, but eventually if high level politicians keep mishandling info, something important will leak.
