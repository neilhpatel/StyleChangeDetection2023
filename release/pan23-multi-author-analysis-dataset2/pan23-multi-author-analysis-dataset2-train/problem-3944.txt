From what you wrote I don’t see anything that would violate a typical lease. Landlord may try to evict you but would not be successful. If they truly want you out you may be able to negotiate a cash for keys agreement, she buys you out of the contract essentially.
Just read your edit, review your lease and what it says regarding the amount of people staying at the residence. If you violate those rules she may have grounds to evict you.
How long is your lease for? If you are month to month, she can technically give you a 30-60 day notice to vacate.
If you have a fixed term though, unless your lease says (and I highly doubt it) that you can’t advertise a roommate listing for your apartment, then you haven’t broken any rules. Even if your lease did say that, I highly doubt it could be enforceable. Had you moved someone in without her consent, then she would have every right to terminate the lease.
Have you responded to her text yet? I would respond by apologizing for the confusion and just reiterate what you said here. That you were initially looking for a fourth roommate but you deleted the posting as soon a you knew it wouldn’t be allowed in order to stay compliant with the terms of the lease.
