Good Samaritan laws are civil liability shields if you injure someone while making a good faith attempt to rescue them. They have no effect on criminal justice in either direction, and cannot protect you from the police if they discover evidence of a crime as a result of your intervention.
Do not speak to the police without a lawyer at this point. Plan as though you are likely to be arrested, until your lawyer tells you otherwise.
You need a lawyer. Your phones have been seized as evidence of a crime, and the police have other evidence that also connects you to a crime. Having two phones is not illegal, but having two phones and a bunch of drugs is a great place for a prosecutor to start building a case for possession with intent to distribute, which can put you in jail for a very long time.
OP, it's going to hinge on the amount of drugs found and whether it falls under personal use amounts. As mentioned, you need a criminal defense attorney, now, and to not speak to the cops without that attorney around.
As I recall, if the phone is locked with a fingerprint or face lock, you can be compelled to unlock it, but if it's a PIN code or pattern lock, you cannot be.
