The Goodreads account is, I believe, reflective of the AskHistorians . This list is compiled and maintained by our flaired users. To speak directly to your question, this means that the Goodreads list should be updated when the main booklist is updated.
Now, when is the main booklist updated? Sporadically. Basically, the main booklist is updated whenever a flair or group of flairs volunteers their time to do so. Sometimes this is a lone flair adding a single book, but sometimes it is a large coordinated project by a lot of flairs. An example of the latter type of revision is the which was the subject of a massive and comprehensive reworking in the not too distant past.
Relatedly, I notice that the booklist has Amazon affiliate links. Would it be possible to add bookshop.org affiliate links so that purchases can support independent bookstores?
We use Amazon (with permission of the site Admins) as it allows us to fund things for the sub like the prizes we hand out at at the end of the year, and - in non-apocalyptic times - conference presentations. I didn't know that there was a comparable option for independent stores though! Can't promise anything, as it would take quite a lot of time to update everything, but we absolutely would consider adding in an affiliate link for that as well.
It's definitely a long list! the info for the bookshop affiliate program. They only launched a couple of months before the pandemic, but it's a good alternative to Amazon.
Just wanted to thank you again for the recommendation. I've been a total putz but did finally get around to setting up an affiliate account so we can add them as alternative links for those who'd prefer to skip Amazon.
