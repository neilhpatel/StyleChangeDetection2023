Unfortunately that's an easy pivot for the GOP. They've already prepped for a while saying that the IRS is a biased partisan organization that goes after Conservatives. All they'll have to say is "They're not tax cheats, they're being asked to pay more than their fair share. Taxes are evil and the dems want to take your tax dollars to turn kids into eunuchs/gays/trans/whatever they're hatemongering about".
Law and order and and more back the blue for the poor, addicted, and mentally ill. Let crime run wild though for the tax cheats and white collar criminals.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
