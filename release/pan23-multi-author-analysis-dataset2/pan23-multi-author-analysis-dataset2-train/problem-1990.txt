Yes, the officer can come to court and testify as to however he measured you actually going however fast you were actually going, and exercised his discretion in reducing the speed on the ticket.
It sounds like he did you a favor by writing it for 60 as 80 could be considered reckless speeding or endangerment in some states. He could absolutely say he clocked you going 80 but cut you a break, but the radar will be his main evidence for the trial. He'll say that he checked the calibration prior to and after his shift, making it a valid argument. You can also plead no contest, which the judge will hear both sides and probably ask you to still pay the fine.
Have you ever heard the phrase “don’t look a gift horse in the mouth”? This is a prime example. Pay the five over and be happy. If you go to court and try to argue that the ticket or evidence is invalid because he actually clocked you at 25 over, there’s a good chance they good agree with you, then amend your ticket back to 80 mph to correct the discrepancy. Be happy with what you have.
The ticket was for Yonkers, NY. I am not sure if that makes any difference in what evidence is promissible. Just to clarify, even though he wrote the ticket for going 60 in a 55, and I was clocked doing 80, he can show up and say I was doing 80 despite what the ticket says? I dont have much knowledge of the law sorry, for mistakes or confusion.
