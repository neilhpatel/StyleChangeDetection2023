DeSantis ordering courses wiped because of ”Black queer theory”, and this, Florida is really just going to continue flushign more of itself down the crapper. And on a related note, saw this clip on Twitter earlier, a guy on the Daily Wire saying book banning is a Western tradition and modernity “liberal” idea, so I have no doubts that these people are chomping at the bit to ban them. (Also noticed far down that someone put “that” page of Gender Queer in the replies, anyone else notice that tactic, where they put the image in order to get you to say “that is acceptable“ or ‘that is unacceptable” so either way you lose?).
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
