Congress is protected by the Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution. It will take either rebalancing (packing) SCOTUS and/or a Constitutional amendment to fix the problem. The STOCK act made it an explicit felony anyway, and guess what effect it had? None. We get even Democrats entering Congress with less than a million net worth, only to be worth more than a couple million half way through their terms, and it being a mathematical impossibility for it to come from actually working based on salaries.
Capitalism is 100% about the destruction of democracy and the concentration of wealth/power. It isnâ€™t surprising, then, that it happens in the very heart of our government. It is truly bipartisan. Now, only some Democrats are trying to fix this. Every Republican opposes even ceremonially addressing it, let alone doing something with teeth.
