What is the point of your comment and further more she actually addressed the issue of the Republicans being racist towards her and Omar in the press release that Rep Tlaib made.
Now one time her "accidentally" using a antisemitic trope I'd forgive and be understanding, but she's done this a lot. Every time she either hides behind saying she's not antisemitic just anti-israel but the language she uses is always antisemitic tropes. That or she'll either give a half hearted apology or do nothing and hope it goes away.
And boebert is a horrible person who I despise, doesn't change the fact that several times tlaib has been antisemitic. Just because Republicans are awful doesn't mean I'll support antisemitism. That's the point of my comment, she's a hypocrite. She claims this language is bad then she uses it herself disguised as "I'm only against Israel" while calling Jews sneaky and greedy and at one time literally retweeting a poster about ethnic cleansing all Jews from Israel.
