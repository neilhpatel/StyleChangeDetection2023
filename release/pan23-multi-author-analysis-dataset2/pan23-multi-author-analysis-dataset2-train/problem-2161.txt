That's true. They are a very reliable news outlet. Them and AP, everyone else has some kind of influence in the way they produce their articles it seems.
Is there any evidence that isn't how it happened? At least right now, that is reasonably what actually happened.
If you don't think that is what happened, then wait to publish the story until you have all the facts.
That's not the point, the point is that there isn't any evidence that shows that it did happen that way, which is why they didn't put it in the headline. Reuters reports facts, not unsubstantiated claims.
You're just taking their unsubstantiated claim as fact, which Reuters wouldn't do for their headlines. They may include the ISF's claim in the article, but do they say it's true? No, they just report the facts. Fact, guy was killed. Fact, ISF claimed they had a good reason. Reuters doesn't verify that the claim is valid, nor do they disprove the claim.
You've made multiple posts criticizing the IDF, so yeah you are defending the guy who died by suggesting the IDF is lying here meaning that what he did was innocent.
"The Israeli army said the man got out of a car and approached a military outpost near a brigade headquarters, despite being warned off by soldiers who shouted and fired into the air. He attempted to attack one of the soldiers before being shot by another soldier,".
If you don't want to come across that way then stop suggesting the IDF is lying or unreliable and thus the individual who died wasn't doing anything wrong.
