That's your opinion, the company may reasonably disagree, they may argue that having one employee 100% telework creates an unworkable precedent or that they need people to be in the office for some other reason. They may also have some other accommodation that works for you, they are not required to give you the reasonable accommodation you want, just a reasonable accommodation that works. Honestly, your position that you can interact with people on the phone, but not in person, is questionable. If the issue is that you might need time to step into a room by yourself to center yourself or something, that can be done in the office. My point is that you need to engage in the ADA interactive process and that your request, is questionable and may not be the reasonable accommodation that is settled on.
That is the only way your boss has to consider that doctor's note. Otherwise he can tell you to come back to work or you're fired. ADA protects people with disabilities that prevent them from doing a job as expected of them through reasonable accommodations.
