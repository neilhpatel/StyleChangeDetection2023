There's no "cost to repair" because they would just give you a new set. No one is paying someone to repair a commodity item.
I get that it is about the principal, but you’ll be barking a pointless tree, they are such a huge company they aren’t gonna give two damns about a single user and their broken headset.
I'm surprised actually that you can't just get a replacement from your vendor, or from Sony, assuming it's still under warranty. Have you tried doing this yet? It's unclear from your post.
Refuse to repair, or refuse to replace? Again there's zero chance a repair is happening here. If you insist on that you will probably get nowhere.
I've contacted them multiple times, they refuse to repair them. I've asked them to tell me what part of the warranty I have violated and how this isn't a material defect and they won't respond to those questions and only tell me that it's not covered. The place I bought them only has a 30 day return policy and they aren't willing to help.
they wont repair or replace them. Its only been about 10 months since I bought them, WHCH710N is the model. They don't fit well anymore, headband is loose.
Anyway there's still a lot that's not clear. You haven't mentioned how long it's been since you bought them, what the model is, or if this crack even interferes with ability to use the headphones.
