All it means is Russia will be killing their own civilians in Kherson when they start shelling the city. But they have already been doing this in Zaporizhzhia for weeks, which is also Russian according to Kremlin.
So Kremlin admits it is unable to defend Russia, then? Admits it has retreated from it's own territory? Or are they hoping we don't put those very very simple pieces together?
American here to say "dang". But what can we do? We (now CarolineGuerinistan?) have been caught in an unbreakable verbal trap, first discovered by the Kremlin.
The other day I got a little drunk and broke into my neighbor's house. I broke a bunch of stuff, killed some randos that were hanging out in the living room, did some other things that probably can't be spoken aloud on reddit, but then some neo-Nazi busted out of the back room and chased me out with a shotgun.
Fucking clowns, just shouting whatever stupid shit they can, figuring that if nothing they say makes sense, nobody will be able to figure out what they're really doing.
Jokes on them though, because I had post-it notes on me and he's got a sweet lamp by the door, and I slapped a "Dibs it's mine!" note on it before running off to watch some porn, drink cheap vodka , and celebrate my win.
