I am confused. Either the money order was cashed or it wasn't. If it wasn't, then you can cancel it and get your money back and pay her again.
They told me if I have signed it and given it away I should get a refund because it takes a refund 14 days just to process. And they take a percentage of the money so I’ll be paying more out of my pocket.
When I ask to speak to someone higher than the leasing lady. She says she’s the highest person there is to talk to. This all just happened yesterday so I can’t go to their office today but I’ll go Monday. Try to speak with someone else.
This isn't a scam. Either they cashed it and you can get that proof or they have not and you can get your money back. Their isn't a scam here. This is a thing that happens with money orders.
Get the documents showing that they are taking x amount in order to refund. Deduct that from the new check and submit it all together.
They told me I shouldn’t refund it. I’m confused on what I should do if somebody is telling me not to do it and it sounds like they’re trying to scam me or do it and still get put out.
Their 10 day notice is kinda assholery but you are also refusing to take the necessary steps on order to pay your rent. Start the process and keep them up to date, in writing, of what is going on.
