Today it was mostly quiet in the city, but the same can’t be said about Kharkiv oblast. Starting around midnight missile launches from Belgorod were reported, and all of the missiles landed somewhere in oblast, we don’t know where exactly. There were a couple more air raid alerts throughout the night, all of which were, thankfully, uneventful. Then just recently, at 8pm, another missile launch from Belgorod happened, with about 4 missiles, all of which went somewhere to Kharkiv oblast again.
So is this the next phase in this war? Russians are digging in like ticks to hold onto their positions. It's gonna be rough on, but not impossible to get them out.
They can dig in all they want, without supply's coming in they're just digging their own grave. Crimea will become an island by new year's end at this rate.
The speed of Russian retreat was really impressive. Just 2 days ago they announced that they are leaving Kherson, people were predictably saying how they are probably setting up a trap for us, and that it will probably take weeks for them to leave, if they were even going to leave at all. And now, just 2 days later, they are already gone, faster than anyone predicted too. I guess their retreat from Kharkiv oblast was just a training exercise, so that they can improve their skills before Kherson retreat.
