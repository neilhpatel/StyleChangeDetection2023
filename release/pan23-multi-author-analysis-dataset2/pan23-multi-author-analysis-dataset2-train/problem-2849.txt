What truly wild to me is that if Trump had shown a shred of basic human decency during the pandemic he’d likely still be in office. Literally all he had to do was not be a complete maniac in those press briefs and he would have won re-election hands down. The fact that he couldn’t shows how unfit for office he really is, but it’s crazy looking back how easy his path to a second term could have been.
No one could go: “no that would kill a person Mr President and yes UV lights used in rooms and vents when no one is in them. Would fox a lot of problems.” Oh no just sat there and stared in horror whole stupid people killed themselves.
I used to watch all of these briefings back when they were on. They were kind of boring, so one day I decided to take a nap instead of watching it. There's no way I'm going to miss anything, right?
I remember listening to it live on the radio - as soon as I heard the doctor talking about bleach…and Trump started talking - I felt it coming. When he suggested injecting bleach I cackled in the car.
I felt it coming but still couldn’t believe he actually said it. And then people tried to play it off like “he didn’t mean that.” Yes, yes he meant that.
