Why are they doing this? Well, for two reasons. The first is because our mainstream media is largely funded/owned by the corporate left. They have a narrative in place that they push. Per-Elon, twitter was an outlet they could use. But Elon is coming in and challenging them on that. And anyone who opposes "the narrative" is the enemy.
It's funny cuz he didn't cause it. But he will have to pay for it. He fired everyone that patched it and he hasn't changed the chinese component that the whistleblower was warning about. And now twitter is handled mainly by foreign visa holders who are being forced to work there.
Twitter is basically worse than tiktok and being run by a madman who also controls the US space program. lol. The US shitshow is god damn crazy this season.
A lot worse. Near monthly data breaches, accounts accessed and used to cause international crises before anyone even knows the account is compromised....etc. Twitter was pretty bad at security, but now, without even that amount of effort put in, you're looking at just about everyone having their identity exposed, and possibly stolen.
