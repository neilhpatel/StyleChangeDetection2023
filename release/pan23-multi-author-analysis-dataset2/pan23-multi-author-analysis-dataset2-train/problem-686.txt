Change in Iran will require the blood of its leaders to be spilled, but idk how willing the military leadership, or other keys to power would be to support such an action.
I’m not super familiar with Iranian politics and culture, but if they’re being sentenced to death for protesting, why are they not asking for foreign arms and just straight up revolting?
You need the military on your side for a revolt. It’s REALLLLLY hard to win a revolution if the army stays loyal to the government. Remember that modern armies have tanks/helicopters/jets/artillery/APCs/ and most of all trained soldiers who know how to fight.
Even if a nations military isn’t the most up to date, it’s almost impossible to revolt without the military either A.) joining the revolt (in which case they already have a successor in mind) or B.) doing nothing to stop a revolt (in which case they probably have someone in mind).
From my understanding Iran’s government has been selecting very loyal military leaders so that neither A nor B above happens.
Unless the foreign arms involve modern multi billion dollar equipment and training (which should be obvious won’t happen in a grassroots revolt) it’s unlikely an armed insurrection will do much.
Oh yeah, you just need at least 2 million civilians willing to fight against 2 million soldiers with tanks, fighters, missiles, artillery, etc.. and then you need 2 millions rifles and 2000 millions bullets.
