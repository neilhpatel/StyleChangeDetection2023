I wonder what the USs playbook is here. Either there is legit Intel of this happening, and they're throwing it out in the open as a passive aggressive message to China to not go through with it. Or there is currently no actual evidence of such intentions, but it intentionally creates the narrative that there is, pressuring China to prevent even entertaining the idea of arming Russia.
Or China wants concessions from the US or the EU (like better tariffs) and therefore threatens with helping the Russian war effort. Given the manufacturing capabilities of China, it could be a very serious threat. From ammo to thermal cameras or drones, China could really outsupply western countries if it wants to. Not being a democracy helps with kind of decisions...
United States of America citizens need to change their Walmart mentality. I will spend an hour finding the product they want. Give them expert advice on installation. Then then come back and want the lowest price they found online or will purchase there. Price is their only concern.
