While the sentiment of the comment is reasonable, its not accurate, Zionists and world powers tried to promote a Jewish state decades before the UN vote, it just gained more urgency post ww2 (the British themselves tried very hard to prevent Jews from immigrating to England), Israel and many many other states were 'founded' around that time and the next 20 years, most of them simply gaining independence from their imperialistic owners or new rulers, the UN grew up to 190+ countries/territories in a short span of time (not everyone was a member at the UN even as states early on).
Unstable nations generally arise from a situation where the government's legitimacy given to it by its force is threatened by another force within or outside of the country. That could be an armed rebellion (revolution) or a challenging alternate "government" (like the Taliban in Afghanistan) or it could be an invading country (like Russia in Ukraine). In all those cases a potentially stronger force is threatening the monopoly on power held by the government.
