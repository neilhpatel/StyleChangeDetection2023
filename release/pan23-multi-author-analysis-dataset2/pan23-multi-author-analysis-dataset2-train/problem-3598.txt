A septic tank should be pumped every few years, so it sounds like you may be due again. Also though, it doesn’t really sound normal that it’s failing so badly when it rains that its destroying dirt roads. Before this neighbor takes things up a notch with a lawsuit, you should have a septic engineer come and check out the tank BEFORE having it pumped; the issue may be that you just need a new system.
You’re definitely right, the road definitely is deteriorating on its own from the weather. But, from the way OP described it, I interpreted it as unfiltered overflow running over the road, not the leech field drainage. Having unfiltered feces running down a road would DEFINITELY cause damage that shouldn’t be happening compared to normal rain/drainage runoff.
See, and I was interpreting it as septic field drainage making the whole area soggy -- which will happen in a properly functioning septic system as well as a nonfunctional one. I think OP probably should clarify what's going on, if possible, because I suspect the two problems might have different legal solutions - properly functioning equipment causing damage vs. malfunctioning/poorly maintained equipment causing damage would seem to be different (though IANAL, just someone who lived with a septic system for many years).
