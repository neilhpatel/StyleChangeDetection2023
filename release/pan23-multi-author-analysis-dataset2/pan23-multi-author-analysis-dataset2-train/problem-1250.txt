I have trouble walking and become easily tired because of treatment I'm receiving. I can stand and walk but not for long, my legs hurt and physical effort can be exhausting. It's not every day, there are good days and bad days.
If your employer wants you to drive a nicer car...well maybe they want to consider leasing one for you? As it is, your car in the lot is probably remarkable more to ownership/management than, say, customers who might stop by (who don't give a shit). FWIW, my firm has 10 lawyers, and we drive everything from brand new 8-series BMWs to beater GMC Yukons from the late 90s. Nobody gives a shit what anyone else drives - get to work and do your job well. I suspect nearly every other employer on earth feels the same way (though I grant a new car dealership might have some issues with old, busted up, off-brand cars in the customer lot).
It would be legal to fire you for driving a non-luxury car, but your employer may be wary of doing so immediately after you request a parking-related accommodation.
You do not need to be permanently disabled, nor qualify for a handicapped placard, to be entitled to . Ask your HR department (if you have one) about their preferred process for requesting reasonable accommodation. (Strictly speaking, there is no single process you must follow, but it will be much easier if you follow the process your employer is used to.).
