Who was supervising when your ex threw your kid across the room? Is your lawyer aware that you've denied him visitation since your son told you what happened, communicated through his girlfriend and want the visits transferred to a center?
Then file an emergency custody petition (again, may have a different name in your area) or a domestic violence restraining order on behalf of your children (not on your behalf since you were not abused in this situation).
Call the police immediately and report the child abuse. If they do not report it to your version of Child Protective Services (may be called something else in your area), then separately report to them as well.
Have you reported this to CPS? Is the court aware that he physically abused your child? You might want to find another lawyer, they don't sound like they're doing a good job of protecting the children.
Yes I have told my lawyer. They did an emergency petition to change custody but the judge told us to try to work it out in conciliation that was already scheduled, which of course didnt work.
