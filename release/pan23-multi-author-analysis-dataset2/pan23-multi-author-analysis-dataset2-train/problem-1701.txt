What you really have here is an r/relationships issue. You as the mother have the right to choose an abortion. You also cannot adopt out the baby without the father's consent. Obviously, no matter what choice you make here (even choosing to keep the baby as your husband wishes), it sounds like it's going to have a serious impact on your marriage. I'd suggest talking to a counselor if possible and thinking through what you want.
You could potentially divorce him and abandon full custody of the eventual child to him, though you would of course be expected to pay child support.
While there are complex circumstances in which it's possible to adopt a child without the father's consent, usually because you don't know who or where the father is, even in those circumstances you have to give the father a technical chance to intercede. In a situation where the father is known and right there, no, you cannot simply overrule his consent.
You can’t just give your baby up for adoption without the consent of the father. If you don’t want to be pregnant I would suggest an abortion, if you’re still early enough.
