Narcan isn’t epinephrine or Benadryl. It has nothing to do with allergies. Narcan is given to reverse the effect of opioids. Your respirations might have dipped too low, so they counteracted it with Narcan. It’s standard treatment. Would you prefer they let you become hypoxic and die?
Unless you have permanent injuries related to this, you aren't going to be able to turn this into a massive financial win.
What fiscal damages do you have? Because most likely the hospital will credit the charges related to the drug you're allergic to and the treatment (narcan in this case) to correct the error.
Do you know that you were given a drug you’re allergic to, and that’s why you were given the Narcan? Because Narcan can be given for a number of reasons.
You missed work due to surgery not due to an opioid you were given because they reversed the medication with Narcan. They are humans that made an error so they reversed that mistake, and you are fine now.
I mean, accidents happen in the medical world unfortunately. They reversed the medication, and you didn’t say you have had any other adverse effects so you aren’t likely to get anything out of pursuing this. Medication errors happen. In the absence of anything permanent happening to you as a result, you won’t get very far with this.
