Get your parents involved. Even leaving aside the apparent bigotry, "someone spit in my kids food and you did nothing" is going to look really bad if they have to escalate to the school board.
Spitting in her food might potentially be mischief/vandalism, and there's clear motivation on the basis of a protected class, so in most jurisdictions, yes, this could be construed as a hate crime.
It'd never see prosecution, though. Police and prosecutors have better things to do than to put kids in jail over being shitty to one another. Talking to the school - and getting your parents to push on the school with you - is the right answer in a situation like this: most places require that schools provide a learning environment free from bullying and discrimination.
