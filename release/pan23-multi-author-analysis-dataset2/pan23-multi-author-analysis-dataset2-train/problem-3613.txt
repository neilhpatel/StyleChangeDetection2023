Keep all records from your cameras and text messages. Call police non-emergency line for any incident of problematic behaviour, like shouting sprees or profanities directed at your children. Do it every time this happens, and document the events yourself to corroborate with any police reports. A Ring-style doorbell is also helpful for additional videotaping.
And quite possibly needs help she isn't getting and poses a threat to herself and others. It's good to be empathetic but prioritize your kids and your home -- she can get help from family or doctors once she's been taken away by the folks in white coats.
You might also put in a report with Adult Protective Services if it seems like she's having a mental health crisis. It's obviously not normal to shriek profanity in the middle of the night.
My advice for these kinds of situations is to go on the offensive. You've got kids in the house, you paid good money for your quiet enjoyment, and this person (and the people that should be reigning them is) is a nuisance and even a potential danger.
When making these reports, be calm and concise, stick to observable facts, don't exaggerate, and don't hypothesize except very carefully. "She's in her nightgown in 20 degree weather at 2 am yelling at the fence or my house -- it's not clear which -- about children and I don't know what else, something about losing? It's cold out and she's been at it for twenty minutes, I don't know if she's having some kind of mental breakdown but my kids are freaking out.".
1. Get as many of your neighbors in on the approach as possible. It's to their benefit to do so and the more people involved, the more you lot will be taken seriously and credibly (even three or four neighbors complaining about the one shifts it from "these two people just hate each other" to "this one person is a problem).
