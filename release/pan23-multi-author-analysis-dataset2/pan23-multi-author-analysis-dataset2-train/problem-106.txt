Get your city code enforcement involved. They're not going to mess around with a contractor who doesn't do things up to code.
They'll probably force them to get a permit, in my city, any "permanent" structure that is added to a property requires the right permitting.
Typically having to do things by code (like not sloping the driveway for runoff into your yard) is more expensive and permitting itself is expensive and time consuming.
Just make it more difficult and expensive. I'm NAL. But I have had to deal with city code enforcement and understand a bit how they operate.
If your $5k concrete pad basketball court now will require another $15k in drainage, sloping, and retainer wall... that may put an axe to that dream of having a half court.
I deal/dealt/have a lot of acquaintances and former clients who are house flippers, realtors, and/or land developers.
It really depends, and OP should read up on local ordinance. Every community I've lived in since I've been a homeowner (5 cities in 2 different states) have had ordinances governing where your front yard ends and where your back yard starts, what percentage of your front yard can be paved, and how close to the property line you can pave - all of which seem relevant to OP, but it's obviously highly community-specific.
