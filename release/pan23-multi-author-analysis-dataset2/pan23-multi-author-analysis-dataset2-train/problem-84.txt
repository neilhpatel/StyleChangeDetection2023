(2) Driveways. In front of a public or private driveway, except that it shall be permissible for the owner, lessor or lessee of the lot accessed by a private driveway to park a passenger vehicle registered to him/her at that address in front of such driveway, provided that such lot does not contain more than two dwelling units and further provided that such parking does not violate any other provision of the Vehicle and Traffic Law or local law or rule concerning the parking, stopping or standing of motor vehicles. The prohibition herein shall not apply to driveways that have been rendered unusable due to the presence of a building or other fixed obstruction and, therefore, are not being used as defined in §4-01(b) of these rules.
Plead not guilty, but make sure you send in a copy of your car registration and your mortgage/property deed also. Make sure they have the same name and address. Good luck.
You don't have a public sidewalk that cuts across your driveway, do you? I know some municipalities require home owners to keep a path between where they start and stop clear, even if the "path" is through your driveway.
There may be other “vehicle, traffic, or local laws that apply. The ticket should have a reference to what the infraction was. Research the language of the infraction designated on the ticket.
