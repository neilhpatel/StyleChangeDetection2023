It says if I don't get it after 6 weeks, then I can cancel with no penalty. It doesn't specify if this is 6 weeks after date of purchase or 6 weeks after their stated delivery. The sales associate told me it would be here in October during the whole transaction process. I don't have that in writing though. The receipt just says "tentative delivery".
I called and they told me that the rest of the sectional will be here by December 6. I have the conversation recorded which is legal in VA.
I guess my only option now is to wait for December 6 and check the status? I naively and immaturely made this purchase without looking up reviews of the company online.
What does their policy say about late delivery? Was this a custom order?? Especially with part of the furniture delivered, it is highly unlikely you are getting a full refund.
Nothing has been delivered to me yet. They have it in their warehouse. Delivery will take place when all the items have been received at their warehouse.
What would be the grounds for a charge back? They can likely point to their terms & conditions to justify a short-term delay. You, on the other hand, already took delivery on part of the order. I dont see your bank coming down on your side.
