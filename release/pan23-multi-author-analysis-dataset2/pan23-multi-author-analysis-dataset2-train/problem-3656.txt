Seeing as the survival relies on living hosts with living cells it would make sense to become less deadly to continue to propagate. If it got more deadly populations would continue to get decimated until it couldn't spread but that's more of an apocalyptic interpretation and my 2 cents. Not a scientist in that sense.
There's statistically a chunk of people who won't get it but would have without that slowed spread. Number of people infected in the end is inversely proportional to R_t.
Also, we would be sooooo far behind in this without the vaccines. Let's not forget Italy and China and India had overflowing hospitals with people dying on the floor. It wouldn't be back anywhere near business as usual with overflowing hospitals, older loved ones dropping like flies, some young people in extended circles dying, etc.
But I also accept that at this point, people can make their decisions and if you end up very sick, well don’t say I didn’t warn you.
I'm not disagreeing with you. In fact when Delta was the dominate strain at the time the vaccines became available, vaccinations was the main reason we were able to start opening up after the lockdowns. Unfortunate, by early 2022, the original vaccines were no longer as effective (but still helped) with Omicron. But fortunately, Omicron wasn't as deadly or severe as Delta.
slowed it down enough to mutate to a less dangerous strain. Which is awesome in my book. It will be decades before we actually figured out what happened because everyone's opinion is rife with politics and emotion.
