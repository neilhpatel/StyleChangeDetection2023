If she was taken off, that accident should have been taken off as well since she was the driver. Are you sure that the increase in premium is related to that accident?
If there is a surcharge for an accident, the date of loss should be noted on the policy. If it isn’t clear, call your broker.
Her, her car, her other car, and her baby daddy are definitely off. I ended up switching insurance companies because i was having issues getting them off my plan.
Otherwise, if they did all that and she is not factored in, then the premium is based on your record, age, area, Majority of the companies also take credit score into consideration as well. The better the score, the better the rate. They don’t get a credit score per se. they will put you in a certain level. This is usually the opposite. The lower the level, the better the premium.
So you've learned a valuable lesson about saying no to manipulative people, count that as a win. Also, most insurance companies only take into account the last 3-5 years of your driving record so you'll have cheaper rates again in a couple of years at most. It won't be causing issues forever. Just don't get into an accident or get a ticket before then.
I don’t doubt it. Companies usually want evidence that someone is out of house, especially if there are accidents involved. Many people try to avoid paying rates for obvious reasons, like conveniently forgotting they have new young drivers. Your new company shouldn’t be charging for her at all. If the new company factored her in because the accident is on what’s called a Clue report, they shouldn’t have. They can take the charged off because she is no longer in the household. They can dispute it.
