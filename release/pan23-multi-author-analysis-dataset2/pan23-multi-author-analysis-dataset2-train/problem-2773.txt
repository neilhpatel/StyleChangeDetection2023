a restraining order will do nothing, nor would charging them any crime here. just block their numbers and go sit down with a supervisor at your local police department so you don't get bothered with welfare checks.
I have blocked them and talked to the police officers, and they told me they have to follow through with the welfare checks. The reason why I ask about restraining orders is because that's what the deputy officer suggested I look into.
make an appointment with one of the higher ups. if it is a smaller department, the chief. if larger, the highest person you can get. sit down with them. maybe you can work something out if they won't stop -- a quick phone call or text message. a restraining order will do nothing.
My parents don't know my exact information, it's the police who do. I complied with them to ease the situation. I don't have the means to move as I please. I already made a huge move coming here. That's why I'm looking for a more permanent legal solution to end this already...instead of running away from my parents for the rest of my life. Who's to say they won't find me again? They bribe people into giving out my information by making up sob stories about how I'm in danger.
Try going down to the local police station, ask for a supervisor and explain the situation to them. Tell them you are 'no contact' with your family and this is their way of harassing you.
