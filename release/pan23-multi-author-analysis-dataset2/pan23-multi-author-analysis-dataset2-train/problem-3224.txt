ADHD does not prevent people from wearing a mask. You can breathe just fine. Desensitize yourself by wearing it for a short time at home and then increasing the lenh of time, so that when you go back into public, you can wear it for as long as necessary.
Where did this happen and how does your ADHD affect your ability to wear a mask? I also have the condition as well as other things such as a breathing condition but I still had to wear a mask as stubborn as it was. I know in Texas a mask isn’t required by law but businesses still have the right to remove someone if they believe a mask should be required on their property.
Unfortunately, irritation and not wanting to wear a mask isn’t a valid excuse to not wear one if wearing one is enforced. From where I’m from at least, you also had to provide medical proof that you could not wear a mask to be exempt from wearing one and even then it would have to be due to a more serious and credible condition. I have a chronic nose condition where I can’t even breathe in through it but I still had to wear one. I do find it odd that you be required to wear one outside. Especially if others were not wearing any face protection as you claim and they weren’t also removed. I’m not sure what the laws are in Scotland but it doesn’t sound like discrimination at least.
That stinks but I don’t think there are really any legal actions you can take if it’s more of an anxiety issue than a medical one. I don’t think anyone can breathe very efficiently with a mask on. You did somewhat imply face shields were an option. Maybe look into that as an alternative?
