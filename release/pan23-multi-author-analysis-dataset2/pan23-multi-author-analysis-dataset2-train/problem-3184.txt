So you’ve posted an untrue article from a biased outlet with no sources in an attempt to create an equivalence from an incredibly not equivalent situation. You’ve additionally attempted to make it a “both sides” argument, despite the case you posted about not having anything at all to do with Democrats. The person arrested is a conservative, but that has nothing to do with his arrest. The assault upon a 73 year old man is why he was arrested. That’s not exactly a left vs right situation. At least for the time being, conservatives generally oppose assaulting the elderly. Though I wouldn’t be surprised if elder abuse makes their policy platform in 2024.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
