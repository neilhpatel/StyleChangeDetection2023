The article you linked to says it is more like 580,344 sorties over 9 years (see Table 1). It is also worth noting that what are being discussed specifically are cluster bombs: bombs that contain lots of small "bomblets." Each bomb can release 600-700 bomblets. The counts of unexploded munitions are bomblets. . In this video, you have one plane releasing too many bombs for me to count â€” I started counting the large releases from the first plane and got to over 20 of them. Each of them then breaks into what could be hundreds of bomblets.
So I think your overriding assumption, that this is a WWII-style "many planes, many bombs" approach, is entirely wrong. This is likely a "few planes, stupendous number of bombs per plane" situation.
I suspect that the poor failure-to-detonate rate is related to the cluster munition itself. They were crude little mass-produced devices, being scattered (as the footage makes clear) over a large area at high speed.
Cluster bombs! Of course. I'd forgotten how many pieces of ordnance could be involved there. 600-700 bomblets per drop would require only 1 or 2 planes per sortie (and even fewer using the larger sortie count from the linked PDF).
Also worth noting that the B-52 had a much larger payload (70,000 pounds) than the B-17 and even B-29 used during WW2 (4,800 lb and 16,000 lb respectively). So a single sortie during Vietnam would carry between 4 and nearly twenty times as much bomb load as a sortie during WW2. That's without considering that Vietnam-era fighter jets could carry as much ordnance as a WW2 bomber all on their own (the F-4 could carry up to just under 16,000 pounds).
