I do have full coverage insurance. Haven’t been able to contact them as they’re closed on sundays. The issue is i have video but still couldn’t get a license plate number.
A lawyer isn't worth it for property damage. That's a set figure, and you appear to have coverage that will make you whole there.
A lawyer would probably need to be paid hourly because this isn't a personal injury case and there's not a lot of money in it for them. Further, you don't want to have to pay a contingency fee out of money intended fix your car. That said, if you want to pay a lawyer a few hundred bucks an hour to help you in some way, you can totally do that if you want.
You can't press charges, you can report it to the police and see what they will do. A lawyer won't help here.
I get wanting to make him pay, but that's out of your hands. Let your insurance cover this and deal with trying to track him down. They're pretty good at collecting when owed money.
Okay. I talked to the off duty office at my job and he told me pulling cameras from the streets wouldn’t be very likely for public use so i figured getting a lawyer would help in putting on the pressure to bring this person to justice. I won’t move forward with it thank you for your help!
