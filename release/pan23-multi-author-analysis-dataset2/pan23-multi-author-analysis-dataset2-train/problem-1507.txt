That’s not a wrongful arrest. He has child porn in his possession, and committing (possibly felony) statutory rape.
Also I think you’re a troll (and a repeated troll) based on the weird number of posts on here lately from different accounts, all centering around “wrongful arrest” relating to age of consent and age gap relationships. I also notice that you’ve made posts about how the brain doesn’t mature until 25, and the age of consent should be 25, a theme in the previous posts.
I definitely remember multiple posts in here about two brothers, sometimes twins, who were in weird age gap relationships and one of them got arrested for it and it was not fair1! I think this is another troll post too.
Your brother's cop girlfriend has no choice in who she arrests, she is not a "hypocrite" for doing her job. You have literally no idea what you're talking about. Your brother had sex with a teenager too young to consent to sex, he was arrested for it. 18 is when you legally become an adult, your brother passed that mark over a year ago.
The age of consent in California is 18 years old, not 16. Even if it was 16, the 15 year old is still too young to consent to sex. The age difference between two consenting adults is not comparable to an adult - which your 19 year old brother is - having sex with a teenager who is a MINOR and thus legally too young to consent to sex. He also has images which are considered child porn on his devices which is also illegal.
