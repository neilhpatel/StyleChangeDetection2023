No, never do this. If your ID got lost, it could open you up to identity theft. If your friend did something illegal and used your ID while doing so, you could be the one getting in trouble. There is no situation where this would wind up good for you.
They do this a lot and genuinely only use it to get into the club, never ever been anything more. Iâ€™m dropping them off and picking them up so not too worried about losing it as I will be nearby. Still horrid idea?
Oh maybe itâ€™s different here? Youâ€™re able to drive without a license if you can provide it within 24 hours. I rarely have it on me if Iâ€™m just driving 5 min down the street ðŸ˜‚Which would also be the case here, I live like 3 miles away itâ€™s not a huge deal.
