If your landlord doesn't have money to pay the mortgage, unlikely suing him is going to be worth your time, money or effort. From a practical standpoint, even if the bank were to foreclose, it would take time before any of that would impact you as you have rights that would survive the ownership transfer.
If the new owner ratifies your lease1, if the lease is included in the sale, if the lease is a recorded interest, or if the new owner is one of your landlord's creditors, then your lease will continue uninterrupted.
Otherwise, the purchaser may well be able to terminate your tenancy during the foreclosure sale. You'd be owed 90 days' notice or the remainder of your lease, and the new owner will owe you your security deposit.
You may have recourse against your landlord for any resulting damages (plus a $200 administrative penalty) if they do not notify you within 7 days of the notice of seizure. Those damages would including the costs of a short-notice move or the rise in your rent through the remainder of your original lease term, but keep in mind that your landlord will have lost what is likely their most valuable asset, and clearly either does not care to or cannot maintain enough funds to pay their mortgage, so there's a good chance you won't be able to recover much.
Don’t believe you can sue til it happens, the landlord hasn’t broken the lease , neither have you, if that time comes then you have the option to sue. Foreclosure are taken a while during these times, I would guess that the lease will be over by the time the bank has possession of said home, laws vary by state also.
