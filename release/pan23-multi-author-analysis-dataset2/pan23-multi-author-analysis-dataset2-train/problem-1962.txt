Okay thank you for the response. Here is a direct quote: "We were recently made aware that the [redacted company name] insurance carrier requires employees to not only be listedÂ on the [redacted company name] insurance policy, but to have individual coverage which provides additional protection in the case of an accident.".
They should not be able to require it. The company should been paying for commercial auto insurance for any company car they have. Insurance companies will not give you a policy to drive a company car as an employee. I would talk to your coworkers and push back as a group. Maybe talk to an insurance provider to get some more specific information that you can use to fight back.
They are saying the company insurance is requiring supplemental personal insurance. I'm uncomfortable with that as well because I don't want an accident in the company car to effect my personal insurance.
Supplemental personal insurance is for people who frequently rent cars. Not to cover gaps in company insurance. You should probably talk to an insurance professional because something sounds fishy here.
