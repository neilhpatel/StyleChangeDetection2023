You need to call them and politely explain that you did not understand you were signing up for a credit card and you are uninterested in continuing. Ask if you can be refunded anything for services not provided. You won't have much luck if you leave up your negative review. And the aligners are not your property - you paid for the overall treatment inclusive of aligners and a doctor overseeing them. It would be malpractice to just hand them over to you.
Look up the Georgia Board of Dentistry, who regulate dentists in your state. File a complaint with them. This kind of unethical practice is not generally allowed of licensed medical practitioners.
Also, it sounds like you consented to treatment and consented to using Care Credit - it is usually the only payment plan offered in dental offices (and medical, and vet) and is very common. You didn’t realize you were signing up for it at the time? Did you receive any promo paperwork? It’s likely not 26% interest - it’s usually 0% during a promotional period established by the office.
