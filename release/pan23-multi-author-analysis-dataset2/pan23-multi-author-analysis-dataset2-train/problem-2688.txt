I understand what you are trying to say, but consider this: Russia invaded a peaceful nation. Our military supremacy, which is the product of our overall expenditures, is key to beating back a belligerent tyrant with no regard for human life. That's a great example of helping people, right?
Yeah. Not to mention the vast majority of the military-industrial complex's corruption is out in the open. I mean, in the United States it's legal for transnational corporations to give money directly to elected officials for political purposes, as long as everybody files the right paperwork with the FEC. And egregious criminal behaviour often does get prosecuted. I don't see a strong argument that the US government is any softer on corruption at Lockheed or General Dynamics than they are on the big Wall Street banks or any other major industry in the US that's rolling in easy money.
That's more than the total since 2014, the United States has committed more than $21 billion [1] in security assistance to Ukraine - if passed brings to $58.7 Billion.
