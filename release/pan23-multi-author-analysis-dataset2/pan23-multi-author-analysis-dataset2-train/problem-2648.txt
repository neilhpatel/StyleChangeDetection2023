There are occasionally complications when crossing state lines for purposes of sex with a minor. Easiest to wait until she’s 18 for anything physical.
If the age of consent is 16, then you engaging in sexual intercourse with her would not be illegal. Having said that, dating a minor comes with it's own set of logistical problems in that the minor is still controlled by their parents. If they tell you to take a hike (which is a good possibility for someone who lives in another state and they don't likely know) you should respect their wishes or risk whatever consequences that may entail.
That’s not the biggest thing on my mind I don’t want to just have sex but I know if we did end up getting in a relationship it’ll probably happen at some point and idk what kind of trouble I’d get in for that legally...
