Hundreds of thousands of Jews fled Europe during the Holocaust to what was British controlled territory. To escape genocide. 1896-1948. The Muslims saw it as another British/western expansion. When In reality everyone was trying to save an entire race of people. Many Muslim and Islamic factions announced jihad and have been conducting terror attacks to the civilian population ever since. What are the Jews supposed to do? Get exterminated again.
Specifically “Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”.
The issues are that 1) Russia can still create very real problems for Israel in Syria, and 2) Israel even got shot on when they sent a ton of help. A field hospital, humanitarian aid, defensive equipment, Intel, condemning Russia, accepting refugees? And yet there's tons of "Israel has done nothing!" flying around.
Well if you read what I said you can figure it out. Words mean things. “What was British controlled territory” aka, the Arab population didn’t own it. Aka the British did. Aka the British aren’t animals and can save/shelter whoever they want. Aka when people are given the freedom to live and invent and prosper they become really powerful and rich. Aka the Jews are really powerful and rich.
And the land the Jews who came in (even the ones who came well before the Holocaust) built on was land they bought. Often from Arabs. They didn't just come in, say "this is mine now!" and chase off the people living there.
Obviously there was a huge amount of fighting back and forth, but it's still true that the land Jews were living on was land they had purchased.
