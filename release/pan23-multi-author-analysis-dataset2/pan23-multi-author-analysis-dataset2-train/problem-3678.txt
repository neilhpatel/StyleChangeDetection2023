The way it works in my state is they apply to the Tax Commission (state version of the IRS), send in proof or whatever, and receive a card they show retailers who then discount the state portion of the sales tax.(4.5%).
No shit. The 30% sales tax is such an unworkable, unrealistic, politically poisonous own-goal Iâ€™m amazed they even had the gall to propose such a thing in the first place. The only thing worse than the optics of adopting such a thing as your platform would be the catastrophe that would rapidly ensue from actually implementing it.
