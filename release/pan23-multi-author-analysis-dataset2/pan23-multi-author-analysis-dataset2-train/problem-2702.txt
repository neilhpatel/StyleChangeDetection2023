We don’t have separate insurance but the movers do. It’s 60 cents per pound, not item value. It would take quite a while but I suppose that’s an option if the rest of this fails. Thanks for the reminder!
I got the $0.60 per pound thing after they broke my 75” TV. We got $150 back because they were being “nice”.
Did you have insurance through the moving company or through your own insurance? That might be the first step.
You can call the BBB, but be aware the BBB is a private business that has no legal power. They simply act as a mediator in disputes between businesses and consumers and they have no power to enforce anything (including whether or not the business wants to even participate in the process).
Honestly it seems as if the company seems to realize they f'd up with the move in regards to the prior damage and you should give them a call and ask to speak with the owner or manager and discuss your options. Take a lot of photos for evidence, both in terms of showing to the owner or manager or any potential court case you might have.
The movers claim to be insured for up to $1 million per move. On doing some research just now after looking into insurance, we were never provided a waiver for Full (Replacement)Value Protection, so it sounds like we need to get their insurance to step up.
3k is cheap for a move sorry this happened to you normally it’s 60 cent a pound per item that’s broken not unless you purchased other insurance local movers generally don’t care because they are getting paid 15 dollars an hour for moving peoples shit.
