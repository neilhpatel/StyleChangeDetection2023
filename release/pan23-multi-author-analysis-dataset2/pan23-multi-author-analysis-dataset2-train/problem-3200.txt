Kerosene can be dyed red. Red dye doesn't necessarily mean you were buying diesel. The effects you report do suggest that you were being sold diesel.
You could report them to the IRS for not following the dying rules correctly. IIRC, home heating oil is supposed to be dyed blue and other kerosene should be clear. Additionally, usually the state department of agriculture or consumer affairs regulates fuel dispensing, you should look into that for your state.
Jet fuel is widely used in lieu of Kero, and diesel works fine as (expensive) heating oil, but not the other way around (at least not for any lenh of time).
Heating oil is usually red, same as farm diesel. This was red, and labeled H/O on a receipt, so the dying is probably fine. It sounds like it was verbally misrepresented though.
Nope. Far from it actually. They're all derived from oil, but their major differences are in how refined and clean-burning they are. From dirtiest to cleanest: Heating oil-.
Also: Kero is clear. Diesel and Jet A are either clear or a pale yellow (natural color varies a bit).
For the Farm diesel, that's just regular diesel that's dyed to indicate it didn't have road tax paid on it. Heating oil is dyed for the same reasons, hence the IRS suggestion by the other poster.
Makes sense. I kinda guessed it was different levels of refinement, but had heard of people using one fuel as a substitute for another (such as the farm diesel in a regular truck) and figured they were all compatible.
