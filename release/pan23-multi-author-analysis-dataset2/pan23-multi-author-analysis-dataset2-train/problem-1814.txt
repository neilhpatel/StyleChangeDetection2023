Broke in, got notification from alarm company this morning. But they did not send anyone as it was with that first 72 hours of having the alarm system. I canâ€™t get into the house to see how they got in. But the locks have been changed.
Both parties called the police. They claim they have squatters rights. The police gave us a court date. It does not make sense that they are just not trespassing. Should I try to escalate up the chain of command in the Portland police department?
10 to 1 the police will not willingly mediate this issue, which is why they provided a court date. My understanding is police will not make the decision as to who belongs in a house. They leave that for a judge/magistrate, and then will enforce whatever court decision comes from it.
The Portland police dept is understaffed and isn't responding to even emergency calls anymore. Like others have said you need to act quickly.
While you wait for your court date to play out, you can see if your county court has guidelines on their website about how to evict a person. Consult with a landlord/tenant law attorney about how to properly carry out an eviction (even though technically the squatters are not tenants).
You need to escalate, get other homeowners to escalate, call the local neighborhood association for assistance, and get the responsible city council person involved. Nobody in the neighborhood is going to want another red house occupation.
