Like any other problem, the GOP has not offered any solutions, just saw their role clarity as opposition to whatever it was that the Democrats were doing.
This is what the GOP is. Its not a "sense" Trump created in 2022, Trump was the party for like 5-6 years if not still.

What is definitely new though is the level of infighting. GOP was always fairly successful in keeping their ranks closed. All that changed with Trump and the loonies he brought in. Itâ€™s something most people seem to miss completely yet I feel is a very positive development for those opposing republican rule.
The long term conclusion from Watergate that the GOP got wasn't that they policed their own, it's that they hurt the party. A few people sticking their neck out and Trump would have been only a joke candidate in 2016, now he's a cancer.
The lack of self awareness from a guy who used him and protected him the entire way is just astounding.
