Did they approve your relocation? If so is it in writing and what does it say about taking away remote?
Not a lawyer. It does not sound like they are firing you it sounds like you are not willing to adhere to the requirements for work. Absent a contract or a union I don’t believe there is much you can do.
Again not a lawyer but I don’t believe this situation would allow you to quit and get unemployment.
The policy doesn't matter. A lot of states looked the other way during COVID. To be clear, was your employer paying into your new state's UI, state tax, workers comp, etc. and did you file state taxes in that state? But they can decide to change the location required, FMLA doesn't have anything to do with that; not sure what this has to do with FMLA. You don't work while on FMLA. Can you clarify?
But did you pay taxes in that state, did your employer? Without a specific exemption (such as with the airlines) you need to, and they run a great risk not paying into that state's UI system, workers comp, etc. They have to follow all of that state's labor laws with wages, OT, etc. Where are are when you work is what matters, in terms of taxation, labor law, insurance, etc.
