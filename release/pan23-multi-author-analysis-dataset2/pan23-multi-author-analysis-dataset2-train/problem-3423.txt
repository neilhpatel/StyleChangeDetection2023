Why on earth would you even entertain an arrangement without a contract/waiver? They're going to take your money, refuse to move out, and make this a nightmare. Speak to an attorney who handles evictions in your area and go from there. Frankly most cash for keys deals are LITERALLY a cash-for-keys exchange after people are gone.
You offered to pay them to move out on December 31st. That time has come and gone, so your offer can no longer be fulfilled. Assuming you haven't made any other offer since then that they've accepted, you don't owe them anything if they were to move out today.
Make sure any future agreements are specific. "I'll pay you $X to vacate the apartment on this date". Not just "I'll pay you $X when you vacate the apartment.".
Definitely get it in writing. And definitely don't hand the money over until you've inspected the unit and have gotten the keys back.
To avoid any tantrums when they do move out, I was thinking about giving them an old check. Since there is no writing, will I be held accountable if the check is invalid?
Not sure exactly what you mean by an "old check", but if you're intending to pay them with a check which you know is invalid/won't clear, that's fraud.
How are they still legally have possession of if they agreed to move out and handed me back the key? I offered all of this in writing but they refused.
Also it doesn't really help you. Once they realize you didn't pay them, they're just going to come back to the unit, which they still legally have possession of, until you get an eviction order and get the marshalls to act on it.
Because they agreed to vacate the premesis in exchange for a sum of money, which you failed to deliver.
