Could Russia have won this war, if they'd actually tried to fight Ukraine, instead of just murder and brutalize it's civilians?
Russia continue to show the world its incompetence in attacking Ukrainian non-military target while Ukraine manage to send its drone to attack Russian military target deep in Russia.
Russian soldiers are also so weak and cowardly that Ukrainian kindergartners are basically the level that they’re on, although the kids are obviously smarter and are human.
Can you imagine people used to think that the Russian military was capable of anything beyond shitting their pants, filling mass graves, and brutalizing children? So many giant parades and this is the sum total of their pathetic martial tradition.
It’s not even indiscriminate. Russia knows what kind of infrastructure exists in any given civilian population.
They've expended massive amounts of ordnance on non-military targets, which have done nothing to impair Ukraine's ability to fight.
Sure, some of it accidentally hit military targets (blame the warped barrels for that I guess), but by and large...
