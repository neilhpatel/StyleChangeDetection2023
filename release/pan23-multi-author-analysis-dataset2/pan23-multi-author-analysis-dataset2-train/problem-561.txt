It is considered a point of diplomatic etiquette to wear your host nation's national order when you come for a state visit as a sign of goodwill if you are from a friendly country in good diplomatic standing, so you are usually gifted one on arrival so you can do so if you don't already have one. And also, the pomp and pageantry of the whole thing is considered good for greasing the wheels of international relations.
The Americans are sort of an exception to this as presidents are barred from accepting foreign titles, nor do they hand domestic titles out to foreign dignitaries as a routine matter.
Edit: For clarity I’m saying as far as I’m aware, Australia doesn’t hand out titles, awards or medals to visiting dignitaries like Presidents or Prime Ministers.
Because it is the King of Australia, Charles III, as head of state, who gets these honors, not the governor general/prime minister.
And you guys do hand these things out as well, but people just don't make a fuss about it, for example, Shinzo Abe just got an Order of Australia right before he got shot.
