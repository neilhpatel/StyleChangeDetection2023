Yes. But only if the CC&R's have specific language that covers it. Florida HOA's have a legal right to approve or deny potential buyers if they do not meet specific criteria outlined in the association's governing documents. HOA laws in Florida allow HOA's considerable discretion in approving or denying potential buyers.
If your brother is actually served he will need to respond but in the meantime a consult with a local real estate attorney who can review the CC&R's and the situation is probably the only proactive path currently available to him.
Check the CC&Rs to see if they have a restrictive racial covenant left over - some older communities never bothered to remove them. If it has one, bringing that up could be a nice brushback option.
Does the HOA require new owners to apply to the HOA? This is very common. HOA will run background checks and what not. They also make sure that the homeowner is up to date on their dues and that there are no back assessments.
Did a title company handle the closing? If so, they are the ones responsible for getting an estoppel letter from the HOA which would have stated the process for sale/new buyer approval if one was needed.
