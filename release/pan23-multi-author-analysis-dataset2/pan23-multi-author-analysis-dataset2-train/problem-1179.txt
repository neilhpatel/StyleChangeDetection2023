When you noticed it during your walkthrough, did he promise it would be addressed? If you accepted it during the walkthrough and moved in anyways, you donâ€™t really have legal standing to force him to change the living conditions you signed onto.
You mentioned in the post that you noticed it during the move in inspection. The point is to resolve issues like this before signing. I called it a walkthrough, same thing.
I was never given a tour with the landlord. I took a self-guided tour and the noise was never mentioned to me prior to moving in despite complaints from previous tenants about the issue.
A move in inspection is generally done after you sign. You sign, they give you the move in paperwork and you write everything down that you see wrong (broken blinds, paint scuffs, etc) so that you don't get billed for those items on move out.
A) He said he reported it after completing the move-in inspection (which was the earliest he could have possibly reported it as the move-in inspection was self guided).
B) A move-in inspection happens after you have already signed a lease. You can call it whatever you'd like - by the point you're doing it you have long since signed the lease and paid deposits. You literally do it right before moving in.
