Like, even if this war was going well for Russia, this would still be disastrous on the world stage, even for their “allies.”.
What are they even trying to hit in kyiv, if their front is somewhere entirely else? This feels a lot like nazi-germany shooting V2s at london. "Doesn't matter what we hit, as long as we reach their capital".
Like when you've got Death Robots and stealth bombers but Ghandi is threatening you for grain by flexing his tanks....
Weird to see the second best army in the world swapping between ww2 and even ww1 warfare, while we develop AA-lasers to shoot drones out of the air.
Yeah right stick man I was using tanks when I steamrolled Montzuma 10 turns ago I'm onto bigger better things now....like refrigerators and nuclear fission!
They’ve agreed and then reneged on their national promises more times than I can count immediately after making said promise. I’m talking about the corridors, peace talks, grain deal, hell, I’ll throw this whole war in as well considering how moronic it is that this is even happening, and that’s just off the top of my head.
