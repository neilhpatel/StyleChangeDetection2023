Who cares about the building costs? People with the money to build large scale see it as an investment so they will charge what they can get away with.
the material maybe marginally higher, but labor is pretty much flat or less. Also its definitely more profitable to build smaller homes aka townhomes. Since they can take up less land.
The build quality 10-20 years ago was much better. Now pretty much a few weeks after move in you have issues.
In like 2015 I bought a new condo 3 bed 2 bath single floor with a 2 car garage and a fraction of the square footage around 1k square foot for 189,999.
Yes, but the homes that are left behind by those wealthy customers in the process get sold or rented to those who were worse off. It is possible that the quality of housing that everyone enjoys increases, even if brand new builds are only used by those who are the most well off.
In 2001 my parents bought a 5 bedroom 3 bath, 3 stall garage with a finished basement. I dont know the square footage for 179,999.
