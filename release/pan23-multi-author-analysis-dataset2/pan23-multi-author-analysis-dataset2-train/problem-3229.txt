They proclaimed to be a Swiss as well, living in France... And are asking for money to be paid, after they sent their "form", to cover the legal fees (which I wrote about here, in a reply down below: ).
Hopefully this means that this person hasn't actually gotten any money from you. I doubt that they have the ability to do anything with your IP so you are probably in good shape if you could find an actual investor to continue your work.
You're talking about enough money (if there's any money at all) that you are well into real lawyer territory. If you plan to develop games that make any money in the future, it's not a bad idea to have a working relationship with a lawyer you trust to help with legal matters. I'm not talking about having a lawyer on retainer or anything, just that you should have someone who knows you and can give you advice when you need it.
And as I only now their name, and a vague location of their current residence, I can't even reach them, nor confirm their identity. My suspicions came after knowing that the, for some reason, 1) they don't seem to care about money, 2) offered a single digit interest rate (opposed to the double I saw, as standard), 3) have had no interest in the project itself, or how/when it will be recouped (they easily agreed to my first guesses/quick calculations), 4) they claim to be of Swiss nationality (which I just read not long ago, is usually a dead giveaway), 5) and found out a few days ago that they used the same message on several other sites, with a different email address (they've numbering in their address). Oh and ofc they want to me to sign a life insurance, in case the project fails. Everyone I spoke about this thinks I'm crazy, for trusting them. To me, this is something too good to be true. And now, they're asking me to get a loan somehow, from somewhere. If I were to ask a third party, they'd be forced to identify themselves regardless my preferences.
