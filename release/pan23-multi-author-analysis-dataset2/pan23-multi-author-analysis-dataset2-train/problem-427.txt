My brother-in-law use to work for Stanely Steemer and got called to do a job at Biden's house years ago back when he was still vice president. He said the secret service presence they had there was no joke. They were searched and had to give their names, info and sign something before they could enter. He said there was a bunch of them and they were everywhere. They were practically on top of them at times and it was annoying cause they were getting in the way. If they had to use the bathroom or anything they had to be escorted even when they were going just to and from their work van. Any room or part of the house they weren't working in had agents guarding it. No one was making a move that wasn't being monitored.
