From one Aussie to another so incredibly sorry for your loss please know even though we don’t know them first hand the whole country is grieving with you….
I went to school and was good mates with one of the slain officers, he was such a good bloke and kind soul, this is bloody heartbreaking and i feel so horrible for his siblings and family he was a triplet and was meant to come home to brisbane for christmas yesterday, i cant believe his life was cut short in such a horrible dispicable and meaningless act of violence by these conspiracy theorist nutjobs, no one deserves to lose their life while just trying to do their job.
Theres been reports that have come out that the shooters online activity showed they were actively posting anti-government conspiracies like the port arthur massacre being a false flag operation to make stronger gun laws, antivax government control conspiracies, aswell as posting a lot of "sovereign citizen" and standing up to "police tyranny" themes the weirdest of his posts claimed Princess Diana was sacrificed in a satanic blood ritual and pretty much every other tinfoil conspiracy these people usually latch onto.
