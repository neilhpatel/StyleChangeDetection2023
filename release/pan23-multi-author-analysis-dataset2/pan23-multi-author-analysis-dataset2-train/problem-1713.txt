Do yourself a favour and give up on the label phobia. "Clearly aimed against" is you assuming PTSD is some kind of magical curse you attack someone with instead of a very common and well-understood medical condition the symptoms and common causes for which are pretty common knowledge. If everyone in your family is diabetic and you eat 5lbs of candy a day, someone saying "dude you're going to end up with diabetes" is a reasonable assumption based on known variables, it's not them "diagnosing" you or "attacking" you with the diabetes curse.
The whole "labels are always bad in every case and no one should ever use them for anything ever" attitude is what nearly got me killed. I didn't want to be "labelled" with an eating disorder because everyone told me labels are terrible things to attack people with, so it went untreated for a year and I almost died. Being labelled is the opposite of a bad thing, it means there's a word for it, it means there are people who understand it and can help you, not that you have a ton of enemies putting a curse on you.
And not knowing if rescuers are in top of you or not. You probably would not know time while you are in there so it would probably feel longer than 9 days.
I remember that video. How fucking terrifying being underwater, completely and utterly pitch black. Not a single source of light anywhere while your body is half submerged. Metallic groans coming from the vessel and echoing around you. I can't even imagine how terrifying it would be. I imagine you start to lose all sense of what is happening.
