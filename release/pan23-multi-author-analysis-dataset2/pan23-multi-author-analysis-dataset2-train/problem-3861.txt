I think I understand from your post that the oncoming car that hit you was driven by a female driver, thus you refer to it as "her" car.
In general, "it was dark and raining hard" does not relieve you of your duty to yield to oncoming traffic, but "the other car was not displaying their headlights" might be a mitigating factor that reduces your contribution to the collision.
"Every motor vehicle driven during the period from 1/2 hour after sunset to 1/2 hour before sunrise, and whenever rain, snow, or fog shall interfere with the proper view of the road so that persons and vehicles on the way are not clearly discernible at a distance of 1000 feet ahead, shall display at least 2 lighted lamps on the front; provided, however, that one suitable lighted lamp on the front of a motorcycle shall be sufficient. The headlamp shall throw sufficient light ahead within the travelled portion of the way to make clearly visible all vehicles, persons, or substantial objects within a distance of 200 feet, except that the headlamps of motorcycles shall be sufficient if they make clearly visible objects within a distance of 150 feet.".
