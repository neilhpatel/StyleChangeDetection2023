Ohio has some interesting legal code covering ‚Äúunborn humans,‚Äù that are currently being tested in court. The code defines an ‚Äúunborn human‚Äù as ‚Äúan individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth.‚Äù Maybe an attorney can use that angle to get DHL to release them.
While this does not list embryos specifically, it DOES say they do not ship live animals (which technically would include an embryo - it's an animal that is alive, even if it's just a few cells. The cells are undergoing respiration which is a strong indicator of life).
It also has a section for "Medical samples" which, although this doesn't really match, seems like a close category. Notably under that header it says "DHL is not liable for spoilage or degradation of goods due to delays". furthermore, the "Perishable items" section similarly says "DHL is not liable for spoilage or degradation of goods due to delays".
NAL and I have zero clue what to do about this, but wanted to let you know that DHL is at the Cincinnati airport, which is actually in Kentucky. So Ohio law/lawyers probably won't matter.
My husband's a lawyer in Louisiana but I guess we should find someone in Ohio. I guess I can call someone in reproductive law and see what they can accomplish in the next two days. If they don't release by then, they close and it's all pointless anyway.
To me, this document makes it clear that DHL provides no guarantee that items will not be damaged by delays (such as being stuck in Cincinnati for 6 days). Ultimately, it sounds like DHL is making it very clear that they are not an appropriate courier for this type of item.
Your next step is to speak to the company that hired DHL, and ask them why they chose to use a service which is explicitly advertised as not appropriate. They may be responsible for any damages you can claim.
Do you think me calling could still help? Should I say something in particular? They're closed for the day and don't open until 11 tomorrow ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
