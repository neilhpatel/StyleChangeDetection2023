The proposed bill would ban all insurance companies that provide gender affirming care anywhere in the nation (not just in Tennessee) from contracting with TennCare (Tennesseeâ€™s Medicaid program).
The goal is to force companies to stop covering gender affirming care anywhere in the nation by cutting them out of the Medicaid market in Tennessee.
The Tennessee market is small enough that the bill is unlikely to have a major impact, but if larger states followed suit the result could be a complete block on insurance coverage for gender affirming care nationwide.
The other possibility is the loss of insurance providers for Medicaid in Tennessee, preventing healthcare access for the state's poorest residents.
