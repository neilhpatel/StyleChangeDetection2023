Jimmy Carter knew how to get an audience to pay attention. In a speech given during the US President’s 1977 visit to Poland, he appeared to express sexual desire for the then-Communist country. Or that’s what his interpreter said, anyway. It turned out Carter had said he wanted to learn about the Polish people’s ‘desires for the future’.
Earning a place in history, his interpreter also turned “I left the United States this morning” into “I left the United States, never to return”; according to Time magazine, even the innocent statement that Carter was happy to be in Poland became the claim that “he was happy to grasp at Poland's private parts”.
don’t know how to feel about Biden doing things with a holocaust-denier head of state whose administration is going through eu sanctions for degrading democracy and leading a virulent campaign against lgbtq people.
‘President Joe Biden’s visit to Poland later this month, to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will be a “historic moment” that will emphasise the strenh of Polish-US relations and of Washinon’s support for Ukraine, says US ambassador Mark Brzezinski.’.
French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all visited Ukraine. I’m not even republican just sick and tired of people backing this guy he doesn’t even know what’s fucking going on.
