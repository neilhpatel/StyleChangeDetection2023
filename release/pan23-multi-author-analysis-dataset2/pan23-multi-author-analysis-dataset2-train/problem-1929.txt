You can make your claim of self defense in court after you stop the person, whoever it might be and whatever their legal status is, from killing you. The old saying, "It is better to be judged by 12 than to be carried by 6" applies.
Your claim of self-defense would not be impacted in any matter by diplomatic immunity of the attacker. Self-defense is self-defense. You have a right in this country to defend yourself against a violent attack from anyone. Now different jurisdictions define the limits of self-defense differently but as a general rule, you are only allowed to use that force that is necessary to repel an attack regardless of the Diplomatic status of the person attacking you.
It does not affect your ability to defend yourself but it may or may not affect a legal defense for you if you do depending on jurisdictional laws, circumstances and details.
