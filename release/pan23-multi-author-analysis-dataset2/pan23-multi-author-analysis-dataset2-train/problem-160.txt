Despite what the other posters have said the insurance company will not pay Bluetooth. They will pay actual cash value or the market value of thr vehicle at the time of loss. They will use data for sold vehicles of the same year make model trim and similar mileage. NADA is generally a little closer to market value than kbb.
What is owed on the vehicle does not change what ifs worth, and you will only get the value of the vehicle.
Location isn't optional since each state has their own laws so I'll answer with what's the most likely correct answer. You've already filed a claim with your insurance. Your coverage has no limit on payout amount for damages to your vehicle like the insurance of someone who hits you. If your car is totaled, you will receive the actual cash value at the time of loss minus your collision deductible which sounds like is $1,000. Your company will them subrogate against the insurance of the person who rear ended you to get your deductible back. What you owe is totally irrelevant and never a consideration by any company, yours or the other party's, in determining your payout. What you paid can play a small roll in determining payout in some situations.
