The idea of giving notice of them arriving is so that you can make arrangements to be home or to put away valuables.
Unfortunately, north Carolina does not require landlords to provide notice, so unless your lease does the landlord has every right to enter and show the property.
You should reach out to your landlord and find time that is mutually agreeable to showing the property. After all the landlord wants to ensure the property is in good shape for prospective buyers And you want to make sure everything is secure.
North Carolina has no actual statutory limit on landlords' ability to enter tenanted property. Allowing random people to enter unsupervised likely intrudes on the implied right you have towards quiet enjoyment, but if they want to enter themselves to show the unit, or if they want to allow their realtor to show the unit, they can do so. Other than that, your lease controls.
It would be a good idea to ask them to at least notify you before their realtor shows up. If someone enters without the landlord or their agent present, you can tell them to leave - you have no idea if they're a potential purchaser or just casing the place.
