I honestly suspect that the buyer has obtained a mortgage on the premise that they will occupy the property, even though they do not intend to do so. It's fraud, if so, and you should have no part in facilitating it.
Yup that's exactly what's going on. Which makes sense considering the property manager kept telling me "he didn't want to know about any of that" when referring to any agreement about them not living here.
Another thing to keep in mind, if you did go along with that, I think there are different rules for evicting someone as the landlord if the tenant is living in a separate property they own vs if the landlord also lives in the same house. I wouldnâ€™t risk it just for that in case he tries to evict you after the sale and has an easier time doing it because you live together.
Sounds fishy, but maybe you can counter offer with some sort of cash for keys deal? They can pay your moving expenses and an additional sum in order to leave.
I was wondering what could happen if I were to agree to their terms and have them added to the lease. I know Im within my rights to refuse and they've made it clear they cannot move forward with the sale unless I agree. The incentive for me is high enough that I'm considering it but I won't do it if there could be some repercussions on my end if I do.
