Not sure I see this anymore of a LGBT battle than a Democrat vs Republican battle. I would agree they lost when Republicans won but that just tends to be a message and issue that appeals to their voters and they are going to lose in Republican districts and states. LGBT canidates just stand to win a whole lot more in Democrat districts and Blue States.
