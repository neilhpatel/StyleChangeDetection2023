1) Title IX coordinator for your school district. They won’t have jurisdiction to fire him because of the no prior report/he didn’t work there when it occurred. However, they may be able to change his work schedule so he isn’t near you.
You might still be able to contact the police yourself and file a complaint. It’ll be your word against his so nothing may come of it, but it may help you feel seen regardless. It looks like NY doesn’t have statute of limitations for many types of crimes, it’s worth talking to an actual lawyer if you want to go this direction.
2) child line for your state, which should get a fast response, because that person is in close proximity to people who could be hurt by them. However, the response will come from.
You have the right to speak to those three without your parents, but if either of your parents might now support you, I would recommend getting them onboard. Also, if they can, I would suggest asking them for a therapist external to the school, who can support you.
