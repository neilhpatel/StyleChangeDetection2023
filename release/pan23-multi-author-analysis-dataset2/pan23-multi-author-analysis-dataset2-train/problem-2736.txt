Indeed. Hence the Mother Teresa reference. She was an awful person who choose to observe the suffering of others while greedily hoarding donations for those suffering people because she believed witnessing their suffering would bring her closer to god.
I don't get the outrage: the woman has sold her own property and donated it to charity. The "poor struggling" daughter is an adult, she can pay her own expenses, yet she feels entitled enough to her mother's money to raise a sh..tstorm with the whole of China watching. If that is how "the poor struggling girl" has always been behaving I understand the decision not to leave her a cent. Admittedly my parents would not do something like that, but in improbable case they did, I would not run to the news reporters.
Yeah I agree, without knowing more details. The title of this article screams entitlement. Your parent's money is not yours. If it was, we wouldn't need wills.
Edit: lol to those downvoting, it's factually correct under US law? Sorry for stating the goddamn facts??
