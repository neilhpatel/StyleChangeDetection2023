So the GQP has nominated an invertebrate, soulless loser and an America hating, sexual assault accomplice and they are making fun of Justin Amash? I mean, don't get me wrong, he's an idiot, but in comparison he is probably a better choice.
Libertarianism is the magic thinking lie Reagan told that government is the problem because rich people hate paying taxes.
Calling yourself a libertarian is equivalent to saying you have the personal ethics and emotional development of a three year old and ignore your responsibilities to the community and country. In my book that is an idiot.
Yup. I have seen plenty of people who are decent to go through a libertarian phase in high school or junior high, but there is no such thing as a remotely decent human being who is libertarian as an adult.
Libertarianism is a spectrum of ideologies, and you cannot assume 1 libertarian is exactly like the other. In fact, I'd say most Americans are libertarian-leaning in the personal freedom senses, such as in legalizing Marijuana and legalizing Same-Sex Marriage, and most Americans are also libertarian-leaning in the economic sense since it should be logical that government should not be fuelling monopolies with corporate welfare while taxing the majority to pay for it all.
Libertarianism is the reason PA's roads look like shit because of the idiots that took that no new taxes pledge and the gas tax did not get raised for over ten years while the infrastructure was falling apart. There is no magic paving fairy.
