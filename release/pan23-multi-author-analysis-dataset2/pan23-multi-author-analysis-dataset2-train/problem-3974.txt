They projected an image of Erdogan with a pride flag behind him onto the Turkish embassy. Now Turkey is calling for an investigation for insulting Erdogan. Who wants to remind them that they don't get to enforce their censorship laws on other countries?
Turkey is allegedly mostly fine with Finland joining NATO, but Finland and Sweden have an agreement that either they both join or neither country does. So Finland's NATO accession is also halted as long as Turkey keeps up its bullshit.
We'll see, I have a feeling the rest of NATO will have something to say to Turkey if they try that. Trying to enforce your own laws on other countries by holding their bids for a defensive pact hostage is pretty frowned upon.
Unfortunately NATO membership has to be unanimous, it's pretty clear, and Turkey is a valuable ally because they have a very strong military (2nd after the U.S. in NATO) and they also control the Bosphorus strait which provides access to the Black Sea.
In any confrontation with Russia, being able to cut them off from the black Sea would be substational.
