First step is to contact the postmaster for your branch. When I had something "delivered" that was never delivered, they were on it and called me back directly when it was resolved.
The tracking number (as shown on the Informed Delivery image) produces a report that it was marked as "Delivered, Front Desk/Reception/Mail Room." I assume that means a receipt was triggered.
Edit: also, be kind to them. You NEED them as an ally and leave room for procedural slowness as a possibility, rather than scumbaggery.
I talked to the postmaster, but he's simply going to "talk to" the postal carrier and "see if they can find it." They claim not to be able to reverse something marked as delivered, so when a carrier lies, there are zero repercussions for him and you are legally deemed to have received the parcel anyway. My video won't really fix anything.
It's not slowness. The carrier actually faked the delivery. I already talked to the PO, and they have the actual GPS scan of where he scanned it.
I have the video of him not attempting to deliver to a resident, but rather delivering only the non-certified mail and walking away.
Obviously you should contact the postal inspector. From Informed Delivery you would know who the sender is. Surely you have a decent idea what this is about?
