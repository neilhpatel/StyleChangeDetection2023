Timing is suspicious, but it could arguably also be her boss being a dick because he's angry about his significant demotion, which would be legal.
The other question is why your wife was the only person left under his supervision. Did the other 40+ people in the department do very different things?
Great question. Seems to have set her up for failure when you give an angry guy one person to supervise.
Yeah, Zach used to fill the position my wife is in, and he is likely the only person in the company that understands what my wife does.
Right, but based on your post, it happens just before she informs them of her pregnancy, which sort of rules it out as being discrimination against her on the basis of pregnancy.
Yeah, that may give him more motive unrelated to your wife's pregnancy, if anything. He may think by getting rid of her, he makes himself invaluable/useful again rather than just a random middle man who is clearly on the company's shit list.
And good point, she’s considered that. He’s the only other person capable of doing her job, and he’s already in trouble with the company.
