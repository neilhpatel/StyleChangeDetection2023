Only accrued PTO has to be paid out in most jurisdictions. They may grant it to you all at once in the beginning, but it's still slowly accrued over time.
If this is front-loaded PTO (PTO that is made available to you, say, at the beginning of the year without you having to work to earn it), then pro-rating the payout of it congruent with the amount of time you worked in the year is appropriate.
You hadn’t earned it yet, so even in a state where you must be paid out for earned leave, you would not be entitled to it all because you were given it to use so you didn’t have to wait until July if you needed to take a vacation in February, but if you had taken it all in February and then quit in March you would actually owe some back because you had used leave not yet earned.
For example, if you're provided 40 hours of PTO at the beginning of the year, and you work 6 months and then quit, then you'd be entitled to payout of only 20 PTO hours -- because you only "earned" or "worked for" half of those hours.
They are not supposed to be able to take away any from you after it has been accrued/earned, more than likely.
