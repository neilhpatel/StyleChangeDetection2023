As Mastercard will assess the fine at a later date, your account balance has been placed on reserve to cover the future debit. In addition, per Mastercard's rules, you and your business have been added to MATCH or another terminated merchant file operated by the card networks. Going forward, we’re unable to provide you with continued service and your account has been closed effective today.
