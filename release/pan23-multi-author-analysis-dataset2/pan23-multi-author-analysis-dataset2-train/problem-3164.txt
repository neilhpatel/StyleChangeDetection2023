You are correct that the idea didn't spring out of nowhere, but 100-200 years ago imperialistic attitudes were the norm in many countries in Europe, even in the United States we had our notion of Manifest Destiny, which isn't far from the same attitude. Most peoples grew out of it, although even today there are some that cling to the notion that their country should dominate or rule their neighbors out of some perception of cultural/ethnic superiority, but these people are typical not in in the majority, and making decisions. I truly despise this this attitude, and was horrified to see it on full display here in the US over the past several decades, in perhaps it's ugliest form during the trump years.
The Czechs, Poles, and Lithuanians (not to mention a few others) know what it is like to be under Russia's oppression. They don't want to ever be back there again.
Really it has nothing to do with the Balkans. Hungary is aligned with Russia because of the wannabe dictator and Serbia because of historic reasons, while sharing imperialistic and genocidal tendencies.
