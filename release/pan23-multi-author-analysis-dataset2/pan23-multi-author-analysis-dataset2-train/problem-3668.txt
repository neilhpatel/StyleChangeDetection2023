I am a 23-year-old woman who flipped a Republican-held district and was elected to the Illinois General Assembly to represent the 51st District. I've been busy setting up our brand-new district office and meeting legislative deadlines as the session takes off in full force. Ask me how I got here, ask me how you can do it too, and ask me about my plans for this legislative session. Ask me anything!
Thanks for the response! I think the Metra is an incredible value-add to the area and efforts to improve its safety and reliability are critically important, especially with Arlinon Park stadium developments looking like a certainty at this point.
The Union Pacific Northwest Metra Line has had a high frequency of pedestrian & vehicle collisions in its history, but itâ€™s been particularly bad this winter. Are you working with Metra and other Metra serviced districts to bring this unacceptable phenomenon to an end?
Yes, I just heard about another accident on the border of our district very recently. Thank you for asking this question. I haven't yet worked towards helping end this phenomenon, but I'll get started.
