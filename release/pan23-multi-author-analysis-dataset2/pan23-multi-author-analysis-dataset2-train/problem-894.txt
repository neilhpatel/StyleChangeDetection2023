Did you do a walkthrough upon move in either taking pictures/video? While landlords aren’t allowed to charge for wear and tear, a lot of pet urine can destroy carpet and especially the pad underneath and wouldn’t be considered wear and tear.
If you have evidence showing the carpet in poor condition upon move in then that might help reduce the cost required since you should only be responsible for the replacement value of the damaged carpet and not new, better carpet.
In most of the US (and I assume Canada but don't know) you don't owe for normal wear and tear on a carpet. Cat pee isn't normal wear and tear, but if you were there for a year, and the carpet had an expected life of 5 years, tha'ts already 20% of the cost you can't be made to pay.
If the carpet was already two years old when you moved in, that would be 60% of the cost you can't be made to pay. If it was 4 years old and you were there for a year, that would be 100% of the cost you're not required to pay. Some carpets have projected life of 7 years, some 10. States usually have limits either by statute or by case law -- so a state that caps it at 5 years is not going to have landlords installing 10-year carpets.
If the carpet was not replaced after the building was repurposed, you might not be liable for any of it.
And if they're going to withhold it from a security deposit, you/your roomate could sue them for improperly withholding the money if you're sure the carpet ws too old or decrepit to be your issue.
If the building was bought from a school residency program, there is a solid good chance that the owner has no idea how old the carpet is, and has no documentation to back it up with. He should not be able to win any money in court if he doesn't have the paperwork -- not to say he won't, just that he shouldn't.
