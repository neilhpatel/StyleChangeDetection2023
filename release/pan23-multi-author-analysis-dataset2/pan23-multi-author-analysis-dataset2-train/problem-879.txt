Your landlord has 30 days to return your deposit and an itemized list of deductions. She can't take the whole thing "just for arguing with you" but she can find and list reasons to deduct more. It would be up to you to argue those deductions in court, if you chose to.
Second, just because you had permission to hang stuff on the wall, doesn't mean you're not responsible for the cost of repair. You were responsible for returning the apartment to its original condition, prior to move in. Except for ordinary wear. Repainting over spackle doesn't count as ordinary wear.
However it could be argued that over 6 years, the apartment was due to be repainted anyway. Since the useful life of most interior paints is 2-10 years. But again, that's something you'd need to challenge in small claims court.
In my judgement (which may not mean much) it's fair to charge you to touch up the paint in spots you damanged but not to charge for repainting the whole apartment. Unless you had holes everywhere.
Thank you for your thoughts- I should have been clearer, our permission was to hang stuff and patch WITHOUT it affecting our deposit. She implied before we moved in that she repaints after a tenant leaves, so as long as we patched holes she would be repainting anyway. But we never got it in writing.
$100 sounds about right. A touch-up would make it good and not be considered normal wear and tear due to the drywall patches/holes.
If they hold your full deposit, sue in small claims court for your deposit back. Some States allow up to triple the amount back.
In every state, if the deposit isn't returned in the manner and time required, you sue in small claims court, no attorney needed. Did you take pictures of the work you did to fix it up?
