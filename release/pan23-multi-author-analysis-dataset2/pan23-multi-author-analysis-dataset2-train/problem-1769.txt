As others have said, family law is extremely complicated, and varies drastically from state to state, etc.
In general, never sign anything to do with family law (or anything that isn't extremely straight forward) without an attorney present. They may be trying to trick you.
(Additionally, if the judge finds out that your ex lied to the court, that could possibly go bad for her).
Right now, legaly speaking, you are the presumed father, and your ex's current partner is the alleged father. He has no parental rights, hence why he wants to legally adopt. And in order to do so, you need to give up your rights.
It’s usually the woman’s husband at the time of child’s birth gets the presumed legal father, which wouldn’t be the case for you.
Here's more/less what I would respond: "I don't have any issue with consenting to the adoption, but I don't want to be on the hook for any sort of back child-support. Give me what you want me to sign, and I'll get my own lawyer to advise me. I think it's fair for you to pay those legal costs, which shouldn't be more than a few hundred dollars.".
(1) You don't want to acknowledge any sort of paternity. You just want to consent to the adoption. Those are different things. Especially, you don't want to do anything that might put you on the hook for back child support. (That's unlikely if there's never been an order that you have to pay child support, but you still want to be sure.).
(2) If you have other children with her, you want to make sure that the consent ONLY applies to the one child.
