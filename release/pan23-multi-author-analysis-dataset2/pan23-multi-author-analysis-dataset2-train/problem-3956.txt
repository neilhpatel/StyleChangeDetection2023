So lemme get this straight. Science told us there was a problem, the main culprit (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), mainly from aerosols and refrigerants), we heavily curbed the use of them, and it worked? Wonder what else this crazy way of thinking could do?
Big freon was never ever the size of big oil. Oil has too many powerful people that stand to lose their fortune if oil suddenly vanishes, and that’s why the anti-science campaign is so aggressive with oil.
Wasn’t there an article this last year darting China isn’t complying and the ozone layer isn’t getting better? This is why people don’t trust scientists.
Yeah we stopped putting the harmfull gases into the atmosphere in this case CFCs.and other freons. Guess what it worked and now it's recovering.
Now it is all climate change because we've identified it as a problem but we aren't doing anything about it. It's not a conspiracy or some made up shit to "scare the populace" it's a serious problem but the solution is to stop releasing greenhouse gases including carbon and sulphur emissions but there's rather a lot of industries and countries even that rely heavily on this for income and are naturally reluctant to loose out on that money. They have the incentive to tell you climate change is bs because they have a financial stake in it but unfortunately peiple li yourself buy the whole climate change is bs.
