This is outrageous. There's no way the American people should be footing the bill for Trump's legal defense. A man who has repeatedly violated the Constitution shouldn't be allowed to use his own money to pay for his own defense? It's like letting the fox guard the henhouse. Trump obviously thinks he's above the law and doesn't care about anyone else. He's only interested in himself and his own interests, and that's wrong. TrumpNotAboveTheLaw.
