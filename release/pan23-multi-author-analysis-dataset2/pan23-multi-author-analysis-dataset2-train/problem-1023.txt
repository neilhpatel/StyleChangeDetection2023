The decision to prosecute is entirely up to the DA's office. They, in turn, are responsible to your elected representatives, who are responsible to you. You can try asking your reps to intervene, if you like.
Be prepared for this kind of petty theft not to be prosecuted, as the systems that address it already did their jobs. You are not, at this point, the victim of anything - you got your money back and your credit has not been impacted. The credit card company and the retailers involved have losses, but you're whole.
Contact your credit card company and see if they have fraud investigators. Some (such as American Express) are very proactive about fraud and may be able to do something with your info. If they can identify other thefts linked to these folks it may be enough money for police to make it a more serious crime.
Also just because you found evidence doesn't mean they can use it in court. It sounds like you did quite a bit of legwork, but it's not like they can just take what you have and get arrest warrants. They have to do everything through proper channels and with proper procedure.
And please call up your credit card company. Credit cards have 100% fraud protection provided it is reported within the amount of time specified in the credit card agreement. You should be out nothing assuming you reported it on time. Debit cards are much more difficult to get the money back from fraudulent debits..
