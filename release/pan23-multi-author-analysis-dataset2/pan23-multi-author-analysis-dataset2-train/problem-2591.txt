I think it’s pretty important to be culturally aware, and not just marinate in one’s bubble in a small corner of the world. I think that more news sources should report things like this and spend less time bickering back and forth.
Since media is vastly ignoring us, all we can count on are users on social media platforms continuing to spread the news. 💗.
Hi! I’m Persian. The more you post, comment, like, and engage with posts like these, the more attention our cause gains.
Honestly, BBC WS is one of the only news radio stations I can still stand listening to any more. They’re professional and present the facts, instead of ranting and raving; they cover news from all over the world, which has made me more aware of geopolitics and events outside my country. That’s how I learned about the recent end of the Tigray War, about the Sri Lanka President fleeing the country earlier this year, the unrest in South Africa, etc.
The regime is mutilating and executing protestors and even civilians (even children) who aren’t protesting. Protests aren’t backing down, though. The people will win, especially with continued posting so the people can have support, and the lies of the regime can be shut down. 💗.
