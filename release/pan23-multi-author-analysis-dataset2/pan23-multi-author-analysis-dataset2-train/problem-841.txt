It's not about if they serve food and drinks, it's about if they customarily receive tips. Bathroom attendants do customarily receive tips, so it stands to reason they could be included. If by "polishers" you mean shoe polishers, they also generally receive tips. If you mean glass polishers, that might fall under bussers, which would also be valid. if you mean floor polishers, and that's all they do, then that's a janitor, and probably wouldn't be valid.
Also, worth noting, if it is determined that this was an illegal tip pool, then not only are you owed the tips that you would have received, the restaurant also owes you full minimum wage for the hours worked (i.e., if you were receiving the tipped minimum of $2.13/hr instead of the regular minimum of $7.25, then they owe you an extra $5.12 for every hour worked.).
Then that's not legal. Even assuming Florida law theoretically allowed it, federal law which trumps state law does not. There are now situations where an employer which does not claim a tip credit can include positions which are not normally tipped in the tip pool, but that wouldn't seem to apply here. Bad news is that Florida has no state level enforcement of this sort of thing, so you have to go to the Federal Department of Labor.
I want to clarify: could it be possible that the bathroom attendant is being considered an employee who customarily and regularly receives tips?
