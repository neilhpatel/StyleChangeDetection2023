It all depends and is almost never a sign of the merits or lack thereof of your case. Usually the high, shock the conscious, retainer is to scare away a bad client (in our experience).
Honestly, it all depends. I primarily do divorce but, procedurally, it checks a lot of the same boxes.
If I know we are on the heels of needing to do discovery, the retainer goes up a bit. If there are hearings or other things coming up in 60 days, it's a bit higher. If we take over for another attorney, we charge a bit more up front to get up to speed.
If things seem "normal" given the issues, and there is nothing pressing on the calendar, I can take more time to get up to speed and research and 5k sounds reasonable.
A much more important thing to watch is how high the bill gets when things get hot and heavy - this is where attorneys show how ethical they can be. Ex: I had a case wherein fees were requested, and in their billing statements I saw multiple days where opposing counsel billed their client in excess of 24 hours in one day (26, 26, 28, 33 hours) over the course of a week. It is, of course, allowed to bill multiple professionals on one case at a time, but this person was being billed egregious amounts of time and was horribly losing claims being made - doesn't take a genius to see fee churning.
Ive also seen it where firms will hire underlings and bill them out at 200/hr or so and they are really just running in circles not doing much. You go there and interview with one attorney who impresses you then he dumps you off on a bunch of kids out of law skool.
Then another time, I hired this lady with great credentials. She was the county rep for that particular field of law. And a day or two after I retained her she retired and left me to her dipshit associates. Of course the contract I signed said I agreed for her to assign the case to associates so I was stuck with them. I did OK but they definitely weren't up to snuff.
