Reselling the guide is, in and of itself, legal, so long as you're selling the copy you bought and aren't making additional copies in the process.
This poses possible a trademark issue, even if Jane has not formally registered the mark. You'll want to get Jane's permission, and some assurance that her distributor is fine with her giving you that permission, before you proceed.
If we were to include additional documentation, such as a sheet that references where the screws are used, which we would make, would this be considered a derivative work and be an infringement even if we include the unopened guide as well?
A derivative work is a work based on or derived from one or more already existing works. Common derivative works include translations, musical arrangements, motion picture versions of literary material or plays, art reproductions, abridgments, and condensations of preexisting works. Another common type of derivative work is a “new edition” of a preexisting work in which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work.
