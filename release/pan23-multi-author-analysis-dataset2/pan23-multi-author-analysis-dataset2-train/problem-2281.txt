10 or so years later the price and condition of the Turnpike in PA basically makes it worthless/unusable. The cost is 20x what it was 10 years ago when they took over. Big sections are always under construction. Which often times make it slower to use then a normal road. If you happen to need to use a section under construction not only is it slower, they actually want you to pay full price to use it. They completely eliminated the use of cash, which in turn eliminated 1000's of jobs. It also makes it a complete pain in the ass to use if you don't need an easy pass account most of the time normally, since they bill you though the mail. If you forget to pay the bill that shows up weeks later or doesn't at all it can cause you all kinds of issues.

Town/area I know of not far from me switched from Chester Water Authority (which serves not just the very impoverished Chester, PA but also the incredibly wealthy Chester County, PA) to Aqua... Almost immediately residents reported triple digit percentage increases in water bills.
