Yes, my boss changed my schedule and told me the only way to have my original schedule was to have my light duty lifted so I went to the doctor to have it removed. I worked one day and realized it was too soon to get back to full duty so I went back to the doctor and got back on light duty.
Are you able to perform the fundamental duties of your job with the Lightduty restrictions? Is there a reason you employer is giving for not allowing them? Are they basically saying you need to come back full duty or take more leave?
Talk to your employer first. What do they say, did they forget, was there a communication breakdown? Then talk to your union and your workers comp attorney.
I'm currently performing my job to company standards but my shifts are limited to 8 hours while I normally works 10. I work on a production line so to get around this they've been having me on the line for 8 hours and for the last 2 they'll have me do housekeeping or providing support for other employees. Somedays they've kept me for 12 hours.
