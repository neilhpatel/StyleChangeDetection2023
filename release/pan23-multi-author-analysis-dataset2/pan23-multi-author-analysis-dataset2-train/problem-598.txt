The state you live in might matter; please don't just demur and say "it snows here" or "the written contract breach statute of limitation is six years here".
Genuine mistakes happen in the auto sales business. So do underhanded misrepresentations. Both are common when there's a model of the vehicle where the all-wheel-drive feature is not apparent from the trim markings or model name.
What document is the "main selling sheet" ? I assume it's a purchase and sale agreement, but want to be sure that you're not describing a "Buyer's Guide" window sticker or an advertisement flyer.
What is the difference in value between the AWD version of the vehicle and a 2-WD version ? Ideally, post the actual make and model of vehicle.
If you sued them for an unlawful business practice (essentially "false advertising") the damages you could claim are roughly the difference in value between an 2-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive vehicle of the same make/model/year. The car also has almost another year of depreciation on it. The difference between two variants of a 2005 CRV is going to be bigger than the difference between two variants of a 2020 Model X.
If that's anywhere close to the value they are offering to settle the dispute, it's likely better to agree to a settlement instead of filing a lawsuit.
Lots of states regulate car dealerships through their Department of Motor Vehicles, California and New York for example. You may want to find out who regulates car dealers in your state and file a complaint with them. They could help clarify the law, your rights, and possibly mediate an outcome.
We would like to trade for the same amount. We picked another car of similar specs and awd.They told us said car would be even more money and that's all they could do.
