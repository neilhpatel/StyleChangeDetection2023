Your parents don't have to pay for it. Being an adult dependent doesn't obligate your parents to anything. If you're disabled then you need to start applying for disability benefits.
This is more personal than legal advice but your university will probably have councilors that can help, or your local county government might have social workers that can assist with finding the proper paperwork and helping you complete it. There is also an organization called The National Eating Disorder Association that has a helpline and contact page, it’s a .org so hopefully the mods don’t delete it:
Hi the services from my local government wouldn't be free and therefore aren't an option unless I convinced my parents to pay. I've tried multiple helplines and they couldn't provide answers either I would like to know if there is or isn't a law that says I'm an adult dependent and defines neglect for adult dependents.
Dependent for tax purposes isn't the same as you've been judged to not be able to take care of yourself and a guardian has been appointed. They have no requirement to take care of you.
I currently need more than counseling services. My college (community college) specifies that they don't handle crisis situations and my full situation qualifies as a crisis situation.
If your community college is affiliated with a state school, you may qualify for services at that school. If your whole situation qualifies a crisis and some groups won’t take on crisis situations, perhaps you can seek a partial remedy that they are willing to take on. Most government programs will have an income threshold where if you are low income or a student you can qualify for low-cost/no-cost treatment. I understand if qualifying for low-income status is complicated by your parents claiming you as dependent but they may qualify based on their income anyway.
