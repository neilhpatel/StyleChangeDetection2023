I'm aware of the fact I don't own the car. But in both BMW's analogy and the actual situation, I am the insurance policy holder, not BMW, not my friend (which is why that analogy is stupid). So I have a contract with the insurance company, while BMW has no relationship with the insurance company. Obviously I owe BMW the payoff amount, but BMW has inserted itself into a contractual relationship between the insurance company and I. What exactly would form the basis for their right to do that?
I think that terminology is what help fuel this kind of confusion. He is not financing a purchase through bmw. Hes renting. OP even uses the word "Payoff" not purchase price.
their basis is that they own the car and are entitled to full pay off from the insurance company. You would need to go over your lease agreement and see what it says about what happens in this situation. If you feel they are wrong, obvious you can sue them, but Ive seen this situation a lot, and it's what they do.
The only thing BMW FS required to lease the car was proof I was carrying full coverage insurance on the car at all times, and it was sufficient for me to show my insurance card.
