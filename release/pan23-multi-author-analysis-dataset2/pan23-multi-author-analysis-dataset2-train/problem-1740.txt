Russia seems to think they are doing God's work. They claim to be Christians. I thot 1 of the 10 commandments was something about not killing. Maybe the Pope should tell the Russians they are NOT doing God's work, they are the furthest thing from being good Christians, and that they will all burn for all eternity for their transgressions. Maybe that might make them think a wee bit harder about what they're doing !
He's more well informed than you and I. The Vatican is a major player in world affairs and they occupy a very unique position in that they're not really regarded as adversarial by any state. This allows them to play mediatory roles in conflict situations, so he's probably not talking out his ass. His ambassadors will have had meetings with numerous parties and apprised him of what's going in. Or maybe you don't like him calling it a 'world war'?
Most of the 'world war' scenarios people are familiar with end in widespread nuclear armageddon and casualties in the billions. There are reasons not to like him calling it a 'world war'.
Well, many countries are involved. But yeah, the fighting is just between two countries. Any non-ukranians and non-Russians fighting are volunteers or mercenaries. It's bad but absolutely not a world war.
