That's your call. But not sure what your defense would be to the ticket. A lawyer may have an easier time gaining access to dashcam footage vs someone unfamiliar with how legal matters work.
And if mistake of fact isn't a viable defense then what would be, or is it more, me just being screwed?
I guess you could call it an assumption, but I could not see road markings clearly due to the weather and time of day. I guess that still wouldn't qualify in your opinion?
"I couldn't see the road so I just assumed what it looked like based on another road in another part of the country" is not a good defense.
It's possible that a judge might find this a mistake of fact but you really want a traffic attorney for help if you want to fight this. You don't want to go in spouting legal terms like you know what they are and how they apply when you don't.
I will say I'm not intending for my defense to be "I couldn't see the road so I just assumed what it looked like based on another road in another part of the country", but if that is what people are getting out of it, then it is my fault for improper explanation.
