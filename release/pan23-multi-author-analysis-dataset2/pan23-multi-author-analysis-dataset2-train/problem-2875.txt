NAL. You and your siblings need to get a lawyer immedietely. Who has been paying the taxes and mortgage/bills on the property? Depending on the state, your uncle may already be able to claim adverse possession of the house. Housing law is complicated and varies greatly state to state. But your uncle may defacto own the property by now if you and your siblings have neglected it and allowed him to live on site for so long with no written lease or agreement.
I'm not sure who's been paying the taxes, but my uncle doesn't even pay the water or electricity bills and has been making my mom or their sister pay those for him. Am I able to write up a lease now and begin charging him rent?
Speak with both your siblings first and either decide to evict or write up a lease with a lawyer. You may have to set up an llc to collect rent. A lawyer will be needed. First find out who is paying all the bills and taxes. And inform them of your plans to evict or start an official lease.
It does sound like your uncle will be unable to pay rent so keep that in mind. And more than likely whoever has been paying the bills and taxes will stop paying those if you evict or start charging rent to your uncle.
