Judge him on his record. Ok not his police record (he was fined for partying during the pandemic). Ok not his eat out to spread covid scheme record. Ok not bringing a bunch of discredited morons into downing street who insisted the pandemic was over in September 2020 and dealing mitigation efforts on the second wave therefore ensuring the second lockdown last longer and cost the economy more. Or his gamble that interest rates would stay low last year that saw the taxpayer transfer tens of billions to the bankers. Or his decision not to go after companies that defrauded the covid schemes.
Idk, I suspect a low turnout will make it difficult to call. 35% is considered upper middle class (traditional right) +, 30% generally considered working class (traditional left). The remaining 35% of emergent service and affluent workers could go either way as they're equally penalised by both the left and the right.
I agree and will lose no tears over it, my fear though is that UK politics is a complete shit show and I have zero faith in either Tories or labour, neither are capable of creating a good policy.
I had the same sentiment about our elections in Australia but our new labour govt is actually doing a refreshingly good job so far. Our prime minister doesn't seem to be obsessed with self image and instead is just getting on with the job and giving a shit about ordinary hard working Ozzie's for a change.
