But the contract I signed says I’m an exempt employee. Is that contact null now? They don’t pay over time.
I was told I was an exempt salaried employee. Which I thought meant I was paid a flat rate and exempt from 'overtime'. I didn't think hours mattered, which is why they set a minimum wage for salary.
Sometimes I work over 40, sometimes I work under 40. But we're told to just fill out a timecard to bill Microsoft for 40 hours a week per employee, but through the company I am employed with I am an 'exempt' salaried employee.
That's basically it, you were salary exempt (the exempt being you were exempt from overtime). With the new law if you qualify, you're now salary non exempt and you are owed overtime. No one is "required" to be paid the min salary, just it determines if you qualify for overtime. It's not like min wage where that's the floor for hourly that if you offer salary it must be at the minimum.
Your annual base salary will be $43,000 (Forty-Three Thousand Dollars) earned over the course of each year and.
