I guess my question is there a way to keep her from taking over before the date she had said in her previous email. I'd considered moving the shed, but logistically that would be hard. A shed like that, minus the rodents, runs about $2500, which to me is a fortune.
There is furniture in the shed (wood antiques that can be cleaned). The new time table for getting stuff out of the shed is way to fast considering the pandemic. I won't even be fully immunized at that point, although I'll be close, but getting friends on that short notice who are immunized and who can help... there are a couple big pieces, an old ice box that belonged to my grandmother...
You can react if she disposes of or destroys your property but you can't really prevent her from doing exactly what she's threatening to do. The only way to completely prevent it is to remove the shed and the items inside it.
Even when it was built with permission? I mean, I paid for it, and I am willing to move it. It's the time table with the pandemic that is the problem.
What is your exact legal question? It is also possible that your mother has been paying additional tax or insurance for this accessory building (even if she didn't realize it.).
