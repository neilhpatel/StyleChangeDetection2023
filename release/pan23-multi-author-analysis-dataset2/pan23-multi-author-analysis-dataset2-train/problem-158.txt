The eeoc has regulations on types of inquiries before hiring. stipulates what those are. They can ask about accommodations needed for specific duties but not the nature of disability.
You don't identify whether he is applying for gov't disability benefits based on ADHD or the orthopedic issue that requires a brace. Regardless, I imagine it's a pretty significant disability if your partner is applying for disability. An employer needs to reasonably accommodate disabilities. But without knowing more about the disabilities and job duties, it's unclear whether your partner can perform the duties of these jobs. He can speak to an employment lawyer who should provide a free consultation and would take the case on contingency (percentage of the recovery) if the case looks strong.
He is in the process due to both. Originally it was due to the disability requiring the brace, but during his college education he got more documentation together for ADHD so theyâ€™re hoping he can get disability with regards to both mental and physical limitations. I will let him know about the employment lawyer though if he decides to pursue that route. I appreciate your response!
