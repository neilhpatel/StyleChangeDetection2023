They'd undoubtedly support these things if their candidates did well, they're not coming around, they're just looking to pass blame for a little consolation, they don't really find these things unappealing, they're just upset that enough voters did.
So a lot of conservatives are turning on these candidates, on Trump, on election denying, on Christian nationalism, extreme, anachronistic policies, but they voted for these candidates, for these ideas, they're only lashing out because they lost.
And now they're trying to delude themselves into thinking that Desantis isn't just more of the same.
They are going 110% in on desantis who has been all culture war since biden was elected. These are people who have actively called homosexuals sex predators and groomers in the recent months. Who’ve been banning books that encourage inclusivity even when it’s simple things like race.
For a guy who’s shown himself willing to turn on a dime on a business supporter. Honestly if Dems just ran ads about how bad DeSantis would potentially be for businesses because he demands absolute loyalty and will cut even his long supporters if they don’t not just bend the knee but bend it enthusiastically enough…. If they ran those ads DeSantis would probably see enough business, and by extension union, support dry up.
