Let your landlord know that you will be making a report to the USPS Postal Inspection Service if he does not start giving you your mail. If he doesn't comply do it.
I would just do it op. He doesn't seem to want to give you your property even though you said something to him. He also clearly has a history of doing this with no intentions of stopping.
This business of him taking the mail and not passing it on to you for weeks if ever is plainly illegal and he deserves no more discussion or warning. You told him today. Did he respond to that by saying he would immediately get you your mail? No, obviously not because you still don't have it.
You're not being unreasonable doing that. You know your landlord says they take mail for you and others, you know the landlord has done this with some of your mail because you got some from him long after it was delivered. You also know you have missing mail. Furthermore, the fact that a neighbor reports their mail having been opened and then taped closed is cause for alarm.
You should also call your local post office and have your mail placed on hold, so that you can go there and collect it and not have it interfered with in the meantime.
always better to give someone the option of making good on their mistakes, in addition by giving him that option it will make the USPIS more likely to slam the hammer down on LL.
The USPIS is a part of the postal service, and not who you'd talk to if you just call your local post office. You have to report that your mail is being stolen.
