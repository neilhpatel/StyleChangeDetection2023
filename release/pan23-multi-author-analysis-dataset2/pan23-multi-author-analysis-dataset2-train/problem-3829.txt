He is abusing and assaulting you. These are serious crimes. Your concern should be ensuring your safety in your own home, not worrying about his future. Your first step should be to tell an adult you trust, like a teacher or doctor. They will help you get help to ensure you are safe at home.
I've told my parents, and they scold him and threaten him that he'll lose the car and his phone. But nothing more than that. Are there any options where he doesn't get a criminal record or something on his record? Even though he's an asshole I don't want to ruin his life.
He may or may not be charged with a crime for his actions; there's no way for us to say for sure either way. It's entirely possible there would not be enough evidence to charge him with a crime. If your brother does face consequences as a result of his own actions, it will be entirely his fault for assaulting a minor, not your fault for just telling the truth about what he did.
Regardless, you definitely deserve to live without fear in your own home. Please tell an adult and ask them to help you (or, if you prefer, you can call CPS and make a report yourself).
It's concerning that your parents aren't doing more to protect you from your adult brother. Spitting, hitting on the head and grabbing the throat go far beyond sibling squabbles into actual domestic violence. You can or confide in a trusted adult who is a mandated reporter such as a teacher, doctor or guidance counselor. What happens to your brother should be least of your concerns right now; your safety is what's important.
Being burnt out is not an excuse. As a minor, your parents have a responsibility to provide an environment where you're not subjected to abuse. While all domestic violence is serious, grabbing the throat is especially so. Please follow through with the advice that you've been given here and seek help.
