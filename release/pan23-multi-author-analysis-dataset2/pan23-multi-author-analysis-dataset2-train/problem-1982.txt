I read a lot of Putin history... like Putin in 2000 vs 2008 Putin vs 2022 Putin. He wants the USSR back. He's not destroying Ukraine moral or the support for Ukraine from other countries by bombing civilian areas. He does it because it shows the ones who support him at home that RU is still powerful. I don't know the percentage of those who support this war. I don't think it can too many, as he literally told his Generals one day before, and they were shocked.
If Russia did annex Belarus and tried to turn the Belarusian army on Ukraine, expect rebellion/civil war.
NATO State would piss themselves laughing at the prospect of being able to fully defeat Russia for an eighth of their military budgets and without any personal lose of their soldiers.
The Belarusian army is comparatively untouched and while hardly having a moral high ground (they do maintain a tentative peace with Lukashenko), I'm sure Poland alone would funnel in enough resources to make Belarus a direct threat to Moscow itself.
