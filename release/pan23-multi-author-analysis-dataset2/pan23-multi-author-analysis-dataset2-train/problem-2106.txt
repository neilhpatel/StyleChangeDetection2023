Can you tell me anything about the small claims process? Is it going to be the kind of thing where i can get something done on my court date? Or am i going to have to keep going to court over and over and over again?
You go to court and the judge will determine the outcome. If the judge rules in your favor, a judgement for whatever the determined amount is will be entered into the court records. It is then up to you to collect on that. That is the hard part. You can try to garnish her bank account or wages if the law allows for it but there's no easy mechanism to get her to pay you immediately.
If there's a text saying that then it'd be impossible for her to lose it. Even if deleted, her phone provider will have it. It'll take a lawyer/suppena though to get them to release the texts.
You should have a copy too, though, if you've deleted it then you can request your phone provider to get you copies of them.
The dog should have a rabies certificate but then should have still been quarantined at her cost or in her home.
AND your medical insurance would likely wish to know her info so they can go after her insurance for their costs.
Next you get your medical treatment done of course (I’m sorry you’re injured!) and also the hospital should be reporting the bite.
Also, in the future with a dog fight, kick kick kick. Do not use your hands. Bending over and using hands puts your face at risk too.
That’s proof. That’s all the proof you need to then take her to small claims for 100% of the cost of medical care.
