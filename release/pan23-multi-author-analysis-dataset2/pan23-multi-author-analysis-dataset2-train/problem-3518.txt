That GOP was not buried in the midterms is obscene and mainstream media should be ashamed of itself for normalizing the GOP as much as it has.
Don't forget their policy of outlawing abortion, that helped Democrats as much as anything else in the midterms. I suppose McConnell's shenanigans going back to as far as Merrick Garland's nomination for SCOTUS is to blame there, too, so yeah, I guess it really is all on McConnell and Trump.
