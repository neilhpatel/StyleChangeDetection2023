This is all coming from the book Confidence Man by Maggie Haberman, which I highly recommend btw, but there doesn’t appear to be any evidence that Fred hated Donald. Fred was a harder man, but always spoke very well of his son publicly and helped him numerous times when needed, especially financially. For what it’s worth, Donald reveres him and the only family photo in the WH for awhile was one of his father. When he was elected, he said that his dad would have let him run. There’s obviously something deep there in his need to be loved and respected by his father, and I find that often comes from fathers who are reserved in how they give that love and respect. But I think ‘hate’ is a bridge too far and one there’s not any evidence for.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
