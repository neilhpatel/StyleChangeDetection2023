As for his proclivities, if no crimes have been committed then you've got a dangerous line to walk. If you were to, for example, tell the school administration at his old school what you know, it's possible you could be sued for defamation\. I don't know if that suit has legs or not, but you'd have to defend it through, at least, a motion to dismiss if it were filed. I would note that, depending on what your physical evidence says, you may or may not have an absolute defense to defamation (e.g. "the truth").
This is a very hard situation and very fluid. I'm just so very sorry you're experiencing this in your marriage, but you've done what's best for you re: divorce and I applaud you for acting quickly and with a clear head.
You should, to the extent you are speaking with this man, encourage him to seek counseling immediately. I am not an expert on the sexual abuse of minors, but what you've described as "grooming behavior" is sometimes a step in an abuser's evolution and, in some cases, if they continue to get away with this "benign" behavior, they may escalate to overt, criminal abuse of minors.
\ "Pedophile" has a specific definition that your soon-to-be-ex husband may or may not meet. For example, while sexual activities with post-pubescent minors remains illegal (generally speaking), engaging in those abusive activities is not "pedophilia." Therefore, and based on your post, it may be prudent to avoid using that word until such time as his sexual dysfunction is diagnosed properly.
I would also strongly encourage you to discuss your concerns with your divorce attorney and see what she has to say. She may have specialized knowledge in this area or the ability to guide you more concretely.
Are there like State level teachers unions or something similar that you could contact? They might be able to bar him from any kind of teaching job. Otherwise I would indeed contact the state or regional school board to warn them - they 100% would want this information.
