Typically in NV you pay 1% in earnest money, and $1500 between appraisal, home inspector, followup inspections like sewer before closing. In some areas like Las Vegas earnest money could be 3%, in a rural area it could be less than 1%. You don't pay the rest of the down payment and other costs until just before closing. The earnest money is held by a third party in escrow, usually if the sellers are in breach this money is released back to the buyer. So the only damages to pursue would be for the inspection and appraisal generally.
Yeah I mean if I had to guess it was your parents who pulled out and that’s why they lost the earnest money. Unless maybe they were doing it entirely without a realtor.
I don’t think you know the whole situation. Your Mom would not have been out any money besides maybe having had an inspection done. Usually suing only forces the sale of the house to your Mom but seeing as it’s been 6 years there really isn’t anything that can be done now. It’s not the sellers fault other financial situations came up to where your mom can’t afford a house now.
