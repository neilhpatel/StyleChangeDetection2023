Or Beslan school where the glorious Russian security forces tried to ‘rescue’ 1100 people held hostage in a school. The ‘rescue’ involved tanks, a helicopter gunship and firing a number of thermobaric missiles into the school.
Or the Moscow theatre where the FSB gassed and killed all the Chechen ‘terrorists’ and a large number of hostages.
The worst part about the theater crisis is nearly all the non-shooting deaths were likely avoidable. They used carfentanil (a super heavy duty opiod) to knock everyone out, but then afterwards when they "rescued" everyone from inside they wouldn't tell any of the paramedics or medical staff who responded what they used. Essentially all those deaths were just an OD. They could have just administered naloxone and saved the majority if not most of them, but Russia saw it more as an opportunity to test a chemical weapon than a hostage situation.
Rural US areas can be pretty bad, think regulatory capture but instead of regulation being captured it’s the local government local courts and law enforcement by a few wealthy and or powerful individuals/groups.
Would South America, the Middle East and parts of Africa and Asia be in a better place (politically, culturally and economically) if they (the US) didn't intervene for the sake of oil and power?
Have you put into consideration that you might be biased (if you're American or even from the West that is)?
