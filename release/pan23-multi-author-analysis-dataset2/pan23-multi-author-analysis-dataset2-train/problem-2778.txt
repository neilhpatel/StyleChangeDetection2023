The letter you should be sending is called a debt verification letter. You have 30 days from initial contact to send this letter. Sending this letter prevents a debt collection agency from taking further action to collect the debt, such as suing you, before providing you with certain information. . They basically just have to tell you who the original creditor was and that the original creditor says the debt is legit. If they already sent that information in their initial communication, they probably don't have to send it again.
This is problematic. Your location is relevant, you were likely owed an itemized list of the damages deducted from your deposit, and if you weren't provided with this, or your landlord didn't meet numerous other potential obligations in relation to your deposit, there's a swell chance they had no right to keep any portion of it.
This is not a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your office provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.
Anyway, no, you shouldn't send letters to the 3 major credit reporting agencies. There's no point, since the debt isn't on your credit. Dispute the debt, are some templates, use one or combine them to say what you want them to say. Send your dispute via certified mail. I understand that you already mailed them, if you didn't mail them certified or whatever you sent them wasn't similar to the examples provided by the CFPB/wasn't clear in the fact that you're disputing that you owe the debt, you might want to go ahead and do so a second time.
I am sending this letter to you in response to a notice I received from you on September 7th, 2021. Be advised, this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 (b) that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.
This is the letter I sent to them in 2016 as well as yesterday that I got from a comment on Reddit in 2016.
•Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe; •Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable;.
If your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the three major Credit Bureau's (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion), said action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you for the following:
If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist.
Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel. This includes any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is no provided proof that it is.
If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately.
The letter asks for more than debt collectors are required to provide by law, which isn't a big deal, they'll give you what they have to and ignore the rest. Under the FDCPA, they don't owe you 30 days to investigate the information they return to you, they can resume attempting to collect the debt immediately after they validate your debt, to include reporting against your credit.

This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.
Thank you for the information! I will send them a new letter that is certified. The letters I sent them yesterday was not certified. I sent one to the collection agency in Denver, CO and the other to the law firm that had their PO box in WA.
I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls or correspondence sent to any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter.

The 7 year period is when it can no longer be reported on your credit. You should send the debt validation letter and you should, in that letter, dispute that you owe the debt. Depending on when you vacated in 2015, you might want to stretch out that 30 day clock as much as possible just to make it that much harder for them to collect.
