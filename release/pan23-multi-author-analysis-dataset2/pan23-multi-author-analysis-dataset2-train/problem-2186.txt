He continues to come in anyways. We actually have before but he left right away and at that point they cops didn’t do anything because they did not see him in the store for themselves. So they didn’t want to go over to there business just to tell him off.
Keep calling the police on the trespasser. Put a picture of him up and write DO NOT ADMIT THIS PERSON, CALL THE POLICE, there are all sorts of things to do to get aggressive.
You, restaurant manager, owner, whoever you feel is appropriate in your business hierarchy can authorize the employees to enforce the ban and call the police.
No, I'm saying management doesn't need to do it directly, if someone with the authority in your hierarchy will authorize (or just sign off after the fact) on the employees trespassing people who have already been banned.
If your management won't even do that much, then there's not a lot your employees can do when you're not there unless it escalates.
We try, but no one above me will keep up with it because they don’t care about the situation as much as I do. I am very persistent at telling those above me that they need to do something and they just keep saying “yeah we’ll get back to you”.
