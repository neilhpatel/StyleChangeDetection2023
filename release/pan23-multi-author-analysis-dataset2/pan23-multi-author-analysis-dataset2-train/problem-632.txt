It can be so frustrating when policy is not applied evenly. It sucks that the school is not finding a satisfactory solution; in this case though, I think you can feel confident that a police report is appropriate because regardless of intent, your child was assaulted. Most people probably do not have to deal with this situation so it may be daunting, but you definitely aren't limited to what the school can do!
My older son, when he attended the same school & had the same staff, he was suspended from the bus for 3 days for play fighting his friend at the same location (they tired to claim it wasn't on school property, but the bus stop is according them!).
I understand. Just consider what would happen if you had a child who was nonverbal, or too young to talk, or who didn't understand what had happened. You would be able to file a police report for them. You can file a police report for your child even if they cannot or will not assist in any way; as their parent, you are essentially their voice. Good luck, I hope things get better for you and your child!
