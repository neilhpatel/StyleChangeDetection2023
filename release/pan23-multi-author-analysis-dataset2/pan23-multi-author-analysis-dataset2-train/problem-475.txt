Its not currently trained as a service dog. The dog has no standing and is little more than an ESA in the eyes of the law right now.
Ok. However, several people in the park also have dogs and I have seen them off leash, not clean up after them or that they bark when ever they see somebody. I am unsure as to why she is specifically picking me out and deciding to try to evict me for having a dog.
As for who is doing the training and the programs, I was planning to have him get his good canine citizen certificate first from a training program near here called BlooMoon and planned to get it started this coming month when fresh classes start. This way he would get all of his basics down.
Is it a certified program? Most of the places raise and train their dogs from puppies so that they know they have the right attitude and aptitude.
The problem with getting a pretrained epilepsy service dog is that there are no trainers near me and the ones that I do find in states over have a very long waiting list or are very expensive.
While yes I do understand that he is not a service dog, I'm questioning if she really has the ok to allow everyone else around me to have dogs and then come after me and say I have to get rid of mine even though we do plan to have him trained.
