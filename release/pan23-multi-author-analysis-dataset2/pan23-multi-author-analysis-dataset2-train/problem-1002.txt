He's committing a crime, and, given his record, I assume he's committed it with many others -- in some cases, I would guess, with more success than he had with me, but in all cases it's a major hassle. If I caught someone trying to break into my house, I (probably) wouldn't merely change my locks and get better ones. I'd like to make sure he doesn't do it to the next person, that whatever he stole in the past was returned to its rightful owner, and so on. If I broke into his house to find out who he was, but didn't take anything, that could be my problem. So be it.
This does not change anything. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act does not outlaw hacking, it outlaws unauthorized access to computer systems. Which you did, and would be confessing to if you showed to the police like that. If you are going to report the crime against you, get a lawyer to report it to avoid screwing yourself.
While most police departments are not particularly well versed on computer crime statutes (the larger the more likely to be well versed, or state). You can't be sure what will happen afterwards.
Be that as it may, I'll leave to him to come on this board and ask questions if he wants. My concern is how to stop him.
