As long as it’s not in the written contact that is allowed to have internet then no it’s not illegal. however has he paid his portion of the bills? Cause In theory he could say you can’t use the water if he doesn’t get internet. But you could use it as a tactic for sure.
Wouldn't it be better for op to reduce speeds and\or block a couple of roommates devices? If the bill is in op's name and there is no written agreement on how good of internet....water on the other hand...is a lot harder to restrict.
he knows he is breaking the lease agreement so his is using the maintenance department to report me because he cant go straight to the property managers. I am worried that the maintenance man will put a good word in for him and make me look bad but it is too soon to tell what he is doing (hasn't responded to him at all) at this rate the odds of one of us leaving and one staying is unlikely. He will probably not pay next rent and get me intentionally evicted but he has given me no other options here.
I have been arguing with this roommate for months now and we both hate each other, he is preventing me from having my gf down when his gf gets to live here unapproved. restricting his internet will not get him to listen. the living arrangement and our friendship is beyond repair and this is strictly a revenge move and i doubt ill be living here much longer cause i want a single apartment. i just dont want to get in trouble if i proceed with this.
this october. he is refusing to leave cause he wants to live here and bring one of his friends here. i would like to stay here since there is a dishwasher but there an unlikely chance of that happening.
If he wants his friend there it might be worth it to talk to him about releasing you from lease in exchange for his friend to be added. Or see about sublet with his friend. Talk to your landlord about situation and if hed be willing to go with one of these solutions.
