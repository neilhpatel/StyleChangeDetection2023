>An employee who works remotely (75 miles or more from the employer's office) is covered under the FMLA if the office to which the employee reports and from which assignments are made has 50 or more employees working within 75 miles of its location. FMLA regulation 825.111, paragraph (2) applies to remote and other off-site workers. The regulation states: "An employee's personal residence is not a worksite in the case of employees, such as salespersons, who travel a sales territory and who generally leave to work and return from work to their personal residence, or employees who work at home, as under the concept of flexiplace or telecommuting. Rather, their worksite is the office to which they report and from which assignments are made.".
He otherwise qualifies for FMLA right? At least 50 employees in a 75 mile radius of whatever office he reports to, employed at least 1 year, worked 1250 hours in the past 12 months?
He can request it as caregiver leave, but that can involve different documentation than bonding leave.
