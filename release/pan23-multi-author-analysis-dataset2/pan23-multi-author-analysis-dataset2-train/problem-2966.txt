Are you located in an SF-R, SF-11, SF-6 (R-1), SF-4.5, DR, TH, PH-ZL zoning district? If so, then the landlord may be in violation of Section 4.3.4.5, even if not the rooming house regulation. If SPA zoning precludes the others, then perhaps not. If so, however:
Probably not, no. If people could bypass the law by saying nobody told them, then the law wouldn't matter. But it's not clear if the landlord is in violation or not.
Can't do DMs on this sub. You don't have anything to worry about right now. Maybe there are no such ordinances in your area. Take a deep breath and check with the city on Monday.
San Marcos (like most places) has multiple "special plans" which are different. A specific plan is a document designed to implement the goals and policies of the General Plan, but it won't necessarily be the end-all of zoning. "Where the regulations of a Specific Plan are silent or not specifically referenced, the comparable regulations of this Zoning Ordinance and all adopted ordinances, regulations, standards, and guidelines of the City shall apply, subject to the Director's discretion, unless otherwise declared by the Planning Commission." SPA covers both SPA and HDR (High Density Residential). You may be but you should speak to your landlord asap.
My landlord is Unknowledgeable and I am too anxious to leave the situation as is without knowing my rights and options. I canâ€™t seem to find anything else besides SPA online for our zone, I will call the city Monday.
