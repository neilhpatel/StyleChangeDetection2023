Here in Washinon State it's colder than usual for this time of year. We usually don't have snow that sticks, until around Thanksgiving. We've had several inches on the ground for over a week now. The planets has been screwed up and it's going to get worse. Politicians just keep supporting industry without climate improvement being mandated. The rich will continue to do so, until their factories are affected and their families are dying. To them, it's a problem we can deal with later. The problem is. IT IS LATER!
ETA: Mates, I stopped reading too soon and drew the wrong conclusion about where this piece was going and have been corrected twice --- so far. My bad. I'm going have a nice glass of wine with my lovely wife now. Secure in the knowledge that what I wrote is true, none the less. And thank you to those here who recognized it also.
Not as extreme here but similar. I'm a gardener. Anyone who spends time out in Nature can see and feel the changes. Flowers that should have died back months ago are still blooming.
"This weather pattern, while fairly unusual for the time of year, is not linked to climate change," says King.
From Washinon as well and it was like in the 80’s some of the days here in late October.. that’s never the case.. By October usually it’s pouring rain or grey daily… so I agree it’s hella cold here but idk if it was like that in your area but for me it felt like the warm weather stayed longer than usual this year too (Tacoma-Seattle area).
