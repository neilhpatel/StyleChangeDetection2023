If we can see the Big Dipper, we should be able to see the meteors! We live in Hawaii quite a ways away from any big lights so as long as the clouds stay away, we will bundle up and go lay on the beach and watch it.
Litha is a brilliant time Getting together to celebrate the love and warmth of the warmer seasons, jumping the fire - i want to go to Stonehenge on both solstices, so badly!
Christmas with the current celebration date is basically the celebration of the winter solstice and happy wishings for the new (solar) year.
In Northern Europe we havent even bothered to change name from the pagan celebration to something more Christian .
Christmas was even banned in England during part of the time when the just became protestant, as it was too much of an pagan Holliday.
Interestingly, Stonehenge has nothing to do with the original Druids. Stonehenge predates them, by quite a bit. Moreover, from what we know of actual ancient Druidic ceremonies, they were generally conducted in woodlands, not in stone ceremonial spaces.
So why the association of Druids with Stonehenge? Apparently, this dates back to the late 18th early 19th century, when antiquarian interest in Stonehenge really got going in England, at the same time as antiquarian interest in pre-Christian religions, and Druidism in particular. It was simply assumed that the Druids must have built Stonehenge.
The actual age of Stonehenge was only determined much later, well after the association between Druids and Stonehenge was already well established in the popular mind.
