The answer to this question is a little tricky because it will depend on what is considered a "reasonable" change to the rules.
Also, I acknowledge that given this clause they can probably enforce the rule. But am I wrong in believing that they can't make me sign an addendum? From their point of view, if they believed this rule was enforceable, they wouldn't need tenants to sign an addendum since it's already covered in the lease. This makes me skeptical as to whether it's enforceable, or if they're hoping people won't question it and just sign.
Yeah I'm not concerned about having to leave at the end of my term, I planned on it anyway. I'm mostly just concerned with them being able to evict me for not signing an addendum.
Does your existing lease allow you to smoke inside? If so they canâ€™t change that, but they can change rules for common areas.
The lease doesn't explicitly allow or forbid smoking inside the unit. So I figured I could acknowledge the rule change and refuse to sign. Just want to make sure I have a leg to stand on when they inevitably get upset because of that.
It really depends on what the lease says. If there's a provision in there that let's them add new restrictions or policies, they can, for instance. But usually they can't just change things mid-lease.
they can make changes to rules to common areas and such, but can't change how you use your rented apartment.
