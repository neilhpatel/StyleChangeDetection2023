What's your point? DeSantis has no shame either, but enough of an air of respectability to him that Republicans that couldn't stomach voting for Trump twice, might vote for him in a general. Let Trump be the republican front runner, let him lose a popular vote for a third time and the EC for a second, and if he actually does win, then realize that he's a less harmful form of cancer for this nation than DeSantis.
No, no,no,no... if you can't get him to sit the election out or vote D, you should he doing everything in your power to keep him on the Trump train. Trump os ineffective. DeSantis is Trump with the brains to actually do real fascism.
