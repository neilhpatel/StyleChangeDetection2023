I stopped reading after that as you went on to a lot of other stuff that isn’t really relevant. Pay the $150. Reach out to tenants rights organizations or legal aid to see about the other issues and anything going forward.
The other option if it’s in play is requesting to a mutual breaking the lease since she wants you out. You also may be able to negotiate a cash for keys situation where she helps defray the costs of moving out to just end it.
I’d pay the money. She can’t evict you if you do, at least not for that. Having an eviction filed will make it part of your record and will make it harder to rent again.
You can’t claim gas or laundry expenses. It wouldn’t fall under a health or safety violation for a non working washer. You didn’t mention you had confirmation from an agency that it was.
You can’t prevent it. You can reach out to the organizations I mentioned to try to teach you your rights. If it’s in the budget a sit down for an hour with a tenant rights lawyer is helpful. You can go over specific concerns and all the other issues mentioned and the process to get them addressed.
