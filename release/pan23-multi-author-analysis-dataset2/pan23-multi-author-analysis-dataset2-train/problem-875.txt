Yes I think it's wildly hypocritical to reintroduce in the mountain West, but not, say, the Northeast. Screams nimby imo. Upstate NY has way too many deer.
We've got mountain lions in my area, but they don't really go after people. Pets are taken by wildlife fairly often though.
Wolves are just as frightened of people. We wiped them out more because they were competition for game. They've been reintroduced in my state.
This is a legitimate issue we’ve been facing as a species for a while. How do we balance preserving these animals and their survival while eliminating the risks they pose to us? Sadly we still haven’t found the right answer and this little girl was another victim of that.
Well, on some continents there are big areas where mosquitoes are way deadlier than tigers... So, also glad those mosquitoes also aren't carrying West Yellow Malazikadengue.
Yeah we have the occasional bear, but Bobcats and coyotes are the actual concern in Kentucky at least. They’ll nab your pets and you won’t even see a trace of them.
