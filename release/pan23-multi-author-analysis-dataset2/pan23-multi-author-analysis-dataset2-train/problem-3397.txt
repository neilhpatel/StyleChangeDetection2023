We do have a custody agreement for our son which is very basic. We have joint legal custody and she is the parent of primary residence. I have the children Friday 10a - Monday 10a as per the agreement regarding our son. We split all costs evenly, I pay children support for our son and allow her to claim them both on her taxes.
After we broke up and things got ugly we went to court to settle the parenting situation. That is how the custody agreement came about. Fast forward a few years and we tried again. We had our daughter but it didn't work and we split back up when she was 8 months old. We haven't been back to court or anything like that since so we just keep the children together for our times. There is no agreement or order involving our daughter just the one for our son from 5 years ago.
Edit: she doesn't break the agreement as it only deals with financials which there is no issue and schedules which aren't an issue either.
Unless you actually think the kids are in danger I would take an extra day and talk to a lawyer about how to file your case with the best chance of success.
Could the live in boyfriends record or past be an issue if I brought it up in court? I can't understand hiding your identity unless the reveal would be problematic.
