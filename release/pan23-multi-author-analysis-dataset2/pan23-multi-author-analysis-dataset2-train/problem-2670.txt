because colorado is an at-will employment state and your job can fire you for any reason or no reason outside firing you because of a few protected classes or a contract saying otherwise.
Lacking a union agreement or employment contract your employer can fire you for just about any reason under the sun as long as it isn't for being a member of a protected class, as retaliation for whistle blowing, or against any other state law.
The worst thing I typed to this troll was "If you were so upset because you didn't get my sarcasm and didn't like my comment, that you think it is your job to get me fired, then fuck your feelings".
Yes I did, but the original comment was seriously harmless. But my HR dept showed me screenshots of my instant message to the guy, telling him the above comment, and this is what they told me was in violation of the social media policy. Unfortunately I had no idea that Facebook Instant Messenger displays my listed employer at the top when someone receives a message from me.
Unfortunately this means that they don't have an objection to the social media policy. About all you can do is try to collect unemployment (if they don't dispute it) and try to get reemployed ASAP.
AFAIK, Colorado has no state law protecting this. Even if there was, it would be dependent on the context. If it was offensive or racist you likely would not be protected because it could make the company look bad. Even if you didn't specifically mention the company in the post.
I really hoped the union would have power, but they don't seem to in this case. HR said they were going for termination, my union rep told them I have 9 years of service with not one problem, and they STILL terminated me.
