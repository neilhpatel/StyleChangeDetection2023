You need a state here, but in many jurisdictions if you are on the title of the house, it can't be sold without your consent or without a legally enforced partition sale. So they can say they're only going to give you 17% and you can say no (and you probably should, that seems like a terrible deal). You probably want to get a lawyer to help with this and give you all your options. For that amount of money it is definitely worth getting a lawyer.
Do the math. If you've only paid 17% of the expenses associated with the property, it would be pretty reasonable for you to only get 17% of the profit.
I just am not sure if I have any ground to stand on because I haven’t paid the mortgage since I moved out, because of our “agreement”, which wasn’t in writing. I’ve looked online about the rights of co-ownership, but didn’t really find anything relating to a situation like this.
It wouldn’t be only 17% if they had held up their end of the agreement, though. I understand that it wasn’t in writing, but I sought out advice on here because I’ve never been through anything like this and am not sure if the court system is that black and white.
But the reality is that you didn't hold up your end of the original bargain and continue making your portion of the payments. If it gets to court the judge isn't going to care what would have happened in an alternate universe. They're going to try and find an equitable resolution to the dispute, and the easiest way to get there is to split the profits at the same ratio that expenses were split.
