What you are quoting most likely refers to exempt employees, as the FLSA does not require a full week’s salary be paid in the first and/or last week if a full week was not worked. If your husband was non-exempt, he needs to be fully paid for all hours worked.

google wage complaint and labor department .your state may have a labor department .you make a claim there. seen lots of posts on reddit that they are good about getting people paid.
He only worked the one day, so he was technically compensated for hours worked but not at the agreed upon rate. They cut his $17.50 down to $8.80 without notice for the one day worked.
