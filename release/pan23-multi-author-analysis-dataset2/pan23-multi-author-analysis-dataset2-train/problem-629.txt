It's not even a tank. It's a M113 I drove these back in the very early 2000's. So... these are not tanks. It's closer to a tractor. 10 of these and 50 people to for them. It requires 2 people to operate and CONSTANT MAINTENANCE to keep these things running. The US ARMY with INFINITE BUDGET can't keep these things operational. They'll break track constantly. Roll-overs will happen. These vehicles are barely capable of providing an official weapon platform.
Because otherwise this is just another boner pill for their base of limp dicks looking for someone to blame for their shame.
