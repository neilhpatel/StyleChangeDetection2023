You have, at best, a complaint to the police chief or your city elected officials about the decisions that were made here.
Unrelated though...does that mean that if I were to somehow legally be driving an emergency vehicle with a siren, and I were to use it in a manner that violated that section...Would the state have any recourse against me? Again, hypothetically. I have no way of legally driving a police car.
If you like the event, there's not much to do here. If you didn't you can complain to your city officials.
Generally with community outreach programs, there's some notice considering they want the community to be a part of it.
There were no road closures or signs, there was no obvious parade-type convoy (all I saw was police and fire trucks driving around), and in my experience it is absolutely abnormal for them to be using the same sirens that they would use for an emergency, nonstop, for extended periods of time, during a community outreach program. That is my issue there.
They absolutely did not know what was going on, the dispatcher was just as confused as I was. Someone just happened to overhear what he was saying and also happened to know what was happening. This was like a 15-minute phone call, not a quick "oh yeah let me check, wait it's the parade!".
What you’re supposed to do if you’re concerned is call the non-emergency line and ask what to do. Turn on the local news and see if there’s a major emergency being reported on. Suck it up and move on.
