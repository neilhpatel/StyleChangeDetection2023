As one commenter stated: "The study said that masks did nothing because people didn't wear them properly or consistently. That's not the same thing as them, inherently, not working. Notice how surgeries are still masked environments?".

Seems Bret is confirmation biasing (wrongly too) that masks did nothing because of the result due to him telling people during covid that masks were being forced on them and that they did nothing.
Anecdotally, I've observed rather a lot of lousy mask discipline, so it doesn't surprise me much that people who ostensibly "wear masks" aren't seeing the best results. Too many people seem to think that poking their nose over their masks, wearing them over a full beard, or removing them to eat inside crowded restaurants doesn't obviate the protective benefits of masking.
