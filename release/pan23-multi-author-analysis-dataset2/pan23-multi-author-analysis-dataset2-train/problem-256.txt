Thats all their policies are, a "moderate" republican will fall in line with MAGA if they are the ones in charge and they can continue the grift. I wish people understood this and stopped giving this party chances ffs look what they have done to the country.
Good to see the narrative is now "one party isnt good" vs all the terrible shit the republican party has done and is still doing. I'm all for more than 1 party but republicans have shown they shouldnt be one.
