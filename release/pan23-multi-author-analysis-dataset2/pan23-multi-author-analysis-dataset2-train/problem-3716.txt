Document the existing condition of the floor yourself, including the damaged board, the wear, and parts that aren’t overly worn. You could also bring in a contractor of your own to give an opinion on if they think the floor needs to be replaced, can be repaired. Get their estimate on how old the floor is, how long a floor like that normally lasts, and if in their opinion the wear exceeds ‘normal wear’ for its age.
Then you can use that information to potentially challenge the landlord’s claim. Depending on the information, see if you can even challenge if the landlord has claim to keep the deposit.
You could remove a board from the closet if you can't find any extra flooring, and replace it with something close.
Yeah, laminate does not stand up well to dog traffic over the long run. I'd take her to small claims court, as her policies are unrealistic and this should fall under normal wear and tear, especially since she was well aware of the dogs. This definitely sounds like she's trying to make you pay for her remodel so she can sell faster.
Laminate floors are not meant to be painted. Depending on the type of laminate and type of paint the chemicals can interact and actually cause a weaker surface to the flooring.
Additionally, if there is no checklist stating the condition of the floors at move in, there is no evidence that any damage was done at all.
Get a flooring salesman/installer to take a look and take good notes on any information they give you. If this ends up in court provide the information to a lawyer.
