IANAL. Do not do this. Estate law is very detailed about which debts get paid first, and if there are insufficient assets in the estate to cover all debts, the unsecured creditors (like credit card companies) miss out on full repayment.
Assume makes an ass of you and me, so go to your state's probate court (could be called surrogate's court or something else) and find out if they have any guidance on estate management online. If the estate is more than $20,000 - $30,000 I recommend getting some advice from an attorney who practices in this area.
It's rare for post-death credit card interest and fees to actually be paid -- the credit card company will typically waive that if you pay quickly and don't make them jump through the hoops of filing a claim against the estate. .
Just let the estate process play out. Keep everything above board and transparent. Also accessing his account when he’s deceased is considered fraud. Also if the bank knows he’s deceased there is probably a block on the funds anyway.
Unsecured debt like credit cards tend to be barrel of the bottom in terms of collecting from a dead person. You should make no attempt to pay outside of the probate rules. If called by collectors you should not agree to do so outside of written notice to the estate.
I don’t know what Lastpass is but I can make some assumptions. Standard procedure in banking is that a deceased person cannot give access to accounts. The bank is going to expect you to follow the legal process to gain access to his accounts. Using a third party tool to gain his passwords is not that. Also there is literally no rush. If the credit card keeps adding fees or whatever, the court will only make the estate pay what he owed on the date of his passing.
