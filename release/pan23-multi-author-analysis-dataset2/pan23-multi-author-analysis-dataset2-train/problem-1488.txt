What outcome is your friend looking for? It sounds very much like your friend should work out with landlord to vacate and pay the damages before this comes to litigation and a public record.
My friend just doesn't want this to go on his record and he wants the time to fix it. With how much he works, it doesn't leave much time to work on repairing a home. He recently was given four days off a week. But the money is a huge problem. He is willing to fix anything that he can himself. Cleaning, painting the walls, and he has experience in ripping up carpet and laying tile and linoleum. All of which, are the main issues. He just needs a realistic time frame to do that in. He isn't fighting the landlord to stay in the home. He understands that he isn't trusted to live there anymore. But he needs a realistic timeframe to get the work done.
It wouldn't be possible for the landlord to cancel the process or decide to not go through with the legal action? I'm sorry in advance, I don't have experience with these things myself.
This is that either or again. If the property is vacant and ready to go landlord should dismiss. If otherwise he should go forward.
