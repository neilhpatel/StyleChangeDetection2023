Perhaps it might have been better to not let countries set their own targets, and then further incur zero penalties for not actually meeting them.
Shit, we as a species can't even put out a bucket of candy for Halloween without some ignorant fuck stealing the lot, what hope did the Paris Accord ever have to begin with?
It would have in Theory, but in practice none of the countries you want to be part of the deal would have agreed to it. And yeah we have no hope, we are basically fucked, best thing to do now is to just not have any children so they won't have to suffer the future we have made for them.
Does anyone really think we will be able to stay under 1.5C warming ? I am starting to think even 2C is a big long-shot. A good example of this is what happened in the US. People were stressing about high gas prices, so the US Gov releases its reserve to lower the price to help the party in power. This alone proves we are on the "highway to hell" so to speak. And yes, the "other party" would have done the same.
That's cynical. It was a good-faith agreement, unfortunately no country is going to put itself in the position of being punished for not meeting goals set internationally.
Well either everyone, especially in the "first world", makes big changes now they can control, or people will be forced to make very unpleasant changes in the near future. This issue will not go away by hoping it will or pretending it will not happen.
It would force conversation, public transport use, other modes of transport. Plus people would need to move closer to where they work.
The best way to mitigate this is to force fossil fuel prices to double or triple. Unless it hits the pocketbook of most people, nothing will happen.
Yes because in 2022 there is literally no way for people to communicate over great distance to avoided flying everyone in on private jets. None whatsoever.
