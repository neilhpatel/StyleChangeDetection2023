What's important here is whether you can document these events to prove up a claim. You could certainly go with your word, alone, but evidence is best. Emails and texts showing you objected to bring treated like that, video of an event, etc. All are helpful.
Next step might be to call corporate ethics hotline. Not sure if they'll do for franchisees but worth a shot.

From here on out, document as much of the harassment as you can Write down exactly what was said in a log with the date and time, as well as witnesses who heard the harassment… I’d also do research on recording consent law in your state, and if you’re legally allowed to, record as much of the harassment as you can Then take it to a lawyer.. but in the very least, log everything said to you?
Title: I work at a popular pizza company, and have been enduring sexual harassment/assault from my "straight" manager consistently, and homophobia and false accusations from the owners. I don't know what to do. And there is no HR number to call.
You can also call the police and file a criminal complaint against your manager for assault and, perhaps, sexual assault.
If it's a popular pizza company, it's more than likely the case that you're dealing with a franchise business as opposed to a chain store. That means that there is no corporate HR to call unless the franchisee has multiple units and an internal HR department.
