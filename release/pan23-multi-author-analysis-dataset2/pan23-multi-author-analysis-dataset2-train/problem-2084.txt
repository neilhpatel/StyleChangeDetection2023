COVID-related eviction moratoriums generally only affect people who cannot pay due to income loss due to COVID-related job loss.
To my knowledge, the COVID eviction moratoriums are not going to be effective against this sort of termination and eviction.
The protections do not include non renewal of a lease, violations of lease, or termination due to a sale. If you are not out on time, this is an eviction case courts will hear.
That’s what I’m trying to figure out. Do those regulations help me against the lease language. She never gave me any indication that she was selling or thinking of selling.
If the lease says she can terminate the lease if she's selling - then she can terminate the lease if she's selling. Covid or any other protections don't help you if it's spelled out in the lease.
Okay that’s what I afraid of. It sucks that she had me recruit new tenants that moved in this weekend and now she’s terminating the lease on us. Thanks for the insight.
Okay thanks for the input. It’s been in there prior years too I just don’t get why she had me recruit new tenants and move them in over the weekend and then terminate the lease today. I appreciate the insight.
