We have a saying in Sweden going back to the WW2 days, which translates to "The Finnish cause is ours". Erdogan is trying to cause a divide among the Nordic countries to strenhen his bargaining power, but he's underestimating how close the countries are and how much we view each other as brothers and sisters (yes, even you Danes). Besides, even if Finland tried to join NATO on their own, it's very likely Erdogan would come up with some other nonsense reason for why they can't join since the core issue isn't really about Finland and Sweden in the first place.
Attacking Sweden without going through Finland isn't impossible, but it's a lot harder than the other way around. I could see why Finland may want Sweden to wait, but no reason why Sweden wouldn't tell Finland to go first.
I'm a Finn and I think this is definitely a wise choice. Personally I have no faith in Erdogan saying something else today or tomorrow anyway so it's better to just wait for his tantrum to end and join with our neighbors to the west.
