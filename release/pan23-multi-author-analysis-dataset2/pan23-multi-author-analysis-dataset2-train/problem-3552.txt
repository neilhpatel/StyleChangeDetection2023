I looked at the first few lines, didn’t read your entire post, it needs to be like 10% of what you wrote if you want people to read it. In any event, your employment was at will, that wasn’t a contract. Your “employer” was not obligated to follow through on anything and was free to decide they didn’t want to employ you.
I would note there are extreme fringe cases where a concept called promissory estoppel applies, but those situations almost always involve bad faith on the part of the company, which you don’t have here. Changing business priorities and financial situations are valid reasons to end an agreement before it even starts.
Because it says it’s at will in the agreement. Unless the agreement said it was irrevocable and could only be changed for cause or consent then it would be at will.
followup question: I never received any official notices of termination or delay. I was informed by an employee/director there, but never given anything stating "sorry, we've decided to go another route" or "sorry, this position is no longer available." would this have any weight?
Not glib at all. I appreciate the clarification. My counterpoints, even if I’m wrong about them, come from a place of genuinely trying to understand the situation, so again, thank you for taking the time to explain.
