I would do it ASAP. If his wife finds out and files for divorce (and possibly also child support for her kids) before you are awarded child support, then the court may award your child less support. It’s often advantageous to be the “first one” to get a child support order against someone. Even if it gets modified later based on his new post-divorce financials, that will be an uphill battle for him and you’ll get that extra $ in the meantime.
In the broadest terms, parents who desire it and for whom there is no question as to fitness, should plan on shared custody and relatively equal parenting time.
That he was married to someone else does not, in general, affect fitness as a parent. You should anticipate this will go as it would in any other situation.
It will only impact you if he has children with his previous wife, and was ordered to pay child support to her. Generally previously ordered child support is deducted from income when calculating new child support payments, so all things being equal the first children to file earn more.
And even if they are living together, if they knew OP would also file for support, keeping the old order active keeps more money in their pocket; so why modify it?
