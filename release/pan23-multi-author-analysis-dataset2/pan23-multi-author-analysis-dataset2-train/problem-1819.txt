I have proof in texts and in cash app transactions that she was paid for the commission, we never set a deadline for the portraits so I’m not sure if that matters, but we also have proof of her looking for other commissions (specifically pet portraits) for less than half what we paid her when she hadn’t been responding to us. And she admits that it’s shitty of her to do that in messages to us. We have no tracking number for the packages or anything to prove she ever sent them, let alone started or completed them.
Sounds like you have what would need for a small claims court case. The artist would have a hard time proving the mail was successfully sent to you unless they sent it as certified mail. Was there a tracking number involved with the mail piece?
No tracking number, she didn’t even tell us she mailed it the day she supposedly had mailed them out, she told us the day after when we once again inquired about a photo of the progress of the art. Seems a little convenient that she finally responds and they were “mailed out the day before” so she can’t send pic proof they were ever done….
