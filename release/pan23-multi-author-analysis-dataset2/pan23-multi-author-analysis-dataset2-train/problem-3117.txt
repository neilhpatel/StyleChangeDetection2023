The issue is that the president of the United states was that blitheringly stupid to even suggest those thing at all, in any context, much less on the national fucking news.
Was he spitballing nutjob health cures on the fly at a nationally televished health presser? Yes. Was he saying we should try shit that was so deadly a 7yr would know better? Yes. Did it cause some of his stupider followers to literally try to kill themselves? Yes.
For sure. It was pure vanity. He felt it made him look weak. We suffered through his historic mismanagement of a once in an a lifetime pandemic because he didn’t like the way a mask made him look.
Yet, wouldn't do it with Masks during a pandemic and fought them. Hell, other places took: "Trump 2020" for buying masks and made a profit, but the dumb ass who could have made a killing on them: "nah, they are stupid and I can't cover up my beautiful face with a fake virus that will go away any day now.".
You've removed all context from the clip. First, he didnt say bleach, but did say "disinfectents." The context was effectivly about bleach, which is why people refer to it as such. Secondly, he was suggesting we find a way to use disinfectant or UV light internally. Both would immediately kill a person.

And still does today. Hell airlines should use their profits and just update their filters and kill germs as it circulates the air. But nah… why do that?
