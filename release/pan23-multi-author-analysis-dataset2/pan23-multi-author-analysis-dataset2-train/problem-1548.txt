This is what is called an illicit discharge and is an MS4 (Municipal Seperate Storm Sewer System) violation. Whoever is in charge of your storm sewers would regulate this be it your county, drainage district, township, or city.
Agreed on all fronts, but I'd also recommend contacting the state level Department of Environmental Protection. While the illegal discharge to the sewer would prompt the Municipal authority to issue a violation, if the actual material being discharged is indeed deemed hazardous that's a whole other series of violations that the local DEP would come down on. Hard. And depending on the duration of how long the neighbor has been doing this and what specific cleaners he's using, the overflow from the planters (into the yards) may have the whole area contaminated to the point that a serious cleanup would be required. Though that aspect depends entirely on what that waste water consists of. If its just water and dirt, not so much. If cleaners are involved... potentially.
Contact the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District as well. Sounds like he's dumping solvents and would need District permits. Someone mentioned contacting Cal EPA and they're absolutely right. It will get routed to all relevant agencies.
There is a number on this website for “Chemical Hazard Inquiries” I would start there and I’m sure they can direct you to the right department if it isn’t them.
While those who are recommending you call the EPA aren't exactly wrong, the EPA is going to send it to your state department of environmental protection who will then forward it to your local MS4 anyway so you might as well contact your MS4 directly to get a quicker response.
