You need to hire an attorney. Tomorrow is your arraignment, or trial? Presuming arraignment, plead "NOT guilty" and then ask for an attorney to be assigned. If they won't because you make too much money, hire one. Don't talk to the police. Of course you want to stay out of jail but you also don't want to have a criminal record for the rest of your life. Stop talking, get attorney.
You shouldn't have said anything at all. It can only be used against you, not for you. Hopefully you'll never be questioned again or detained again, but never again try to explain it, this can only lead to an arrest. Also, the law doesn't care what you were told or what you believed, if the person was, in fact, under 21 then you broke the law.
When I originally was detained or whatever the proper terminology was, I maintained that I didn't know how old he was because they asked me over and over again, it felt like they were trying to get me to admit something to them that wasn't true. I dont know the difference between trial or arraignment but tomorrow is the first meeting I'll have in court. The carbon copy citation they gave me told me to go in tomorrow at 8am.
If this is your first appearance, plead NOT guilty and ask for an attorney. You are pleading NOT guilty to have more time to negotiate a plea. If the person was under 18, then you could be charged with an additional crime. If the person was 18+ then you are not facing jail time, rather fines and community service, but having a criminal record needs to be avoided here, and an attorney can help with that. You should not try to defend yourself because you have no defense (again, because it doesn't matter what anyone said or what you thought). You need an attorney to negotiate a plea. Good luck!
