Does part of your process include telling the people you are negotiating against that they are welcome and even advised to have a lawyer represent their interests?
No, however, the people I'm negotiating with/against do work for large businesses that have their own in-house counsel. Therefore, they're fully aware that they can call on their attorneys anytime. Generally, I negotiate with them and often times that info gets passed along to an attorney for their approval.
In Texas, lawyers have different ethical obligations than non-lawyers. For example, lawyers have more restrictions when recording a conversation as compared to non-lawyers. One other obligation is disclosing the fact that you are representing the interests of a client in negotiations with a non-lawyer if there is any possibility that the non-lawyer might think the lawyer is just trying to facilitate the process or any other assumption that is contrary to the understanding the the lawyer is representing only the interests if her client.
