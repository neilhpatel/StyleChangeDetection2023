Chances are what will happen is the banks will eventually detect the fraudulent activity, but not for some time after you've withdrawn the cash. Then your account goes into the negative, and to add insult to injury, they add overdraft fees and interest...that compounds until you bring the account back up to zero.
This is definitely illegal, this is the perfect description of being a money mule or money laundering. It doesn’t matter if it’s just in Canada it’s still the same thing.
It wouldn’t be my money. It would the the people who have illegal businesses that are covered by another name. Each card withdraws around 5k per day. The job is just to withdraw the cash.
Of course they would try to make it seem legal and fine to you, they want you to do it. What you listed above is money laundering and I wouldn’t get involved with that if I was you.
They aren’t stolen either. These people made business accounts for these illegal companies, and they get a percentage of all the money that goes through the account.
