Okay. So have you tried calling the Medicaid office and letting them know you’re still an Idahoan and you can send a utility bill with your name on it to prove that?
You’re filing for disability, so do you not currently have a disability that the state of Idaho acknowledges as qualification for Medicaid?
Edit: also, it’s not that they took 16 days to get it to you, more than likely the post office was the delay. You can check post mark date on the envelope. Also, only reason you said they are suspending your coverage is they can’t prove you are a resident anymore so seems like that’s what you have to prove. Unless there are other details not being shared. I don’t see what you can do legally though, other than provide them evidence of you currently living in Idaho and not just getting mail there.
You’ll need to prove to the state of Idaho that you live there, not just possess a PO Box or that you show them a photo of something else that got mailed to you there. So yes, the lease should suffice as proof of residency.
2. Two years ago, a Medicaid expansion was enacted to allow low low-income people who are not considered disabled to go on Medicaid. This allowed me to get Medicaid. During those years I worked part time at a call center and made probably $5k for both years.
