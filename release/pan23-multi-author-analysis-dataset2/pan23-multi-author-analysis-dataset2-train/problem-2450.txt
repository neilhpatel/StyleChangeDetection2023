The event would be canceled but it would still be a loss all around. The teams would all individually have to honor their contracts and pay the damages. Advertising clients would be furious and demand their money back (probably also have clauses in their contracts if they are savvy). The web of economic entanglement is large at such a large event. I can't even grasp the scope of all the companies which would go under due to this.
Not quite. I'd say every team goes in fucking hard against Qatar and tries to thrash them. The only action the host nation should see is their team getting beaten over and over.
The best possible scenario would be if all 31 teams would just not play. That would be absolutely hilarious, just 90 minutes of all players sitting down on the field. Constant 0-0 and the Qatar gets the most humiliating victory.
They've bribed their way to everything else, so id say it's not unlikely that the Equador team or others would settle for a new Ferrari for every player just to let in a goal or 3. Lies and money has controlled everything else this world cup, so I don't see why the matches would be any different.
The world would talk about it for 1-3 weeks and then it would be forgotten again because the next topic will be on the table.
