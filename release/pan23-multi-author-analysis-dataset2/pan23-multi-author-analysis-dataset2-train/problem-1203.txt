All companies, businesses, even governments need to evaluate what actual minimal personal information is actually needed to operate as opposed to wanted and "good to have" off customers to access services and how long do they need the information for. So many companies hold onto personal details long after you have left or stopped using them. Passing info to third parties needs to be banned. Unused accounts need to be deleted and not "paused". Plus a huge crack down on fake call centres with big penalties when raided.
Many companies in many industries are guilty of not using minimum PII and it often comes down to how they organize data internally. And laziness.
But for real, these seam like things that may actually help people, so you know.... Not going to happen.
What labour says and does in opposition is what it thinks is the best course to get back in, what it does while it's in power is what it really wants to do. I know that's shitty and everyone should just be open but that's the political game. The liberal party would never say they are going to defund Medicare while in opposition but as soon as they get in what do they do, try and defund Medicare.
