In 2016 I was mistakenly diagnosed with TB. When I was admitted to the hospital for quarantine one of the first things I was told was that if I left I would be arrested. When I was discharged I was given masks and told to wear one around others at all times. Someone from the public health department came to my home repeatedly to assess my adherence and inventory my medication to see if I was complying. The whole thing was very strict and made me feel that if I ignored any of it I'd be in huge trouble. I'm surprised to read that someone could just resist like that for so long and endanger the public.
