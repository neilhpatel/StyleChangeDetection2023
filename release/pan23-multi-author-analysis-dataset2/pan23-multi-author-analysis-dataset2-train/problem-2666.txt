Perhaps I'm a cynic but whenever I read about corruption crackdowns, I tend to believe that it's more of one group trying to oust another group for the sake of power rather than for the sake of the country.
No man rules alone, and they keys to power are what keep him there, he needs to keep them happy. In dictatorships the keys are few, and in democracies keys are many, but the rules are the same, lose the keys to power and they will replace you.
The idea of revolutions and the people fighting to removing the ruler is mostly fantasy. This only happens when the army lets them; the people haven't replaced the king, the court replaced the king, using the people's protest to do it.
Authoritarian regimes love corruption, because if everyone is corrupt you automatically have an excuse to arrest anyone you like at any time. So everyone walks your line.
When i was young, i thought the same. But in reality, the commies has their hands on everything from the US-VN war finished until now. The picture of democratic is just a farce in my country, sadly.
