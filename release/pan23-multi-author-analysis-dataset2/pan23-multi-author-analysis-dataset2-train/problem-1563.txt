It sure sounds like he is but you have to prove it. Do you have anything like pictures that can show the before and after to help prove he didn't fix the ceiling appropriately?
If not, you can make the case that he should be liable but it sounds like the landlord will make that difficult and you might need small claims court.
Him fixing the ceiling is a separate issue and needs to be done ASAP since leaks like you mention may make the place inhabitable.
no renters insurance, does it sound like he is liable? He just went up to the ceiling to do whatever "fix" he does then I tried talking to him about my computer to no avail which led me here. I'm already moving out and putting money together for that I shouldn't have to pay for a new computer as well.
I am trying to be in a new place by sep 1 and worry about clearing out everything in the pending months, 25+ years of crap in this place to storage up.
If the landlord isn't willing to discuss, talk about or negotiate based on your laptop claims, then yes, you'd need small claims court.
