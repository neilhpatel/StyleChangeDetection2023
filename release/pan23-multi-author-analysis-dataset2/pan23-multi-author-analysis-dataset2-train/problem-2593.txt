Ive had mixed results and this from others. I feel as though saying no is making us seem as though we are at fault for something. Although I totally agree. I'm interested in what they think will come of a mediator. I refuse to agree to anything outside of what is already a black and white law or HOA guideline.
Stop talking to them. If they sue you, get a lawyer. Otherwise you have nothing to say to them. No mediator. No discussion. No interactions. You have nothing to gain from playing their game.
That's even more telling. They are paying because they know that's the only way to get you in there to try to bully you. They have no standing. None. They are delusionally thinking they have some sort of rights over you. Block them and ignore them, just don't be loud after 11pm and the police will grow sick of their complaints.
If they don't? That's illegal. You can report them for harassment. I would. IMO opinion, tucking your tail would be playing along with their "come dance for me, puppet" approach to the neighborhood.
