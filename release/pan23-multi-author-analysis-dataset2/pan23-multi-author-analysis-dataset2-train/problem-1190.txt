Washinon and many Western allies say the Leopards - which Germany made in the thousands during the Cold War and exported to its allies - are the only suitable option available in big enough numbers.
A German government source said Berlin would lift its objections if Washinon sends its own Abrams tanks. U.S. officials say the Abrams, which runs on powerful turbine engines, uses too much fuel for Kyiv's strained logistics system to keep many of them supplied at the front.
An open secret of international relations is that the US is the bad cop for a lot of people's domestic affairs. Entire political parties are able to sustain themselves by publicly denouncing what the US does while maintaining the mutual benefits of military and economic cooperation. It's kinder, gentler posturing, but still populism for the "fuck the USA" crowd.
So the world doesn’t want the US involved the way we have been for more than a generation in world affairs. But at the same time they don’t want to manage and police their own back door… Got it..
The fact is, it's a mutually beneficial relationship of hard power for soft power. Germany is the damn king of conceding the shiniest rock so they can have two dimmer rocks of greater value, and a part of that has always been leveraged by their glacial speed and bureaucracy.
Scholtz is posturing to avoid action with a request that he knows is silly because he wants people to look at the US while he leverages something for German interests.
Welcome to international relations, where nobody has ever supported anybody because it was the morally good thing to do.
