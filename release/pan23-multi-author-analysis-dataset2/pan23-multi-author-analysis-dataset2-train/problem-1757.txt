The statute requires "A person who, in connection with his or her predecessors in interest, is in uninterrupted adverse possession of real estate for 20 years". Those "predecessors in interest" include previous owners.
Since Wisconsin requires, among other things, at least 20 years of occupation of another persons property for adverse possession I would suggest you remove the offending items from your neighbors property.
Would it make a difference if a previous owner had lived with it this way for 20+ years before us? Or does the 20 years only apply to us as the new owners.
I also just got all of the building permits and documents related to our home since the 70s from our city hall.
In one of them from 2003 she gave permission for the previous owner to build within a certain variance of her property line. It feels like now she's trying to go back on that.
Specifically the letter she sent says "the house at ___ is 2 foot 1 inch from the lot line. I am in total agreement with this, and don't mind that they build further on the south wall".
The owner was filing for a building permit variance to addon to the existing home which was built long before she lived nextdoor. The addition continued from the side of the house that's encroaching and followed the property line.
Move your things that can move. If the A/C unit is expensive to move, offer to rent that space from her. A rental agreement in place will remove her worry of adverse possession.
