At some point, there will likely be a warrant out for your brother's arrest (and possibly yours) depending on how the car is registered and insured ("ownership" is a murkier concept, so we'll stick to official gov't records for clarity). If you're the one who's arrested (likely incident to a traffic stop on an unrelated issue, but possibly just a cop running tags) your defense is going to need to be "that's my brother's car, he drives it exclusively, he's the man you want." Sadly, that defense isn't going to stop you from being arrested and processed, but it may keep you from having to pay fines in court or having your license suspended for unpaid tickets.
To protect yourself, you need to start papering the problem and keep your records. by that, i mean you should email/text/send certified letters to your brother telling him he needs to pay his tickets, that you're not the driver, that you're not responsible, etc. Hopefully, you'll get him to respond and admit the tickets are his, but even a lack of response can be used in some cases as an admission b/c the law can, in some circumstances, presume that someone accused of a crime (or some loathsome conduct) will deny it and silence may signal admission.
You wouldn't have to call the DMV in that circumstance; depending on the state, you'd fill out a form or hand in your plates, having signed the title over to him exclusively. Then he goes to the DMV and re-registers it in his own name, for which he'll probably need a bill of sale.
Also, keeping records of your comings/goings to match against tickets will also be helpful. For example, if there's a parking ticket issued in City A on 5/23 at 9 AM and you can prove that you were in City B at that time (receipts, photos, etc) then you can offer evidence that someone else drives that car and incurred the ticket.
