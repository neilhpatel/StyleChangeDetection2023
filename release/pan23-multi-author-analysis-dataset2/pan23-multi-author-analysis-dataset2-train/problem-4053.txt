A redditor recommended a cool app to me called TurnSignl that sounded kinda interesting. It's an app that allows you to immediately launch a live video chat with a lawyer if you're pulled over. The lawyer can give advice, act as a witness to the encounter and try to de-escalate the situation. I haven't tried it yet because it's not available in my state, but I might look into it for when I travel for work.
