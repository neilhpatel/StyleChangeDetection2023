There is a moratorium on evictions. You need to file paperwork with your landlord. Click on the "Declaration Form" in the Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions to Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19 link below and make sure you get it to your landlord.
According to the US Government, you are eligible for benefits (from your state and the US government).
The US has 50 different states, and they all have different laws. Its very possible that your state has an eviction moratorium that will kick in if you fill out a form saying you have a financial hardship. Give us your state, and someone will be able to help you with the policy in that state.
But if you had to decide? Try to keep your car. Or sell it to pay off the car and purchase a less expensive car, for cash.
Legally, neither event has an impact. It is not criminal to be evicted or have your car repossessed. They will have financial impacts, and impact your credit score. You might get more information on these effects at r/personalfinance.
