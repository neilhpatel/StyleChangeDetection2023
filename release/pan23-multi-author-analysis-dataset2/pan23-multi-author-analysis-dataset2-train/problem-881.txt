People like to use the threat of a civil suit when they have nothing left. I would suggest you mention to your contractor that they will need to follow required building codes and permits extra closely as to avoid any hiccups and delays.
Let them know to pull a permit early under the assumption that the neighbor may challenge it and cause delay.
Thank you, I will definitely warn the contractor, HOA, etc of all these issues when it’s time to proceed. I was honestly surprised to hear about this “spite fence” thing and especially that a plaintiff can try to recover loss in value to a home, which could be significant.
I would actually like to set up some cameras but I’ve heard that there could be an invasion of privacy if any part of the camera view is toward their window. Because they have no real backyard, any camera that monitors the boundary would realistically also be partially filming the back of their house as well.
You may also want to set up cameras around your property. It is possible he could attempt to sabotage things (move survey markers, damage property, etc).
Generally speaking this is not an issue, but always good to be careful. Perhaps mount the cameras up high and angled down to the property line might help avoid their Windows.
