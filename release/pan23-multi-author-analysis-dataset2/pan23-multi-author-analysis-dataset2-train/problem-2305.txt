It is entirely possible/likely that the address it’s being shipped to is just an unwitting mule address. You should report your credit-card as stolen to your bank and rotate your passwords at the very least. Reporting it to the shipping address’ local PD would probably be useful, but don’t expect to suddenly have the mastermind arrested or anything.
How does anyone benefit from a lawnmower being shipped to someone else's house? Im not sure I see the point of the theft if the person doing it doesn't get anything out of it.
Also, would you still consider my card stolen if the info isn't viewable on my Walmart account (just the last four digits)? It was saved which is how they bought the item.
The scam would be that it gets forwarded on to someone else, or resold on eBay or something and sent to an innocent buyer (probably more likely for a heavy object like this). The people doing that work are often themselves stuck in employment scams of their own, known as “reshipping” fraud.
Or it’s possible this was indeed an opportunistic idiot who shipped something to their own house! But I find it unlikely.
