I’m wholly against this child labor policy foisted by bought and paid for GQP republicans, it’s anti child and anti human. Accidents in the workplace will rise if these bills pass among many awful consequences. Their motives are not for their constituents and highly suspect across the board. They serve corporations not people, it’s obvious. That said, I started working at 14 as a cooler stocker/bottle boy when beverages came in returnable/reusable glass bottles. It was a very fun and eye opening experience for me as I saw a diverse array of customers from all walks of life and made money to spend on things like my bmx obsession. I don’t regret it.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
