You broke your wrist trying to hop a gate. There’s no harm in asking if their insurance will cover out of pocket medical costs but don’t expect it to go far.
The insurance company can do what they must, I'm not looking for thousands upon thousands of dollars im lower middle class so being out of work for a month or two literally means I lose my trailer. I make $800 every two weeks so the most I'd ask for is 2K for the two months I'm out of work, I know how to operate a gate I was a private contractor in HS Ffs. it was STUCK. calling would have done nothing as they were asleep and the ice didn't help my landing whatsoever. Also back to the calling did you miss the part in my post where I mentioned neither of us had our cellphone's? Or did read what you wanted to read.
If you didn't know how to operate it, you contact the host and ask. It doesn't sound anything about being dark or icy caused this. If you're going after lost wages expect the insurance company to look heavily into that part.
You said you felt they were negligent because they didn’t you a psa. You don’t need to attack me for responding to your point. How do you do that if you don’t request it? Again a stuck gate doesn’t mean the only safe method of entry was engaging in risky behavior like jumping a gate.
Was there a back door you could have used to resented the house? Were you or your friend impaired in any way? Was the gate defective or was it just stuck?
