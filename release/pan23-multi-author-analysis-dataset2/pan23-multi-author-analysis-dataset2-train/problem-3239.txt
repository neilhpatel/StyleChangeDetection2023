She can't "file charges" but she could report her suspicions to the police. They may or may not choose to investigate. If the police question you, you should decline to answer any questions without a lawyer. If you don't leave the gift there presumably wouldn't be a way to prove you did leave it, so you wouldn't be charged with violating the order. If you do end up being charged with violating the order say nothing to the police without a lawyer.
Also (for OP): disengage with this person. Why are you this knowledgeable about who will leave what gifts for her? The sooner you get her out of your head, the sooner you will be safe from her and her order.
Make sure you have one. Go for a hike or a drive and have your phone GPS tracking you all day. Take photos throughout the day with geotagging turned on.
You have a restraining order. It's your responsibility to separate your life from hers entirely and to move on. Stop obsessing about what she might do that you can't control. Be aware of what you do and how you might prove where you've been if you are questioned.
