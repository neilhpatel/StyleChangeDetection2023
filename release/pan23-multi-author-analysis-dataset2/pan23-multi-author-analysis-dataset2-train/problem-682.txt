We’ve come to the first Digest of November, and creep ever closer to the end of the year. Get comfortable because we’ve got a wealth of threads here for you to browse, and tons of really fantastic stuff.
Start off with our usual weekly features, and don’t forget to upvote and thank the people who put in so much hard work!
That wraps us up for the week. Enjoy all the good history and keep asking great questions. Keep it classy out there community folks, and I’ll see you next week!
The question about who ran the US before Washinon was basic enough for me to pen a 10th Grade High School sort of answer, and append a US History 101 sort of source. Not that this subreddit needs to have a "Explain History To Me Like I'm Five" section, but there are times when it doesn't seem as important to cite the latest scholarship as it does to point a possible autodidact towards a good general history to read.
Every week I like to identify some of "The Real Questions" of /r/AskHistorians Here, we honor the more atypical questions that get asked here: the bizarre, abnormal, strangely niche or oddly specific, interestingly worded or built on uncommon premises, or otherwise amusing questions that make me say, "Finally, someone is asking the real questions" We look at little-known customs, unexpected historical anecdotes, unusual cultural traits, and other more unique questions that go beyond the regular brand of sociopolitical history that this subreddit so fabulously covers.
