If your sister has been declared incompetent then there may be a legal process to having someone new designated to care for her. If she stays with your father because she needs someone to care for her but there is no legal designation then she may be free to relocate to your motherâ€™s house.
Obviously your parents might agree to her move from one house to the other even in the place of a legal designation.
The process for declaring an adult unable to manage their own affairs is a court process usually called guardianship. Your father would have had to go through this to get authority over your sister. If he didn't do this, then he is simply gaslighting all of you and possibly stealing your sister's disability benefits.
Try going to the website of the probate court in the county where your dad and sister live. If they have an online docket, look up your sister's name.
