And they are pretty cool. Hull of a speedboat, jetski engine, a few servos, a shit ton of explosives and a satellite antenna. They can probably make one for a few grand and with a good hit take out a multibillion dollar frigate or destroyer. It's gonna be a bad day if they send a few dozen into Sevastapol.
People always forget that the US economy is HUGE. A relative "small" amount of support economic wise still translates to large monetary value. By percent GDP, US lags behind 5 European countries (for obvious reasons, all 5 are next to Russia), and most European countries are close in percentage. Europe only seems small because support are geared more toward humanitarian and is split across twenty something countries.
If you were to read news from outside of America you would discover that plenty of countries are already supplying huge amounts of of both financial and military support.
By percentage of GDP, countries near Russia (Poland, Lativia, Estonia, Lithuania, Norway) provided more support.
Please note that the US economy is enormous, so despite that enormous dollar value, it's merely a small percentage of our economy.
Also forgetting that the US is an outlier in amount dedicated to defense. So a lot of random shit we gave Ukraine boils down to "random shit we have lying around against an enemy that happens to show up in Ukraine".
It would be nice if news could be more focused on just how small the amount US gave in comparison to the defense budget, or even a year in Iraq (hell, the amount we waste in Iraq is probably enough to transfer an entire regime of Abrams with all associated logistic support and fuel to Ukraine).
Yeah...HiMARS are no longer used by the US Army as a rule so we just had them laying about as the backup's backup. Turns out our early 00s tech works quite well in certain arenas.
