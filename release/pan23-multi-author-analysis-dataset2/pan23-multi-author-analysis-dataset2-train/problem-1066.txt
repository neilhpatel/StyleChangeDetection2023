So the only way in which you are even remotely connected this situation is that you happen to know the two people who are actually involved and have them added on discord?
And you think law enforcement is just going to run around "raiding" the homes of anyone who knows them? No. If you don't want to get involved, then just don't get involved. There's no reason for you to be.
If these are people who are causing problems that you don't want to be a part of, then just disengage. Un-add them or block them or whatever, don't talk to either of them about what's going on with their situation, and move on.
Just stay out of it. Stop talking to them. Stop talking about whatever it is they have going on. There is no reason for you to have anything to do with this. So just mind your business and stay away from it.
