That wasn't an error from the lab. That was an error by your doctor's office. What happened is the lab posted partial results, which they do all the time as tests take varying lenhs of time, and the physician didn't notice that one (or more) of the results had not posted. The list would look like this:
What long term health problems has it caused? They were out of testing kits, that’s an inventory issue. Not malpractice or negligence. The only thing they could have done differently was tell you only half of the tests were ran and you still would’ve needed to wait for the rest of the results.
did your partner test positive? the law doesn't deal with what if's. their testing didn't give you the sti so any problems that you have come from that would have happened anyway.
Your MD office just missed the blank spot. Labs run out of reagent or kits for various reasons and test results can be delayed, but here, it wasn't a matter of the lab messing up. The physician just told you that everything was clear prior to noticing there was a missing result. The lab would have communicated the positive in the chart immediately to the physician, and they contacted you right away.
