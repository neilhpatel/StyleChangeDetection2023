I just listened to a podcast about the recovery effort for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Of the $20Billion or so allocated to the funding, only 2% has been spent in the past five years. Some changes need to be made to speed recovery efforts.

Not as much for local elections since like everyone is “catholic” but once you start pushing stuff against their beliefs you will lose a lot of them…. Enough that it will be a purple state.
They’re partially right. A big chunk of those aid packages are usually funds to replenish American stocks. They have to be replaced from somewhere if they’re not already being retired. We also do send them cash to buy their own equipment with and keep their government running. We even directly pay the salaries of critical workers like nurses and emergency responders.
IMO the bottom line is you’re not going to be able to get nearly the bipartisan support for giving PR extra help as Ukraine. A lot of the Republican base thinks of PR as a shit hole country, and not just the MAGA ones. Ukraine is an easy sell to Americans though, and the important politicians see huge strategic value is an economically/militarily friendly Ukraine.
