This section explicitly prohibits requiring tenants to provide for utilities to a common area unless several very specific issues are met. I'd be surprised if the landlord met those requirements.
You should collect as many old leases and utility bills as you can and make copies to take with you to the lawyer. If you have time, I suggest making two folders - a small one for the first meeting, with a recent example or two of each for easy access, and a big one with everything in it that you can hand over right away if they decide to take the case.
Write down what the utility technician did and said, and anything else you can remember while it's still recent, in case you need to refer to it later. The lawyer may be able to help you get more notes about the visit from the company later, but it doesn't hurt to have your own.
I would also gather photographs of the gas connections from your apartment to the laundry room (if they are visible) and the surrounding area. Print a copy to show the lawyer and save a digital copy in a secure location - preferably two copies in different locations!
Since you've already decided to see a lawyer we can't really second guess their instructions, since they'll be able to tell what's going on much better than we can. I certainly wouldn't talk to the landlord about this until your lawyer says you should, since you say he's not very friendly.
No one has mentioned this but take pictures with the gas plumbing if you can before anything gets changed. Also ask negibors with similar sized apartments for copies of the gas bill for the past 3months.
