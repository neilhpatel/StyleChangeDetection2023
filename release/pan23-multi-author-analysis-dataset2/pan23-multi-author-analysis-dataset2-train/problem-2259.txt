Yes, used. Should that matter? Transmissions should last WAY longer than this. Like 100-200,000 miles. Mine lasted maybe 5k.
At this point I'd take the old one back... It did the same thing. I'll take a look and see if I have a warranty.
Plus whatever it did in the last car. $1k is just enough for installation. This transmission wouldn’t have been reconditioned or rebuilt in any way at all.
Yes, but people dont shop there for used transmissions. They shop for used functional transmissions. Why would I have purchased the transmission if I had known it could only last 5k miles? The car wouldn't have been worth it.
Like I get what you are saying from a legal standpoint... But how do they function as a business? This seems unethical. If I had known the condition of the transmission, I would've never bought it.
That’s the only standpoint that matters in the context of this sub. But from a practical standpoint, you bought what you bought. Which in this instance was a total crapshoot.
Again, I doubt that just from the numbers here. But in any case, you have the warranty you have. If there’s no warranty left you’re probably without any real recourse.
If you only paid about $1k, it sounds like it was an as-is junkyard transmission. You'd have to check your repair order to see if there was any sort of warranty.
Yeah might make things more difficult but it is still an avenue worth exploring. There is no way to fix these issues and installing a new transmission will only buy more time.
