The first thing I'd be looking for is what, if any, doctors have deemed in lieu of his mental state and second, any living wills/advance directives that exist, in case he IS mentally incompetent, who he picked.
The lawyers said that your grandfather could move of his own volition, and he did. Of course you're worried about your mom, but it sounds like she followed the court order properly. She should talk with her lawyer to confirm, but don't panic just yet.
/r/HolUp there...you don't need a court order to become PoA or sell a house. You're saying that in March 2021, the uncle's NJ lawsuit went from "letter of intent to sue" to "judicial decision" (or perhaps a preliminary injunction) in a matter of weeks? And your lawyers interpreted this series of events as "everything is fine"?
There's some part of the story getting lost in translation here. Either you need to listen more closely to your existing legal team and let them worry about NJ nonsense. Or if you think they're at fault, you need to hire another lawyer and give them the real, complete details (including court paperwork that's too fact-intense to post on Reddit).
