I highly doubt it, but does your lease state anything specifically about the carpet when moving out?
I don't think they can force you to pay for a carpet cleaning service, but thoroughly cleaning them might not be a bad idea. You're required to return the apartment in the same condition you received it in, less normal wear and tear. As long as the carpets aren't damaged or dirty when your lease ends, they can't charge you for it.
Take detailed photos/video when moving out, and be prepared to fight your landlord on this. After you move out, your landlord has 45 days to either return your deposit or send you an itemized list of charges.
So technically there is one spot above where we signed in the condition of premises section that states “actual charge to have carpet professionally cleaned by X Company unless tenant provides paid receipt from X Company”.
What you can do is get quotes from other cleaning companies, and compare them to how much you will get charged from Company X. If its more then 10% off, you can complain to the LL that you are being cheated.
