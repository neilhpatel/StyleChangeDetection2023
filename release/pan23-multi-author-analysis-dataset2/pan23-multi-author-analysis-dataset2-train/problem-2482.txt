Until I met some people who are really good with languages but still struggled with Turkish names, I didn't realize how hard it is to pronounce ğ, ü in words if they aren't in your language's phoneme. I just tell people to write AJ at Starbucks now.
I know some people purposely mispronounce last names if they don’t sound “American” enough as a passive aggressive insult. Remember that scene from Godfather 2 where the politician mispronounced “Corleone” at the wedding speech but then in private with Michael he says it perfectly? That scene was subtle, but right on the nose.
Pretty sure the average American (I’m one myself so I can say this .) couldn’t point to Turkey on a map. As far as racism in America goes, I think Arabs and Pakistanis have it the worst in terms of Muslim minority populations, thanks to 9/11 of course. Turks don’t look/sound that much like either of them—if anything, they might get mistaken for being Greek.
Dont take that serious - just a lousy try to change the focus from turkeys economy crash Erdogan needs all lousy actions if he wants to win in summer election.
