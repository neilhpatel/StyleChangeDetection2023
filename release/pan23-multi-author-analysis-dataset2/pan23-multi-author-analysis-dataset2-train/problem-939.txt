That the Democratic Party is a broad party running a gamut of political opinions doesn't invalidate that in the least. Neither AOC nor Manchin are relevant to that point.
Eric Adams and Joe Manchin are also registered Democrats. Kyrsten Sinema was when she was elected. Maybe Savage actually favors liberal or progressive policies (or even mainstream Democratic policies), but the party he registered in is not sufficient to prove that.
That he is registered as a Democrat is evidence of his politics. It neither means nor must mean it proves what they are.
No, it really doesn't. There are conservative Democrats, even in California. I'm not saying Savage is. I'm just saying that the fact that he is a registered Democrat is not enough, on its own, to say anything about what he stands for. Again...Eric Adams, Kyrsten Sinema, Joe Manchin.
