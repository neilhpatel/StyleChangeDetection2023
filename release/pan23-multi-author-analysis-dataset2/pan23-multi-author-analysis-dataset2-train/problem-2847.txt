Reddit has the redditcaresresources bot, and I'd argue 75% of use of it is people using the "Get them help" button on a user's profile as the "Fuck you!" button.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
If you read the article, it's a bot that responds to user searches to supply helpful links. It's not a reporting function like Reddit has (which I also have been on the receiving end like you have).
I've gotten at least 12 different DM's from that bot because a user reported my profile over an argument or my post was reported for suicidal content despite being completely unrelated to suicide or depression. They only chose that option because it alerts the report-ee that their post was reported.
