So how could the Biden admin "stonewall" the Senate Intelligence Committee from gaining access to documents that they no longer possess?
Biden's attorneys turned over all the classified docs they found to the DOJ. And, as far as we know, the FBI seized all of the classified docs that Trump had been hoarding at Mar a Lago.

In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Therefore, if Senate Intelligence wants access to those documents, they should probably reach out to DOJ directly.
And moreover, since these classified documents are the subject of an active DOJ investigation, why would the Biden admin fuck around with leaking evidence to the Senate and risk obstructing DOJ's investigation?
Sure it's understandable that Senate Intelligence is angry about this and wants to exercise oversight, but if I were Biden I'd keep my mouth shut and hand the phone to Merrick Garland.
Biden should aboslutely not be cooperating with right wing traitors, slavers, misogynists, neo soviets or other assorted enemies of the American people under the sign of the R. conservatives are enemies of the American people.
