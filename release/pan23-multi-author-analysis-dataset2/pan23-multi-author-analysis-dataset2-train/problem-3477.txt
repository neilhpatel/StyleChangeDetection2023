So your grand stand of "I don't just give this out to anyone" may have the end result of keeping your brother from getting the job, and causing the background investigator to spend forty seconds doing research in a computer database and then filling it in himself.
If your brother was answering an add on craigslist for a remote-work admin assistant, I'd agree that you shouldn't give it out. But this is a background check for a federal position of trust- not remotely the same thing.
The people asking this are the government. They already have your social security number, because they assigned it to you.
If they want it, they'll get it with or without you and your position seems a little extreme on this one, IMHO.
Thanks for your comment I also figured if they wanted it they would have no problem getting it, which is why I was a little confused they asked for it in the first place. I also do agree that it’s not some Craigslist BS or something, it’s a federal prison job- and I appreciate your input and opinion.
To save themselves time and work and money and hassle. And (perhaps) to gauge the applicant's ability to provide accurate and necessary information. But really just because it's easier if everyone lists everything, and if the applicant "forgets" someone, then why was that person omitted, etc.
