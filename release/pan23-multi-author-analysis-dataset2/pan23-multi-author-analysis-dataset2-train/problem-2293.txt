Assuming you are eligible to claim the child, print your complete and correct return, make copies of everything, and file it by mail. Be absolutely sure the return is signed and dated, and you use sufficient postage.
Yes, you'll have to allow a minimum of six weeks to receive your refund, and probably longer due to ongoing IRS backlog issues.
Yes, your ex is going to get their (probably excessive) refund, which they will promptly blow on hats.
So, your ex will get substantially the same notice. If they choose to not amend, IRS may audit one or both returns and then you'll be asked to prove your eligibility. If your ex can't provide proof, they will have to repay that sweet sweet refund (previously blown on hats) plus interest, possible penalties, and possible sanctions for claiming certain credits on future returns.
I'm assuming it's a reference to the scene in the spoof "Hot Shots" where Charlie Sheen's character gives his savings for the last 10 years to the widow of the man whose death he caused.
She accepts it and tells him that with the 3 million she just won on the lottery, she can take his $2500 and blow it all on hats.
Edit: OP's girlfriend's situation will not change should her ex have refrained from blowing it all on hats...
