I visit r/NewIran frequently, and while the global media declared the protests as stopped, they never actually did.
Ohio is another thing like the balloon that the news can scare our parents and grandparents with and chum the political waters.
Sadly, the average person just doesn't give a shit if it can't be framed into something directly affecting them. And since it's not Iran Nuclear Deal related, it can't be turned into another us vs. them political food fight. All the right-wing boomers I've met only seem to care about Ukraine insofar as it affects them directly, like with their favorite foods. Everything they say is so absurdly myopic - "just make a peace deal, Biden is hurr durr playing politics something something approval ratings and nuclear war mongeringurr durr...".
Yes, because appeasement will work with a tyrant like Putin. Surely he'll just give up all his imperial ambitions and never invade Ukraine or Georgia or anyone else again after being rewarded for this war. Surely it wouldn't send the message that nuclear countries can freely invade their neighbors and eat them alive. Surely that wouldn't encourage nuclear proliferation! God damn are these people reckless and myopic.
They know! Iâ€™m Iranian born but was lucky enough that my parents immigrated to Canada when I was younger.
I think it's safe to assume that the CIA, MI5, and Mossad are present in Iran, I wonder what they're up to? As much as I'd love to see regime change it would be counter-productive to stage another coup directly. Iranians need to claim this win themselves in order for it to be legitimate. But they could really use some help, and I really wish The West could give a lot more attention to it, and whatever support is right for the circumstances. The US and Iran had a great relationship up until the British convinced us to stage the coup, and I'd love for that to be restored along with the Democracy they once had.
