Ok, I understand that it's not truly possible to nail down a time period, but I'm guessing that based on the back log (which was supposedly around 150k cases as of late last year), and the normal processing times during normal circumstances, that it won't likely be for quite a while, right?
I say, you have until the end of the yearâ€”at lease, just speculating based on timing and the currnet laws AND we'll still have some COVID restrictions for sure.
The time to process non-payment eviction cases through housing court is gonna be long & tedious. Tenants probably won't be allowed to go through the process without representation so... they'll need housing attorneys to review the paperwork and set-up/review stips. The backlog will be crazy. And what about tenants who've abandoned their apts without eviction or notifying the ll, they'll need to be some formal process for that too. Can't have a ll double renting an apt or tossing belongings left behind (outta pure frustration by this time)...I SEE MESSY PEOPLE.
Just because you can get away within paying your rent, still doesn't mean you won't be responsible for what you owe. You'll see more money judgements for back rent and legal fees in NYC in 2022...be prepared for that fallout on credit reports/tenant reports (unless there are laws enacted against it).
As for the rest: would it make sense to send in my COVID hardship document now, and then when they contact me, let them know that I'll be leaving within the year anyway? My thinking is that if they know that I'm leaving, they may be less inclined to even bother pursuing action.
With respect to judgments, can you give me a basic idea of how that works? What means would they have to actually collect it? Would a judgment be determined in a housing court or civil? And if I'm out before I even make a court appearance (and obviously still show up for any dates), is there any action to take?
