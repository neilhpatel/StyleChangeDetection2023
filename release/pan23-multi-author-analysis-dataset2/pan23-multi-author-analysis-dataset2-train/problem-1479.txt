If you were refunded in excess of what it should've been and you agree that you were refunded in excess, then they are certainly entitled to it. However, if you disagree, they can certainly sue you and have a Judge decide.
However it seems the consensus is that if they overpaid they are entitled to it back, fair enough. I will go find an accountant to take a peek at this sheet to sanity check, and will get them their money back assuming the accountant concurs they have double paid. Drat.
I don't know. They sent me a copy of my move out statement with one line highlighted, however I am not qualified to speak to the legitimacy of this claim. I have been paying whatever shows up on my account, trusting them to be honest in their dealings. However having been moved out for 2 months I had assumed our interactions were at a close, hence my displeasure at them resurfacing asking for more money.
You aren't actually saying whether they credited you too much or not, so it kinda sounds like they refunded you too much and you don't want to admit it.
