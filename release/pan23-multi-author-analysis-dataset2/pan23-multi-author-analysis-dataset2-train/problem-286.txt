Long time ago there was a ground launcher for BGM-109 Tomahawk called Gryphon. They were removed from service due to a treaty.
Not really that long ago, the BGM-109 was retired due to the INF, and only carried a nuclear payload. All units were destroyed besides some displace pieces which were rendered inoperable. Ukraine's AGM-88s are believed to be fired in "pre-briefed" mode, the aircraft has no integration other than the ability to launch the weapon. Intelligence determines where to launch the missile, the aircraft flies to that position and releases the weapon. If the AGM-88 gets a track it flies towards it, if the radar that is tracked turns off, the AGM-88 loses track. If no track is found the AGM-88 eventually crashes. It's not exactly ideal.
Weapons get procured after they're ready, so they operate and function hopefully as intended. After a entire logistics chain is established to develop maintenance procedures and spares, after people are trained to perform such procedures. The Army MRC program budget request for 2023 was 400 million dollars USD for just RDT&E, no production units. This isn't a fuck it lets send one and see what happens program.
