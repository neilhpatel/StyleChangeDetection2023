probably the most serious issue is that if he's not an approved driver and there is damage to the vehicle, any insurance you paid for will not cover the car unless you yourself turn it in.
If he has insurance on his own, and verifies that the rental car is covered by his policy even if he's not an approved driver, then that's not an issue.
If he takes off with the car, then the rental company will have to go after you for damages, because he has no contract with them. he can't commit breach of contract against them -- but you have done so simply by letting him drive. They don't have privity with him so they can't generally go after him to recover the car. If he disappears, you'll owe them the cost of the car.
But if there's no damage to the car and it passes their drop-off inspection, i can't see them refusing to accept its return. I suppose they could, but that would probably require specific contract language that you can't have an agent drop the car off on your behalf.
Insurance would be the only real serious issue. Rental car companies aren’t dumb, they know that many times other people drive a car not on the agreement.
Personally I’ve never had to do anything but drop off the keys at hand off and occasionally waited for the inspection. Many places are just drive and drop off, leave keys in there.
