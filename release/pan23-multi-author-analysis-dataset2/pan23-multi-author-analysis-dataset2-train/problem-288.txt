Like, De Santis is a cringey typical Republican toolbag that's super cool with eliminating human rights for a spot at the big boy's table, but it's scary how calm and collected he is about doing so.
A big appeal for Trump was that he was big-league business daddy. Decades of PR telling people how rich and successful he is, convincing rubes he'd be a great president. He was a political outsider, someone who they thought would shake up the status quo.
DeSantis straight up mimics Trump's mannerisms, hoping to catch the undiscerning eye of the American rube. But there's no argument to be made of him being a political outsider, that he's rich so he must be smart. We have his record, we know how he governs.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Also Trump we super vague about what he would do, or how he would do it. Even his gobbledygook answers were vague enough that like any good conman you would hear and see what you wanted and you would sell yourself on the con.
DeSantis both lacks the mystery of what kind of political leader he'd be, and the entrenched PR of what a big-league business Daddy he is.
All this being said, the rubes are quite willing to simply lie to themselves about who or what DeSantis is.
I feel like if De Santis got into office, we would have 75% less social media b.s. to worry about, with same level of villainy.
