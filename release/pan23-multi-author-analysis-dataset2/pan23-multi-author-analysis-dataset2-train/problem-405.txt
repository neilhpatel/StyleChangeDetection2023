In the thread, as one would expect in a history sub, most answers are highly critical of GGS. I've actually read GGS and I've probably read most of the GGS critiques on places like Reddit, and I will say that historians and anthropologists are right about GGS getting many details about history and anthropology wrong. So, eviscerate it and extract out whatever is wrong from the contents of GGS.
But I think GGS still has something that remains to its argument even after that. When the critics try to roll their arguments up to discredit GGS's main thesis, I think they are not being fair. GGS's main thesis is about Eurasia and continental axes, not local histories, not even at the subcontinent level. So in the thread, I made a point that OP's question, which used examples about North and South Korea and intra-African geography, was not applying GGS correctly. I made comments in a few locations in the thread, all of them non-top-level comments and all of them relevant to whom I was replying to, making this point. But my comments were removed and I was shadowbanned. To be fair, the moderation didn't remove every single comment that was against the tide - there were 2 other commenters who were questioning the points that were criticizing GGS. But I suppose mine was the most "annoying" to deal with because I was making a sweeping point about GGS and OP's question whereas the other two were asking about specific points that could be specifically answered.
Seeing my grandpa and was goin to an AMA with him, figured I would give others the chance to participate. He was 11th division Airborne paratrooper in Pacific Asia- Japan, Philippines, New Guinea.
