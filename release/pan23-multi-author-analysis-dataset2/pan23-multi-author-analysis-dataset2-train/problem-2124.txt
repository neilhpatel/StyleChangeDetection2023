Any assets that were jointly owned or that had a death beneficiary do not go through probate and the rule you are referring to will not apply to. Same goes for life insurance.
So probably anything of value will go to the minor child or be sold to provide for the minor child. But you can probably get the guardian and court to agree to things of sentimental value going to other people. The land will definitely be included in this, if you want the land and it isn't jointly owned then your only option would be to buy it at fair market value or at auction.
But it looks like anything that goes to probate will end up with at least 40k in money and/or property and if the estate is worth less then they just get the whole estate. This is unless the minor child's guardian and the court agree to waive this rule.
The land will follow the way the deed is written. It is possible that his portion would be party of the estate, but likely will just go to the sisters.
All of the final bills of the deceased, including funeral expenses, income tax, property tax?, etc, would still be paid from the estate prior to the minor child inheriting, correct? What other expenses would legitimately be paid by the estate?
To my knowledge, which is general, yes, all debts and expenses are paid first, and only if there's assets remaining in the estate does anyone get a payout.
