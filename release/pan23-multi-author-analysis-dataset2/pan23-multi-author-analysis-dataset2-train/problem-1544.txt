The whole purpose of hiring a lawyer is for them to advise you on the appropriate course of action. This could include the appointment of a guardian ad litem, having the therapist present their notes in court and court ordered counselling. I'm not sure what sort of perspectives you're looking for nor what you mean that the father is guaranteed 23% custody by law.
Me either really that's just what I was told, that they won't give him less than 23% parenting time. I haven't officially hired anyone yet because I'm not feeling like any of them are at all hopeful of a good outcome. It's just a lot of hum and hawing. Guardian ad litem though? Is this something I should make sure to have?
I am currently consulting with a few. Just want more perspectives. I'm not entirely sure what route to take, OFP didn't work, custody change will still give him 23% by law, and CPS has bigger fish to fry.
If multiple attorneys are dismissive of your chances of securing a change in custody, then the situation is far more complicated than what you've shared here. If you truly believe that every visit with her father places your daughter at risk and causes psychological harm, you need to hire an attorney immediately. More information about GALs can be found .
