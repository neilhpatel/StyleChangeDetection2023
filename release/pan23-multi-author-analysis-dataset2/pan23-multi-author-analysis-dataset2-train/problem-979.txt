If you children are truly in danger you need to call CPS. But it sounds like what you need is a family law attorney, asap. If she will let you see the kids at her father's only, so be it. She doesn't have to let you see the kids unless a court orders her to. (Nor would you, if you had run off with them, but considering what you're already facing, don't even think about doing that now.).
I do not want to get CPS involved and traumatize my children. At this point I am taking things slowly, but I want to know what my legal options are to see my kids.
Because she is their legal parent. You could take them somewhere she doesn't approve of, and vice versa.
She has no right to these. The BC is just a copy of the original which is held by the state, so that's not that big of a deal. The naturalization docs are probably strictly yours. Contact the local police non-emergency line and ask for a civil standby.
In regards to the emergency custody order, if I pursue this and it is approved...does this support my chance of custody in the case of divorce?
