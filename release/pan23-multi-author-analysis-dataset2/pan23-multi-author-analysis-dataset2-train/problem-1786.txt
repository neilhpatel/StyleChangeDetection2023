While more can always be said, I do have some discussion of this when I wrote about "The American Way" in regards to Superman last year:
Note that absolute self-sufficiency is _not_ quite the same thing -- there is still the sense of helping community in individualism, it is just cojoined with a freedom to choose.
Is it then fair to say that the idea of the lone sheep farmer or bushman carving out a life for himself in a savage "terra nullius" is absent in American self-identity? I'd have thought the western frontier would have had an impact on American ideology, especially since Western films seem to focus on the cowboy or ranger as a masculine lone wolf in a similar vein to Mulgan's Johnson or the bushranger.
Western films: not as much as you might think? You might like even though Pravda called it a "glorification of the individual".
Even Shane, one of the most prototypical lone gunslingers of the Hollywood Westerns, teams up with Joe Starrett.
The Man With No Name, who you might be thinking of, was actually based on Japanese samurai -- the first movie (A Fistful of Dollars) was adapted off of Yojimbo and there was a lawsuit due to it.
