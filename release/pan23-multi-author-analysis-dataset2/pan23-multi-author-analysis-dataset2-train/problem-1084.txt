not even including the wounded, its mind blowing that a modern country is losing so many people every day. The US army trains 50-60k soldiers a year. Last year they fell short of their goals at 45k trainees. If ukraines numbers are accurate enough, Russia has had a KIA equal to 3x the annual US army training for 2022. 9x losses if you include a 2 to 1 wounded to kill ratio.
More fun math. Russia has a population of 143 mil last year compared to the US population of 332 mil. So to put the Russian losses into a US perspective that would be 2.32x US soldiers for every Russian.
So that would be like the US having 311,000 dead soldiers in one year of fighting or close to 1 million dead and wounded after a year of fighting with almost nothing to show for it.
No wonder Russia is having to snatch people off the streets and you know they are not getting even close to adequate training.
Russia, as part of a "3-day operation" has a higher casualty rate than the US had in world war 2 and that is not counting for a drastically smaller military.
In 3 years 8 months of fighting in WW2 the US military lost around 405,000 men, but that was from a military exceeding 16,000,000 personnel by the end of the war.
