If the prosecutor has offered a non-reportable charge, there would be nothing to expunge. Usually this type of charge is dismissed when you plead guilty to the original violation.
Thanks for the response, so should i just take the deal and pay the court fee and small amount of citation. Which is non-reporting and is not going to to add points to my driving records. But my concern is more about the arrest. Just to make it clear again do i have to plea guilty to original violation and don’t take the offer or take the offer?
Without knowing the details of the offer, which you want confirmed so it isn't changed at the last minute, I can't say.
Are they agreeing to drop the charge you were arrested under and just have you plead to the original traffic violation? That will add points to your driving record but is better than doing jail time and a misdemeanor criminal record for obstruction or whatever they arrested you under.
Talk to a Legal Aid attorney to make sure you are agreeing to the lowest possible charge and that it does not include a criminal conviction.
No we agreed on failure to maintain lane which is just traffic offense is not a misdemeanor or felony. And they are not going to report it to DMV. But I don’t know what will happened with my arrest record.
That was the question. So they are dropping the obstruction charge, which is what you were arrested for, and only having you plead to the traffic violation, correct?
If that is the case, then take the deal. I'm not sure how they will not have this hit DMV unless they record it as a non-moving violation.
Based on what you have said, just pay the fine and then this is in the past. Just make sure the failure to maintain traffic lane is either listed as no report or is logged as a non-moving violation. Otherwise it still might hit DMV.
