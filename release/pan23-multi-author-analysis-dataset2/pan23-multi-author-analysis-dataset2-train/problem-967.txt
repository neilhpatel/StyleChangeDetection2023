Doubtful. Putin would be milking it for all itâ€™s worth domestically and using it as an excuse to crack down even harder on dissent or purging people all the more quickly. His lack of reaction indicates that none of this is supposed to be surprising: everyone knows by implication exactly why she died and who did it.
The sinister side of me thinks every officials are trying to book a below 4 story room and they figure they are fired when no room lower than the 13th floor can be booked.
Nah, the sketchy ones here are hanging yourself in your jail cell while on suicide watch, with 3 broken security cameras, guards asleep at their station, and your cell mate being moved to a new cell the day before.
When they make a movie about this period in Russian history, it's going to be really boring when they do the Godfather/Goodfellas/Sopranos style scene when Putin's taking out all his enemies. It'll be an hour straight of people getting thrown from windows. By the end of it, the guys who did the first throwing will have also been thrown out and the people who did that will have been thrown out too.
