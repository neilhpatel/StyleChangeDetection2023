Pigs are not smarter than humans, if they were they'd put two and two together over the course of generations on a farm and not be led idly to slaughter.
As for pigs treating us as equals, that's true, but not how the sentence implies. Pigs will devour anything defenseless thing that falls into their pen, humans included.
You may be thinking of a boar: a fierce, notoriously deadly animal which domesticated pigs can become if outside of captivity for more than two weeks.
The transformation works both ways: confine a boar, even one born in the wild for long enough and it loses its hair and won't regrow its tusks if they break.
But the willingness to consume anything that won't fight back didn't start when the hog became a boar. It's built in to every last domestic pig.
When people praise pigs it's usually their domesticated brethren getting the love. But I will say massive boars are wicked looking.
Color me shocked a documented intelligent wild animal, in the wild, aggressively subdues perceived threats quickly.
