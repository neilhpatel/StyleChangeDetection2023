I asked the moderator why I was banned and was told "show me evidence that Trump was tried and convicted of a crime.".
That sub is its own world. I got banned for asking how Trump could become MORE popular with his voters after stealing government documents, the exact thing he accused Hillary of (pretty much).
Then the mod pointed to a "no liberal talking points" rule and muted me from replying to him further.
I then said "Ok, my bad. I will be sure to report anyone who also says Joe Biden is a criminal without posting evidence of a trial and conviction.".
