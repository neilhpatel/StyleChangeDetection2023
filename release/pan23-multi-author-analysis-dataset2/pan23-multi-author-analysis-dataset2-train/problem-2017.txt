That's why they took the west indies and Philippines after pearl harbor. That's where their oil supply was going to come from. And in the process of taking those, damages an aircraft carrier that was resurrected in 3 days then be ready for the battle of Midway. Truly a remarkable story in history.
One thing the Ukraine war has made apparent is just which sides different countries would take during a world war. The US really needs to think about how itâ€™s trade policies are funding the military strenh of, what we now know to be, enemies.
If I recall correctly the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour believing that the US (a spiritually/militarily inferior country) would cave, sign a peace treaty and leave them to their devices.
I wonder whether China has fallen into same delusion having observed US divisive/corrosive politics for many years e.g. Marjorie Greene (WTF) etc. I believe the recent balloon incident was a test of American resolve. "Hey, you're not so tough. I wonder what else we can get away with?".
