The lawyer is requesting you to waive your right to service of citation. A service of citation is a requirement that states that when the lawyer files with the court that he has to inform all relevant parties.
I recommend you retain your own lawyer, because whatever you may or do think: Your Stepmother's lawyer does not have your best interests in mind. At all. Do not sign anything they present you with until you have your own lawyer advising you.
Do not sign it, it won't help you at all. They're essentially asking you if you wanted to be kept in the blind.
Thank you for the clear and helpful advice. I will be hiring a lawyer of my own to cover my ass. In your opinion is this standard practice to have 1 party sign this or does it seem shady?
I slightly disagree with the above commenter. NAL but I am a paralegal and I’ve been doing probate for 10+ years in MA.
That said, based on your stepmothers comments you should retain your own counsel before signing anything. Your attorney can advise you on whether it is advisable to sign the document or not (usually there is still a way to proceed it just takes longer).
Without getting really in to it this is very common in MA where heirs will file a waiver and appointment of personal representative to speed the process of filing along because typically it allows the court to simply appoint the PR (executor it many states). It only waives service of the petition other documents still have to be served on all parties.
However, given the current situation, I'd wager that OP wouldn't actually want to speed up the process as to allow themself the time to seek legal counsel for themselves.
As I said, I’m not familiar with the jurisdiction, in my neck of the woods it’s typical to waive even if people disagree just so someone gets appointed (and not waiving takes a LOT longer usually). That’s why I agreed with your point to hire a lawyer and added to defer to them on whether it made sense to sign the document.
