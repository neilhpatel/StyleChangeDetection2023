I mean, if you're on someone's property without their permission, whatever they do to you is on you.
Just like the laws protect squatters, they also protect those who blow away unwanted guests on their property.

Normally when we think of stalking, we think of unwanted and unwarranted attention. I don’t dispute here the attention is unwanted... but it’s not unwarranted, unjustified. It’s unlikely, for example, that in these circumstances a court would order him to stop contacting you.
But you are intentionally using the existing legal framework dishonestly, so perhaps he intends to do the same. Maybe he’s thinking he can shoot you and claim self-defense, for instance, even when he wasn’t actually fearful for his life.
Maybe he got that idea from your success in perverting the legal system to your advantage. That would certainly make your corpse ironic, eh?
