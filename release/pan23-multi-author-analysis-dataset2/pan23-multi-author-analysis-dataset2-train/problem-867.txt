If he is not on the home title and they were not married, then you need a probate attorney. He has to be evicted like any other tenant. He gets proper written notice to vacate. But someone needs to be named executor first in order to have the ability to do an that.
The homeowner or lessee will need to give the ex bf proper written notice as required to end their tenancy. In Michigan this is usually 30 days. If he will not leave willingly at that point the owner or lessee will need to pursue eviction through the courts.
Enter the house, and collect their documents if you haven't already; birth certs, tax numbers, etc. Anything that would allow the ex to open credit cards in their name. Freeze their credit scores.
One month, not 30 days. If the Notice to Quit is sent by mail it it needs to be one month plus one day. This is important because the tenant requires proper notice to engage the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. You cannot cure an insufficient notice by waiting until it would've been valid to file your lawsuit, the notice must provide enough time on its face.
Finally, go with a witness to the house, as a witness in case you see.... dodgy dealing occuring whilst you are there.
Take anything of value to the children, that could be pawned for drug money. Get a lawyer to find what you can't take from the house, as I'd say the ex is still there as it's providing him cashflow for his drugs.
Telling the utility companies that the person who lived there is now deceased (is; turn it off, as no-one will pay for it). The reason you talk to the lawyer about this is that it may be seen as an illegal eviction of the ex who lives there.
