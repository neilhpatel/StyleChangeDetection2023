Landlord here. I had a tenant do this with me many many years ago back in 2002 or 2003. He told me what is happening and I then took him off the lease through an addendum. He then moved out and she became delinquent and I ended up evicting her. Once she was evicted without ruining his rental history, I then rented it back to him. I did this because my girlfriend cheated on me and I felt for the guy. Speak to your landlord and see what you could do.
I have heard of this happening where the landlord filled the vacancy left by divorcing spouse with another person (a bad tenant to encourage the cheater to leave). Depending on the style of rental and room space you could exit forfeiting very little and she will just have to accept a new roommate. Your landlord may also have other properties you could be moved to, without breaking a lease.
File for divorce if that's what you'd like to do. You should be speaking with a divorce attorney ASAP. Roughly how long were you married for and do you have any kids?
Barring unique circumstances you're looking at a fairly straight forward divorce. You don't want to delay because there is a risk that she'll get pregnant (and then you would need to disestablish paternity).
