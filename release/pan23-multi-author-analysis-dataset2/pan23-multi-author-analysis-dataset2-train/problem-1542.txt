I used “bigoted” to cover his racism, Islamophobia, homophobia so, of course, he would say that about Steele. They’re definitely mentally ill but that’s no excuse for being shitty people. Lots of people are struggling with mental illness who are decent.
Very. He’s known to be a lying, cynical, hypocritical Christofascist. Everything he does is greedy, hateful, bigoted and intolerant. He ticks every box in the ‘conservative’ checklist. He was a staunch defender of trump during his corrupt term in the White House.
He also shit all over Michael Steele and said he only had the job because he was black. Michael astrele was pissed because he thought they were actually friends.
They make all these random accusations about rape and grooming because they are the rapists, and they are the groomers. Immediately view them as such, lol.
