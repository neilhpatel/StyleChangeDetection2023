This one is, partly, rather simple. Hat pins were quite long- four inches or more, which is why they could feature as murder weapons in mysteries ( though, I don't know what specific mystery featured one). Until bobbed hair became a fashion in the 1920's, women's hair was left long. Girls could leave it down, but older women put it up into a bun, and that was what the hat pin impaled to keep the hat on the head.
The only way I can imagine a rubber band being effective is if it was applied around the crown. That might work for a soft felt hat, but it seems as though it would quickly mangle a straw one, so there's perhaps another angle we can't see.
A rubber band would have been attached to the hat (or bonnet) on either side of the crown and run under the chin, where we might normally expect to see ties, or under the back of the hair, as Miss Cornelia is described as doing in the book. But I have to say that it's a perplexing thing for her to say as it was never commonly done by women in the nineteenth century - literally the only references I can find to it are a couple of patents that may never have been acted on.

That bun would go up into the hat, also. The pin was enough: driven through the hat, into the bun, and out the other side. More than one, if it was windy.
