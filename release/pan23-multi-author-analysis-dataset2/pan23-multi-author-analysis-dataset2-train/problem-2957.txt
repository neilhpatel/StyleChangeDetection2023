Edit: judging how I'm getting down voted for this comment, I can tell I've ruffled some feathers of people that would rather stick their heads in the sand.
I'm seeing a lot of people posting about the democratic party donations from FTX. Just wanted to bring to light that this isn't just a one sided company that was donating to a single party.
Ryan Salame, co-CEO of FTX was a massive republican donor too. He gave $24m to Republicans this midterm cycle alone.
r/conservative won't let me post this after I tried to mention this to a few people. Guess they only care about being partisans about this issue. They're having a hay day over Sam donating to dems when they don't even know the full story.
