What puzzles me is the utter lack of mainstream reporting of the missing $30billion disater tax, the recorded comments of Erdogan praising his efforts to bypass building regs for earthquake resistant buildings. Its already yesturday's news.
Turikye isn't a country that has engendered much Western media sympathy, which is what really drives the news cycles.
If this had happened to a "friendlier" country with a president that wasn't a complete and total Mini-Putin, maybe we would "care" for longer.
They'll report that Erdogan said these things but there isn't a strong western media presence in Turkiye to drive any sort of hard narrative that will be widely disseminated. Consequence of the entire country reaping what it sows, just like here in America with the train derailment and the news of lessening safety regulations.
The people of E. Palestine, OH certainly voted for the R's in government, the same ones who want to always remove regulations and make it easier for rich people to become richer. Now their town is ruined, and ultimately, only have themselves to blame for it.
