The issue will eventually compound itself. If some space debris collides with a satellite, it trips it into a million pieces, and eventually one of those pieces hits something else, and it compounds into a huge problem for anything or anyone in orbit.
A big factor in so-called Kessler Syndrome actually happening is the altitude that satellites orbit at. Most people think that as you go up that air just stops existing, but in reality the Earth's atmosphere extends out several hundred miles. It's obviously mostly just independently orbiting molecules of various gases at that point, but those molecules are still common enough that they actually create drag for satellites. The ISS famously requires periodic reboosting because that drag drops its orbital altitude surprisingly quickly. In fact, one little-known thing about ISS is they rotate their solar panels to "surf" the atmosphere to reduce how quickly they drop.
Anyway, these lower orbits are referred to as "self-cleaning" because satellites and debris in these orbits don't last long relatively speaking. SpaceX chose these low orbits in part due to the fact they're self-cleaning, for instance, and their satellites require constant thrusting from built-in engines in order to maintain orbit. Any of them that fail come down by themselves within a few years or less, and at EOL the remainder are brought down under thrust in weeks or months at most. If there's a collision at these altitudes the debris shares the same fate, so over time there can't actually be a Kessler Syndrome at these altitudes.
