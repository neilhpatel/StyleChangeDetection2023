Depends on his location, Country, state, etc. And if he has kids from that marriage and/or another marriage. Where is he? Also the money that goes through probate will go to taxes before people.
The biggest advantage is that it can waive probate bond requirements and make estate administration far, far easier.
For the retirement accounts: There's a difference between a beneficiary getting the money in the account (pay on death), and getting the account itself (transfer to new owner). For something like an IRA, there could be a BIG tax difference.
It's hard to convince an older person to make a will (I should know, I am one). What would happen if mother dies first? But he does have a point. The state has a default one-size-fits-all "will" for people without a valid will. It does involve a few extra steps after he dies, but they're not too hard. For example, the estate representative has to give the court a list of heirs (mother), and maybe the next lower contingent heirs (his children, usually).
Does he have any children not in common with your mother? As an aside, being behind on a residential tax bill is super bad. The property can be foreclosed on if the delinquency gets far enough or the tax bill can be sold for a high interest at an auction. Unless he's trying to prove a point through nonpayment, catching up makes a LOT of sense.
