A technical debate may decide whether more than 40 million Americans receive up to $20,000 in student-loan debt relief.
>“The states’ more extravagant theories are emblematic of the broader trend where states are taking advantage of vague language in Massachusetts v. EPA, to challenge any federal action with which they disagree,” Bray and Baude write. “Unless this Court wishes to sit in constant judgment of every major executive action ― which is not its constitutional role ― it is time to say ‘stop.’”.
Actually, this random politician redditor (lol) thinks you should hold out hope. This plan for cancelation does not release the demographic of people the refinance industry needs and wants to remain in debt- there is still soooo much profit to be made for private businesses and the government. It’s not like this stops the cycle of more people going out and getting a liberal arts degree for 20k a year at 18. It doesn’t fix the problem- which I think they will like. And if they want to install a dictator in 2024 the best thing to rule would be to NOT screw with any supposed executive power. This all predicates on the fact that they believe/want this upcoming election to be actual voting and that they don’t literally plan on another Jan 6th again either way, though. I dunno the more I think about it, it could go either way. If they want trump to be our overlord it may make more sense to say the presidents word is god and then just have him do something worse to people with student loans when he takes office.
