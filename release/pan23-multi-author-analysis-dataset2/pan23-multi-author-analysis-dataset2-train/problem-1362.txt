So far, nobody beats Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) when it comes to fictitious resumes. He seems to have lied about virtually his entire life experience — from his volleyball career to his college education to his mother’s death on 9/11 to his family’s flight from the Holocaust. He appears to have played fast and loose with finances as well. He now faces criminal inquiries about whether he conducted scams (even one about service dogs!) and misrepresented information on his campaign disclosure forms. (Santos, though he has admitted to fabricating his background, has consistently denied claims of wrongdoing.).
