An employer is free to choose who they will employee, except if the employer is basing the decision on a characteristic prohibited by law (race, age over 40, disability, etc.). So, I don't think you would have much luck unless you had evidence of some sort demonstrating illegal discriminatory intent on the part of a potential employer. This is especially true in a subjective area like opera singing.
also, as an autistic person, autism doesn't impact your appearance like you claimed in your post. autistic people look just like everyone else in terms of the wide variety of human physical appearance. you might be better served by working with a career/skills coach who can help you identify any deficits in your auditions, whether being autistic is part of those or not.
Unfortunately evidence of discrimination at the hiring stage may be difficult or impossible to get. If it exists, it's generally either a specific statement (e.g., the person hiring says "we don't hire people with autism") or a pattern or practice with discriminatory effect (e.g., on average company hires 5% of those who apply; 1,000 people with autism applied, but zero were hired). Unless you're privy to some information that could demonstrate that kind of discriminatory intent, your chances of success on a claim would be low.
