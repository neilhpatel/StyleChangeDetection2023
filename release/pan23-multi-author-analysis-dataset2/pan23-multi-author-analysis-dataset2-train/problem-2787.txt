This could be anything from a mundane-but-important procedural update on your case to news of a warrant. You won't know until you've spoken to your lawyer. Call your lawyer back. If it's urgent, he'll return your call urgently.
In general, your lawyer isn't going to leave confidential information on your voicemail. There are too many ways that could exceed their duty of confidentiality or harm your interests. Instead, they'll either relay it to you directly, on the phone or in person, or keep it around and give it to you the next time they see you, depending on how urgent it is.
if there were a warrant out for your arrest, a competent attorney would leave a voicemail telling you to call him immediately because he had urgent news. he wouldn't simply say he wants to give you a heads up about something.
