It might just be a clerical error - someone noticed that you said you were leaving early, so they sent you the standard "you owe us for another month" letter without realizing that you had paid everything.
Since you've paid the lease in full I don't see how they have grounds for charging a fine or additional rent. You fulfilled the fixed term lease, gave at least 1 month's notice you were not renewing, and returned the keys before the due date. Since your lease is for 14 months, they needed to give you 60 days notice of changes to renewal, but I believe CA only requires that you give THEM 30 days notice. It sounds like you did that.
I am kind of confused, let me know if I have this correct. You paid for the full time on your lease, but you aren’t physically there and turned in your keys a month early?
Probably best to give them a call to make sure you both agree on what has happened before you launch the lawyers to fight about remedies.
What happens if you tell them to just give you back the keys, and you’ll turn them in when they want you to?
If the time is paid for, I don’t understand why it matters whether or not they are in the possession of the keys. Do they have any kind of an explanation as to why this is a problem?
Also, remmber that they are required to return your deposit within a limited time after you move out. have they done that? Did they give you an accounting statemnt for your deposit?
