I'm not sure if that is true in Canada, but what I do know is that they're not at all about freedom from oppression at all.
Here in the states if you follow the money funding these kinds of right wing 'protests' you're usually led to China or Russia. Sure it's very similar up north.
I don’t get it. No one is being forced to mask anymore unless they choose too. They’re literally just being whiny little pussys for no reason other than just to be whiny little Pussys.
And the only relevance their lives have had since high school. Of course they're going to cling to it as long as they can. It's all they have before they realize how truly insignificant and powerless they are without their blockade.
So basically: all of these people are lunatics who aren't actually fighting for freedom from oppression at all.
Assuming you're not Canadian or from Ontario, these exact same people were cheering when Doug Ford, (premier of Ontario), abused his powers to force people who were legally striking to not only go back to work, but removing their legal charter rights to protest in the process.
