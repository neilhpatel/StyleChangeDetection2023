Even if you had a copy of the “clean” Carfax, that doesn’t necessarily establish a problem. Obviously it would be possible that the accident informations as reported to Carfax after your purchase. And that’s not as uncommon as you expect when you consider that may people sell a car immediately following an accident.
If you could prove some sort of fraud in the sale here, that might be significant. It doesn’t sound like you’re very close to doing that.
I guess to me it seems like a sale under false pretenses? I would have never bought the vehicle if it had a reported accident on its record during the purchase. I am unsure of the legality behind that though.
If you can establish that there were false pretenses that may be important. But that means proving they provided a Carfax with bad info (sounds like you can’t) and proving that it wasn’t the ordinary Carfax didn’t know but something deliberate by the seller (that seems nearly impossible).
They’re not going to claim they “didn’t know.” They’re going to correctly say they didn’t represent anything about the car but that the Carfax didn’t list any problems. Which was true.
Yeah the last part of your comment is more-so what I'm asking. I signed a "clean" carfax during the purchase of the vehicle, so I am actively working on getting a copy of that without sounding the alarms yet. But even if i do get that, can the dealership just claim "oh we didn't know there was a pending accident, yet to be updated on the carfax" ??
