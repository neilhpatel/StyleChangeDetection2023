Most people in Serbia just want to get on with a normal life, but like most countries these days, the political narrative is dominated by a loud and aggressive minority of nationalist cunts.
EU wants peace between Serbia and Kosovo, but Russia wants turmoil in the Balkans. History is just repeating itself....
I would look at the polling coming out of Serbia around this situation. It's obvious the right wing in that country has put a lot of Serbs on the nationalist side.
Indeed, the media and the church have enormous influence in that direction. I haven't been there since before the migrant crisis and I imagine that might have contributed to a shift further to the right also. Very dissapointing to see how easily the right is able to manipulate people, in every country, especially when the economy is unstable. Fascism has been on the rise for years now everywhere and it looks like there's no sign of it abating.
The ruined German economy after WW1 played a big role in nationalist movements promising a better life now itâ€™s about killing pretty much from the outset.
