Sounds like you may have a valid usury claim, and also a consumer fraud act claim by extension (treble damages and attorney fee shifting). Look for a consumer fraud act lawyer in NJ.
Sounds like you just need to refinance with another bank. But legally, in New Jersey, it is considered criminal usury if a lender charges an interest rate of 30% or more to an individual, or 50% or more on an entity (a corporation, limited liability corporation, etc.). In addition to paying a fine, the lender may only recover the loan principal, and forfeits the right to interest on the loan.
BUT all of this means nothing if you signed an agreement at the time of sale to accept that interest rate. Also, exceptions to this are “Loan for over $50,000; savings and loans; banks; Department of Housing and Urban Affairs and other organizations authorized by the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970; state or federal government or quasi-governmental organizations (§31:1-1)”.
