China and India gave zero fucks about the sanctions for the unjust war, but this would be a step beyond. And still accompanied by zero fucks I am sure.
Of course they don't give any fucks. Most countries are sympathetic to Ukraine, but think this is a local issue and not a global one. Why would they harm themselves to support the West, especially after the US have been directly involved in plenty of unjust and illegal conflicts around the world over the past 70 years: Vietnam, Iraq, Panama, Grenada.
The US is on the moral side of this conflict, but claiming the moral high ground rings hollow when the US frequently is on the wrong side of the scale.
Yep, and we are in the decline and fall, but I don't see how this is a response to what I said beyond "those with power do whatever they want" which is a given. China has been in the driver's seat for some time and have clearly given up on their soft power campaign.
The Belt and Road initiative are going strong. They've been investing hundreds of billions of dollars in developing Africa, Asia, and Latin America. They created a development bank, and have been giving a shit ton of grants and interest free loans around the world.
The reason why only about a dozen countries have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan is due to the effectiveness of Chinese soft power.
I suppose they have given up pretending they don't do what the fuck they want to the casual observer (me), but yea I know they have been pouring money into Africa among other places. It is optimistic to think that will pay dividends before everything goes to hell, but they are also working on claiming the moon so they are hedging all around haha.
