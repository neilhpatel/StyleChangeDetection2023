So in short there is no way to get a hearing for me to speak my opinion? I just can't find a way to believe that is true, cause if so there are countless occasions that a minor could be getting abused, sexually exploited, etc., and not being able to speak out about it. Also, I edited the post saying that it is taking place in Washinon and Ontario.
I will not go into personal specifics of why I would like to in an online environment with strangers being able to invade my privacy. As a revision, I mean that I will not say the specifics online but I would be going into them with the judge preferably in a private hearing.
If you have a court hearing, it's very likely to be public. That's how court hearings work. And it's also very likely to be in person. Because that's ALSO how court hearings work.
The specific rules will vary by state and county, so no one can really answer this except the court clerk where you are.
Thank you for informing me that I forgot to mention that I'm also comfortable with speaking in a public hearing, I must have phrased it wrong. I also do know that court hearings are in person.
