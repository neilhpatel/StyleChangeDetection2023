Your post is getting downvoted because people seem to be allergic for personal injury cases where you arguably "knew what you were getting into". From what you described, though, it sounds like you may well have a case. Liability waivers are not insurmountable obstacles and it sounds like the park may have been negligent in setting up the foam pit in that manner. Whether you will be successful is extremely fact-specific and evaluating the same would take a lot of digging. However, your injuries are significant enough that you should have absolutely no trouble finding a personal injury attorney to take your case. Just make sure you do your homework and find someone who will actually put in work. I encourage you to pursue this, it seems like the premises should bear some responsibility for your injury.
Yes, waivers may offer them some protection, but do not grant them immunity in cases of gross negligence. You should consult a personal injury attorney and discuss your situation with them, and they will let you know if the believe you have a case worth pursuing. Your state bar association should offer a directory or referral service.
