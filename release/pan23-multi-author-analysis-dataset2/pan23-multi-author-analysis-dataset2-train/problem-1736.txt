The funny thing is jews aren't supposed to go there ðŸ¤£ since the temple was destroyed jews are considered not pure currently to go there so if any religious jew insists on going it's only because they want to instigate.
Like everything in Judaism, two Jews three opinions. It very much depends on who you ask. It's not as black and white as you claim. Certain areas certainly are off limits, but not the whole area.
Sure they're are many opinions just like if you look you can find someone that says you can drive during the shabith.
While you can find some rabbis who will tell you that you can drive on shabbat (electric cars are a whole other story though and are MUCH better by Jewish law) you're not going to find any big rabbis saying this. Compare this to rabbis who say you can go up to the temple mount. And here is the list I just took from Wikipedia(sorry for the Hebrew):
So the same for this area.. The mainstream is that you're not allowed to go there since jews aren't "holy" right now (lqck if a better word) and the only reason for someone to visit is provocation but hey who cares right? I mean worst case scenario it will lead to a terror attack and people will die but At least we can die saying we went and visited so it was worth it.
Either way i hope if this leqds to violence in the end of the day the people that felt the need to go to the temple will be happy with their decision.. I mean it's not like ben gvir is going to suffer the consequences he's covered by guards 24/7.
