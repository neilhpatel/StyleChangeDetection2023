They shouldn't, but some people probably have phones and devices they also personal and business use. This is probably mostly not with direct government employees, but contractors. The company I work for has a very lenient phone policy and allows work phones to be used for personal use. I noped out of that one. I'll pay for my own phone so if something happens I can just walk away. My work and personal communications are separate. I've had to wipe to many company phones and search them for company information to take that risk. Also, if you have a company phone please be sure you aren't recording while walking around naked in a hotel room in front of a mirror. That's an image I will never get out of my head.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

That is true, but it's hilarious to me that whenever this is mentioned, no one ever mentions that the single person controlling Twitter also happens to be the single person most compromised by the Chinese government. And that leverage only continues to grow as his wealth shrinks.
