I'm somewhat unclear on what it is he's doing, but in general, you can't copyright a practical device, only an "original work of authorship." If something is eligible for copyright protection, it is automatically protected as soon as it is fixed in a tangible form. He can register his copyright through the copyright office, but if the designs are eligible for protection, each would need to be copyrighted individually. Registration gets you some extra rights when you sue for damages, such as the right to statutory damages and attorney fees. You can sue without registration if you have actual damages.
If you wanted to look for a lawyer, it would be an intellectual property lawyer. They can tell you if the item your father is making is something that is subject to copyright protection. They tend to be pricey and generally work in large firms or boutiques that practice only in that area.
The designs are unique and technical, more an invention than art. Would a patent be the better option? If so would that be something that legal counsel could help with? Sorry weâ€™re so ignorant on the subject, I appreciate the responses!
You don't copyright objects, only writing and art. Are the camera covers artistic in some way? The designs would be covered by copyright, not the covers themselves.
