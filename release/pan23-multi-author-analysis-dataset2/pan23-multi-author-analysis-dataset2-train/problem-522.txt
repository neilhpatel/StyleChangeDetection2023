There are at least two governments, if not up to six, that could and would be banning vasectomies and making castration illegal except for capital punishment, but the countries in question would not be germane to the current conversation.
I expect the unwanted born children will also experience high levels of suicide. That said, I think Republicans are okay with this so long as they get enough poor and uneducated people out of the deal.
I think they're more interested in a Stepford Wives scenerio. They believe it'd be much easier to 'keep the peace' when others can't exercise their right to protest their decisions.
DeWine isn't even the worst GOP governor we could have and he still needs to be fucking gone, along with the rest of the GOP.
Sadly a trip through the countryside and the merest glance at any billboards here looks like a murderous cult in a rural town with idyllic farm scenery.
Still, as soon as the GOP decides the number of vasectomies is outsized to their actual voters, they'll start going after doctors in roving RVs doing the procedure in conservative states. The first time the Highway Patrol runs one of those doctors and parades him in the conservative media as committing malpractice is when that shit is threatened even in blue states.
