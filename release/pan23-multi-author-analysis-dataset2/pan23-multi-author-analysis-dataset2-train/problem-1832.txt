I am an able bodied working person who can drive, I have absolutely no “real” reason why I can’t go to the polls on Election Day, but fuck me sideways if I ever do, I have done it several times and it is an unpleasant experience, long queues, crap weather, people handing out a landfills worth of political propaganda, randos giving their views no one asking for, one year the guy in front of me stunk so bad of stale urine I nearly vomited. I have voted by mail for the last couple of years and will continue to do so, voting is a right and honestly if you don’t vote I feel you have no right to complain about the state of the country you chose not to partake in. I have never missed an election since I was able to vote. Mail voting allows everyone vote to be counted no excuses.
