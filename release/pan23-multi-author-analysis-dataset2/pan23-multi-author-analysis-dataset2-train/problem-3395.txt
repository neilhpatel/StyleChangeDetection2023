If you were paid for 8 hours on a day where you only worked 5.5 hours, that's generally slightly more than the law requires.
This is because in the private sector, there's really no such thing as "holidays." Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, July 4th -- those are all days no different than any other regular workday, and how the employer chooses to handle work and pay and PTO on those days is really up to the employer.
Are you saying that your employer deducted 8 hours from your bank of accrued PTO on a day where you worked 5.5 hours? Can you explain succinctly your employer's PTO accrual and use policy? Assuming USA, in what state did this occur?
So the current policy is they give us 56 PTO hours a year to be used on holidays. But it's stored in the same bank as accrued PTO. So I had 94 hours of PTO, had to use 16 hours for Thanksgiving/Black Friday, and now I'm at 78.
I get it. You worked on a day that you we’re getting paid for anyway (paid holiday) but, legally, there’s nothing to be done.
If the company forced me to use PTO, they can they force me to come in? I'm supposed to be available to come in anytime, but I never get paid for being on call or coming in after hours.
