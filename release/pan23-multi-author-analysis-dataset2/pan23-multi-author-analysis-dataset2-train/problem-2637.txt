Apparently it's what they do in every store, and it's how their system is. I sent a text message today to the district manager who hired me saying I was uncomfortable doing it, and I won't. He hasn't replied.
Do NOT use the last four of your social. Even the SSA states: "The SSN is the single most widely used record identifier for both government and the private sector, exerting a broad influence on the lives of most Americans. However, by itself, it is not a personal identifier because it lacks systematic assignment to every person and the means to authenticate a person's identity.".
At that point, the ball is in their court. It would be great if you could get one or more co-workers to side with you on this and approach management as a group. You always have more power as a group.
Well if you're dead set on not using your social security number, then I would approach management and say something like this...
I am not comfortable giving out part of my social security number. I'm willing to consider other options to meet the company's needs, but I am not comfortable using my social security number. What can we do to move past this?
