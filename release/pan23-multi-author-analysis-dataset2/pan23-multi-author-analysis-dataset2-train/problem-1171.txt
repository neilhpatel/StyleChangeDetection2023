Countries are willing to donate the f-16 because they have orders lined up for the f35. I believe the Netherlands was one of the first international countries to get the f35. US arms manufacturers love this war.
They'd have to get permission from the US first as well (which they may well get, but that would be a pre-requisite).
The F-16 is one of the most widely exported fighter jets out of the USA. It has an extremely long history of operation and training foreign crews on the airframe. Additionally, for a fighter jet, is relatively easy to learn to operate. Someone who already knows how to operate a fighter jet of any kind should be able to transition with ease and expediency.
One of the biggest advantages is there exists a massive pool of potential contractors (retired air force personnel) from western countries that Ukraine could recruit to do servicing and maintenance on the ground. This removes the second largest roadblock to fielding western aircraft (political will obviously being the greater problem).
It would require some political will to make happen though, as countries would need to give said retired personnel permission.
