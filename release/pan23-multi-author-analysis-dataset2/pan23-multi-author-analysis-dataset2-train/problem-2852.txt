we havent, my husband has thought maybe we should, I would be the one doing it as my husband is usually out at work all night and while im working at home and then trying to sleep its very bad. My husband thinks it may be a good idea to call but at the same time we feel like police dont care and would worry about more important things. . So we are kinda lost.
Had something similar many years ago. Except it wasn't the guys fault above us. The floor literally creaked and squeaked everytime he stepped. I could even watch the ceiling moved as he walked above. He happened to be a huge seahawk football player and the apartment was just built like crap.
You can call the police for noise complaints.Your lanDlord is actually doing more than most do with offering you a different apartment. The thing is, in apartment living if the building isnâ€™t insulated enough you will hear your neighbors. Having carpeting and rugs can help some.
Apartment "tried" to fix it but there was nothing they could do. I told them due to the warranty of habitability we were breaking the lease and did not expect to be charged any penalties. They released us from the lease.
