I've investigated over 100 equivocal deaths to include over 15 homicides. We typically do not take body temps. Sometimes the coroners will. There are just too many factors that effect it's reliability, body mass and composition, state of dress or undress, ambient temp, humidity, proximity to air vents or fans that cause air to move over the body etc etc. There are multiple other metabolic changes that occur post mortem as well as physical and digital evidence that can be used to determine time of death.
At the end of the day establishing a time of death is always helpful but it is part art and part science and utilizing a body temp is just not very accurate.
Although, I can understand bodies found with obvious wounds but for someone with no visible wounds, marks, or assumed cause/s of death, it seems that this information could provide for a better investigation. Taking temperature, with all factors known, could give a better understanding during investigation. If temperature is taken at the morgue, this could prove very little information as the body was moved, transferred, and now in a much colder/hotter area.
It just seems logical, to me, to gather as much evidence as possible at the scene of a crime or death, despite that evidence being useful or not. As the old saying goes, Iâ€™d rather have a fire extinguisher and not need it, than need a fire extinguisher and not have it.
I hope you and your family get the answers you seek and can have some closure. Sometimes the question can be worse than the answer. Remain patient as you work through the process and best wishes to you.
