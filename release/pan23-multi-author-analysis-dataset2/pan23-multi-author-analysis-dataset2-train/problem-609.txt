You have an agreement with the buyer to pay the delivery fee. It's not a bad idea to inform the seller about the situation (which you've either done or have tried to do) in hopes the buyer and seller and can quickly resolve their apparent dispute so that the buyer will then willingly pay you, but their dispute doesn't legally impact the buyer's agreement to pay you. Consider sending a letter to the buyer saying that you're sorry to hear that they may have a dispute with the seller and you hope that they are able to resolve it, but the dispute doesn't involve you and you are requesting payment for the delivery per the agreement the buyer has with you. If that and any follow-up attempts you make aren't successful you can file a claim in small claims court.
I would have refused the delivery then. If you already gave them the goods you may be SOL. In the future, try getting your payments up front. Companies like UPS don't ship things to you prior to paying the shipping fee.
It also sounds like maybe the buyer and seller made the agreement to not pay you. Either way, keep trying to contact the seller. Good luck to you.
