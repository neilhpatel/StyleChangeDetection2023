I see so many documents from the past (with beautiful penmanship btw), and their lines are never crooked.
On the other hand, if I try to write something on printer paper, I find it tough to not let my sentences sag.
Nearly all surviving documents from the Middle Ages are written on parchment, which is sheepskin that has been stretched out and cut into square sheets. When a manuscript was in production, sheets would be cut that were often larger than the manuscript was going to be. In the extended margin, the scribe might make marks as to where their text should start and finish, where illustrations were going to go, and other details. It is not unusual at all to see ruling on medieval manuscripts that are unfinished, and occasionally manuscripts that were. This was often done with pigments that were easy to remove later, or by actually scratching a line into the parchment. One method of creating ruling was to place pin pricks in the parchment a set distance apart based on the desired size of the text. Some kind of straight edge was then used to connect the distance between them. The extra edges would later be cut away when the whole book was put together.
Medieval scribes, who were usually monks, were also remarkably skilled and likely spent hours upon hours of their lives copying texts. So a fair amount of practice and experience went into things as well.
