Ukraine will never invade Russia. They would absolutely get nuked in that situation, and the West would have a hard time justifying a hard response, since Russia would be hitting their own globally accepted territory.
And just about that entire 'lost half of the Soviet population' is actively donating to buy Ukraine anything from care packages to bullet-resistant vests to cutting edge drone weapon systems.
And I wish we would supply them the same way we supplied the Soviets. That's what they need. All this spoon feeding seems ridiculous, But what do I know? In the end, I'm grateful all of our countries are providing support.
Apt observation, very true. Key difference this time around though is that those German tanks are gonna be blitzkrieging you to protect freedom, democracy and the rule of law, because this time you're the Hitler.
It's a lot easier with German tanks, but Poland has Abrams and mechanics that are probably VERY good at their jobs and will almost certainly be earning their pay training Ukrainian techs.
The US should be outfitting Poland with everything we can since they're probably going to be Russia's next target if Ukraine falls.
