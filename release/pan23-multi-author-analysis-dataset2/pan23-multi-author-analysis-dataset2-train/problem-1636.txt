Being commander-in-chief in war is hard enough and Zelensky is simultaneously trying to root out corruption.
I think he will be remembered as one of the greatest in annal of history if he can continue and succeed in defending his homeland from Putin's grab for more territories.
It's hard to defend and retake your sovereign territory when you have people at the highest level ready to sell out to a neighbouring dictator.
Like, its rarely from politicians that you hear "we should improve society somewhat". Its usually about them sniffing glue and being actively harmful shitbags.
Im pretty sure that this isn't about corruption. That is the least of their worries rn. Probably just weeding out evey suspected anti war people or other risk factors.
It also goes without saying THEY ARE AT WAR. The Russian's have collaborators at the highest level, top level diplomats and politicians have already been outsted at traitors for directly supporting the Russian's invasion from Ukrainian territory.
Ukraine is openly in the process of joining the EU, and after the war, NATO. There are things internally that need to change to make that happen.
It feels so refreshing to hear positive progress. Theres lot of activism to reduce corruption but you rarely hear a head of state being like "yeah, we are cleaning up house and trying to do better".
he has some issues with corruption, like he's not 100% clean, but i bet thats what was needed from him to arrive where he is now.
Theres also a push from Ukraine's allies to clean up house. Accountability for the weapon, training and intel, and conditions to join the EU and such.
So it is in their best interest right now to be actually serious about corruption. Maybe thats a work in progress which will be slightly biased, but in the end it will still be a cleanup and improvement.
