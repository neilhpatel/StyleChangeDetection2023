If a person with a disability needs to use an assistance animal, he or she must first make the request to his or her housing provider or housing board. (May be your fuck up to move the animal in before permitted.) The housing provider may not ask for access to medical records or unreasonably delay the request. (Unspecified time, but months have been found unreasonable.) Conditions and restrictions that housing providers apply to pets may not be applied to assistance animals. For example, while housing providers may require applicants or residents to pay a pet deposit, they may not require applicants and residents to pay a deposit for an assistance animal. While a landlord may be able to recoup reasonable fees for damage done after the fact by the tenant and his or her emotional support animal, an initial security deposit may go against the purpose of the Fair Housing Act.
Your landlord can request an additional deposit or charge for damages upon move out, but cannot charge pet feeâ€™s. A refundable deposit is not a fee, a non-refundable deposit is a fee.
