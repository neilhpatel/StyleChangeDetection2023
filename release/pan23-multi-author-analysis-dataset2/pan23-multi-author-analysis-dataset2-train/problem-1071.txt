I think Reddit is grossly misunderstanding how that conversation plays to the conservative audience. To a conservative audience Pete is saying a natural defense but one that is intrinsically different in values than their own. They are not going to deeply consider Pete’s question, even if the host did answer, it would only call into question the hosts values. The people consuming this crap are just looking for Queues on who is a good guy who is a bad guy. Who is in the tribe. They’re less curious than you can imagine except you probably can imagine through countless conversations with them. If they were ever to cede ground in an individual discussion they would forget to have that ever reflect in their values. The most important thing to them is their tribe and Pete’s views, your views, are direct threats to that. The best thing a clip like this does is play to both sides. The problem the left has is the right acts in bad faith and should not be engaged with, yet there’s no other avenue of reaching the right.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
