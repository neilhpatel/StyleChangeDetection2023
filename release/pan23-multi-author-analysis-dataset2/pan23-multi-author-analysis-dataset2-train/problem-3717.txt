Krasovsky,the dude who talked about drowning Ukrainian babies was one of the first gays to publicly come out in times when Russia was pretty conservative(in that regard anyway) even in the big cities,and obv in the media. Also, before talking about drowning Ukrainian children he talked about similar stuff about Ukrainians in general, which got no big reaction from his audience.
Just a friendly reminder that the first book burnings in Nazi Germany were of an institution that led the way in LGBTQIA+ research, specifically Trans research.
I wonder what my childhood might've been like if that knowledge hadn't been burnt to the ground, and had instead become widespread...
He'd probably just getting replaced by someone doing the exact same shit. Russia will always be the same until the Russian culture, which isn't likely any time soon.
Yeah it's super depressing. We lost so much knowledge because of the Nazis, knowledge that could have saved countless trans and queer lives. And that's not even getting into how many queer people the Nazis — followed by the Allies who let us continue to rot in the camps — murdered directly.
