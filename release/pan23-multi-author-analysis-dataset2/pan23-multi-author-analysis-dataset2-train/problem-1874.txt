if we're critiquing john kelly, i don't have much to say about his staying or leaving trump's employ because i don't know what is reasons were, i see both sides. But once he was gone, he could have been more vocal as to what was going on and warning the citizenry. While he was in the White House he was an enabler to much of trump's incendiary blather. He liked to pull out his military credentials and go on at lenh about honor and his pity for civilians who never got to serve their country and so forth. He betrayed the country by shutting up for so long. Coward.
