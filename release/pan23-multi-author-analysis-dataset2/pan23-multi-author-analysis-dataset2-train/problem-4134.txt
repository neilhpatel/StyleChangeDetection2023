Yes, this is precisely what you should be looking for. In the transaction the Title company generally certifies that the home is free and clear of any liens or debts. So they should have documentation from the HOA that you don't owe them anything.
Not entirely sure, but if you can find and link the documentation concerning “any and all” fees at the time of sale and verify that they cashed the check, you could be in the clear.
I’ve seen situations where cashed checks referring to “all debts paid in full” was an acceptance on their part (specially for an HOA) and their case was thrown out.
As part of a sale, the HOA has to provide an estoppel letter (that you usually pay for) that states what is due (Title Company should have a copy if you don't), which is binding. Anything found afterwards is their issue and should be written off.
Do seek more information. Do consult a lawyer before responding, or if served with a lawsuit. Do call the title insurance company and let them know about an alleged outstanding lein on the property. HOA's interact with the property, not individuals.
