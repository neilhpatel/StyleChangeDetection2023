In short: yes, it appears you can ask for verification. You can also propose that the employee substitute other like shifts instead, such as a Saturday instead of a Sunday, or a Sunday evening instead of a morning. It also seems that you're only required to offer a single solution to the requested religious exception, and should the employee refuse it than no further accommodation for this type of request is necessary. You would however, need to keep notes of all this as this absolutely could be questioned in a case of some sort.
Another thing to note is that, should this employee continue to be a thorn in everyone's side, Georga is an at-will state.
The fire at will state is an argument that I just made to the owners of the business, but their concern is that she will then file for unemployment, though I believe she's currently paying back and unemployment claim that she falsely made against her previous employment, and that she could also try to claim wrongful termination. Honestly I'm pretty pissed off that we didn't fire her before now because she's been nothing but a headache and literally every single other employee that spends any time working for the company, makes complaints about the way she speaks to people and her attitude. Tomorrow she's getting a write-up for a particularly nasty interaction with another co-worker and it's going to be written up as her final warning and that any other confrontation with her co-workers will result in her immediate termination. Everyone else get the long fantastic, works together, helps each other, it's all around a really good environment except for this one poisonous thorn in our side.
