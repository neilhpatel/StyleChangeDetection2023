It's not, but you also generally can't just individually remove yourself from the lease and let the roommate continue it alone without the landlord's permission. You can only unilaterally terminate the shared lease.
If you terminate the month-to-month lease, it's over. If the landlord wants to continue renting to the roommate, they can start a new lease. If they don't want to do that, roommate has to move out. They are implicitly correct in that they aren't obligated to keep the roommate on a new lease if you end the current one.
That is all assuming you are jointly on the lease, and the lease does not provide for any way to release only one cotenant (most don't for this reason).
To add to what the other user said, if you did just leave and your roommate stayed behind without landlord approving and signing a new lease, then the old lease would still be active.
You would be equally liable for the rent and damages as the roommate while the roommate is there alone, and the landlord would eventually evict everyone on the old lease, which means you get an eviction on your record too.
