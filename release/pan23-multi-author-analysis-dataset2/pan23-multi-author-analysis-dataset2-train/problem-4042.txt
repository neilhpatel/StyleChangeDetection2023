It's especially annoying because in the most recent cases I've seen this (3 within the past year, all related to hockey oddly enough), all the authors are well-versed in the sport (one was an autobiography, albeit ghostwritten, but a long-term executive; there were date errors with things he himself had done), so should have no excuse for making these types of mistakes.
I finished a book related to hockey recently, and I want to say it's really frustrating when you read multiple factual errors in the writing. These are things I find just casually going through the book, I wasn't looking for them, so they should have been caught while editing, and I find it really unprofessional. It's also not the first time this has happened, and if they are things I catch without trying, it makes me wonder what other issues are going on that I didn't notice.
It's still worth a read, but it should be supplemented with some more recent works. A few suggestions:
I'd like a recommendation for books on the Weimar Republic. I know there are quite a few works that talk about how it led into the Third Reich, but I'd like a book that focuses on the period itself. Thanks!
