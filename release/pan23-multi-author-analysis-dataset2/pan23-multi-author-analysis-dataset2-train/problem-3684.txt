That’s what I was trying to do originally but I was struggling to find articles with the results of the cases, all I was finding were ongoing investigations. If they haven’t won/lost yet, is their representation as the attorney for the person enough to consider them as a qualified lawyer?
Without knowing the details of the case, you should start by consulting with Personal Injury and/or Civil Rights attorneys.
Another way to look for lawyers is to look up recent cases involving cop-involved shootings in your state and see who was representing the person (or person's family) that was shot.
Just google your state, police excessive force settlement. You will find many news stories that identify which Plaintiff's firm was involved in the settlement. Firms with multiple reported high figure settlements is probably indicative of a qualified attorney. However you should be able to get a free consultation and the firm should take it on a contingency fee, meaning you are not out of pocket. Ask them to discuss some other use of force cases they have settled. Ask if they have an Expert they may like in your situation. Ask questions about how many cases they've handled. Do they have any settlements that are public record you can look up., etc.
Then you can look at ratings on Martindale. You can also read their website for client testimonials, look at facebook and google ratings. I don't trust AVVO because ratings are somewhat dependent upon whether the attorney subscribes to the service and fills out the information, or at least they were like that for years.
