Once a Stars fusion energy hits a certain low level, it no longer has the energy to resist gravity and the mass does collapse. It doesn't actually increase the gravity. If our sun just pop became a black hole everything in the system would keep orbiting as it was. The event horizon has formed around the new black hole and once something trips past that line is when it gets "sucked in". I've understood it as space has become wrapped the only direction anything can can move is towards the center, any all roads lead to Rome kinda situation.
Imagine if this star had an Earth-like planet with intelligent life, but their civilization was still pre-industrial. Watching their life-giving source of comfort and stability being violently shredded apart as their planet (most likely) got jettisoned into cold, dark space.
Stellar objects form or drift near each other all the time. Something like 80% of star systems are binary or composed of more than two stars.
I’m not a credible source of facts by far but pretty sure black holes are stars that have already imploded. Their gravitation pull is so strong that anything that gets in its orbit gets pulled in. Idk correct me if I’m wrong lol.
