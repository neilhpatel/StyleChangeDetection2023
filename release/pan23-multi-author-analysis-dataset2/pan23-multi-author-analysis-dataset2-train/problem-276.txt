Get your landlord's insurance information. You'll want to piggyback on his claim for damages. Home insurance companies often cover this cost, so you should be entitled to coverage.
Alternatively, report this to your own renter's insurance and let them know the cause. They may pursue the landlord or his insurance.
In this case, it should be the landlord's Rental Property Insurance. Homeowners Insurance is typically for an owner family home. Renter's insurance is correct for personal damages. OP's Renter's Insurance is going to want the Rental Property Insurance of the landlord to subrogate if the company is a good one. The cheaper ones will tell OP to go straight through the Landlord's insurance.
I have not dealt with this issue for rental property insurance, but I assume they will cover it based on the above.
NAL, am a tenant. Do you have renters insurance? If so, you can submit a claim for it. I know my RI specifically covers water damages, so I suppose in some cases there is liability. Really depends on the case.
The terms that comes to mind are "warranty of habitability" and "duty to mitigate damages". Most states, counties, and localities have these laws (Except for Georgia and Arkansas IIRC). Basically, property managers have to keep units safe, stable, have hot water, etc. and tenants have to tell them when something is amiss.
Generally speaking, if you contacted your property manager the moment you found out, they're liable (unless your lease says otherwise and live in a state with no different maintenance laws).
I would write every thing down, keep bills and receipts, communicate via email / certified mail, etc. until it's all resolved.
Well, if it's a burst sprinkler head, then it would depend on the lease and whose duty it is to maintain the lawn I guess.
