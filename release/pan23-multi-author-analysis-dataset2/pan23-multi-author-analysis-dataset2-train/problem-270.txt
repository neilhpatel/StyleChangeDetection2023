Following on /u/ilikecheeseforreal's comment, I want to stress that the sum total of your damages is replacement of one can of corn. There's no lawsuit here, no windfall, even if you had eaten the bug. We see this kind of thing in this sub frequently, in fact, insects are so common and ubiquitous that the FDA has standards on how many insects and insects parts are allowed in commercially prepared food.
i know there are fda standards, but this is an entire caterpillar in a 15 ounce can of corn and from what i’ve seen in researching this, this isn’t acceptable.
These things are not measured in a per-can/per-serving manner like nutrition label stuff, they're measured in batches at the factory level. Again, your personal damages are "one replacement can of corn"; you can report them to the FDA, which if they do an inspection will take action at the plant, not based on your can.
Just to be clear, you could have found two tarantulas, a severed human's he-bits and three grams of uncut cocaine in there, and you'd still be personally entitled to your damages: a replacement can of corn. The FDA (and, in my hypothetical, other government agencies) may fine them out the proverbial severed human he-bits for all that, but that would be between them and the Alphabet Soup -- you'd be lucky to even get a follow-up call about the results of the investigation.
