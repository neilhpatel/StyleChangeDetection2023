Thanks thats a good idea I am trying to contact the country office and obtain the name of the property owner. From there I should be able to get a phone number. I found some online lookup tools, but they wanted me to pay for the service and so I'm going to go through the county directly.
I already contacted my insurance. My deductible is $500 so the cost of repairs is the maximum that I need to pay out of pocket.
Sorry I meant follow up in person as I have no phone numbers or emails for the tenant, landlord or landscaper. I can and would like to contact them through a letter.
Sorry, I don't understand why you cannot follow up. It seems it may not be convenient for you to follow up, but that is your up to you.
That being said I dont have any direct evidence other than where the car was parked and images of the lawn showing that it was freshly cut. But it seems that this is a fairly common occurance. I think my concern is more about the proper method of optaining contact info and how to contact the landlord/landscaper, which you have mentioned. I met the neighboring landlord before and she was very nice so this should hopefully be an easy process. Thanks for the info! .
