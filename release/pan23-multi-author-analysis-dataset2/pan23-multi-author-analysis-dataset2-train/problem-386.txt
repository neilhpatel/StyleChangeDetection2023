Orders of the Court regarding division of property are not modifiable at any future date. They can be changed only by amending the Final Decree, an appeal to the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court of Georgia, or by written agreement signed by both parties and filed with the court as an orde.
Any attorney would be happy to take your ex's money for a consultation so they can inform him that this option is a no-go. Your ex can hire as many attorney's as he wants to tell him it's not going to happen.
An unethical attorney might file a appeal to the court of appeals, knowing that it doesn't have a chance of succeeding, but at least they get to collect a fee for the legwork.
Unless you are served with papers, and you must be served with notice before such a case goes to court, relax. You don't need to retain a lawyer on the offhand chance your ex tries this, only if he goes as far as to file and get you served. In that one in a million chance, yes, absolutely get your own lawyer. But it's a waste of your money and energy to get one at this juncture. Block your ex husband phone number and forget about it.
Unless and until he actually files your best bet is to simply ignore him and his lawyer all together.
Outside of fraud, there's no way to revisit property distribution in Georgia. Nevertheless, it would be best for you to get a lawyer to respond to this. You may be able to recover attorney's fees if his position is frivolous.
NAL but been through a long Divorce it might be worth finding out what he is actually up too. If there was nothing hiding, and no assets, there isnâ€™t much to get?? Seems confusing to me.
