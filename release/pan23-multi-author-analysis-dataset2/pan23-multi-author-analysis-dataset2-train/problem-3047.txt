Why does it always have to be personal mate? Not every engineer knows metallurgy source : electrical engineer lol.
Pilot plants are conceptual prototypes. Almost all of them fail to bring yield. If the solution to CO2-free steel was found, every blast furnace would close tomorrow.
The problem with using coal for power is carbon emissions. You absolutely 100% need carbon emissions to make steel from iron. It’s the only way we currently know how to get the chemical reaction required for the process.
Its just not true, in Western Germany they are already investing in new ovens to use the new energy Form. You need carbon for steel not carbon emissions.
I worked in a laboratory doing research on this exact problem. You are literally talking to a scientist who studied this. It was impossible to get working at any feasible scale. The energy required to replace even a single plant’s production is so high the carbon emissions on energy alone vastly outweigh the (already remarkably efficient) coke-based blast furnaces.
