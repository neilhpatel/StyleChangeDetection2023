Yeah! I just wasn’t sure if I could call the police and file a report since there’s very little record of the kitten being my property aside from photos and eyewitnesses, paired with her texts explicitly stating she took the kitten.
however, in most jurisdictions, the most you could expect from suing is the value of the kitten (not much), as pets are considered property.
She was renting out of my friend’s place, so she likely has a key and entered her room while they weren’t there and took the kitten, so there’s no b&e or trespassing but hopefully the police are able to at least do something about the theft.
