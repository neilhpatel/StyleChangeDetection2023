So first things first: Put as much shit around this tree and wall as you can and a camera in the tree. No CAT driver is just gonna barrel the machinery into your stuff for \any\ client at risk of damaging expensive machinery they don't own. Indicate the camera in the tree and that the wall belong to your street number, and your phone number for them to call. You need to build a defense in the event that the other property owner is planning to poison the tree or have the driver "mishear" (tell them he got the okay) and begin the process in the hope that they cause enough damage that you need to just let it happen.
Removing trees in Florida can be complicated. Need an arborist to sign off that the tree poses a danger, or you have to follow local rules, which can be very strict.
Removing someone else's tree is a very bad idea! Call your county and let them know what your neighbor is planning.
Have another survey done. You could also see about getting an injunction to prevent the removal of the tree until such time as the property line is determined again.
