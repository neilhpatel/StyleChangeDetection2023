Prior to the 1970s, most historical inquiry into the 1918 pandemic was medical and epidemiological in nature - focused on diagnosing the causes and failures of public health in order to prevent a reoccurrence. Crosby's Epidemic and Peace, 1918 was among the first works to explore the pandemic's social consequences. Quoting a review since I don't have access to the original text:
''I will never forget a 16-year old boy I encountered. He did not cry, as he was not able to do so, but with the full force of his young, sensitive souls capacity to suffer, his eyes expressed pain over the fact that: -The world is so full of suffering. You are tempted to feel bad about the people born in this time who are not allowed to be young the same way that we in the older generation were, uninhibited in our happiness about the small moments of joy in life, believing that it all was one big, beautiful adventure. ''.
