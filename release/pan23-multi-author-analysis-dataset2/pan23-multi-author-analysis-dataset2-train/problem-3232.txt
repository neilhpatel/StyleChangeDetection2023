Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or youâ€™ve edited your post to comply with the rules, .
The Superintendent's comments to the school board might be privileged. There may be some exception to the privilege, but I'm not aware of one offhand.
If the Superintendent (or board) actually does hire a PI or requires OP to have a psych evaluation then those actions wouldn't be privileged and could create a cause of action.
Statements given to public bodies as part of the governing process are generally privileged. This means that such statements can't be used as evidence of defamation or other torts.
The idea is that we want people to be forthright when giving statements to the government and not have to worry about being hauled into court if they're wrong. The problem (obviously) is that this gives people a license to lie, getting defamatory allegations into the public record without recourse to the effected person.
I used to work in labor and employment, I would strongly recommend hiring an outside attorney before speaking with the union. The union will go to bat for their membership on issues like this, but they will also likely languish in arbitration and NLRB admin courts for potentially years without resolving the problem. Meanwhile, a lawyer can file in court at any stage and really kick some fire into their face.
If the meeting was public I don't see how it could be privileged. Edit: disregard, qualified privilege would protect.
