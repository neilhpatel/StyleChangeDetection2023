You also might want to check your place up and down for hidden cameras just in case it's worse than just a mental health issue.
This conduct is patently outrageous. If that’s what in fact happened (it seemingly defies belief). Certainly you might send landlord a letter clarifying appropriate entry.
This probably doesn’t create an unconditional end to your lease (though I guess location could matter some).
