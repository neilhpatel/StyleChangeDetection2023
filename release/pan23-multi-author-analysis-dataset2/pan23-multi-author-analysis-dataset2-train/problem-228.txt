I’m assuming you don’t have individual leases? That you are joint tenants? Because if so you are all responsible for the entire amount of the lease. I’m sorry you have been put in this position and you need to be aware that this eviction is likely to cause you problems in renting in future but the only way to avoid it is to pay the total arrears yourself and I’m not advocating that.
It's worth noting that if OP pays they could file (depending on exact amount might or might not be small claims -don't know NY limits-) to recover from their roommates, if they are unwilling and/or unable to reimburse. Nearly had to do this in a very similar situation.
It's called joint and several liability. In such an arrangement it means that each tenant is responsible for the full $2700 a month and how or what each person pays individually is not the landlords concern. Unfortunately the only way to avoid getting hit with an eviction on your record is to pay the $8000, either yourself or with the help of one or more of your roommates. That's the hard reality you're facing right now. That you are arguably not morally responsible doesn't change the fact that you are legally responsible for that debt.
For sure, but it will hit AFTER they sign a new lease and hopefully they can keep this prospective one in good standing for a couple years to establish a solid rental history to somewhat offset the eviction.
