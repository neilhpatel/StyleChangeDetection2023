I’m scared because I’m only a teen. I’m terrified, I don’t want my family hurt. I wanna grow up. I don’t want people coming to my home trying to hurt me!
A long time ago i had twitter and said some mean shit. Im not comfortable with posting about it here, im sorry. But basically I was a prick there. And did a lot of other stuff, I don’t do it anymore. I only have Snapchat now.
Okay. It's incredibly unlikely that anyone would actually try to harm you over some "mean shit" you supposedly said on Twitter a long time ago. If you're truly concerned, you should talk to your parents.
You said mean things about someone on Twitter. That person is now threatening to post your name and presumably a description of the mean things you said online if you don't post an apology.
A while ago, I was in the true crime community, someone said something, I don’t remember what, and I got upset and said something mean. I don’t remember how they got my number, but they’re mad and threatening me.
That's not illegal. If I am missing parts of the situation here, then ... you do, actually, need to explain yourself.
Right now, it sounds like you're freaking out over nothing. A lot of people say mean or threatening stuff on the internet and nothing ever comes of it.
If someone actually makes a credible threat, you talk to your parents and report them to the police. Otherwise, block the trolls and move on.
They’re threatening to post embarrassing things about me, post my address, and probably other things I don’t know about- I’m scared.
