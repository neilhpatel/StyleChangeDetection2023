I have changed my name. there will be a phone number with your probate court. past due bills won't matter, since no one will let you change your social security number. the only thing that would complicate it is if you have a criminal record. even if so, you might be required to publish an announcement in a local newspaper for a few weeks, just in case there is some unknown fraud happening. Small changes in your name of course will be more easily allowed than if you were completely assuming a new name. Also switching between last names of one parent to another is much easier. Once you get the official paper with a shiny seal on it, it will actually be up to you, and optional, to reach out to your department of motor vehicles , your banks and credit cards, post office and so on, to show them the paper. It can take a while, and it's a lot of work.
Yes. Name change is done through the court system and you wonâ€™t be asked about bills due or anything related to credit owed. Legally any debt owed is still your responsibility. Debt is tied to your SSN which you will.
