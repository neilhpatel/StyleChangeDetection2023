Ex. A collection company for Consumer Cellular, a company I used/cancelled in 2014 before going to another cell company, suddenly posted a big bill on my credit report this January (6.5 years later) and the amount included a $200 fee they added (ILLEGALLY). I was rejected for subsidized housing for this 1 thing. I emailed first and recorded a call to the original company, who said they continue billing after you cancel for their full billing cycle (though it was pay as you go for your minutes, and I'd paid when canceling). I told him I wasn't billed again in the mail and asked for proof via mail and email. He said sent it but i got nothing in the mail or email, not the verification letter either, so I disputed it with Equifax. I uploaded the emails, etc. and within a week I won and it was taken off of my report. (I'd won a dispute 2 years ago on the same company/bill with Experian.).
Scam. This happened to me twice. At first it freaked me out. And I am a lawyer. Then I thought for a minute. Scam. A telephone call is not legal notice of a court action in any state.
