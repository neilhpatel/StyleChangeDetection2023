Have you considered actually stopping by their house and finally meeting them? Perhaps discuss your concerns with them face to face?
How old is the child? If you’ve never spoken to them how are you able to ascertain that the child is disabled? You say “from my understanding” so that sounds like someone (presumably another neighbor?) told you? Where precisely is the child running around? Their own back yard? Front yard? Porch? Down the street?
Without knowing any of this, I would start by calling law enforcement and CPS the next time it happens. There is no minimum age to leave a child unattended in California, so unless the child is absurdly young, it is likely they are allowed to run around their property unattended. Perhaps there are some issues of indecent exposure that CPS could investigate.
I think that calling CPS should be your last resort. It depends on the age of the child. Small children should be able to be naked without being sexualized. If a child is at risk you have no choice.
I don’t know if this is the right thing to do in this situation but call cp Aka Child services there could a huge big case of neglect going on behind that closed door.
I worked with DFCS (in GA but a lot is similar) call the hotline 1-800-540-4000. If they don’t do anything, keep calling. Report case after case so they will get up and move. With the chid being disabled, that does make it more of a priority. If you call every day, call every day. The investigators will come out but just know you are protected with anonymity.
