Lawyer will give you the best course of action. Do not do or say anything to your ex or her bf, and especially not his work. This is what lawyers are for.
Meantime, focus on being the best dad you can be to your daughter, hear her, believe her, get her any help she needs. Here's hoping you can get custody.
To be honest, if this was my daughter telling me this, I would be filing an emergency ex parte motion for modification of custody. Your ex doesn't see the big deal in the trauma being inflicted on her CHILD, and her BF is a police officer, that's why I would file the motion ex parte (you don't need to serve her a copy of it before it is ruled on, you serve her with it after it is ruled on). Where I am, in CT, the judge rules on these motions by the end of the day they are filed.
The motion, if granted, will allow you pick up your daughter and temporarily withhold her until a hearing, which will likely be scheduled within 2 weeks.
IANAL, and the above is only what I would do in this situation as a Mother, as well as a paralegal with some experience.
