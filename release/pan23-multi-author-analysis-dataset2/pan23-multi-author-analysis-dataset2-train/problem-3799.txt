The court should still be aware of any employers who try to get their employees for taking time off for Jury Duty. It's very serious, and if you don't, odds are the next employee working there who gets Jury Duty will also get fired, and they may not be as financially secure as you are.
The court is not going to make your ex employer, and you need to start referring to as such, reverse the termination. That is done and for the life of me I can't think why you would want to consider further employment there.
You need to turn your thinking around. Your ex employer is the one that burned the bridge, so that ship has already set sail. You should not care about that business or the owners of it. They broke the law and should be held accountable. They need to learn a lesson and the judge will be the one handing out the education.
So you should still inform court. You may be compensated, but more importantly, your employer won't punish the next guy for taking Jury Duty.
This letter, for what little is worth, is them knowing they did something wrong I suspect and them trying to save face. The judge, well they are a judge, they have been to law school and all and are generally pretty intelligent and will see through the rouse.
You may not want to "burn bridges" but as others have already stated, that ship has already sailed and it was your ex-employer who cast off.
What your ex-employer did was illegal in most (if not every) state, and they should absolutely suffer the consequences of their illegal actions.
This is no longer about you -- this is now about everyone for if the justice system breaks down by events such as what happened to you then we all will have a much bigger problem to deal with.
