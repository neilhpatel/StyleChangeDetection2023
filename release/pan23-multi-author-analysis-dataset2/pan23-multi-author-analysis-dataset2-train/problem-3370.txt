If you are a US Citizen you qualify for a US Passport, correct? I would get one immediately if you do not have one. When applying, get ahead of it. "Some computers reject my SSN as invalid, I do not know why, however I have my US Passport which checks all the boxes for I-9 Employment verification. I also have my social security card which I can show you." (It's in fact Item 1 in List A.).
That is an unfortunate downside. If a person is having trouble with employment due to computers rejecting him it is pretty irrefutable evidence of citizenship.
Truly everyone who qualifies for one should maintain a US Passport, it's one of the best pieces of ID in the USA.
So unfortunately, there's no such thing as "irrefutable evidence" in the face of complete idiocy. My suspicion is that it's not computers, it's idiots doing it by hand, but it could always be computers, idiots, or computers AND idiots!
You might provide this 1 page fact sheet when you show an employer your SS card in person, and explain that you've had issues in the past with people thinking your SS was invalid.
SSN randomization began in 2011 because they were running out of number combinations with the original format. You would likely still receive a number that starts with a previously ‘unused’ combination of numbers like 8.
Note: If you are rejected due to an actual background check, . You might want to inquire if they used a background check service. If a background check service rejected you for this reason, I would 100% file an FTC complaint.
