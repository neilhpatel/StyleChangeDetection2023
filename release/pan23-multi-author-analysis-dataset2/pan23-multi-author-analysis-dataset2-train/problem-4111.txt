Hospitals and health care professionals follow the Least Restraint Policies. meaning, as much as possible they do not use restraints (chemical or physical) unless patient poses harm to self or others. even with restraints, they can also pose harm to the patient.
if he was improving, the restraints will definitely be weaned off or come off. restraint is not a forever solution 24/7 all throughout the hospital stay. sooner or later, they need to come off. confusion and delirium is hard to assess from one point in time to another. Nurse may come in morning and assess he responds appropriately and remove restraint, as per policy.
theres also the other co-morbidities why he is confused/delerius e.g. sepsis, low oxygen, encephalophaty, dementia, new baseline cognition, etc.
If your dad has a claim, it would be for medical malpractice, which is, way, way, way out of the scope of knowledge for this sub.
very unlikely he has a case as you need to review all the documentation of staff and hospital policies they followed for putting someone on or off restraint.
