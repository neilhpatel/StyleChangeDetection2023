Also, all of those lessons demonstrate the power people actually have and when your policies go against what the majority want, giving the populace a game plan to stop you isn’t exactly smart.
It’s not that it makes them feel uncomfortable, it’s they see that knowledge as being used against their goals.
Damn right it is. I don’t understand how when I was in school in the 90’s we had a Black History course. We learned of the barbarity of slavery, we learned about Jim Crowe and the Civil Rights Movement. There were no objections from anybody and it was a very important part of our curriculum. Nowadays politicians want to hide the ugly side of our history because it makes them uncomfortable. This should not be. I hope DeSantis loses this case.
There's no point. The course is going to be reinstated next month when the updated curriculum that's been in the works for the last year gets released. This was all a perfectly timed political stunt. The kids get their AP course back, and DeSantis gets to say look how tough I am and how quickly I forced those woke academics at College Board to stop being so woke.
