TBH, it's not possible to know for sure who tore down the poster, but I'm 99% sure who did it. I just wanted to make sure that they have no the right to tear it down.

If it's squarely on your property, then she cannot take it down. You could call the police non-emergency line (or go to a station in person) and make a report with whatever evidence you have that she tore it down. They likely won't do much, but they may pay her a visit and tell her to knock it off if you can persuade them that she was the one who tore it down.
A criminal case would be more likely to succeed than a civil one here, but the likelihood of the neighbour being given anything more than a warning is very slim here. She probably wouldn't even get that given that you have no strong evidence to support your claim.
