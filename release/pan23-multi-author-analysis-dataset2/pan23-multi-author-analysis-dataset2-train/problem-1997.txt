ðŸ”¥ The Armed Forces struck a building with 500 occupiers in the Kherson region, 2 trucks with the dead were taken from there, - General Staff ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine.
56 seriously injured people were taken to the nearest hospital, of which 16 more people died soon after.
So you've been stuck poorly supplied for weeks, knowing you were going to retreat for over a week then a mad rush accross the river while being shelled. Your morale is likely already at rock bottom... then this happens... I'm sure the survivers will be thrilled to go back into combat!
Its not even hard to spin! A pro Russian grandma could still be overjoyed to see her "misguided" grandson is alive....
But no, must be faked because nobody in Ukraine could have a nicer house than in Russia and the soldier is a genetic supersoldier with a neck made out of black fleece despite his white hands...
You'd imagine if there were that many in one location it will be those who retreated from the right bank thst haven't been redistributed yet.
Yeah, weirdly everyone on Russian media claims it is staged because grandma has a nice brick fence and planted some cypress trees instead of something more practical like apples.
