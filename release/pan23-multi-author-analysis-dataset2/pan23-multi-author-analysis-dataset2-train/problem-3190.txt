California Highway Patrol said these agencies are not law enforcement and they cant do zip to me, just send crap letter of demand. CHP said to call NYPD. WOW what a quagmire what was, press 1, 4 then back to main menu then on and on and on.
Just keep sending NY the notice you sold the car. Eventually they will find and boot then repo the car.
Eventually the state will turn the account over to collections, and youâ€™ll turn over a copy of the ROL and bill of sale plus any other proof to the collection agency. Keep copies of that ready to go so that you can turn it over repeatedly. Eventually it will go away. Hassle, but that is how it is.
at least 10 times since June. The fines continue. I emailed the buyer, told him the local CHIP S is an ex NYPD cop, who has been in contact with NYPD concerning this.
I know in Cal, if you blow the Bay Bridge without paying, the cops chase you down. I am now assuming Jersey NY bridges have no cops. And the red lights, and camera and bus lanes and parking tickets, keep rolling in.
