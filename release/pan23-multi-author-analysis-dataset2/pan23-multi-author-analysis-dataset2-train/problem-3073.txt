What you describe here does not at all seem to meet the fact pattern of work that is required to be paid.
You are fully free to file a wage claim with the CA DLSE, but I would not expect it to go anywhere based on what you've told us here. You can also consult an employment attorney, but I would temper my expectations on your chances at recovering anything.
While that is true, in California, you legally CAN NOT work for a company for free. Even if you want to. Unless it's a church, charity, non-profit, type of business. So, I could say I would be willing to work for free, and turn around and tell them I want to be paid --- and they'd have to pay me. I just don't want to have to calculate all my hours and that BS. They should just realize they're wrong and pony up a decent amount. And I'm curious if any writer has had to deal with this from a website (I'm guessing it's most likely interns that worked for free, for a start up).
Was it ever requested in any form at any level to any degree of you to complete work without pay? For example “hey any chance you could paint this for me by next week for the website” all the way to “I’d really appreciate if you would paint this” and you’d be correct in my view but if the product was simply volunteered then my advice would not be favorable to your chances.
