You can't waive the subrogation rights of your insurer or force them to accept liability on your behalf. If your child is injured and your health insurer pays bills for medical treatment, they can pursue the homeowner's insurance of the trampoline owner.
You're under the obligation to follow your current health insurance/ homeowners insurance/ liability insurances coverage and policies.
Here's the deal, if you feel the potential for injury is so great, that you need to "protect" your neighbor through a liability waiver YOU need to reevaluate if allowing your child to play on it is even prudent.
Then it turns out your neighbor, wanting to save a few bucks delayed some needed maintenance on the trampoline and that delay was directly responsible for your child's paralysis? Still think a hastily written waiver would be a good idea?
If you try to circumvent that process, they would deny the claim and you'd be left holding the bag.
Or, your child is injured enough to require an ambulance ride and extensive testing to determine if they will walk again. Your health insurance will likely look to recoup those costs through your neighbors insurance coverage, much like your heath insurance defers to another motorists coverage in an auto accident.
