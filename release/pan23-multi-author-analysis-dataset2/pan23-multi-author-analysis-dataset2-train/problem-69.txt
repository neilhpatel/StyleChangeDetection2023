-instead of going the route of "was shipping it illegal" I would suggest documentation and going on the protective order route.
It was not shipped with any kind of refrigeration. Just shoved in a box that was really well sealed with tape. He put a bag of lime in with it to mask the smell.
Also, I would be worried for your safety after going for a protective order or taking any other legal action against him. Regardless of if they find a deer head rises to the level of giving you that order, he will be angry the attempt was made.
NAL but Missouri deer season just started. Missouri Conservation takes poaching very seriously. Perhaps reach out to them. 1-800-392-1111 is the MO dept of conservation poaching hotline.
I would start with contacting your local game warden to report receipt of potentially poached animal parts shipped across state lines. Do not touch the item until being directed by a game warden. Its very possible that transporting the head over state lines was not legal, especially if the animal was poached.
