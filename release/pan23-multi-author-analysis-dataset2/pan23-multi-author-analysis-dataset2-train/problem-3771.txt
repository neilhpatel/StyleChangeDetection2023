Contact your local social worker at child protective services. They should be able to guide you. If not try the victims services office with the district attorney.
I’m really sorry to hear that. Since you had a PRO you should be able to get in touch with victim services and they may be able to help explain what happen and what your options are.
In most states, the family court tends to take into account the living preferences of older children when evaluating custody. Your mother needs to fight for full custody and can file an emergency application asking that in the interim you remain in her custody full time. You will say you want to live with her full time, ultimately that would probably sway the judge, but honestly it would likely just run out the clock until you turn 18. You are a minor. Your mom should be fighting this for you, not having you do the fighting yourself. From your post, it’s unclear what’s going on, but it sounds like you’re being asked to sign things (not binding — you’re a minor and can’t enter into a contract) or going to lawyers when this could be handled as a simple custody battle.
In most states, emancipation can be accomplished via court order, even against the wishes of one or both parents. You will need some legal assistance to do so, as the process can be long and difficult, as you will have to establish that you are mature and responsible enough to make your own life decisions and that your father is an active hindrance to your life goals.
