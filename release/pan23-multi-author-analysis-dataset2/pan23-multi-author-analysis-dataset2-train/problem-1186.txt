I would read it as needing to provide one month’s notice to end the contract, and the contract requires payment. If she’s not paying for that month, then the notice period serves no purpose. Contract law requires a judge to enforce contract terms in the way that gives effect to as many terms as possible.
If you your friend feels the child is in danger attending, by all means don’t send them, but it’s possible they will have to pay for that month. If there is a term in the contract that the daycare violated by ignoring the child’s allergies, they may have an argument that the daycare breached the contract first, so the month notice requirement was no longer valid.
I would report the daycare to the local daycare licensor. Ignoring allergies is a serious safety issue and needs to be addressed.
Right, it is definitely something my friend is communicating with the state, as her child could have had something serious happen to him and the provider brushed it off. I’m sure she’ll go to someone who is a legal professional to further go into this, so she can get better advice than I can give 😅 but thank you for your help!
What do you think a months notice means if not you give notice and continue to attend and pay for at least one more month?
It does not state it is required for her to pay for it though, in the contract. All it says is “I ask that you give one months notice so I can fill your spot”.
But what do you think one months notice means then? Because that is literally the only thing it could mean! That you give notice before leaving. Leaving with no notice but saying '30 days will happen after I stop attending' isn't a thing.
But in the contract it does not say she is required to pay. It does not mention any payment. She did not sign anything saying she would pay the provider after terminating care.
Your problem is that '30 days notice' doesn't have to say and you pay. Because every reasonable person knows you pay for that 30 days.
Well, that’s why it was asked here because I don’t write contracts, I don’t do day care, I’m not a lawyer. My friend doesn’t write contracts, she doesn’t do day care, and she’s not a lawyer. Thanks for explaining this It’s just something that I would have expected to see in writing, specifically, if it’s coming from a contract. I feel the wording should have reflected exactly what she means, you know? So there isn’t room for interpretation, like so many people she has asked had interpreted it differently. I appreciate your help.
