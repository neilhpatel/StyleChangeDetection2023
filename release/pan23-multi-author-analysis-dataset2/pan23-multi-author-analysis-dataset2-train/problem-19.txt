I also called one of the lawyers that contacted me and they said they were just advertising for bankruptcy help and couldn't give me any additional information on the lawsuit. They did mention the collections company I was afraid of though. Should I try and call that company next?
Thank you, that makes me feel a bit better. I checked the online records and nothing comes up. The court clerk couldn't find anything either, but mentioned some lawsuits take a couple days to show up so it's still a possibility. She also mentioned that most medical debts don't reach lawsuit stage for about 10 years in her experience, so if that's true I'm really lost.
That is literally how debt collection works. You don't pay a debt (bad on your credit). You get sued (bad on your credit). They sell that to a collection agency (still bad on your credit) who uses the court order and local law to collect on the debt.
Yes, I know that's how it works I just meant that a lot of people claim to have had wages garnished from this company without getting any notice that they even had a claim against them. That's what I'm worried about the most. I will do my best to contact someone.
