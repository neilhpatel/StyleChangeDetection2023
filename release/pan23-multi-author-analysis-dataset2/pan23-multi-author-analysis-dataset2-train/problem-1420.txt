Hitting a body of water with a missile is a lot harder than it sounds. Sometimes they don’t make it off the launch pad and the guy firing it hasn’t eaten in weeks.
Luke, Wedge, do you have something to say to the rest of the class? If not, listen to the speaker politely and quietly so you don’t disturb the others.
Existing Predator and Reaper drones fit the bill perfectly but aren't mobilized for American airspace defense. Biden is going to change this similar to how Bush authorized unarmed ones for domestic surveillance programs. This also isn't a bad thing necessarily as it will lead to drones becoming more normal within the US, and create operators for commercial ones.
Considering that the object was very likely a local balloon enthusiast's completely harmless balloon, we just spent $800,000 on theater. Awesome. Probably $1,600,000 as they shot down three objects, with this one requiring two, so 4 missiles? Nice.
Lol. Look, to be fair, these missiles are probably built into the budget, and if not expended today, would either sit around forever until being decommissioned or used in a training exercise (that this arguably was anyway). The correct take here is probably questioning how we end up with so much fat in the military that such approaches are the baseline, and that then gets into a whole load of fairly deep and complex moral and ethical questions around America's strategy of total dominance of hard power etc. For right now though, I'll settle with solely poking fun at the situation because WTF else can one do?
