You can call your local non-emergency number and ask the police to do a wellness check on her. Explain the short version of what you said here, and they’ll send a car to do a routine check up.
If they complete a wellness check and all of her stuff is still there and she is not that’s a sign she didn’t really move. It will also give them the opportunity to see any evidence of a crime like you’re concerned about. A wellness check will also just make sure she didn’t potentially come down with COVID or another illness and is staying with a family member to help her recuperate. If she is not there, the police can ask more questions than you can, and seek legal repercussions if they get the sense something is off.
Okay that makes more sense. Guess I didn’t think through that whole point, thanks for clarifying and I’ll definitely try that. Going to give the benefit of the doubt first though and call her of course.
For sure, give her a call. Hopefully it’s a simple answer. But if she doesn’t answer I would go ahead with the wellness check. You’re a kind neighbor.
Side note: if you’re worried about the neighbor man, I would ask the police to keep the wellness check anonymous. Just in case you’re worried he will get upset at you for calling it in.
call the police, talk to an officer (not just dispatch) ask for a welfare check, explain the story. Tell them your suspicions.
