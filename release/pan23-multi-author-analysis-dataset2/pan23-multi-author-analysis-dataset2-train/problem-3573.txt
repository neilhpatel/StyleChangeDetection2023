No...her continuing sessions with your husband does not mean she is not HIPAA non compliant. The fact that you want to dictate where he gets therapy and from whom has nothing to do with the providers' HIPAA compliance.
Your initial comment said you and your spouse went in for therapy. You stopped therapy. HE did not. If he is not on your insurance plan you can contact the company and they will stop paying. This move might anger your husband and start a different problem. If your husband is covered by your insurance, there is nothing you can do. There is no proof she is disclosing your medical information to anyone.
My husband told me he was still seeing her and he ended the sessions today, so I'm not worried about angering him or messing with insurance. I did want him seeing a therapist for an outlet and processing, but not her for obvious reasons. Thank you for your help.
First off, thank you for the reply. I'm just surprised that because I ended counseling, she could continue to use my information in her sessions with my husband. I thought it would be a breach of privacy?
