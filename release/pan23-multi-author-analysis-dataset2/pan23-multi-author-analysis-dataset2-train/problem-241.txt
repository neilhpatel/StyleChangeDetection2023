In 60 years we went from a plane hopping off the ground to landing on the moon. In 30 years we went from the first electromechanical Enigma code breaker, to the first home computer, and 30 years later to the first iPhone. We were able to develop a vaccine, distribute it, and inoculate the majority of the world against a global pandemic in a few years after it was first detected.
I had that we would all band together and eventually stop climate change when it got serious. Like when you have a paper due at midnight, and at 11:59 you turn it in.
Praise allah, god bless america, god save the king, jesus loves you, heil [insert dictator], and so on.
Then Covid happened and I realized we had a better chance of Jesus Christ himself descending from heaven and solving global warming than our species doing something.
Unfortunately we're too dumb as a species to adapt to global issues. There will be war, mass migrations and starvations, genocides, and the worst of us will thrive.
Science, Technology, and renewable energy is moving faster than you can imagine right now. Just because you aren't paying attention doesn't mean that we are working to solve these problems.
