Sitting in your house while doing zoom interviews on CNN and MSNBC isn't the same as getting out there and taking that same message on the campaign trail. He saw a very lucrative future being a "Trump-hating republican" on those very same networks. It's easy to criticize the leader of your party when you don't really have anything to lose politically and a huge cable TV contract to gain financially.
