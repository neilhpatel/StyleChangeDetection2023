I want to know if there is a way for condo boards to fight back against people who may have committed ESA fraud to obtain a dog. I know most of the laws are on the ESA side but states such as Florida and Michigan have made the ESA laws stronger to prevent abuse.
If the condo association is certain, and with the advice of their legal counsel, they can ignore the fraudulent letter and levy whatever punishments/fees/etc are outlined in their bylaws.
I can't request access to the letter as a non condo board member. I am assuming to be legitimate as the condo board seems to complete due diligence. The actions of the individual with the dog are what lead me to believe in the fraud. Also, there are many loopholes with who can provide letters and if you even have to have a relationship with the letter provider.
There was HUD guidance earlier this year that specified what types of providers could provide letters, and gave an opinion that online letter sites where there is no relationship are not legitimate.
ESAs, even the most valid ones, do not have any protections for poor behavior. The proper authority can impose fines on ESAs for behavior related reasons, and they can even demand the removal of the animal for persistent behavioral infractions.
If you have concerns about the behavior of the animal, you can escalate those like you would for any other animal. The fact that the animal is an ESA will not shield them from substantiated behavior complaints.
