At 18 and graduated, she can do whatever and go wherever she wants, with or without her parents' permission, because she'll be an adult.
What her parents choose to do in response to that (stop supporting her and/or providing her things like money, clothing, food, a vehicle, whatever) is probably a good question.
If her parents don't want you in their home, even if she might have something of a legal entitlement to bring you in as a guest in certain situations, they can probably prevent you entry and there may not be much that can be done about that.
A lot of this is a relationship issue as much as it is a legal issue. If she wants to leave under contentious circumstances, she's free to do so, but there might be repercussions that she should prepare for. Without sounding cold, uncaring, or presumptive, 18-year-old recent high school graduates aren't really known for having living on their own and supporting themselves all figured out, so potentially burning a bridge with one of her support systems is something to at least consider.
Title: My girlfriend wants to move in with me and my parents after she graduates from High School, but me and her are not in very good terms with her parents, what should I do?
If there is stuff that she especially values or any papers (birth certificate, passport, etc.) it would be helpful for her to get those away from her house before she moves.
