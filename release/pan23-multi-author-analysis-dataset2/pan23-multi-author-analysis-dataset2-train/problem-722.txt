Iâ€™m more concerned with uneducated voters since they probably have a lower level of critical thinking skills and are more susceptible to propaganda.
if the student loan forgiveness program falls through, which certainly seems possible...do you think it'll still be possible to animate young voters? i wonder how adept dem leaders are going to be at channeling young people's energy at republicans to say "hey it's THEIR fault you cant get your student loans forgiven". seems like a harder case to make than the abortion one which they did a decent job of gauging by the turnout at midterms.

huh? How in the hell would that even happen given they control the House? I guess you mean by some EO that would change the schedule definition of marijuana? That wouldn't really 'legalize' it to the point of actually being able to buy pot in retail stores. An EO alone wouldn't move the needle very far.
