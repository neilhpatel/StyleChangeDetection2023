If the car is in your father's name, you'll need his consent and participation to transfer the title over to your name.
What agreements did you make with your father about the title of the car and if/when it would be transferred into your name, if any at all?
The car is currently titled in his name, but if you paid for it and there was no agreement that you’re “buying it for him”, then you can take him to civil court, if you have financial documentation. If/when the judge rules in your favor, he will have the choice to either give that money back (and you can buy another car) or sign the car over to you.
The lenh you'll have to go to to avoid communicating with the car's legal owner in writing, or in person, is "returning the car to them". That's an inconvenient fact of your desire to avoid contacting your family.
Even if your name appears on the title as a "JTW" "joint tenant with" your father you can't transfer the title solely to yourself without his consent.
You could hire an attorney to negotiate and meet with him on your behalf and litigate in district court (not small claims), which would be necessary if the value of the car is (probably $10,000). But I'm guessing that if you're living in your car you don't have several thousand dollars to spend on attorney fees.
You will need to either meet with your father to have the title transferred or file suit to force the transfer in court. Either way you are going to have to see your father in person so your simplest and most logical move is to just go meet him to get the title transferred.
The only alternative to actually seeing your father is to hire an attorney to meet with your father and do the transfer for you.
