arbitration agreements usually are to prevent being in a class action. it doesn't mean you are giving up your rights.
But they’re basically forcing us to give up our right to class action because class actions are more effective, correct?
class actions are very expensive for them. they're generally not all that great for employees, as the payouts to them are just a few bucks. but for them they have to pay attorney fees for both sides.
Most large class actions you’re right—it’s just a few bucks per claimant. But that’s because it’s stuff like Company X incorrectly charged customers a $0.99/month fee that they weren’t allowed to from January 2018-June 2019.
But if the damages are large, it’s being a class action doesn’t mean the company only pays out peanuts. My wife was part of a class action against a former employer many years ago—they’d done some shenanigans to avoid paying overtime. Her payout was something like $2,500 and those who’d been there longer got more.
that's a rare instance on shenanigans on wages. op shouldn't need a class action to get wages owed to them.
more are about policy violates something and they don't come with exact financial damages to the employees. rigney v target for example settled for 1.6 million with about $9 for employees because they didn't provide proper notice about cobra.
