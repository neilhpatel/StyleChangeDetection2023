Don't get intimidated. He was trying to scam you, and messed up the timing. He thought it was already in the mail when he initiated the dispute.
As others said, work through paypal's offical process to have them refund/close the transaction and then block him. No law enforcement is going to care. He's not going to follow through with his threats because it's higher risk to him than you.
Yes, but I'm not clear on how that's relevant at this point? Even with F&F, it's still been disputed, and that needs to be resolved via the dispute process. And, the scammer's threats to report to law enforcement authorities have nothing to do with PayPal.
When op used friends and family to sell goods to ax stranger over the internet, he waived all PayPal protection. That's what 'goods and services' is for... PayPal offers protection through that . With friends and family, you are saying, "I know and trust this person so much, I can waive all protections for a fe dollars off the fee".
Still, good advice for the future. Lots of people mistakenly think "goods & services" is only for official businesses, or that it's somehow only advantageous for buyers.
It's relevant because people are telling him to go through PayPal s dispute process... and there really isn't one for friends and family. You can request a refund and the sender can agree to send it to you. Or if you were hacked, PayPal might help. But if you voluntarily sent money through friends and family, there is no dispute resolution process like for goods and services. Friends and Family payments are not covered by PayPalâ€™s Buyers Protection, which makes getting a refund virtually impossible.
My point/thinking was that OP said the money was frozen while PayPal reviews the complaint. That's also a process that needs resolution with PayPal before anything else happens. Should have been clear that it's not the same as the formal dispute process available in their g&s, since there was a lot of confusion/mistakes about that.
