I would expect a company that sells climbing gear to require this. It’s a safety issue that they could be held liable if equipment that was found to be faulty is used and causes injury.
While I’m unsure of warranty laws requiring this, there are numerous quality control process certifications that require a documented process for ensuring damaged or defective products are not allowed to be used or resold.
I know this may not actually make a difference, but this specific failure is common with climbing shoes and the solution is to have them resoled; a process that is allowed, even encouraged, by the manufacturer. The defect in this case was that it happened within the first two months of ownership with only light use.
A warranty is just an agreement between the buyer and the manufacturer, right? Their website clearly states, "If you discover a defect, we will replace such product FREE OF CHARGE." I think this is binding because I could not find a link to a more in depth policy or any other terms or condition set forth on the site, save the one I already mentioned above. I take issue with the warranty requirements not being clearly laid out on their website or at point of sale. The main question I have is regarding the legality of requiring me to destroy equipment that they don't want back and that I technically still own before shipping new shoes for a claim that has already been approved.
And yeah, normally you'd want to retire climbing gear instead of having it repaired, but climbing shoes are the exception; they are built to be resoled a number of times before they need to be retired. Had they given me a resole credit or offered to resole the shoes for me, we also wouldn't be having this discussion.
I hadn't thought of it from this angle, thanks for the insight here. Are these QA process certifications issued by a government agency or are they created internally?
