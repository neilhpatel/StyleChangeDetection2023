Practical advice: the way to avoid that potentially confrontational situation altogether is to take your own photos and videos before the landlord does their inspection.
There's no legal issue with you recording the inspection. I'm not sure what you believe you'd be gaining by doing so, versus documenting the condition of the apartment yourself beforehand (or even afterward). You should set your expectations about how the landlord will react to you doing so -- they may be fine with it, they may not be fine with it, and it could turn an otherwise pleasant or uneventful move-out inspection into a situation that's contentious.
It's mainly because they keep sending me notices that 'my apartment is filthy clean it up this is a lease violation' and it's pretty immaculately clean tbh. I've had staff in here twice so far that had no issue with the condition then suddenly I get a notice a week later about how dirty it is and I'm like ????
It could be a simple mistake; maybe those notices are intended for a neighbor. Or it could be something you're unaware of. Either way, step one is likely to seek clarification so you're all on the same page.
so i just want to film me asking "hey, do you see any mess conditions" and getting the reply documented so they leave me alone.
When you received notice that your apartment was filthy and in violation of the lease, and your apartment is clearly not filthy and is instead immaculate, did you approach the complex and inquire about what conditions, specifically, they were talking about?
Yep I emailed them directly about it, I had one of their plumber contractors in my apartment to check my water pressure, I got the notice the next day. I emailed asking about it like "huh?" because legitimately my apartment is clean, and they said the 'manager with the plumber said he saw a lot of filth etc' I replied back that the plumber was by himself and that yall are welcome to check it out. I even suggested it might be the wrong unit.
