Yes, you and the facility hosting the event would face liability for copyright infringement if the films were to be exhibited without a licence agreement in place.
The library is probably risking some liability if they are allowing movies to be played for the public without making arrangements with the copyright holder.
Why is it legal to do it at the library and my house? It's quite confusing about home media legal rights, I own the DVD or VHS and can show it to anyone in my house or library but at a venue it's illegal?
Read the agreement printed in the DVD material. If you're allowing a group of basically strangers into your home to screen a movie, you're probably edit: NOT following the "personal and private" (or whatever language they use) licence granted to you by owing the DVD.
Absolutely there are services on the internet that sell movie exhibition licences all the time for just such small-scale uses. It's going to cost a couple-hundred bucks (and it probably does for the library too).
Does the club aspect constitute "private showing" it's not us paying the venue it's them paying me to find space for a showing? An example is the fee is 15$ a month for 2 double features twice a month, without payment they're no longer a member and aren't included in film night. This hasn't been implemented yet but I was planning on it for March so we can have reasonably space.
