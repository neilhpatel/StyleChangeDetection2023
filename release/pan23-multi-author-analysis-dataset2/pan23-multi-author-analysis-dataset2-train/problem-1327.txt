This kind of argument can be applied to literally any kind of crime. People who commit crimes, turns out, commit crimes. Does that mean we should just get rid of laws because they’ll just not follow them anyway?!
There are other cases, but I just wanted to clarify that there are ways. The next administration intends to crack this down and make it as difficult - or more - as before (until 2016). Not to forget that there are lots of illegal owners and carriers of guns, of course - specially in this environment of protest.
Essentially, it is illegal for a common citizen without permit, but the previous administration made it easier to get the permit to own, transport and carry guns.
One specific instance is, for example, carry of a revolver to protect the rest of the collection during transportation (between homes or to shooting range).
“Not everyone will 100 percent follow the law so clearly we shouldn’t have any laws 🤪 I dream of being able to shoot a burglar in the back” - average American gun nut.
