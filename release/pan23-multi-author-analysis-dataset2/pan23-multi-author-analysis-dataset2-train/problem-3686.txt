Nope. Had your friend been a real asset manager, they would have submitted a 1099-B listing the trades made under your name and you would pay those taxes directly to the IRS. But they can't do that because they aren't licenced to manage someone else's money, so if they admit what they're doing in a court of law they're going to be fucked.
At this point you need to protect yourself, and you need professional tax advice. Contact a CPA for assistance, and be aware you're probably going to pay penalties because the deadline is this weekend and no CPA is going to be able to untangle this in that time.
And, to be clear - in no world do you pay someone else's tax liability. That is theirs and theirs alone. If they can't find a way to legally shift those taxes onto you, that is because their scheme was illegal from the get-go.
You will need to pay taxes on your gains, but you will pay the IRS directly. There is a significant question of how to properly report however - for example, reporting on a trust would be different than if it was under your name, and since this person didn't do any of the normally recognized mechanisms for properly shifting taxes into your name you need professional advice to figure out the right way to report it.
Title: I gave crypto to a person to manage (it's under his name) and he gave it back to me, who is liable for the capital gains tax? This is all in the same tax year.
For the other person, if they had been doing things properly they wouldn't owe taxes. Unfortunately for them, they didn't. They would be well served to speak to a tax attorney at this point, and probably also a securities lawyer, to figure out if they can salvage the situation and avoid paying taxes as well without admitting to being an unlicensed financial advisor/money manager.
