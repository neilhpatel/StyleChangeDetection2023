The fact that this year's cup won't fucking collapse saddens me. This is one of the most shameful things to ever happen in our lifetime. FIFA could choose any country to host the world cup, and they chose one that had no infrastructure to host it; which is so hot in the summer that the whole cup has been moved to winter (fucking over every major football league; which had to stop their calendar right now so players can go to the world cup); which uses literal slavery to build their infrastructure; in a dictatorship with as many freedoms as you'd have in 16th century Europe, a country so ridiculous that they had the balls to literally go and say "please respect us and don't be gay here". And, most important of all, a country that has no football culture and which is completely irrelevant in the football world. All of this happened ONLY so a bunch of old men at the very top of FIFA's organization get a few million on bribery.
Yep ..sadly people calling for boycot are a tiny minority . Most people don't know or they don't care that this happens . Still at least they are trying.
