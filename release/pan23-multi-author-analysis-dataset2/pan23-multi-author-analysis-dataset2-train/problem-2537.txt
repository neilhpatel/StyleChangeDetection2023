Just my two cents, if you think any animals are in immediate danger, you should contact your local authorities immediately. That would be paramount before you worry about keeping your kitten or not. In the US, I believe it is unlawful to separate a kitten from its mother before 8 weeks for feeding and development purposes. I'm not sure what the authorities would do in Australia, and I would hope they would either say the kitten should stay with you (a safe and nurturing home) as opposed to her if they found her abusive/neglectful. They could take possession of all kittens and the mother, and I would hope they would return the kitten to you after a few weeks as, again, a nurturing home.
But bottomline, 1) protect vulnerable animal's lives like the kittens in this situation, and 2) post on the other sub.
I’m not sure if it’s ‘illegal’ here, but standard practice is 8wks for the same reasons.. and I’m betting this kitten was younger (or underfed). I don’t think they would take him back for the 7-ish days until he’s 8wks though? Thankfully I know how to care for young kittens at least haha(I used to foster care for rescue kittens).
The problem is I really don’t know if she’s abusing the cats/kittens that she has, or if she’s just a scummy person. I can’t tell whether the listlessness of the first day I met my kitten was because he was neglected, or because he had ‘just woken up’ as she claimed. But he’s super full of beans now haha.
