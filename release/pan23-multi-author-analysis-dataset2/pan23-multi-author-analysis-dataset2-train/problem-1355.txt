If/when anyone sexually (or otherwise) harasses you (says or does something that makes you uncomfortable), you are obligated to ask them to stop unless you feel it would be dangerous (physically or career-wise) to you. That's the first thing HR will ask you. You COULD ask their manager to ask them to stop, but your best second step is going straight to HR. Use the words sexual harassment when reporting it to them. They should investigate, and ask the person to stop. If it persists, report it to HR every time. If it continues even after you have told HR about it, or if you experience retaliation from that manager, other managers, or HR, then you might have a lawsuit. But you're a long ways away from that point right now.
I am not able to tell what you believe you are being discriminated against for here. If you think you are the victim of unlawful retaliation or adverse employment action based on rejecting the flirtatious manager, then you would file a complaint with the EEOC first. You can speak with an attorney if warranted a bit down that path.
You can not be disciplined or terminated for making a complaint, even if you ultimately do not pursue legal recourse.
You need to report things to a company, and then let them fail to protect you, in order to take legal action. You declined to do that. You can do it now, and see what they say.
