Have you seen account statements from the UTMA account? Do you know that it hasn't been misappropriated?
You can speak with a trust attorney in your area. This is a fiduciary violation on the part of the person who funded the money. You could sue them to compel them to fix this. It's entirely possible that a demand letter from the lawyer could fix this problem.
I am going to look into the trust attorney, should I find one near me or near the person who is the issue? I will try to settle the situation one last time, and then the lawyer letter sounds promising. Thank you very much you have helped with a lot of stress I have been having!
Thank you very much this is the most helpful information that i got since I've been looking! I have checked the statement and it doesn't look like anything is misappropriated, currently it is not allowing anything to be done with the money so it is safe in that regard.
Title: I need to go to the courts to get a UTMA account transferred in my name because someone is refusing to sign the transfer.
Any estate attorney in your area can likely help you. Calling your state/local bar association is a good way to get referrals, too. They often have discounted consultations, which can help.
