Wow. That a passenger is responsible for a driver's actions. And normally people don't have an obligation to report a crime outside of kids/teachers/mandated reporters. Weird how this is the exception I guess.
The person that they are dating owned the car, not my family member. No one was drunk and that wasn't what either of them were charged with (DUI). My family member was charged same as the driver, leaving the scene of an accident and not reporting it. But my family member was not driving. Two people can't drive the car at once. We are trying to find a lawyer but otherwise the police said one will be appointed. They haven't even tried to interview my family member yet so they don't realize they weren't driving the car. My family member was just arrested and immediately put in jail.
what is your family member charged with? if, for example, your family owns the car and knowingly let a drunk person drive it, your family member can be charged with certain crimes.
Both of them were in the car but my family member wasn't the driver and I'm trying to figure out how two people can be charged for it at the same time.
