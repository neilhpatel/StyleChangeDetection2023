The $25,000 sounds like a very common and acceptable tactic of getting out of filing an annual gift tax return. Each person (mom and dad separately) can give up to $15,000 per year to a person without having to file a gift tax return. So mom could give your husband $15,000 and dad could give your husband $15,000 and at the same time mom could give you $15,000 and dad could give you $15,000. Now, why not give you $30,000 instead of $25,000? Because you have to count all gifts, including Christmas, birthday, general gifts, etc. So there is a $5,000 buffer zone for gifts you might receive throughout the rest of the year.
But to give the maximum amount, it must be done completely separately. That's why you are getting a separate check from your husband. It is completely and fully to comply with gift tax law. This requires a little assumption on my part (I'm assuming that this is for gift tax reasons), but if it is for gift tax reasons, then it's very very common and acceptable and just has to be done this way (100% for legal and compliance reasons, nothing else). On the same note, I would assume loans are only made under one name because there is no reason to split it the way gift tax needs to be split. In fact, it would be twice the paperwork and cost to do two loans when one would do for your family.
Yes it’s specifically with the gift tax in mind. But isn’t it odd that his dad wants my husbands $25k to go to a separate account? Specifically to keep it protected in case of divorce in future and also to set precedence for any future gifts or loans. It’s such a small amount in comparison why keep it separate?
