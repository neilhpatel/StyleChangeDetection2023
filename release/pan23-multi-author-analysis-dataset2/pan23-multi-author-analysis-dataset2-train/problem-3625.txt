Your veins are coursing with plastic, weather patterns are shifting into unpredictability that threatens the food supply, and giant methane craters are exploding in the tundra, but have you TRIED just BEING OPTIMISTIC? .
The machine that brought us today's plenty stands poised to collapse upon itself and take everyone and everything with it. It is incredibly myopic and patronizing if the best we can be told to do is "accept the duty that comes with privilege" or "look on the bright side" as though smarter and more powerful minds have not tried to solve this problem and tens of millions of more obstinate or complacent minds than my own need to be changed for this to work.
EDIT: Since we're here, and as others have said, I think it's very important to point out that yes, pessimism is the brother of complacency and is counterproductive.
But my point isn't that we can't or shouldn't bother trying to do something about the problem because it's just too big (though it likely is), it's that it's incredibly frustrating to see these platitudes about this being the "best time in human history" or that mere optimism will change the trajectory of things.
If we are to look at all of human history, how about the several past decades where we can see human greed and obstinacy preventing or even opposing ANY meaningful government action on this issue? How about the fact that the overwhelming majority of our infrastructure still farts out incomprehensible amounts of GHG and continues to do so and grow in its capacity to do so every day as billions of people hunger for meat and fish and fuel and electricity and transportation and electronics?
There won’t be any change in the world as long as the people at the top remain old cunts who won’t live long enough to see the consequences of their greed and stupidity.
