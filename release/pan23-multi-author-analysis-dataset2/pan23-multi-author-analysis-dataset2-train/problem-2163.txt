How awful! First, the important thing to do is to help Grandmother as she passes on. Hold her hand, if you can, talk to her (she may indeed hear you even if she can't respond), just be there. Next, take care of yourself. This is going to be a tough time. Remember that in the next days or weeks you may not be thinking or making decisions clearly. If the hospice has a social worker, reach out to that person. Social workers, I have learned by experience, are wonder workers. If you need help making funeral arrangements, filing paperwork, finding a counselor or clergyperson for yourself, you name it--they can help.
Your grandmother is evidently not capable of handling things like producing her own will. Is there someone legally in charge of her day-to-day affairs? A durable power of attorney, if she made one while she was able, could designate an 'attorney-in-fact' for such things, but unless there is one, then wouldn't a court regard her next of kin as the logical person/people to handle such things? As I understand it, just a 'regular' power of attorney only gives someone the ability to act while the person is still competent, the 'durable' part designates that they keep that ability after a person is not competent.
The reason I mention this is that, unless you have designation as that person, then looking for and obtaining her will seems to me to be on shaky ground. For instance, if you were to go into her residence, look for and find the will, and remove it from the premises, I'd worry about what the (nasty-sounding) aunt/daughter would say about it to the authorities. Even going in and looking at it sounds questionable. There are questions for lawyers here.
