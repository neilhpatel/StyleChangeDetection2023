What is the scariest prediction that came true? There have been years of threats that are designed to make it sound like ahumanity is at risk and all of our lives will be drastically different by now . Look at old articles.from 20 years ago. Scary but it has all been noise. I'm thinking about no polar ice, increased severe hurricanes in the US, mass flooding if Florida ( remember the map that showed Florida almost completely underwater by now) or the like.
What's the point you're reading an article and talking about droughts, wildfires, shrinking polar caps. Then turnaround and go "the reasons for these things isn't agreed on". Yes it is by everyone but nutball pseudo science dinks. Those are the people you choose to believe because that's what you like. Did you know Ronald Reagans phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons had an extreme impact on the environment. These are the kind of things that change projections and seem to confuse you. Even republicans used to be smart enough to help the environment.
