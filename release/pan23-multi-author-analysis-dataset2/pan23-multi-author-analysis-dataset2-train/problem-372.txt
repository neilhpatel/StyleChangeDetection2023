Yeah remember that one young athlete which was under sweedish or finland flag and after he won medal he presented Z symbol and praised the war or shit like that? Fuck'em.
Sure I dont have trouble with this... I just dont want double standards, next time USA attacks someone, or if Israel does it. Ban their athletes also.
They can leave Russia if they want to compete. Where they're born isn't a choice, but for those with means, where they live and pledge alliance to is.
They should be forced to defect if they want to compete. It's not their fault that they were born in Russia, but it is their fault they continue to live there.
They've had every opportunity to not be a pariah state, it's their own actions that have brought this upon them. If they don't want to be a pariah state, they're more than welcome to completely pull out of all internationally recognized Ukrainian territory and start making amends.
If they refuse to do that, then I'm glad the world is turning their backs on Russia. They don't deserve to interact with the rest of us.
