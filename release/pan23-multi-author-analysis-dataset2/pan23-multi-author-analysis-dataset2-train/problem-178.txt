Trees, yes, but not so sure this rule applies to vines or other fast-growing plants crossing over a borderline. It's Op's property to maintain as OPs sees fit.
In VA, you own anything on your side of the property line. If a neighbor plants a sapling directly on the line and it grows into a giant tree, any part of that tree that is on your side, you own and can do with as you please. If your neighbor won't reign in their plants, you are within your rights to cut down anything crossing the line.
I had to do with with some pretty sizable trees my neighbor, ignorant of this law, decided to plant directly on the property line to keep as much of their yard as possible. They had zero regard for my yard that would be eaten up by the trees. These were cypresses, so they grow out fat at the bottom. I just trimmed them back to the line on my side and problem solved. Of course this wasn't plan A, and the neighbors weren't too happy when they finally noticed, but they didn't consult prior to planting, and had a chance to do something proactively when the issue was brought to them and refused.
This is no different than any other invasive plant, tree, ivy, bamboo crossing into your yard. You can cut it off at the property line. I have to cut my neighbor's ivy at my property line weekly. If you have a good relationship with your neighbor, you might give him notice they you will be cutting them.
I know some states you need permission from neighbors prior to building anything with in so meany feet of property. May exist, may apply in your state.
