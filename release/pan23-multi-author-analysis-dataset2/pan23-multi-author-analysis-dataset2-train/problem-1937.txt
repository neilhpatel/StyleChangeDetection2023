You can speak to an employment attorney to get their opinion. Getting one to work on your case pro bono is unlikely. You can file a complaint with the EEOC, but if you have no way to prove what you're alleging, it may be dead in the water. Your testimony is evidence, but it would be more of an uphill battle.
It may be wrong, but it's doubtful that it was illegal. Businesses aren't courts of law. They don't have to meet some burden of proof to be able to fire you. Absent an employment contract, you can be fired for many things. Even being accused (not proven) that you harassed someone.
Free lawyers aren't the default. Nothing you've described sounds like anything a lawyer would be willing to represent you for free about.
Send them a certified letter asking for your property back by a certain date or you'll file a small claims court suit against them.
Did you specifically ask to fill out ADA forms for an accommodation or did you just ask to take a day off? Those are two different things.
Doctor's notes aren't binding. They don't have to let you leave. Did you request any accommodations pursuant to ADA?
Are you African American? Did they say in regards to you? Did you ever report either of these things happening?
