I guess I should edit that when I get a sec. This guy showed up 2 weeks ago. The paper he handed them and the judge say that they were served 3 months ago.
Is there a chance they received alternate service? You can look it up on the court's website. But yeah, they at minimum got served by the Hawaiian shirt guy.
When we talked to them we were exploring possible ways and they said the Hawaiian shirt guy was the first they've heard about the house or the property taxes. They knew they were behind, but hadn't heard it from anyone until him.
Hawaiian shirt guy served them, but his papers said they were the 2nd set and that they had 5 days to get out. Judge and Hawaiian shirt guy said they had already been served 3 months ago. The description of who they served doesn't match anyone at all in the house. Not even by a best guess. Paper says a 63 year old woman who is 5'3" that has short black hair. Only women in the house are my mom, who's 4'11", 50 years old, with long blonde hair, and my 5'7", 20 year old sister who has long black hair. Or my grandma who was too weak to get up unassisted, who was 4'10", 80 something, with short white hair.
This may prove to be a painful period for you and it is good you are trying to help, but you need to recognize and respect that this is your parent's problem. They need to take speedy ownership of resolving, but if they don't they don't. Either way this will be a huge life lesson for you.
