Some states have laws to protect consumers that allows them to cancel a contract for services within some period of time. At which point you cancel the check and tell your contractor you changed your mind. You didn't mention your location however.
You can attempt to cancel, but he'd be entitled to some amount for sunday's consultation, time spent on the project, materials bought etc.
But...you're paying in full up front? That's not normal operating procedure for home improvements. You pay a deposit, with the balance paid after work is done. If you pay in full up front, nothing is going to stop this contractor from ghosting you.
There are tons of good contractors out there, but way, way too often it comes down to final payment leverage to get things done to your satisfaction. It sounds like you have some hesitation already... Do not pay everything upfront!
Paying in full up front is typically not normal. Is this originally what you agreed to? Or is this something the contractor requested after he'd lost your check? Typically a contractor would request some amount up front and then the remaining balance upon completion for smaller jobs like this.
