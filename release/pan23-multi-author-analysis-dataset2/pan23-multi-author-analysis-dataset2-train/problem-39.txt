There are mobile notary services in NYC, you may want to call and ask how they would handle this. Since covid, I believe there are some remote/online notary services as well.
Second, apparently holographic wills are not valid in New York, so you will need a signed will with 2 witnesses. They don't need to be notaries, but this could be helpful. It may be possible to use an online notary for this, i'm not sure.
I would not leave this to chance unless you're completely sure that your family will follow your wishes. If there's any chance they would just take your property, then you need a will.
So, first, you should go to the hospital for treatment. Some of the treatments we use like Dexamethasone have a small mortality benefit. Also if you need O2, it will be beneficial and make you much more comfortable while battling COVID.
If you’re at the hospital, and still feel like things are heading south, usually the hospital has case workers that can help you with wills and things of that nature. Not sure how they’re handling it with COVID, but best option here if you still feel the need is to ask.
ALSO, if you have a life insurance policy, you can change the beneficiary to your girlfriend, and this operates entirely outside of the will. You can probably do this online, but it might be safer to call so there's an audio recording. If you have any other accounts with beneficiaries (like 401k's or the like), you should set them as the beneficiary.
