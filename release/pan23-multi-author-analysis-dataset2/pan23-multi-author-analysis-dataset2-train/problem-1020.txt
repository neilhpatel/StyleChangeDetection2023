ah fuck this reddit thread, fucking downvoting fucking everything jesus fucking christ. i was asking a legitmate question, not to mention i mentioned how my mental health was in the shitter, thanks for fucking it up. not to you specifically but just to everyone in general. why am i not surprised that everyone on reddit is equally a asshole prick who literally doesn't give a shit about anybody. none of you came close to even trying to answering what i asked. literally fuck this shit, i don't even know why i though reddit was even remotely close to a good idea.
Calling CPS does not necessarily mean you will be removed from the home. Their intervention may be able to help you receive the therapy it sounds like you desperately want/need.
again how is that helpful to what the post was asking, it was to ask for legal advice regarding the question and its confines. it seems you don't understand how this has affected my life and its entirety...
