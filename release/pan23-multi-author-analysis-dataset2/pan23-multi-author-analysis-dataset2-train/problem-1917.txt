You can have Medicaid while living with family, the mother and child count as one "household" while the grandfather is a different "household." Also, you can be declared disabled by a doctor and qualify for Medicaid despite having an income while also not being eligible for social security payments. Furthermore, the limits for Medicaid for children are higher than that for adults. Lastly, you can have private insurance AND medicaid. Private insurance pays first and then medicaid pays on what's left. This typically leaves a zero payment due for children. It's very likely in this instance that your child will remain Medicaid eligible despite you having her 50/50 and having her on your insurance.
There should be a helpline for Medicaid in your area. It would be a good idea to call and ask these types of questions.
Most likely yes. The government generally will knock a child off of medicaid if one or both parents has the option of health insurance through their job. Now if both you and her mother have the option of health insurance through your jobs, it may go either way since the custody arrangement is 50/50. It could come down to who has the better insurance or the higher income.
