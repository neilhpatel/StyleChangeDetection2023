No lease would technically make you a month to month tenant. You still would owe that back rent. If you have a copy of the lease it exists and you should give them a copy of it. That just means the previous management company did not file all papers and documents properly.
You would get paperwork if they were to attempt to kick you out. If you had your lease in court they would owe you money plus legal fees.
I'm just trying to figure out if we're technically squatting or not and going to be kicked out of my apt.
If you signed a lease you are not squatting. If you have a copy of the lease that is best, because it has all the dates on it as well. (This also means they probably have no idea about your security deposit, etc...).
Even if you were a squatter, they would still have to formally evict you, which means providing you with a notice and then going to court after the notice expires. Once it went to court, you would be able to take the original lease (which is still valid even if the new company doesn't have a copy) to the judge.
There's 0 chance of you getting legally kicked out tomorrow. If the landlord tries, it is an illegal eviction.
But if you want, there's nothing wrong with getting professional legal advice on this. More importantly, if at any point, they start trying to pressure you (to leave, change the lease before renewal, etc) find a lawyer you trust and begin looking for a new place for when the lease ends. The "find a new place" advice also applies if they don't have easy communication lines by the time the lease is up. Trust me, you don't want a property manager you can't contact.
You already have you answer from others. You owe the rent and it would be best to provide them a copy of your lease that you signed.
No, its trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do because according to them I dont even live here.
I dont really want to be homeless. I've literally been trying to pay my back rent for 3 months now and they've made it impossible.
