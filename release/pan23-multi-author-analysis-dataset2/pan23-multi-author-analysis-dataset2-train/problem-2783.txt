Correct. The officer actually actually eyerolled pretty hard when I explained the situation. I just want to be clear about whether there's actually a legal issue here. Especially as my kids are getting to be teenagers with more autonomy.
The legal answer is that a 12-year-old can go to his other parent's house to pick up a coat. That doesnâ€™t mean that you can go into the house, or even that you should necessarily be in the driveway. The practical answer is that if you know the other parent has been volatile, then you should just go to Walmart and spend 20 bucks on a new coat.
Based on your version of the story only, you did nothing wrong legally and your ex is crazy pants. But if this happens again, park on the street, as you know he doesn't want you in his driveway. And to be clear, you were not charged with a crime, correct?
