the jury runs the deliberations. if one is a holdout (either guilty or not guilty) it is ultimately a hung jury and the state can try the person again. judges can give an instruction along the lines that no other jury would be better suited and to continue deliberations, if it appears deadlocked. but, ultimately, it is up to the jurors whether they continue or believe they are hopelessly deadlocked.
so if there are 2-3 rock solid jurors for not guilty, person is actually not acquitted, but charged again, possibly over and over, forever? Isn't that punishment by itself?
it has to be a unanimous verdict. the person is charged again, he is tried again (legal distinction). sometime the state tries the person again, other times not.
make different arguments, refine arguments, change the way evidence is introduced, try to exclude something the defense did, different jurors, more evidence...could be lots of things.
I have been in a jury that didn't agree before. It wasn't one against all but everyone talked and we came to an agreement regarding the charges and outcomes.
No one is pressed to do anything. They discuss why they disagree. Then everyone talks. Talks about what they think, why they disagree, clarify things, ask to look at evidence again if that is an option. The jury foreman controls everything and directed discussion.
