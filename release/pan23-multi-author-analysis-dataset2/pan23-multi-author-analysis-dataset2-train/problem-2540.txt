IAAL in Ohio but not yours. Are the tax liens all originating from the Ohio Dept of Taxation? If so, the Sellers chances of negotiating a release of the liens as a block (at least as they apply to this particular property) in the 45 day window is not so bad. 10% seems pretty low for settlement but it’s technically possible. The CPA may need to file back returns and could have calculated a lower balance actually owed (vs what was assessed). The amount is also not really your problem unless Sellers equity is to low to pay more from the proceeds. In your contract they presumably agreed to pay all liens so as long as there is funds they are obligated. If the liens are old they are probably already in collection (usually with a subcontractor company called Revenue Group). They would have authority to settle and could probably do it relatively quickly.
If you have a sales contract for a warrantee deed (the usual case), then the seller is required to provide title free and clear of all liens or other encumbrances. So, this is really the seller's problem.
If liens are held by state and IRS, it would likely be a longer process. IRS is incredibly backed up now and anything needing a person to look at it has a waiting time measures in months. Probably enough to make me walk unless the property was special and my family could make it work.
Remember that the Sellers’ attorney, CPA, and the title company are actively trying to see this sale go through. They are getting paid to make this happen for the Seller (and vicariously you) and want to help things go smoothly. Although I’d always advise you obtain personal counsel I’d definitely lean on them with any questions you may have.
