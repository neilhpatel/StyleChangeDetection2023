Attempts to rigidly define the pre-conversion roots - or to deny the pre-conversion roots - of Christian holidays is problematic. The process of conversion was complicated and often gradual when it came to folk customs and calendar celebrations. It is a broad river that pass through time - drawing on many tributaries and emptying into a wide delta, all the while, the water from various sources mixing thoroughly.

The earliest reference to a connection between Christmas and Mithraism appears in the work of Paul Jablonski, an eighteenth century Protestant who invented the idea to criticize the Catholic Church. \[2\] In reality, Mithraism had no festival on December 25. \[3\].

The same can be said of St. Bridget's Day, Easter, Halloween/All Saint's Day, etc. Even when these days had Christian anchors that were more or less secure in their own way, pre-conversion folk practices either put wind in their sails or not, influencing whether the celebrations were popular or not ... and more importantly, influencing the way the celebrations were practiced.
It is incorrect to say that Christmas was celebrated on December 25 because of a specific reason - the reasons were complex. Equally, it is incorrect to think of the celebration of the birth of Jesus landing on December 25 without any pre-conversion influence, as was asserted by a well-documented answer that has since been deleted; answers regarding the origins of holidays are complex.
My previous post (now edited), did not assert there was no pre-conversion influence. It made the far more narrow claim that scholarship generally dismisses the idea that the date of Jesus' birth was based on pagan equinox festivities.
It was unrelated to Mithraism. By the time the date December 25 had been settled on, Mirthraism was a virtually dead religion and Mithraites were adopting Christianity. \[1\].

There is no connection to the Roman festivals for Sol Invictus. During the very time that December 25 was adopted widely by the Church as the date of Jesus' birth, the key dates for festive activities in celebration of Sol were in October and August, not December. \[4\].
The Christian celebration of Saint John's Eve started in the fourth century. Is there historical evidence that it was created to replace a pagan festival?
In fact, the only evidence for pagan festivals being held on December 25, is only found in the historical record after December 25 had already been adopted by Christians. \[5\] This suggests that pagans were attempting to claim the date as a reaction to Christian religion, rather than the other way around. \[6\].
