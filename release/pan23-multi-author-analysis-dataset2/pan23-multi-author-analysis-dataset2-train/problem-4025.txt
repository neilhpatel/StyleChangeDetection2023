Oh I already have all that. It’s been done but I’m trying to figure out what those actions are called. I’m past all that fun stuff and am in the midst of a legal spiff and needed the term. To me, that’s harassment but the EEOC states it very specifically like making rude comments regarding my disabilities.
It’s not but they continually get onto me without knowing the context and goes on a power trip only to end up looking stupid? They denied it to me flat out without providing options. I’ve filed internal complaints for a hostile work environment and discrimination of disability but they concluded it wasn’t. They didn’t harass me _because_ I’m disabled but they knowingly bullied me which caused 3 suicidal triggers. Nothing was done afterwards.
