Was the order issued by a criminal court subsequent to a DV arrest, or did you apply for it yourself in a civil court ?
In general, if you leave Florida's jurisdiction, and/or you never make a complaint to police or the court about your fiance/husband's violation of the court order, then there won't be any consequences.
It is not helpful to re-ask a legaladvice question while leaving out important details to see if you get an answer you prefer.
Your husbands needs to deal with any criminal matter pending and see the order lifted before he does this. He risks prosecution if he takes any other path.
Edit: OP, you badly buried the lede. You're the "can we get married to cancel a restraining order" poster who claims their mother somehow got a restraining order on their behalf despite being an adult.
