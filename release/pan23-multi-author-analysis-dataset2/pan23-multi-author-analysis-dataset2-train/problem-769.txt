Additionally, I'd recommend getting a good Personal Injury Lawyer who works with those in gig economy. If the accident happened in California, look into lawyers in California primarily. Most lawyers will give you a free consultation, especially with what I know regarding PI law (being in California PI law myself). Ask your lawyer regarding the cross state issue, additionally.
As far as I'm aware, Uber is required to also have insurance for drivers in the case they get into an accident. I'd try getting into contact with them.
Oh, I think I misunderstood. Uber will likely cover damages. I'm not your lawyer, but I'm relatively certain that the other insurance provider case will need to be a separate one entirely.
I'm not sure if the incorrect insurance is more of an issue with the individual who sold you the insurance or with the company itself. I think we'd have to see all the elements and points of the insurance you have and the insurance coverage options that they have. It's also possible that the insurance covered gig work in New York but not outside of the state.
Found out my insurance said I didn't mention Uber which I just signed up in July 2021 and the policy in same month. Only have done UberEATS and didn't get ridershare because of what I learned to believe it for taxing people around. I was strictly delivery. I told em what I was using the car for, to delivery of service. They have a recording and I ask to hear it, but don't know if thet will happen Do I have legal options? I don't know what type of lawyer I would need. And advice would be greatly appreciated. Robb.
No of course not. I only wanted to say that your case will probably require more time and focus than Reddit is able to give you.
