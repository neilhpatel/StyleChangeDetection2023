OP, you were the victim of domestic violence. Strangulation is a huge escalation in level, and some studies show when strangulation enters the DV picture, the targeted family member is 70% more likely to be murdered. Your son, while technically a child, is very close to the age of majority. If he pulled this on a classmate or a teacher, he would likely be prosecuted as an adult. You were assaulted. You may be in danger in your own home. You need to report him to the police. If you wouldn’t piss me off, you wouldn’t get hit is a classic abuse line. You are being abused by your child.
Honestly you’d be doing your son a favor to call the police and report this assault. He needs to learn that this type of behavior is not acceptable.
Your son assaulted you and the next step should be to call the police. If he is booked and put in juvenile detention then the county can also help get you in contact with a social worker of some sort who can look into anger management services for him being a condition of his release.
