Had a Russian dude like that in my EET classes. Guy scoffed that his RU certifications weren't recognized, then proceeded to cheat his ass off from the first mother fucking term. I even had an instructor approach me to see if I knew that he was cheating off me. Oh - and then he proceeded to get kicked out of an unpaid internship with a local hospital.
But fuck us for not accepting his EE cert that apparently didn't even test as far Ohm's Fucking Law.
What's even more depressing is there's non Russians in other countries that have never been to Russia, who think Russia is better off than where they currently live.
Eh, it was pretty chill for tourists up until the war this year. Visited Moscow in 2019, had a really great time. Obviously not happening again any time soon, but would be cool to see St Petersburg too once (if) things get back to normal in the future….
I lived there for a year in the early 2010s. It was a great experience and I met so many lovely people. All of my friends have been publicly against the war (risky), and I am so proud of them for standing up. Russian people aren’t bad, and there is lots Russia has to offer. I’m furious that bad governments and greedy people ruin all the good things.
