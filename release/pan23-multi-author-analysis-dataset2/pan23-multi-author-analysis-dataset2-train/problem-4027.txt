Were you terminated? I agree with other responses that the plain language only applies to people who were terminated.
What exactly did you "sign" in the handbook? Was it just an acknowledgement of receiving the handbook or did it expressly say that you are entering into a contract/agreement?
Separately, there's no reason why you couldn't go to the job interview. If it goes really well and you get an offer, you may be able to delay your start date until after the 90-days has elapsed.
True, but the meaning of words in contracts are construed based on what's in the contract. Unless it's specifically defined to include firing and voluntary quits in the contract, "termination" would generally be interpreted to mean involuntary firing.
But wouldn’t you say that this is probably unenforceable because of the core requirement for protecting business interests?
When I learned about NCAs in law school it almost always surrounded specific or special business practices or proprietary information — what kind of special practice or proprietary information could a daycare possibly have to require an NCA?
I guess there’s an argument to be made for taking clients from one business, but I’m not sure if that would rise to the level of protecting a businesses interests so much that an NCA would be enforceable.
I didn't see anywhere in OP's post indicating they signed any agreement; they said it was simply in the employee manual. I think the question is whether the info in the manual can be considered a Non-Compete Agreement.
