Absolutely not. We recently went through something similar where our landlord was trying to get new tenants after we told them we weren’t renewing our lease after expiration. The property manager told us she would give us 24+ hours of notice before showings and that we should have the house “spotless.” It was tidy and kept (we have three young kids so that was a small miracle), but not spotless and we got a not-so-friendly email about it. I reminded her - absent damage to the property or a health violation - there is not requirement we keep the house perfectly clean, even for showings. She backed off after that.
Im not sure.., but would I be introuble if the place wasn't deep cleaned? If they can still come inside the home legally and find clothes on my bedroom floor could they punish me legally in anyway?
24 hour notice is the norm, check your lease. You can insist on that for every showing or other entrance. They can also have an open house.
You can make it hard for the realtor, but there is no value added in that. Work out something mutually agreeable.
