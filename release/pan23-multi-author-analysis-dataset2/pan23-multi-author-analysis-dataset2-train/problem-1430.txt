My condolences. I would contact a med mal attorney ASAP. The attorney should handle all the leg work in getting copies of medical records. Just a head's up that med mal cases are some of the toughest cases to prosecute and extremely expensive (the attorney will advance costs.) So it may take some effort to find an attorney willing to take the case but don't give up after a couple rejections.
Nobody can give you an informed opinion about the strenh of a medical malpractice case in this forum. Your mom would need a formal consultation with a medical malpractice attorney, who will likely need to have a medical expert review all of her medial records before an opinion can be rendered as to the viability of a potential case.
You can get a referral to a malpractice lawyer via the Law Society of Ontario. That comes with a 30-minute consult, which will be oriented less around advising you on your case and more around advising you on what a lawyer can or can't do for you. If your case is or is not promising, your lawyer should be pretty clear with you about that during a consult.
