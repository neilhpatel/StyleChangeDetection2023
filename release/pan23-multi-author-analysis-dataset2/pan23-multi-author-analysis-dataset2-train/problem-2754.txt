Even the tanks were sending were mothballed. We’re just paying to have them cleaned up and the uranium replaced with tungsten. General Dynamics is the only company that does this and they were awarded the contract for Ukraines tanks. So while the government said Ukraine was getting tanks “from an industry order” and makes you think brand new tank.. it’s actually just some old tanks from a warehouse somewhere getting refurbished. Honestly the return on value of aid to ukraine is off the charts.
. The "donations" to Ukraine from the US have been largely mothballed, outdated kit that appears on the balance sheet as its as-new replacement cost. There's a decent chance that the US is saving money on the venture since by sending it to Ukraine they don't have to pay to maintain and decommission it (they did this with aid to Iraq as well, apparently). That's not the case for all aid, of course - it's not all old kit and ammo is an everpresent concern.
That's one of the many reason's I've always treated "complaints" about aid to Ukraine as either maliciously dishonest or ignorant and mean spirited.
You're also completely leaving out that all of the military aid packages have been part of the Lend Lease Act and will either be repaid monetarily or by requiring Ukraine to use US contractors to rebuild.
