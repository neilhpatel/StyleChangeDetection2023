Could have been a faulty missile motor or seeker. In the 2017 shootdown of an Su-22 the AIM-9X—same missile used in these balloon incidents—went “stupid” as soon as it fired according to the pilot’s account. Second missile (AIM-120 if my memory is correct) is what downed it.
“…the latest shootdown of an unidentified object on Sunday by an F-16 fighter jet took two sidewinder missiles - after one of them failed to down the target, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.”.
It's not really crazy to think that there might be a time where you have to shoot more then one.for effect.
I saw a lot of unexploded ordnance during my time overseas. Definitely not perfect-just the closest thing to it so far (in terms of guided explodey things).
As the integrity of the balloon is compromised after being shot with bullets, it’s flightpath becomes unpredictable. Safer to drop it as straight and quickly as possible. When Canada shot a weather balloon with 20mm it ended up crashing in Finnish territory. Descending along the way would have made it a hazard to civil air traffic.
