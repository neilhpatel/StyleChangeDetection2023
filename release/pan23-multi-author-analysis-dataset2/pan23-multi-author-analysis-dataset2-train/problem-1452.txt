We can't tell you how reliable a particular attorney is either, but since this is a misdemeanor, you should have one. If you are indigent, you may be eligible for a public defender.
Those aren't points as to your innocence. You're not innocent. These are points you're raising as to why someone might want to show you mercy. But in this particular offense, those arguments may not be terribly well received.
You have the same choices as all guilty of their offense. You can take your lump. You can show up and hope for some lenience. Or you can force the state to prove up its case (that doesn't sound hard here).
None of these are a defense to the charge. They are possible reasons for a lower sentence than the maximum. But I have to tell you that a clean driving record at age 19 is not really all that impressive. You've been licensed 3 years, not 20.
You've engaged in an “exhibition of speed” if he accelerates or drives at a rate of speed that is dangerous and unsafe, in order to show off. It sounds like from your own description that is what you were doing with your "burnout." Sudden acceleration may qualify even if it's not at high speed.
