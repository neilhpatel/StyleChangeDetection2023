It's not very hard for your ISP to pull records about your web browsing and your accounts and figure out who you are, sometimes they also have information about your local network, your machines's network address and MAC. For example, they could also find a history of posts like this one on reddit, even if it's deleted, and see what email address it's registered to. They can do things like track the logins that have occured from other places like phones and see who the phones are registered to. And if they really did suspect you were a terrorist and really didn't know who in the house did it, it's possible everyone in the house could be arrested and investigated.
Even if they would report it, FBI has nothing to do with my country. Best they can do is ask police here to investigate it.
As you should be what you committed is a class D felony. Judging by the fact your account is only 20 some days old youâ€™re either trolling or just really foolish.
Neither did the girl in that news story. Foreign countries are usually pretty cooperative with helping investigate terrorist threats.
