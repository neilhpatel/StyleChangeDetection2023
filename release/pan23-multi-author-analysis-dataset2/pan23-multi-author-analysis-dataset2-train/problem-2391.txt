If your mother moves in and receives any more threats she has documentation to back up, she could seek a restraining order that requires the tenants to move out. Iâ€™m not sure how that would hold up in a landlord/tenant situation but it may be worth a shot.
The moratorium is only for hardships due to COVID. If they're creating a health/safety hazard, they can still be evicted. Threatening your mom's safety and the safety of other tenants may be enough to rise to that level. She should speak with an attorney about alternative methods of eviction other than nonpayment of rent.
There's a comment a little further down that sort of outlines the problems specific to our city right now. She had had three separate attorneys take her case. She had an eviction warrant granted for January 1st but the moratorium went back into effect and now it seems like no attorney can do anything. She had a difficult time as it was finding the most recent attorney to take her case, that attorney had a virtual hearing explaining the specific circumstances and outlining the safety concerns and they just said nothing could be done until May. From what her last attorney said the judge handling her case is very set on siding with tenants in most cases, which I get to an extent but when there is documented safety concerns it seems like there should be an exception to the rule.
