My brain is oatmeal right now so I can't remember what it's called but there's a concept that occasionally gets brought up in employment offers, where someone takes action based on a promised job and then the promised job falls through. It's rarely applicable but your state matters.
I would assume you don't have a job then, unfortunately. I know that sucks but I'd start looking elsewhere immediately.
That's what I was thinking of. It's one of those phrases that gets tossed around at the drop of a hat and 99.999% of the time has nothing to do with the situation, but depending on OP's state this could be one of those rare instances where it matters.
It sounds like you need to go back to HR services again and say "thanks for your advice -- I called the employee help desk and they said I'm not in the system. Where do I go from here?".
You should definitely get in touch with an employment lawyer. Also, call back HR, explain how you've hit a dead end at every turn and if they can't help you, you'll be seeking legal advice. That tend to get things moving.
Also, the fact that you went to the building with multiple other new hires will play into your favour if you can prove this occured.
