Wasn’t netanyahoo opposed to a nuke deal? Don’t they want no deal? It’s pretty clear the sanctions are the goal not a deal.
For the past twenty years netanyahoo has said Iran is 6 months away from a nuke as part of begging for free us weapons. That’s a long 6 months.
Depends on the terms of the deal. From Israel's perspective, a deal like what Obama signed, is worse than no deal. So, if such deal is signed, there is a high probability that Israel will strike. But, there are terms that Israel would find satisfactory.
In a nutshell, strike or no strike is not function of deal or not, but function of how close Iran is to getting the bomb. I.e. if there is no deal or there is a bad deal, but Iran doesn't do sudden moves: then there is no strike. A deal can prevent Israel's strike if Israel is convinced that terms of the deal make it impossible for Iran to make such sudden moves.
Israel just doesn't want their neighbors having nukes at any cost. Iran in particular right now given they have been trying to develop them.
While its debatable if the countries themselves would use them even if they had them. The big concern is a Muslim terrorist organization getting a hold of one or more of them.
The talks and deals don't really accomplish anything for Israel other then potentially delaying Iran a little longer.
It's not like it's exactly hard to develop an almost 100 year old technology that countries such as Pakistan, North Korea, and a number of others have developed.
