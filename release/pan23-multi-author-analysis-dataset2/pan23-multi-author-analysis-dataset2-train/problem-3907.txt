> The term "supervisor" means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.
I worked for a property management company located in Oregon but they had one residential property in Washinon and they did write one of our managers because she said to me how many hours she worked and I bragged about working 90 hours but didn't get overtime. She was written up and told that I turned her in and she made me uncomfortable which is a lie. We were overheard.

Except in some limited circumstances, you are legally allowed to talk about wages as it's a protected activity. Are you a manager?
