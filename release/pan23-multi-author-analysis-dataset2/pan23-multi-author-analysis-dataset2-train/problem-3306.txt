You don't press charges, the State of Utah presses charges; the officer is basically saying "do you want me to file a report up the chain to see if charges are pressed?" No one can sue you for saying yes. It's unfortunate that the officer is putting this on your shoulders. If you say no, will the kid be unpunished, will they receive no treatment, will they think they can keep doing this?
Press charges on that pos and please keep your son away from him even if that means switching schools or something. I suggest you talk to your son and ask him what’s going on and if he was actually friends with that kid or if he just felt like he couldn’t not hang out with him, therapy’s would definitely be a good idea as well as these kinds of betrayals and humiliation as a kid can really mess with ones psyche. As far as the grandma goes, If she even so much as tries to interfere negatively with your job this situation is enough in itself to launch and investigation on her. Hoping for the best to you and your son. Be extra gentle with him and if he needs space give it to him.
In regards to protecting your son, you could file a petition for a child protective order on his behalf. You'd need to show there's an imminent risk of abuse (Which is narrowly read as physical or sexual harm), but I can't find anything in regards to how it changes if the respondent is a child. I'd want to consult a local attorney before going down that route.
