At the time of our separation, I was making very little money and he held it up in court as much as he could to make me capitulate early on.
My husband anticipates my ex-husband will just cross his arms and refuse to budge, but we have medical evidence to back up our claim. My husband says we should skip mediation entirely.
I get the issue, though your original post said your ex was incapable of administering the shots when you were married. And this statement says she didn’t have to take it at that time of separation.
Besides talking to your lawyer about modification to your agreement to say 5pm, what does the school say about their ability to store your child's medicines?
Seems like a modification to the plan based upon medical need is likely best. It is one thing to ask the school to possibly administer but something tells me the school will not want the liability, if the nurse isn’t an RN or a ARNP.
So just to be clear, it makes more sense for our child to transport expensive and potentially dangerous medicine a block down the road to the school and have them administer it to her as opposed to her walking 100 yards home where I can give it to her and have her dad pick her up at 3:05 PM?
