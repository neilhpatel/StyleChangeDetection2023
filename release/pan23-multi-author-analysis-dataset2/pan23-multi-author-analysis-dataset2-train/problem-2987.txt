Also, don't voluntarily leave your home. Get back in there and maintain your rights to your property. You have no obligation to be the one to leave because you're splitting up, especially since you're not married and the house is in your name.
She's...not getting any of your money unless you live in one of the VERY few common law marriage state (Colorado, District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, New Hampshire, Utah).
However, there are still other states where the case law is still developing, or there is still case law that would support division of assets despite not considering the relationship the legal equivalent of a marriage. For instance, read up on "committed intimate relationships" in Washinon State.
As for selling the house - who owns the house? If it's in your name only, did she contribute to the mortgage (or could she argue she contributed to the mortgage by paying bills, buying groceries, etc. in lieu of a contribution to mortgage, while you didn't pay those bills b/c you were covering the mortgage?).
There's a lot of nuance that this answer is missing. In some states, "common law" marriage isn't really common law at all because it is a defined part of the statutory law in that state (e.g. Iowa). In other states, there is common law marriage that has a well-defined case history (e.g. Rhode Island). Those are the two categories that the states you listed belong to.
