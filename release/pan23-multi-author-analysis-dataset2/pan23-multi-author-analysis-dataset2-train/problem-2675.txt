Israeli settlers are known the commit acts of terrorism against Arabs and recently the Israeli government moved to put some of their most radical leaders in charge of the West Bank with no one but Netanyahu having the authority to check their power. They already enjoyed near impunity for their attacks under previous Israeli governments but with Smotrich, a dude who was literally arrested by the Shin Bet for trying commit arson attacks during the Gaza pullout, and Ben-Gvir, another psycho who celebrated the cave of the patriarchs terrorist attack, being allowed to turn the west bank into their fiefdom the violence against Arabs is only going to intensify.
Look up the borders for the UN mandated Jewish state, look up the borders of the west bank, look up what Israel looks like today, and ask yourself what you're talking about.
Edit: you can downvote all you want but there's literally nothing pointing to proof that this was deliberate. Even AJ over here is putting it in quotes.
They were down fixing a tire and someone who was speeding hit them. I can't attribute malice to something just as likely to be recklessness.
