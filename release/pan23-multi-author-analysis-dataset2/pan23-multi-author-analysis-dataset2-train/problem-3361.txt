Biden unilaterally overriding the voters (which I don’t think is legal) to replace the first female VP (who is also a POC) with a slick white guy sounds like a great way to turn off your base. Not to mention it makes Newsom look like he couldn’t win the primaries on his own but needed help to get there. Plus, I think he’s a bad national candidate (I’m a Californian and have voted for him several times but think his inauthenticity won’t play against more competition, and also until the homelessness issue is somewhat solved California candidate will be a hard sell.).
