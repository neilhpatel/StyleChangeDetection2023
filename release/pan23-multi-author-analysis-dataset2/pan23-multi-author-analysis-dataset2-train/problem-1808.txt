ER's provide short course to allow you to establish with a provider whether it be your PCP or specialists. If you must, you can go back to ER or UC, but nothing is guaranteed and you will be paying for the visit.
We tried to contact his PCP, but their office already closed. Even if we had called yesterday, when it happened, I doubt we could’ve gotten in by today. Like I said, he has an appointment with the ortho on Monday, he just needs like 4 more pills? I feel like that’s not too much to ask, we’ll be out of their hair by then. I just don’t understand what it is that they expect him to do in this situation? I feel like our only options are go back or an urgent care place that might not help him.
If you go back, you will get billed and required to pay. They can refuse. The ER isn't for pain management, once they get you stabilized they have done their job. I would look into an urgent care facility if he's that desperate but I've had multiple bones broken at one time and yes it sucked, but I managed when pain killer Rx ran out after a few days.
