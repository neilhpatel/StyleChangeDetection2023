The low altitude close to your home is problematic for the pilot. The pilot is in violation of 14 CFR §91.119   Minimum safe altitudes: General which states.
Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft below the following altitudes:
(b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.
(c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.
Section c is where the pilot runs into an issue if he is actually as low as you say and that close to your home. Now that he knows that the property has an occupant he may also be in violation of 91.13.
Report the pilot, those FAA guidelines are in place for a good reason and "my boss told me to do it" isn't a valid excuse for violating them. The state can hire a plane or heli with proper observation equipment if they need to see individual moose.
