I might be slightly happier if we stopped changing the clocks, but I find myself with literally the “young kids going to school in the morning” consideration. They walk about a quarter mile, and I pass families walking their kids up to half a mile. If we didn’t change the clocks back to standard, they’d be walking before sunrise part of the year. And if we didn’t switch back to daylight savings, I wouldn’t get to enjoy long evenings in the summer. So I deal with walking around my house for a few minutes updating clocks, and feeling a bit out of sorts for a day or two.
