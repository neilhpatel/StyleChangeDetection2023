I have knowledge on this area of law for BC. Not a lawyer, not your lawyer, and I can't provide legal advice. All of the legalities surrounding BC residential rental law is covered under a statute called the Resident Tenancy Act. It is specific to BC, any commenters from out of province may not know the rules in our jurisdiction.
Landlords in BC have a difficult time evicting people now, it's nearly impossible. As a renter, after your first year, you have the rights to continue renting 'you have tenure'. It's basically your space at this point.
The law was changed to be advantageous to tenants a few years ago to end fixed term (read: one year) tenancies. These were being used by landlords to increase rent faster, there is only one kind of lease now in BC for regular tenancies such as yours.
There are only a few reasons that you could be evicted. Key ones are landlords use of property (themself or family living in the space) or for renovation, or for sale of the property where the new owner requires vacant space for themselves to move in. For renovation had rule changes this year to stop superficial renovations from resulting in tenants being evicted. You can read about that here.
Maybe they want to sell the property or move into it themselves at some point. Who knows. They’re not obligated to offer you the term you are requesting.
Given that these likely don't apply to your situation, given that you are renting from a large property management company. I'm assuming you are in purpose built rental housing. Let us know if that is not the case.
Maybe, but I have my doubts. The property (a small group of buildings - probably 2 dozen units all together) sold to them in 2019. They own a lot of rentals all over the province and I really can’t see them wanting to sell these, they just built new ones a block over. If you’re selling apartments specifically wouldn’t having more lease-signed tenants be more appealing to a buyer? Just seems odd to me.
