It is an interesting problem. The jury acquited on murder. But let's say murder involves finding 4 different factors (person was killed, intent, etc). Jury couldn't find that all 4 existed so they acquited on the charge. That only means that at least one factor was missing (beyond a reasonable doubt). Does that mean the judge cannot consider any of the four factors at sentencing? When there is large evidence that one of the factors was present (let's say- someone was killed) does the jury not finding a different factor (let's say intent) mean the judge has to also ignore all the other factors despite strong evidence one of them was there? Considering a jury acquittal only requires one factor of a crime to be missing, does that mean a sentencing judge needs to treat an acquittal as if every factor of a crime is entirely not present? (I'm not making an argument about this particular case- just an interesting problem to contemplate).
