Illinois and pitzker just removed bail so there wouldn’t be any chance for me to get out. I don’t plan on killing him but I can’t call the police, calling the police would only make my life worse so if he says he’s going to assault me with punches even though I’m the victim and not starting anything could I escalate the situation and use a crossbow?
You could be arrested, charged with assault, attempted murder, or even murder if he were to die (or some other relevant charge, depending on your state). Then your bail could be set extremely high, so you may end up sitting jail for quite some time until you go to trial. At trial, you could try to argue self defense, but it may or may not succeed. If it doesn't, you could be sentenced to years, decades, or even life in prison.
I don’t know what to do then. I’d be willing to take an assault charge when he comes onto my property with the intent of assaulting me just so I can be left alone. Life is rough in some areas and unfortunately I think violence is my only resort.
