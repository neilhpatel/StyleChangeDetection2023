Biden’s speech in congress does not look like a government's statement. It avoided to mention crisis we are confronting: the FED has to increase interest rate to control the inflation and meanwhile U.S bond are giving up in the world while. Can't sell chips to China, our high tech companies are laying off their employees and stock market is sliding down.… Biden acted like a kind grandpa tell story to his grandchildren about a beautiful tomorrow. He doesn't worry about the debt ceiling at all. He simply mention that Trump raise that as a president.
