I don't see how she'd have a case at all under . I would block her (and him) entirely and stop communicating. Don't pay a single cent. If you actually get summoned to court in Arizona (guessing 0.000001% chance of that) then you'd need to consult with an attorney.
I don't know what she wants as she hasn't contacted me yet. I think she's pretty rich based on her profession, but that's an assumption. And I believe she's from California.
I get all that but you never used her name, correct? And you told one person? And she doesn't live in Arizona? And how was her reputation damaged if there was one person you told and he didn't even know her name? Again:
She'd have to win first. It would take tens of thousands of dollars out of her own pocket to sue. If she somehow won, it might be $1. No way at all to know. This is about as hypothetical as things get.
What if she brought it up in small claims? Aren't those significantly cheaper and don't require a lawyer?
Honestly, and I say this with respect, you need to stop panicking and maybe talk to someone about this worry. Nothing is going to happen here.
