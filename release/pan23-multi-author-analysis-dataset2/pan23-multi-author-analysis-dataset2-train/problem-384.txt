The problem is the fallout from even a small nuclear detonation in Ukraine could very easily hit NATO country’s and at that point Russia has used a Nuke against NATO even if indirectly. People don’t realize how tightly packed many of the country’s in Europe are. Ukraine is not a particularly large country, and because of its shape there aren’t many areas in Ukraine that are terribly far from a NATO border. Even less points within Ukraine that aren’t close to a NATO border would be worth hitting with a nuclear strike. The most likely use of nuclear weapons from Russia would be a small tactical nuke. But tactical nukes can be as large as 100 kilotons. For context the Chernobyl event was equivalent to 0.3 kilotons and the exclusion zone for that covers 2,600 km^2 ……..
And thanks to this extensive field testing, we now know that our weapons can easily kick the shit out of Russian forces. Thank you for your contribution, comrade Putin.
He already is. Shit medical treatment, nothing but individual attachments driving any sort of “leave no man behind” ethos. No pension for family “becuz not war,” no pension for family “becuz just missing/deserted/no record/private contract.”.
