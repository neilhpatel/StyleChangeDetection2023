It just says we can’t remove them or damage them. This is what it says: All window treatments shall present a neutral, uniform exterior appearance and shall not detract from the marketability or appearance of the apartment community. Resident shall not damage or remove blinds or other window treatments installed by the apartment owner and part of the apartment.
NAL I would argue the blinds installed by the complex are neutral, they are uniform in their function (they all open/close the same) and don’t detract from… the lease does not say I must close my blinds at all times. And if they push it I would read up on my local renter laws and a consultation with a local lawyer if the issue persists.
I have no idea what floor you're on or what people can see, but you can't be evicted for keeping your blinds open. You have a right to quiet enjoyment of your space, including the blinds and windows.
Thank you. It sounded pretty vague to me so I was like hmm. Normally I try my best to comply with leases but they’ve been really on us lately with random inspections and constant “reminders”.
However, if what people can see from the outside of the unit indicates that you are not properly maintaining the unit (you're hoarding, cooking meth, building a skate park, whatever) or somehow, some way, presenting a nuisance to the neighbors or the public, your management might have a point to make about how you hold up the lease.
Given this last bit of info that everyone got a notice, I’d assume it’s targeting someone else who does not have neutral uniform look, not because you keep the blinds open.
