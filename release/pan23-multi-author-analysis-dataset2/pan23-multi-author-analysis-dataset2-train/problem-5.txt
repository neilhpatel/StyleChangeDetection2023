Just continue to explain that you personally can not be held responsible for the debts of a decedent. If you know what county he died in, look at the county court case search records to see if anyone has opened up an estate for him. If an estate was opened, then the name of the executor or administrator (and an address or phone number) will be showing and you can contact that person to find out if your father left any assets of value, from which the debts would be deducted.
he had almost no money, the little bit that he did have couldn't even cover his funeral and my family had to pay out of pocket to cover the rest. his estate was never executed formally.
If there was no estate, then all you can do is to tell any creditors that they will need to file a claim with the estate and that they will also need to check the county courthouse records regularly to determine if an estate will ever be opened.
Each letter says that the debt must be refuted within 30 days or it is an admission of responsibility for the debt, and it would be sent to collections. So i have been calling after each letter i receive because i donâ€™t want this to affect my credit.
