Generally speaking psychiatric holds against your will are time limited, require a burden of proof that you're a risk to hurt yourself or others, and need a judge to be extended. I'd say the odds of you being yanked off a street to a conversion facility are pretty slim.
Those centers are for kids who have limited rights. You are an adult. Shit, it is more likely that you could have your grandparents assigned a guardian than the other way around.
You are in your mid-20's. Your grandparents do not have the authority to send you anywhere you don't want to go.
Additionally ... ignore the bullshit the director of the therapy center put on their website. They have no more power to hold someone than you do. If they yanked you off the street that would be felony kidnapping.
If anyone attempts to restrain your freedom to move, call 911 and say that you're being falsely imprisoned (because you are).
Having said that, you could certainly retain a lawyer and describe the threat to them, so that if somehow you DID get wrapped up in a facility you would have an advocate working to undo it from the outside immediately.
