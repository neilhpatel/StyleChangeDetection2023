Glad to help. It's possible it's an interstate crime. Do you have reason to believe he was actually in those states when your accounts were accessed? If not, it's conceivable he used open proxy and/or VPN services with systems in those states in an attempt to make it more difficult to tie the unauthorized access to a residential internet service provider, cell phone carrier, or employer traceable to him. I am uncertain whether you have sufficient evidence for local law enforcement or the FBI to investigate since that'll depend on what evidence you have that a crime was committed and their interest in pursuing it. An attorney may also be able to separately pursue this via the divorce proceedings or a civil case.
Or I would be in another state accessing my accounts on Fri/Sat/Sun, and then he would be accessing from his home in CA all while I can prove I was in another state.
Another instance shows IP's from where he lives (downtown metro) and his niche ISP that only services the downtown metro and matches his devices.
