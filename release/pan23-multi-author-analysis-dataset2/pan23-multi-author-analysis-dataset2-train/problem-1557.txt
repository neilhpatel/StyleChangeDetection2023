A small gas thingy to boil water (use it only if no electricity for 12+ hours) as my place is without gas;.
A full thermos flask (not sure if correctly translated but it is a big metal thing that keeps water warm) for tea, some cooking and to add to regular drinking water so it is not as cold as the room (sometimes there is also no heat when no water for a long time and my place would be around 10 degrees Celsius);.
Some food that can be prepared by adding hot water, protein bars, snacks etc that can be stored for a long time;.
At the same time we have a lot of soldiers that we try to fund and a lot of help needed for people in recently liberated areas. I know that there is a very limited electricity just yet, so they would need more help with powerbanks, small generators if possible. I guess I should look for some volunteers who travel there and look for a basic wishlist. I hope it does not sound like we do not need help, I’m just very grateful for all the support and being able to fund and cover my basic needs so I can’t even think of what would be great to have that can be shipped. But I would add that while I’m lucky to maintain my job a lot of people didn’t and also there are people who lost their houses (for example in Irpin or Bucha) and moved to Kyiv or older people who can’t go to the store without light because elevators don’t work then, so maybe even small humanitarian aid would be good.
When thinking about that kind of thing (cost of weapon VS the cost of the thing to shoot it down) you also have to consider the potential damage that NOT shooting it down would do.
