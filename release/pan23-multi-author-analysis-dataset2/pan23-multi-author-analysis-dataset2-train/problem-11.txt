If you want to even try to get another script from your dr, you’ll probably have to make a police report. Some dr are willing to do a refill with a report, others are not.
Have you considered the idea maybe your husband is taking them for himself? Some anxiety medications are very addictive.
Depending on what drug you were prescribed ( ie Schedule II / III etc ) would mean more / slightly less legal trouble for him if he’s caught with your prescription.
It’s alprazolam aka Xanax. My drs and pharmacy have drilled it into my head to not stop taking abruptly, because it could cause seizures and even death. When I explained that to my husband he says “your fault for taking it...you get what you deserve”. I luckily saved 10 from previous scripts in case this day came, however I won’t be able to contact my dr until Monday (this happened Friday and I’m prescribed 3 a day- only taking 2 of my saved supply because I’m petrified of running out).
You can go to the emergency room with your police report, and they can give you a prescription that will take you through the weekend.
Go to the police and make a report. What your husband has done is criminal. If he goes to jail (fairly unlikely for this as long as he doesn’t have a previous record) well then, he “gets what he deserves”.
