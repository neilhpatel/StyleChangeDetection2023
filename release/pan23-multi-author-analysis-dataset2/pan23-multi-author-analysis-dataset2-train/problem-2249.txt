i agree with you but the republican platform is against people like you because of how you frame a lot of these issues. Many people would vote against you simply because you included gender issue tolerance and racial diversity in education as an issue at all (let alone the first things you listed) by reasoning that we have so many serious issues to address the people making this an issue are creating dangerous distractions. Again, not saying you are wrong, just what the average-not a reddit caricature-republican thinks.
Anyone that supports anything related to the GOP is not Christian, period. Jesus said "love thy neighbor as thyself." That's it. Nothing they support cares about anyone but themselves.
I completely agree. I call them Crasstions to separate their un Christ like behavior from the people who try to model their lives after Christ's example AKA Christians.
Lol I meant that, in the context of my comment, there were no qualifications such as "love thy neighbor, so long as he's a gun loving cis white man." But thank you for assuming I don't know that Jesus had more than one line in the Bible.
