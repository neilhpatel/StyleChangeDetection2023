let’s say i stay at that job. that employee i was called a thief in front of is always going to consider me a thief. now when something comes up missing, who’s the first person to be blamed? me. those two customers left thinking i, an employee of a shop they frequent, am a thief. i had to quit my job because i couldnt work there any longer and feel comfortable because they didn’t wanna follow proper protocol.
i’m missing a week’s worth of wages because i could no longer return to my workplace because they made it an uncomfortable environment and defamed me in front of my coworkers.
Yes, being told you stole lipgloss in front of two strangers and a retail coworker who won't remember you in a week is a pretty mild issue in life.
“midlife embarassed” no. i was accused of theft. that’s not midlyl embarassed. i don’t know if you’ve ever worked retail but it goes against any type of protocol ever to do that. it’s. giant HR violation. Huge.
Anyway, not here to argue with you over whether the situation is a "big deal" or whatever. Legally speaking, nothing has happened, you have no damages other than ones you inflicted on yourself by quitting, and no case.
so let’s say my next week or so out that I was scheduled, that I can no longer work because they have made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome by defaming me in front of my coworkers and others.
