EDIT: Np, was just trying to get to you before the angry Scandinavians. I'm sure no Nordic country would mind being mistaken for Sweden though.
Not unless you contend against Norway's independence from Sweden. Which I'm sure is a thing that someone does. Your maps might be from the 1800s though hahaha.
Don't worry, there are more than just you that think Sweden should have reclaimed Norway after the 101 year agreement was up. Swedes could use some dope fjords.
So, to the extent it's in Finland and Sweden's hands, they want to join together, or "hand in hand" as the oh-so-popular catchphrase goes.
In reality it just means that the goal is to go hand-in-hand, but if that fails and for some reason only Finland is accepted, they're not going to cancel the application.
In reality, Finland's position is quite consistent: They want to join together with Sweden, as quickly as possible. But if Hungary and Turkey ratify their accession protocol and not Sweden's, Finland will not withdraw it's application and say "screw NATO, we're not joining after all".
