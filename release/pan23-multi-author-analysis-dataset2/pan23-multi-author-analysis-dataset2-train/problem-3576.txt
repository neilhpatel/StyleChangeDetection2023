The Sanskrit grammatical problem, also known as the Pāṇinian paradox, is a challenge posed by the ancient Indian grammarian Pāṇini in his Aṣṭādhyāyī, a highly technical treatise on Sanskrit grammar. The problem arises from the fact that Pāṇini's grammar is self-referential and recursive, meaning that it refers to itself and can be applied repeatedly. This leads to the question of how the grammar can be complete and consistent, given that it is defined using itself.
You would think that the author of the article would have included this very, very important paragraph of context in the article.
"Dead language" just means it isn't a primary language for anyone, but instead is used entirely for scholarly/religious purposes. Like Latin. Thousands of people speak Latin, it's used in the Catholic Church all the time, but it's still a dead language.
I know its just meant to elicit laughter and is harmless but Sanskrit isn't a dead language. Millions of kids in India learn it everyday (like I did when I was in middle and high school). Even I know 100s of people who can read, write, and speak fluently in Sanskrit.
Its a blatant lie from BBC that only 25,000 people can speak Sanskrit. Totally expected, but a lie nonetheless.
