Edit: Just to be fair, there is still a trickle coming through Turkey and through Ukraine. Not comparable to the pre-war situation though, which is why people are freezing their butts off.
The gas was streaming through full force until sept 29 when some country/organization damaged the pipes that caused the leak.
How come no one blamed the Europeans for buying energy from Russia (the war started in Jan/Feb) - perhaps cause they are white, they are always right? And non NA/Europeans countries need to be given sermons on moral obligations?
Europe had been using the pipeline for ages and were already building another one. India had nearly no oil imports from russia before the war started and prices dropped. The consequences of india not buying energy from russia are nothing compared to europe immediately dropping all energy imports. Do you understand now?
Not really. But actions speak louder. Europe wasnâ€™t told to stop their gas pipeline immediately - because it would hurt their economy and their country depended on Russian gas. But China, India, and many African and ME countries were lectured by so many western organizations and governments about buying Russian oil.
