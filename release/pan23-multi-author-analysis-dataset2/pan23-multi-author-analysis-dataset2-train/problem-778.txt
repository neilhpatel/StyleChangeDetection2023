I wouldn't be surprised if the CCP starts doing things like 'encouraging' their elderly to reduce their burden, 'encouraging' women to have multiple children, and eventually invading Taiwan in a gambit of nationalist fervor to distract from these problems. All of which will do nothing except make China's problems exponentially worse.
History tells us that 'united and eternal' China is only ever temporary. It's just a matter of time until China, once again, breaks.
This has been a trend for a long time now. There isn't too many people on the planet. We just need to bring everyone out of poverty, and they stop breeding excessively.
I'm not sure it's really as big of a problem as being made out to be. With more and more automation the age of the workforce seems less important. People will just be worker longer sometimes because they want to and sometimes because they have nothing better to do. The old people expertise will last longer and the young people energy and strenh is somewhat offset by technology and automation. You also have all the latest in medicine science to keep people healthier older and able to work.
