Doesn't really matter what you support, the Western powers will roll in there with as much force as they think they need to stop it from happening. The current situation Russia has us in will only reinforce that course of action.
Iran doing anything directly to Ukraine would be absolute madness. The only reason NATO isn't dealing with Russia directly is that they have nukes. Iran does not have this get out of jail free card.
The only upside from the Iranian regime is that a conflict with the West would distract from their internal problems. But that would be one hell of a gamble.
Perhaps they are doing this to ally with Russia TO GET NUKES. They arenâ€™t idiots who think they can beat NATO. But Russia needs money and support and has the one thing Iran is really looking for.
Except if NATO finds out they are trying to get nukes before they actually have them, they will have a hot war on their doorstep approximately instantly. They have got to either be really confident in their sneak skill or be kinda dumb.
