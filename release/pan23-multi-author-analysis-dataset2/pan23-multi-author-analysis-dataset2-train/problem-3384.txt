After seeing the time line of the events the assault happened in April while under the influence of an illicit substance, you two broke up 2-3 months later. You text him about if you were ever going to talk, then he blocks you. With out all the facts and details on the recording maybe your ex has painted you as an unreliable witness such as an ex girlfriend scorned trying to get revenge. Maybe the meeting with the prosecutor is to evaluate your reliability as a witness or to discuss any issue with the recording.
Unfortunately, prosecutors have pretty wide latitude on which cases they choose to bring forward and which they decline to prosecute. They usually only want to take cases they can win, and rape cases are difficult to get convictions on in general.
You probably won't get very far bringing a lawyer with you, but the victim advocate who contacted you would be a good person to have at the meeting.
Yeah, they probably want to evaluate how you'd behave on the witness stand. If they think you'd be able to give good, solid testimony that might be enough to convince them to re-open the case.
