You can't open your own account until you're 18. It doesn't sound like your arrangement with your boss is illegal, since he opened the account in his own name. That being said, your boss is the named account owner and has access to your money - you are taking a risk that instead of your mom, your boss will take your money.
I know this isn't ideal, but where exactly do you plan to hold the money that goes into the account? Just leave it in the account and hope your boss doesn't decide to close it?
Do you know if your name is on the bank account as well? What address is the account setup on. You don’t want any paperwork sent to your parent’s house. Depending on the type of phone you have you can setup an electronic wallet (like Apple Pay) so you don’t have to carry around a debit card. Also make sure to plant money around your room and in your wallet so your mom doesn’t suspect anything is going on. You don’t want to tip her off that something is happening.
I’m glad you’ve been able to find a trusted adult who is helping you. I also had an abusive childhood and financial independence is very important.
