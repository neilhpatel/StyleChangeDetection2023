If he actually wanted to flex he'd have ridden in a tank to prove the structural stability of the bridge. I could be wrong in my assumption, but the bridge might not be ready for heavy vehicles quite yet.
I wonder why he drove an evil Western Nazi Satanist vehicle made by the devil himself, instead of a nice wholesome and basic (dangerous) Lada, made in the good ole Russian Federation? Does he not trust his beloved proletariat and their strong like bull products?
The span was damaged enough to slow Russiaâ€™s logistics for a while during an offensive, and that was enough for the moment. Kyiv needs to preserve a means for Russia to evacuate Crimea if and when they close in from the north, as liberating the territory Moscow illegally annexed in 2014 will be a tougher fight if the defenders believe they are trapped. Destroying the bridge would likely be counterproductive in that regard.
