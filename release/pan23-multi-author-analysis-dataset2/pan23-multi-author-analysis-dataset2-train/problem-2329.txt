File an appeal with unemployment and provide all the information here, along with any written communication from your employer about no more work being scheduled or the business being closed. You might also get a notarized statement from your coworker that was also fired. You may have to appeal more than once - make sure you appeal as many times as you're allowed.
ETA 2: To add onto this further incase any of this helps, we were a very small business with only 2 workers, myself and my coworker. Boss said they were gonna try to move into their garage and run the business from there and would NOT be able to support full-time employees.
I never said “I quit/resign”, my understanding was we were let go because the boss was closing the business attempting to move it into their garage now that we could no longer be in the building. I no longer had work from this business as all our clientele was not notified of this closure and our scheduled clients ended on the 25th of the month (to allow us time to get all our stuff out) and no further clients were scheduled. The rug was pulled out from under us.
