I think it's important that you make detailed notes about each time this has happened (date, time, etc) and who else was there with you, or neighbor who was home and anyone you told and when. If you have a photo of the individual too would be helpful. Definitely notify your landlord or management about this repeated intrusion and let them know you also have notified the police. I think you should tell them if you feel unsafe or fear for your safety as well. They may have an after hours number or fax or email and if so notify by all available methods and keep notes when you have notified them. I would also change the locks and let them know you expect the reimbursement for having to have done so. Something definitely is not right about the situation and this person. I would also say to the individual if he shows up again that you have notified the police and management of his repeated attempts to trespass into your apartment and tell him to leave immediately and never enter your home again. You might consider a restraining order as well. I would recommend speaking to a lawyer and seeing what they recommend and what actions they might take because a letter from an attorney might make the management company act faster but if you have never told them then they might act swiftly without a lawyer. Who knows- in a large complex you might not be the first person to report this.
Iâ€™ve been here for around 8 months, and I think there may be a truth to what you are saying. Both of them were a bit too lighthearted when confronting a furious (larger) person whose house was nearly trespassed unannounced at night. I imagine that if I were put in their place in that same scenario, I would have profusely apologized and deescalated the situation, and I probably would have been a bit scared too. These two, however, did not seem phased out a bit.
