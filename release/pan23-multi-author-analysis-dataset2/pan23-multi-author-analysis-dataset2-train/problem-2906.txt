Zelenskyy: "A year ago, on this day, from this very place, at about 7 in the morning, I addressed you with a short statement. It contained the two most important things. That Russia started a full-scale war against us. And that we will defeat everyone. The longest day of our lives. We woke up early and haven't fallen asleep since. We didn't know what would happen tomorrow, but we realized for sure: every tomorrow is worth fighting for!".
"I thank all of our partners, allies and friends who have stood side by side with us throughout the year./I want to address our citizens who are now under temporary occupation. Ukraine has not abandoned you, has not given up on you. One way or another, we will liberate all our lands.".
It's madness to think what would be if Zelenskyy hadn't been in power. He grabbed the bull by the horns while facing overwhelming odds and ran with it.
Well, that’s one way to celebrate one year of war. Ukraine took out almost thousand men and a lot of equipment. At the rate Russia is losing men, using the 30 day average, Russia will be at 150,000 KIA in another four days.
