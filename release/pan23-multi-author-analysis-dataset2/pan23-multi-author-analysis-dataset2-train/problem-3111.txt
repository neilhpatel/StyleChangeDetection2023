Gang extortion of regular people is extraordinarily commonplace. It's basically like paying taxes to a gang, but they control whether you get water or not. People are forced to pay the gangs, or they will die. If you speak out, they will kill you. Then the gangs are fighting with each other, and regular people get killed in those gang wars. People ask the government to do something, provide us a water line, arrest these gangs, but El Salvador is extremely poor, and what little money they have is siphoned off by gangs, so the government can't pay it's own staff, or get any infrastructure built, or repaired. The gangs bomb the government infrastructure, so they can't compete.
A lot of people are pointing out how extreme of a solution this is, but those people haven't lived on the ground or visited El Salvador. The gangs would control large plots of land and demand entry and exit tolls, police couldn't even access the areas. This crackdown, however extreme, is working, and is extremely and overwhelmingly popular among the people of El Salvador.
This!, people in the US and Europe don’t have any idea how awful is living there and let me tell you, the Taliban is a hella of a lot more compassionated than Central American gangs. It’s amazing how the Taliban was in the radar for decades while the gangs were doing business as usual but then they didn’t mess the cocaine flow like the Taliban did with heroin.
Even reading this, I think to myself, "I dunno, the gangs are a lot stronger than the military and police.".
