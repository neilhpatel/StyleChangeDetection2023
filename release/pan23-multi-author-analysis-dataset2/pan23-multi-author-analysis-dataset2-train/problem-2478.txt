Without referencing your guy's specifics, am I right in thinking that, or are there matters of 'degree'- this case seems questionable precisely because of the small-time, operationally-irrelevant nature of it (not being a gov contractor, this doesn't jump out at me as something I'd have to put out for tender or anything)?
depending on the size of the company, there are likely anti-corruption rules; these rules generally speak to a number of things, but buying from a supplier that effectively gives a 'kickback' is pretty blatantly breaking these rules.
Contracts with a government dept (federal or state) may have clauses that require the private company to uphold to certain ethical clauses required by that government dept. If they were a direct government contractor, this would probably be illegal depending on the contract clauses. Being a contractor OF a contractor would probably put it out of auditable view of the GAO or state equivalent, but would a company want to take that chance? Not sure that would make financial sense.
