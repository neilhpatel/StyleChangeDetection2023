The landlord can exercise the right to have a someone hold a key on their behalf. In the extremely unlikely case of an emergency, the landlord may want someone who can access the property. However as per your lease agreement your neighbour cannot enter your property without giving prior written notice and without your express consent.
The landlord can choose to have the neighbor act as his agent and hold a copy of the key. Any requirements that apply to the landlord would also apply to your neighbor. Your neighbor should not be entering your apartment unless you were given proper notice.
The only instance you know of the neighbor entering your apartment involved letting the fire department in. Since the fire department was responding to what was presumably an emergency situation, proper notice isn't required. Unless you can prove that your neighbor entered your apartment other times without notice, there's not much you are going to be able to do aside from moving out when your lease is up.
