Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers in the House have introduced a bill that would explicitly permit retirement plans to consider socially conscious investment factors. The dueling legislative alternatives illustrate the polarizing nature of ESG investing on Capitol Hill and how workplace retirement plans have become the latest front in a partisan political war.
House Republicans are poised to vote on a measure that would block the US Labor Department from enforcing its ESG retirement investing rule, as Democrats counter by introducing legislation that would codify green 401(k)s into law.
Rep. Andy Barrâ€˜s (R-Ky.) resolution to reverse the DOL rule will hit the floor next week, according to a senior House Republican aide. The rule allows retirement plan decision-makers to consider environmental, social, and corporate governance investment criteria as long as they are in the best financial interest of plan participants.
