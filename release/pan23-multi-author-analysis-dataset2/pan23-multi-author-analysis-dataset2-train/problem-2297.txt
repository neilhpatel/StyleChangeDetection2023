It was so bad that certain units not only gave away the positions of other units to the Chechens so that theyâ€™d get ambushed instead of themselves, but some just flat out joined the Chechens to kill those other groups.
So they're trying to deplete the west's munitions by literally throwing defenseless men into the fray in Ukraine? I don't see how this benefits Putin in any way...
The Chechen wars saw a lot of non-ethnic Russian groups turning on one another out of generational hatred of each other.
Since hardly anything has changed with the Russian military doctrine, I bet my bottom dollar that the same thing is happening now in Ukraine except it might be even worse (i.e. purposefully using unsecured lines that can easily be listened/tapped into and talk about where the other groups are digging/stationed at which ends up opening them to artillery/drone fire, giving wrong orders to other groups so that they will end up being sitting ducks, having one guy or a bunch surrender to the Ukrainians just so they can rat out on the other groups, etc).
