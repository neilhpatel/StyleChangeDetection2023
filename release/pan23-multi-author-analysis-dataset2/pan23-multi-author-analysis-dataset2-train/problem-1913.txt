As you see, reported number of rapes is much higher in the west than in India. We have to perpetually live in the paradoxical situation, where you read about rapes in India, but the reported numbers are low. Perhaps there's a difference in how media reports rapes in India vs in the West, and one must ask why you aren't reading about all the rapes in the US or Sweden.
>The United Nations estimates that the country is home to the largest number of child brides in the world at around 223 million. Nearly 1.5 million underage girls get married there every year, U.N. children's agency UNICEF said in a 2020 report.
If there are 223 million child brides presently, with 1.5 million getting married every year, then the oldest present child brides got married 148 years ago.
India has about 1400 million citiziens. So that means that about 16% of the population are child brides? Every sixth person? That means if every husband to a child bride would be arrested, one sixth of India would suddenly be arrested?
