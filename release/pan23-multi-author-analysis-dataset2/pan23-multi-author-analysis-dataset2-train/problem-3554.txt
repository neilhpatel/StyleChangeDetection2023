Yeah I feel like americans dont understand how brutally a war in europe would be if soldiers marched into Russia. An escalation should be avoided at extreme cost for the sake of humanity. The generational hate and ethnic tensions are so much worse than young redditors can understand. Many whom likely dont even know what happened the last time ethnic groups in europe were able to go to war on each other, ie the bosnian war. I suspect western troops in Russia would look similar, and still very different. Just look at how the ukrainians and russians are treating each other already.
