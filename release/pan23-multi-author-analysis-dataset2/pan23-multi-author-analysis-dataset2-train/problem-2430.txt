I strongly suspect the GOP and its non-Trump presidential candidate will offer a federal pardon in exchange for him actively pushing his base behind their candidate (presumably DeSantis). It's not an offer he will be in a position to refuse, particularly if/when he's indicted. Either way, at their first opportunity they will absolutely pardon him for federal crimes as they have gone all in on the "we're being persecuted" narrative.
While Georgia's history as a penal colony and slave state would indicate its preference for jailing folks, it doesn't imprison the slave masters. That would be admitting guilt.
Up vote for that comment. Though some of his crimes are not pardonable. State crimes. We need accountability to keep this from happening over and over. Plus Trump being behind bars is a very nice thing to visualize.
