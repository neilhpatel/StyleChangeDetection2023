The book Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson sort of plays with this idea of there being desirable real estate in a virtual reality, and requiring people to have some form of virtual locomotion to get from A to B. There was a justification (something about teleporting breaking the metaphor, iirc).
Physically buying real estate on an infinite plane in fake space owned by someone else, who seems to be a complete idiot who got way too lucky once?
Anyways, one way I can see real estate being relevant in a virtual reality, even without movement restrictions, is visibility. Sure, anyone can go someplace in the "middle of nowhere" and see whatever you set up there, but if nobody really knows you're there, then they won't. However, if there's some popular locale and you can use a space directly adjacent to it, far more people will see you. It's the equivalent of buying ad space or whatever.
Iâ€™m confused about why location matters in a metaverse? If access and travel is instant the location has no value. If you can basically teleport anywhere why would proximity matter? Do you have to walk or drive between locations? Taking time or buying a digital vehicle? Seeing advertisements and buildings along the route?
