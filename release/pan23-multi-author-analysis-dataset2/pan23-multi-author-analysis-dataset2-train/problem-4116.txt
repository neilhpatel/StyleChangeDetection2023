That's true, but turkey will probably demand for it to happen before the vote to join nato? Not sure how the timings line up.
Just chill and wait. Sweden would be a valuable addition for Nato. Let the other members put pressure on Turkey. There's no panic for Sweden to join.
Sweden applied to join relatively early in the war before they really could see how much Russia fucked up and misjudged Ukraine. To seriously invade another nation, Russia needs to finish the war in Ukraine and rebuild their armed forces over a decade or so.
Stop sucking up to Erdogan, there's no way they can get out of that with their democracy and honor intact.
Erdogan has no concept of an independent judicial system. He just wants his political opposition extradited.
To compromise on your democratic principles with egomaniac autocrats is just losing game. They will just come with more demands.
Couldn't Sweden just say they won't do anything any other nato member wouldn't do? Turkey would not be able to play these games with another member.
Erdogan is probable just holding out for large enough of a pay day. His economy is failing with 85% inflation.
