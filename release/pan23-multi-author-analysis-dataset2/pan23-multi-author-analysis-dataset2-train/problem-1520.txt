Are you asking if exploiting tax exempt gifts in anticipation of a divorce, presumably in order to keep those assets from being considered during the divorce, is a good idea?
There have been a number of cases where prospective divorcees have attempted to hide assets to protect them during the divorce where the judge doesn't take too kindly to that at all and brings the hammer down relatively firmly.
If you're being represented by an attorney for this divorce, asking that attorney whether or not this is a good idea before actually doing it would be extremely prudent.
Yes, judges/courts can "reconstitute" the estate, awarding the value of the hidden assets to the other party, or a number of things.
Yes, exploiting tax exempt gifts is the true scenario. I guess that the real question is this: if it is legal to give those assets away, can the judge consider that an action of bad faith down the road in proceedings? The assets would not be concealed, they would be legally given to another party and the gift documented properly in tax filings.
If you give a large “gift” to a family member two days before you file for divorce, it will be clear to the court that you were trying to hide assets from division, and it will fool no one.
If you give a large “gift” to an affair partner during the marriage, your spouse can argue that it was dissipation if marital assets, and get those funds taken out of you share of the property.
