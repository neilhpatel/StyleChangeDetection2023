But they are not his children? Their fathers should be paying child support, assuming he didn't adopt them.
He did not adopt them unfortunately so I might be out of luck if that's a requirement. Unfortunately collecting from the biological fathers is probably not an option since one is unemployed and the other works minimum wage.
I really don't know a lot about the child support system, but I've always worried that it would cost more than it would be worth. We're talking about very irresponsible men who'd absolutely try and fight it every step of the way and probably wouldn't be expected to offer much support because of their low incomes. I want what's best for my kids but fighting a painful child support battle that would probably net next to nothing in actual support has never seemed worth it to me.
No, they were children of two previous fathers. He never formally adopted them but he did play the role of a stepfather while we were together, I'm not sure if that counts for anything though. Unfortunately collecting from the biological fathers would be very difficult since one is unemployed and the other is working minimum wage and on government assistance. I assume it would probably be more trouble than it's worth.
You don't even really have to 'fight' in Texas. The attorney general's office does most of the work for you.
Yeah that sounds like what everybody here is saying. Not the answer that I wanted to hear but sometimes the truth hurts I guess. At least I can avoid wasting time and money on a pointless legal battle.
You should put a claim in with your local child support office against the biological fathers. They may not be able to pay much now, but that can change. Even a small amount each month will help you raise their children.
