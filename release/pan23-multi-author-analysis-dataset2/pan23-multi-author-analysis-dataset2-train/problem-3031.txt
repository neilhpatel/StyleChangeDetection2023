You can file a police report about the guard with the relevant jurisdiction, and from there, the police will investigate, decide whether to refer the case to the district attorney, and they DA will decide whether to prosecute. That's pretty much the end of your involvement unless you are contacted, but you can see if the DA's office has a victim advocate who will inform you of what happens. If I had to speculate, I would imagine that the DA, if it takes this case, will plead it down to simple misdemeanor assault to eliminate the sex offender registry requirement. If he has no record, the guard will probably get a fine and probation.
You can go to the police station and ask to file a police report on the guard. What he did was not legal.
What the guard did was illegal, but your boyfriend's reaction was also illegal. What happens to the guard is completely separate from what happens to your boyfriend.
Just to clarify, this isn't "sexual assault," which is a term that many people use synonymously with rape. This is misdemeanor sexual battery under California Penal Code section 243.4, subdivision (e)(1). It is treated roughly the same as any other type of misdemeanor battery, with the exception that a conviction can require 10 years on the sex offenders' registry. It's helpful, because the terms can be confusing, to say "the guard groped my butt" rather than "the guard sexually assaulted me.".
