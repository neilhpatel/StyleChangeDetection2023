All my blue neighbors out here on the barrier island in Broward had their apartments turned into Airbnbs by corperate ownership. Im one of the last actual residents left on my block.
My Aunt and Uncle moved to FL winters 5 years ago. My Aunt bleeds blue and went there with the intent of being very politically active in her community which she did. This election when I spoke with her she still intended to vote but had resigned that her activism efforts were just a drop of water in a big lake. She alluded to how many MAGAs are flocking to FL as their Utopia. I think she believes FL will never be blue, until about 2050, when the state will be much smaller.
They are flocking to states that are going to get wrecked the most by climate change.. and propping up leaders who won't do shit to help them survive it... and keep picking their pockets. It's not the lonerm 'prize' they think it is.
