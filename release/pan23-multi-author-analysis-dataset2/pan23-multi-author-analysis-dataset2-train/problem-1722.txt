One of two things are probably going to happen. They're in the wrong, through and through. You're either going to get more money back than it's worth, in which case you'll pay your attorney with your "profit" for a wash, or, you'll get the feature and nothing else. You'll still have to pay your attorney, but, well worth it to get everything resolved. You'll then write up a bad review of them either way and ding their reputation (I would wait until it's fully over before doing this, and check with your attorney to make sure there isn't a clause in whatever settlement you do forbidding this. IE 'We'll pay you 3x the cost, but in return you can't leave us a bad review because we're making it right').
There are other options besides a lawsuit that could be applicable. Complaints to the state attorney general, the licensing body for auto dealers, the FTC for false or deceptive advertising, or even the police for false advertising. But most of these focus more on punishing the dealer than making you whole, they can take a long time. It sounds like a lawsuit is the best option overall here, especially if you can collect treble damages, and/or your contract includes a prevailing party fee agreement.
We have an arbitration agreement that we can opt out of is we desire. Decision needs to be made by tomorrow.
I can’t see how any situation would work in their favor with how clear cut it appears, but the world has let me down before.
To avoid scaring everyone who may not e familiar with this: They only do that when the car is sold with Tesla as the middleman in the transaction. They don’t do it to private party sales, of course.
