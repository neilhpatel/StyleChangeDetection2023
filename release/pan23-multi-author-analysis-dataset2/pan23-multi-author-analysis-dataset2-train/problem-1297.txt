Tl;Dr RSV, the flu, and COVID are really bad right now. Rather than declare a state of emergency, the feds are going to provide support on a case by case basis.
My man ontario premier doug Ford is letting children die and the hospitals dedicated to them are overwhelmed. Cons don't care. Dude wants his highway built and the greenbelt destroyed.
huh so you guys are having issues to. that kills canadas cons and the "private is better" shit. our system is collapsing as cons make it to privatize.
The conservatives in Australia have also been pulling at the threads of our healthcare system too. Rebates are getting smaller and most doctors need like $50 bucks up front whereas until very recently most of them were bulk billing. It’s a concentrated effort by right wing ghouls to take away any social safety net they can.
Umm.. i usually dont comment, but… this is about children contracting flu and Covid… not adults who decided to not take vaccines. It is about hospitals needing to request assistance from stockpiles, but instead they are asking for a triple demic.. which may or may not be called for as it isnt clear in article.
My sons spent 2.5 weeks in the NICU last month with RSV. One almost died. He had RSV induced apnea after we brought him to the ER and just stopped breathing. If we hadn’t already brought him there he wouldn’t have survived. Was intubated for a week. His twin brother was on respiratory support as well.
The boys are doing so much better. I’m a bit traumatized to be honest but also in awe of the doctors and nurses that cared for them, especially on the night the one was intubated. They were incredible. But it was the worst night of my life.
