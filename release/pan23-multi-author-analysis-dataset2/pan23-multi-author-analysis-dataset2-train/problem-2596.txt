Do you have a copy of your employee handbook? Who is the manager above your manager? If a 24 hour shift is on the table and you're likely to lose your job anyway, there's no harm in escalating this up the chain of management. I suspect the answer is that your manager is supposed to cover the shift to prevent things like this happening.
You are free to refuse, and you can be fired for refusing to work the schedule. You obviously have to be paid for all hours worked and OT if necessary. If you are in a union however, you should speak to them.
Where do you draw the line here? OP works 24 hours straight and then at the end of that it's their regular shift. What happens if the employer says "nope, your shift and you must work or get it covered." A 24 hour shift turns into a 32 hour shift? That sounds like a hostile work environment if I ever heard of one.
I was more-so wondering if there'd be any legal protections around refusing to work another shift after already having worked 16 hours.
You should inquire with the state's unemployment office as to whether it would count as constructive dismissal if you were fired for refusing to work 24 hours straight.
