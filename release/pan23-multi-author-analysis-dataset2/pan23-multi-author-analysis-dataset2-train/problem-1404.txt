Excellent write up, out of curiousity the reasons 1, 2, 6 (Good Orator, Stayed a Difficult Course and Won the War) which you considered most important by common people but Churchill didn't win the next election. Did these reasons and attitudes become more important over time? Did they become more prevelant after his second term?
EDIT: yeesh, this blew up. Thank you for the kind words and the gold (and the platinum!). I only want to emphasize that the linked post was meant to give some context here rather than be a spot-on answer: it's a reply to a closely related but in the end somewhat differently framed question, after all, so the fit won't be 100%.
Churchill and FDR got along quite well, though of course there were areas of disagreement (and some personal conflicts on occasion: Roosevelt, like many, found Churchill a bore at times). Their relationship is well attested to in the historical record, from numerous analyses through to publication of their extensive correspondence (see Churchill and Roosevelt: The Complete Correspondence).
