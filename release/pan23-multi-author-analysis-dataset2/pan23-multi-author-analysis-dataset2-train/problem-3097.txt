Employers are allowed to have silly rules as long as they don't discriminate against a protected class, or violate laws relevant to your location. This sounds like a work with HR to figure something out deal - do they have a work vehicle you could be responsible for? Any other coworkers live nearby that could give you a ride? Etc.
Yeah as you mention non automobile owners are not a protected class, but it also seems like an odd thing to enforce.
I would probably talk to the HR person about it. I sincerely doubt whatever policy is being referenced is what the foreman is interpreting it as. Perhaps thereâ€™s a locker or something at the facility you can store your belongings in.
Some cities and counties have rules that require employers allow bike-to-work, but I do not see this in King County or Seattle (which I checked as examples).
If it's a small city, your transportation department may be interested in this, and may speak to your employer on your behalf as to the benefits of reducing traffic even over a short distance. They'd have no legal authority.
