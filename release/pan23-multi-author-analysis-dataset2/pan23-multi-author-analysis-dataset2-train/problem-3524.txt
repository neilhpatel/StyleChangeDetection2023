My first thought was raisins and grapes, which are common lunch snacks and poisonous to dogs. I would limit or highly supervise any interactions between kids and dog for this reason and others mentioned here.
Yeah, you might want to build a second fence, one that kids can't toss stuff through (like grapes, chocolate, or army men). Might also talk to the school about having the kids keep away from any neighboring property.
In short: supervision is a bare minimum. Separation is probably a good idea. If you want to have your puppy visit the students, talk to a teacher and find out if you can go and show them to a class in a controlled environment, rather than having kids come up to your dog at random.
In most provinces (every province I've ever had reason to look at, including both BC and Ontario), owners are automatically liable for injuries caused by their dog. That liability can be reduced if the victim provoked the dog or in some way caused the dog to attack them, but that's always fact-sensitive and kids reaching through fences would normally not reduce your liability at all.
Even if your doggo is the calmest and sweetest animal, there is always some risk that your dog will bite someone, or will react violently to something you don't expect. That risk is higher with younger dogs, because they usually haven't had as long to be socialized and you, as an owner, have less of an idea of how they handle surprises or stress.
I think I am going to put up a wire mesh to stop little fingers from coming through but still allow both parties to see each other.
When she’s outside, she’s always supervised and my fiancée was leashing her when she was around the kids. I’ve asked her not to bring her out at recess anymore, tho.
