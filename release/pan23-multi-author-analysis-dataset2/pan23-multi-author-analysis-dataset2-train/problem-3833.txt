Nothing in shared spaces but they smoke it with distressing regularity (one goes through $200 a week of the stuff) and occasionally even next to me in a car. My bedroom shares two walls with the two heaviest smokers as well.
Yes it is possible that you could get swept up and all four people charged as joint possessors (joint as in all together not the other kind). This is especially true if any drug or paraphernalia is present in shared spaces (living room, kitchen, etc.) Also worth noting, depending on the level of your roommate’s use and your proximity in the environment you could test positive for THC. But you can get charged with possession regardless of if you actually have taken a drug. Also with the CBD, be aware that in Texas it is only legal at levels lower than .3%.
Noted I’m hopeful this won’t happen at all, I’m in a college town where loads of people smoke so I’m surprised she didn’t just assume my roommates did too. All my ex coworkers, half my customers at my work, etc. if it does, I’ll be sure to follow your advice.
