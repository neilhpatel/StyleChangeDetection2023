If a Republican speaker is seated based on a power sharing agreement that prevents the political bullshit that 80% of the GOP sees as their 1 goal, that WILL tear the GOP apart. Can you imagine what it would be like if an R speaker needed to keep the support kf 130+ Dems?
Plus it was just contradicted yesterday by Jeffries saying that the Dems wouldn’t help the GOP get out of their dysfunction. I’d love to see a centrist coalition but OP is peddling false hope.

Dictators often start out looking smart, and then fall apart. Look at Putin; if he hadn't invaded Ukraine, he'd have gone down in history as one of the greatest leaders in Russian history.

I just got it! 'Custerish' after George Armstrong Custer, who lead the 7th Cavalry to one of the biggest defeats in US military history.
My POV is that the GOP is now fundamentally broken and needs to be destroyed if we're going to make any progress.
Let them try to hold together any kind of Republican solidarity when half the party is pitching a tantrum over not operating 100% focused on political spite, and the Speaker needs to maintain support from 150+ Dems.
I’d be fine with Dems supporting an actual moderate Republican, if they can get concessions including limitations on dumb-fuck investigations, including just some form of shared committee power.
