Trump has a ton of campaign funds. Some which can be used directly for his own campaign and others which can be directed to other campaigns. So while the party as a whole would be wise to banish Trump, individually those who can, will go after the cash his campaign has to pay out.
> Lindsey Graham to join Trump for South Carolina campaign team launch Flip flopping traitor enabler Lindsey joins team Traitor Trumps campaign launch. Who'd a guessed?...
For those like Graham who is in a state where Trump won 55% to 43%, the situation makes even more sense. Trump still probably has most of that 55%. If you apply the 4pt drop in national approval since Election Day 2020, Trump would still be a net positive in South Carolina. Even for those who don't support Trump now, it's unlikely the taint of Trump would rub off on Graham (insert your own joke here).
The Republican Party needs to distance itself from scam artists and yahoos. The Republican Party needs to become the party of intelligent conservative reasonable honest leaders. Let the scam artists and yahoos create their own Yahoo Party.
