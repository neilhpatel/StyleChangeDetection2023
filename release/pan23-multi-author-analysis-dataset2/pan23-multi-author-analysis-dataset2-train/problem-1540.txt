Out of all of this, only throwing things is an obvious _legal_ issue. If she's throwing things at students, or near students in a way that's obviously meant to intimidate them, then you and your parents may want to talk to the police if the principal and superintendent don't deal with it effectively.
The rest of this is a professional issue, and is absolutely affecting your education, but more or less not a legal issue. You and your parents should discuss this with the principal.
I sympathize - I've had a bully for a teacher, too. If your school can't or won't intervene, talk to your parents about homeschooling for the year or doing alternative schooling, and rejoining next year. Life's too short to put up with this.
Doesn't sound like a legal issue. I'd just start by talking to your parents, and then maybe someone who manages this teacher - the head of the history department, the school administration, or the school board.
Talk to your parents and/or the assistant principal. Your parents can/should do more than proofread. There is also physical danger here that should be reported immediately. You don't have to collect all sort of evidence. And be very wary of secretly recording someone, especially in California. Even if what you're doing is technically legal (no expectation of privacy) the school can punish you, which would be a sad irony.
