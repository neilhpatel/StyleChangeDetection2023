Ha! I posted the exact same news source/outlet as the one originally posted in this reddit post, which we are all now replying in and you had no issue with considering your original comment; Reuters.
I can’t seem to access the original article in this reddit post since it was updated, Reuters must be fairly confident to have updated their original article.
If you have an issue with Reuters and how they handle reporting then that’s a “you” problem. As far as I know Reuters is not a Russian biased news source.
Your misrepresentation of Reuters only relaying what Russian agencies reported citing the country's defence ministry to pretend that what Russia says has any more credibility is telling.
There's a difference between "Reuters reports that the missile was shot down" and "Reuters reports Russia claimed to have shot down the missile". On the latter we can all agree on but the first one is not supported by the article.
You have to grain of salt anything coming out of Russian “news”. They are, in fact, confirming explosions.
I’m sure most people, like me, have read other sources or seen some of the videos going around that have no indication of the drones being shot down.
