There’s no requirement to respond to an employment verification request, and no way to force it to happen, really. When you called and talked to him did you politely ask that he take 2 minutes and verify your dates with the new company?
No, I was told that my former employer must answer questions related to the DOT. This is a commercial driving job.
If that’s the case and your prior job was DOT safety sensitive - then yes. The prior employer is obligated to reply.
I asked if I could send tax documents, bill of ladings, etc, and they informed me this is the only way, unfortunately.
I'll try once more to contact him casually, as well as the secretary employed when I was working there, then go ahead and send this info to him. Will draft up a physical letter too, just in case.
If it comes to the point of sending a physical letter, send it registered with return receipt. Staple the receipts and the green mailer card you'll get back in the mail to a copy of the letter and put it somewhere safe. In case you have to prove at some point that you did this, this documentation meets requirements from most courts and government agencies to prove that you did send it, and it was received. But man, I hope he just does it so you don't have to do this. Good luck!
part. If you send a certified letter requesting the info, make sure you also send a specific consent to release the required information and sign and date the request.
(h) If you are an employer from whom information is requested under paragraph (b) of this section, you must, after reviewing the employee's specific, written consent, immediately release the requested information to the employer making the inquiry.
