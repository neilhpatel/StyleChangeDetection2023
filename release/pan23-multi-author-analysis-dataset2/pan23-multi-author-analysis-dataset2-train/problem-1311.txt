You should ask this person clearly not to contact you again. We can’t guess how this might play out in some kind of school hearing. One hopes you’re both instructed not to contact each other again.
Lol yeah I get it doesn’t make sense since you don’t know me personally. I realized in hindsight that it wasn’t very sensitive and apologized to him! I only brought that up because that was the first time I noticed something getting weird with him. I had had no idea he had any feelings for me before he brought it up.
Your "joke" sounds to an outsider like you were taunting him. Or measuring the depth of his interest.
From that point, any further contact attempts could be actionable by the Title IX office or campus police.
The appropriate outcome from here is for you each to know clearly that the relationship is ended and no further contact is appropriate. You might communicate that with the help of the Title IX office if that is necessary.
The two of you should never speak again. That's an appropriate outcome and you should make clear to him that's the outcome you want.
I think the general consensus is that I led him on and sexually harrassed him verbally. As someone involved I clearly had a bias towards me being victimized. So I should therefore apologize.
Like I said, I realized the insensitivity of that ‘joke’ disregarding context and apologized. However, I don’t think that one comment warrants everything he did and that happened afterwards. I am saying that I do not deserve to feel harrassed.
I am not, nor should anyone, tell you file or don’t file. I’m questioning whether there’s a Title IX action to take here, or whether you’re looking for assistance from the Title IX office to help set the clear expectation that this relationship is over.
Ultimately he confessed his feelings, you were joking about hooking up with people to him afterwards, and you're upset that he no longer wanted to work with you?
