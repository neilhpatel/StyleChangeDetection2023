Don't, however, be tempted to use the threat of a police report in order to get him to pay - these are separate matters. There are caveats, but "Pay me $700 to replace my mailbox or I'll file a police report" could potentially amount to extortion.
"Mailboxes are protected by federal law, and crimes against them and the mail they contain are considered a federal offense. Violators can be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned for up to three years for each act of vandalism.".
Yep. You can send notice that they need to pay you or you will take them to court to collect, that is called a demand letter. But you can't tell them they need to pay you or you will call the police, that is called extortion. A lot of people confuse these two things.
PS: WA is two-person content state. You're good with Ring probably but recording interaction is always risky except if you did it with his knowledge.
When you have police report in hand, contact your local post office and report it there giving them police number report as a reference. This is just to ensure postmaster takes it seriously. They usually do but some are a bit on a lazy side.
Don't request money from the neighbor anymore. If he wanted to cooperate, he would have. Talking to him is the easiest way to get yourself in trouble because he might tell the court you told something you haven't or misinterpret some things you did.
First call police non-emergency number and report the issue. They will probably just point you to the web site to report it there. After a few days you will get a note that your report has been noted.
