The example that comes to mind is the case of the Roman Emperor Alexander Severus. Alexander Severus did not attempt this on a broad scale, but in certain limited cases.
In the Historia Augusta, Alexander Severus is said to have worshipped in a private chapel, or sanctuary, a number of Gods, historical figures, and Demi-Gods, similar in the manner to Marcus Aurelius and Alexander the Great. On top of this, when Alexander Severus had returned to Antioch, his mother, Julia Avita Mamaea, personally summoned the Christian Theologian Origen to tutor the young Emperor in Christian Philosophy, as well as Neoplatonism.
Furthermore, according to the Historia Augusta, Alexander Severus had also considered formally building Temples to Christ, which was also apparently considered by Hadrian.
However, it remains difficult to determine whether these were part of an organized campaign of syncretism, or if they were one individual emperor's idosyncratic religious ideas.
By the third century there was never, to my knowledge, an attempt to bring the worship of Jesus up to a civic level alongside traditional deities--meaning there weren't major temples or festivals to Christ as part of any civic calendar (although, as I said, late antiquity isn't where I live, and it's possible that if you apply some of the questions I'm about to talk about to later events, you could start to see them differently than they're traditionally considered). However, it's possible and perhaps likely that there was a long-ish period where many people were incorporating Jesus into their normal ideas of piety without doing anything that we would consider "conversion.".
