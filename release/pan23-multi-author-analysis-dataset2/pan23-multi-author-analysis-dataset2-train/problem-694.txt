And that's just costs as they stand now, renewables get cheaper every year. They provide clean power in a fraction of the time too.
Renewables are great but they are less reliable - hence why Germany fired up more coal this winter. France, in comparison, has lower emissions than Germany because France uses more nuclear.
Lol well yes, when you take down half your plants for maintenance (as happened earlier this year) you're going to have a bad time. However they are being brought back (I think a quarter are still offline but being brought back by end of year) - and with the plants running, the truth remains that France generates energy more cheaply, and with far lower emissions, than Germany,. France is also typically an energy exporter - selling the excess energy they generate to other countries.
Germany has no option other than to fire up coal power this winter, which of course runs counter to the whole point of renewables to begin with.
Renewables don't provide stable power. Unless your are in location that is suitable for hydro power, you need either fossil fuels or nuclear. It's simply unavoidable.
Yea lives only matter when they die in developed countries. People in developing countries can starve, afterall there's so many of them so who cares right?
Not to mention that nuclear is cleaner then most renewables and not that expensive over the lifetime of the plant. It's just the upfront costs that are big.
