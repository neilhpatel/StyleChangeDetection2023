Someone is using your mailbox? He gets mail at your address and opens your mailbox to collect it? Contact USPS and consider investing in a mailbox camera.
Yeah he uses the storage unit behind our houses but on all social media’s he has his business located at our house and he receives mail there as well.
Intercept the mail, write "return to sender, does not live at this address" and put it back in the mailbox for the carrier to pick up as close to pickup time as possible (so he can't come get his mail in the interim).
Talk to the postmaster responsible for your area about this and inform them that you do not wish to receive mail addressed to this individual/company at your residence.
He wraps cars and tints them in the storage unit behind our house which has my whole family worried about anyone getting upset with his product and coming to our house.
If you don't take steps to curb that activity, then you can expect it to continue. Step number one is refusing packages and mail addressed to this person, and not allowing customers of his to come onto your property.
Is this storage unit a separate property, with its own address? In another comment you mention that the only way into the storage unit is through your property -- does the storage unit business not have their own points of access that are not through your property?
It’s separate from the house but the only way to get to it is from our driveway the same person who owns the house owns the storage unit. It’s only supposed to be for a single person and he was not aware of the man having a business in his storage unit or the constant amount of people flooding our driveway.
