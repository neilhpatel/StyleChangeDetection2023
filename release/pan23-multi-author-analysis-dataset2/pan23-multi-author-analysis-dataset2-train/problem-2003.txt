Repost this in r/tax. You probably don’t have any legal recourse, but can mail-in-file your taxes, and it will trigger an investigation. The IRS will ask for evidence that the children were in your care last year, and will give you the proper refund. What I’m not sure of is how the stimulus fits in. They would hopefully be able to help you out there.
If he rightfully had the claim in 2019, is his. If you or other person rightfully have the claim in 2020, they can get it when they file.

It's actually based on 2020 tax year. If for whatever reason you didn't get the proper stimulus, it gets settled up when 2020 taxes are filed this year.
And the 3rd stimulus is still based on the most revent tax filing. Which for some people may still be 2019. Though it will be a 2021 tax credit for the 2021 filing year.
When 2020 taxes are filed, if both sides are honest, and she claims the child while he doesn't, she'll get the positive adjustment, and hell get a negative one.
Unless the custody agreement specifically allows him to claim the child, the child was with her more than 6 months of the year, and she likely supports more than half her daughters care, thus she would be entitled to claiming the child, not him.
