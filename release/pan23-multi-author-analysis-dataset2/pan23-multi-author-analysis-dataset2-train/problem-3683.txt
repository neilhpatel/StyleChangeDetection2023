The first point of the Chinese peace plan says that every countries sovereignty and borders must be respected but nowhere does it state that Russia must withdraw from Ukraine.
Obviously this leaves enough room for interpretation since Putin believes the occupied regions are Russian.
It would be great if China listens to the Ukrainian viewpoint but I doubt much will come of it. China is totally fine with Russia being cut of from the west as they can grow their influence and export.
You are aware that this is just Zelinski calling China's bluff right? Because if Ukraine dismissed it out of hand Russia and china go to the UN and scream "see He's not interested in peace!" By saying, yeah sure I'll meet Xi, and the outline Ukraines red lines in the context of Chinas plan then it forces Xi to either work those into it's currently very vague plan or show it's hand by not actually respecting Ukrainian territorial integrity.
Yeah, I think the last thing we have to worry about is Zelenskiy making a bad peace deal with China. He will hear them out (no harm in that) and then counter. Zelenskiy has been rock solid so far, I donâ€™t see that suddenly changing.
