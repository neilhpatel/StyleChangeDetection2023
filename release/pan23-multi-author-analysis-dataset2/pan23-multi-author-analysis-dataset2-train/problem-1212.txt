From what I understand, there is no need for foreign assets to register in Canada, unlike in the US and Australia. This means that these police stations have been allowed to work without much repercussion for years and no real fear of international dispute; instead, prosecution only of the assets on Canadian soil intimidating individuals in Canada.
For background, this has been an issue that CSIS (Canadian intelligence) has known about and been yelling about since at least Stephen Harper's government (2005 - 2015) and possibly earlier. Everyone, including current politicians, has essentially just let the issue percolate.
Politicians here just don't want the headache (and possible failure) of dealing with China, so they just keep passing the buck onto the next guy.
Not only have provincial and federal leadership failed to take it seriously across the board, but they have arguably CSIS for trying to raise alarm bells. When CSIS Director Richard Fadden spoke out about foreign interference British Columbia's Cabinet in 2009, he was essentially forced to backtrack and downplay it as a serious issue:
If somebody in a different country has done something wrong the Chinese don't like can they be taken to these new Chinese police stations legally according to the country they're in or could the Chinese be stopped from people in?
No, I don’t even think that in most countries a Chinese citizen could be apprehended in that matter. Chinese police don’t have jurisdiction in London, New York, Tokyo, etc. To detain individuals lawfully living in those countries, outside of existing channels for extradition, would be a violation of international law.
