Sorry to hear that you're getting jerked around like that. According to , you still must file by the deadline and you can use form 4852 to estimate your earnings and withholding. You can download form 4852 from the IRS.
Ok thank you! From the website you linked it sounded like I should wait until the deadline to use form 4852. Am I able to file sooner and use for 1040x to amend the information if my W2 does end up showing up?
EDIT: I am not a tax professional or attorney, just another internet rando. So checking with the IRS is probably your safest bet.
I’ve called them twice now and they say they have a W2 from my specific employer on file. Yet whenever they try to send it to me I get the “no record of return filed”. This has happened to me twice now. The last time I called, they told me that I can access all of this information through my online IRS account. So thinking that maybe there was just a mix up on their end I logged in and found the transcripts and they have all my previous year returns and wage information, yet when I click of 2020 I get the same “no record of return filed”. There seems to be some miscommunication or something is getting mixed up and the IRS doesn’t seem to want to help me. But I’ll give them another call, you never know who you will get this time and maybe they will know what’s going on. Thanks again!
