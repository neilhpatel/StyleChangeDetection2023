So when contributors read this kind of complaint they often have two overlapping reactions. The first is annoyance at the wildly unreasonable expectation that users have over answers being written instantly and on demand, as this devalues the time and energy put into the work. The second is frustration at the complete erasure of the final product that such complaint is contending literally doesn't exist.
Bluntly... a lot of contributors get really, really tired of this "nothing is ever answered" attitude because it comes off as impatient and entitled. This subreddit is not about instant gratification. The average time it takes for a thread to be answered is over 9 hours, because it takes time and effort to research and write them.

Whether that means people should downvote you is another matter, but that is very much why they are.
