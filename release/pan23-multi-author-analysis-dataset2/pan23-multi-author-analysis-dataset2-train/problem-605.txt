Your post history is filled with posts about suicide and requesting for information on how to hang yourself.
I'm sorry to tell you that the EMS may have made an appropriate call. You were in significant immediate danger to yourself, which means that this isn't a wrongful imprisonment.
Without knowing what state OP is in, these statements can't be made with the certainty you appear to have. According to some state laws, OP may not be liable for the bills. EMS may not have had adequate reason to put OP on a hold under the circumstances. If EMS did not follow the law for their state, they have no right to bill OP, and from OP's statements, it seems likely they didn't. Depending on the state, EMS may not even be allowed under the laws to make that call as under some state laws, the qualifications that someone needs to sign off on a hold are higher than just an EMT. Hospitals often think they can always bill people without any explicit support of law, and also without the consent of the obligor. There is no way of knowing whether the EMS are at fault or not without knowing which state OP is in, and actually reviewing the law, and whether they had enough evidence to put OP on a hold or not.
I reccomend you ask for an itemized bill from the hospital. You have no legal recourse against the EMS, but you may be able to dispute some of the charges that add up to 1k.
