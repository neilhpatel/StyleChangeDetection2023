reminds me of when my grandma was deteriorating in health. i went to visit her and figured i would cheer her up by pulling out old photos from her hallway closet. well…i found a .22 rifle i bring it to her and asked her what this was for. a smile came on her face and she said it was my grandfather’s (who passed 20 years prior) and she knew where the bullets were. she wheeled herself to her rolltop desk and pulled out an envelope full of bullets. i had no idea.
My grand ma was too. She could shoot like Anne Oakley. I'd like to say I was her favorite. But she used to say I had a wee bit of the devil in me. Lols.
My grandpa got his hands on a Luger and shipped it over piece by piece and reassembled it when he got home. Got passed on to my aunt, who passed it on to her son, and then it gets fuzzy on the whereabouts. Pretty sure it's still in the family but I would really feel safer with it in my possession.
I love it Similar situation with my grandma, in her later years when she needed care, my aunt found a small .22 revolver in her purse Turns out grams had been packing an unregistered gun for the previous 35 years.
