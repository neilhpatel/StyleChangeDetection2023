To protect your credit you will need to continue making payments as you promised and guaranteed you would. Separately, you can sue your ex. But you agreed to owe the bank this money. Whose name(s) is/are on the title and registration?
I assume the bank is the leinholder and the title would be in my name only when the debt is paid. The car is registered to my ex, I don't handle the registration or insurance.
Then you have no claim on the car, just responsibility for the debt. Pay it off as fast as you can and then sue the ex, and hope they have a bunch of money sitting around to pay you, or else you'll need to start garnishing their wages, etc.
I don’t know what state you’re in but I would assume that if your name is on the title, you own the car. I don’t care who it’s registered to, ownership is on the title. I don’t know how he got the car registered in his name.
Here in Wisconsin if you’re the owner (named on the title) it gets registered in your name and the insurance is in your name. He may have registered it in your name without you knowing. I would go to the DMV and find out for certain whose name is on the title and who it’s registered to.
Get the DMV to provide evidence that you’re the owner. If your name is on both, go to him and demand your car back. If he won’t give it to you go to the police with the evidence from the DMV and tell them he won’t return your car.
The main problem you may have is if he’s not making the payments, he’s probably not paying for the insurance either and if he gets in an accident it all falls on you.
