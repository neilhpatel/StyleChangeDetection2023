I'm aware that we need to go to couples therapy. She won't do it. Full stop, do not pass go, re-fucking-fuses. I've been trying to get her to go for like two years.
Also we are married, doesn't that mean she can't hide accounts or finances from me? Or is that only with divorce proceedings?
Then it may be time to consider divorce. If she doesn't want to go to therapy, then that's a non-starter. There's no way to force her.
There's no legal obligation for her to disclose anything to you. She'll have to disclose the finances as part of the divorce, but until then there's nothing that says she must keep you informed or provide you with access to accounts. If your name is on the accounts, you may be able to gain access to them directly without her involvement.
You can contact the for advice. The website has phone, chat, and text options. They can help direct you to local resources. If you do decide to separate from her, you will need to plan ahead as she controls your access to funds, housing, and children (domestic abuse organizations can help you make said plans).
