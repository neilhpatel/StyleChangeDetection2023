Your and your son should not talk to anyone but his lawyer about this. If the "our lawyer" you mentioned isn't a good criminal defense attorney, then you should tell him/her "no thanks" and hire the best one you can afford.
The realistic question to ask is: what’s the strenh of the People’s evidence for these charges? In other words, the best path to a sentence that gives your son a chance at some kind of post-prison life might be a negotiated plea, or it might be a vigorous defense, or it might be the willingness to go all the way through jury selection before the ADA offers a reasonable plea.
What I’m trying to say is: no one in this forum can give you more insightful advice than an attorney who has worked the case, knows the evidence, knows the local court and the ADA(s), and has prior capital case experience.
But the answers to these questions are really very specific to his case. While there is a school of thought that allows a practitioner to rattle off expected plea deals like a currency exchange dealer, that’s just not true at this level.
You can certainly seek a second opinion, but that, too, has to come from a lawyer who has an opportunity to look at the evidence and assess its specific impact. What kind of witness will the child victim make? How bad is the visual material? Was the deceased victim a low life or a rescuer of nuns and puppies? All of these things and dozens more factor into what the right strategy is.
No one can really guess what the outcome of this will be. But, (I can't stress this enough), his best outcome is going to be had by working with a good criminal defense attorney.
