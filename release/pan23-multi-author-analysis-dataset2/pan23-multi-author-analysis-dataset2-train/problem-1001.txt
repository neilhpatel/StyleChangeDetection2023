It’s hard to tell what’s going on fully based on your writing. Did the landlord give your dad notice to move and then file for eviction in court after the notice expired? Was the apartment provided as part of your dad’s employment? There are different rules for employment based housing. Did you sign the lease, along with your dad?
Landlord gave my father a 5 day notice on july 30th. Then after the 5 day notice he gave him a 28 day notice. After the 28 days he filed for eviction. I want to kno since i am on the lease and he didnt put my name on the eviction notice and i required to leave?
When you say your dad "obtained" your apartment, does that mean he signed a lease? If so, who is listed on that lease as a tenant? When does the lease expire?
Assuming your name is on the lease, you should be okay, but I would not be certain of that. In the hearing, the judge may not realize the situation, and could issue an order to your detriment because he doesn't understand.
It is vital that you appear at the hearing on Monday so that you can explain your side of things in case something is said in court that you find to be problematic for you.
