Check terror attacks that happened prior to election in Türkiye in the recent years - and this time, Erdogan’s election is threatened as never before, so it’ll be even more aggressive….
Can we fucking not bring everything to Erdogan or his political agenda and do the decent thing today which is to say condolences to Turkey???
It's 2015 all over again. Back then the cunt even said "unless you vote for me, there will be more explosions". Amazingly, people didn't see these attacks as his doing and instead saw him as their protector and voted for him.
If you want begin to understand how much of a farce this arrest has been, here's a brief thread about it from Seth Frantzman's twitter (a respected reporter on Iraq, Turkey, and neighbouring countries.) It really shows how absurd the Turkish legal system is, going from zero to one hundred without a shred of due process (I can't post URL without getting automodded).
