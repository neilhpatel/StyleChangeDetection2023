Induction is not always the answer. Living in Asia all you can get at stores is induction, but they do not really turn down, they cycle. So if you want to simmer some sauce for 30 minutes, often does not work. It boils and makes a mess, then the element cycles off, then full blast until it cycles off. And does not work for boiling eggs, heats up to fast. I have to switch to the gas stove in the house to slowly boil eggs so they come out right. Been digging for a regular coil kind of hot plate to cook sauce on very low.
