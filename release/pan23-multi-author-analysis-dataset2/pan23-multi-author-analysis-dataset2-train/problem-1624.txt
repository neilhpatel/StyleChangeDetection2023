However, the downvotes were most likely because he cited UkraineRussiaReport, a sub that gained notoriety in the start of the "situation in Ukraine" of downplaying and censoring pro-Ukraine viewpoints. I see now that there are some comments by more level-headed people, but there are still popular posts and comments repeating Russian Embassy talking points, even when those points are baseless.
If they are idiots, so are most of the people in this comments section, myself included. Hopefully the BBC is correct, but I sent an email to their error correction address just in case.
The article only says that Maxar (a satellite contractor for the military) states it appears to be a military building. However BBC said it can't comment on the building's actual purpose.
No, because it makes a very very big damn hole that makes it very difficult to repair or traverse. It would then reveal the importance of the building based on the response. If it’s filled with Ukrainians, they won’t do anything about it. If it’s filled with war machine stuff, they’d move to fix access to it very quickly.
