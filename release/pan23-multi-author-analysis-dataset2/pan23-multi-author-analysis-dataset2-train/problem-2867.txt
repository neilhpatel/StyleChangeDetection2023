⚡️ "We give all our 155 mm howitzers to Ukraine. And we want to create a precedent in this way so that other countries do not have any excuses why they cannot provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons to win the war" – Estonian Ambassador to Ukraine Kaimo Kuusk.
[From this][1] I understand they are giving away all towed 155mm artillery pieces. At the same time Estonia is purchasing [K9 Thunders from South Korea][2] and is about to receive first units.
I dont think we've ever really seen any details on sunk boats except Moskva and the Vassilly-whateverov. I've always been curious when they say boat what they mean, i assume small skiffs or patrol craft or something.
The previous most recent boat we heard a bit more about. Not exact details but we know that it was a small vessel sunk in the Dnipro river, probably reconnaissance. I'd hope to get at least as much info this time.
With each meeting, I see how our partners' trust in Ukraine grows. This is all due to the hard work of our soldiers & representatives.
When we give them what they need - Stinger, Javelin, HIMARS, and then long-range artillery weapons - they win.

A lot of RU claims here. Rybar has reduced their claims of progress on their map to the "pre offensive" position around Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka. RU sources have also made claims capturing Kam'yans'ke.
Captured a mix of mobiks and convicts from Russia. One was serving a 22-year sentence. The only son, when phoned his mother, she said it would be better if he was dead.
last thing you wanna see is some angry Russian charging at yo with a mosin that wont fire and a raging hard-on. I wouldn't be able to fire fast enough at the guy.
They'd need to fully mobilise and send out hordes of underquipped, under fed, bullet sponges...just to try keep what they stole.
In Norway 🇳🇴 last night, a secret government meeting was convened to discuss arms support and the possibility of sending Leopard 2 Tanks to Ukraine 🇺🇦 (Dagbladet).
Putin likely turned to Prigozhin & Prigozhin’s reported ally, Army Gen. Sergey Surovikin, to continue efforts to gain ground and break the will of Ukraine and its Western backers to continue the war after the conventional military had culminated & suffered disastrous setbacks.
Russia is bluffing and trying to act tough, their last mobilisation and prison sweep has been severely dented for no major gains.
Igor “Strelkov” Girkin continues to attack decisions made by the Russian leadership. Today, he attacks Russia’s adventure in Syria. Screenshot (source is his Telegram channel) speaks volumes. He is right when he calls Syria a “bottomless hole”. But what’s Putin’s motive? Thread.
