Then just tell them when the answer the door that you are recording for your own safety. Even if you're not recording the chance that someone will make a false claim is highly unlikely if they think they've been recorded accepting the food.
At the moment, Doordash policy is no-contact deliveries which typically means to leave the food at the door. Thereâ€™s no physical interaction between the driver and the coroner customer (thanks autocowreck).
Also DD is meant to be taking pics of it on your doorstep. If you don't come out and get that's on the person I would assume considering all the updates. Uber has a similar policy but there's say if you are doing no contact you accept responsibility when it is left and will pick up in 30. Lots of drivers don't bother with the pics and others send me pics of my car or the sky or once a pic of my shoes that I was wearing when they sat it down lol.
Amazon is similar but they are terrible and leave it in my drive way or at the next house over that currently has mice and trash everywhere(people left ankle and knee deep trash all through the house).
Seems like even if the interaction was inadmissible, it would still help your case a lot to have video of you walking to their door with the food and then walking away with no food. Someone would have to believe the Dasher literally walked up to the door and then threw the food on the roof even without the actual interaction.
