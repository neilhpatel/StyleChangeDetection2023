Hey now, he totally started the initiative to promote women in STEM with $200 million in (already existing) funding. I mean, sure, he also proposed cutting most funding for NASA’s educational STEM programs that would help women, by way of $9 billion in cuts for educational funding, but he said he wanted to help them! So that’s totes good enough.
