You can’t live between two states. If her appeal is denied she’ll need to pay it back or speak with an unemployment attorney. Reading this I’m surprised MA didn’t ask for more back.
IANAL, but I am a contract worker in MA. If you are a resident of MA you have to file MA income tax even for income from other states. If she wasn't a legal resident of MA, she shouldn't have gotten unemployment from MA.
and reported all of the income from those other states, as well as filing in those other states as a MA resident (those states may have given her credit for the taxes she paid to MA). She should have also reported her income from all sources, including out of state, to Unemployment every week while she was collecting.
It's possible that filing an amended return in which she pays MA income tax on any and all of her income might remedy this, but if she didn't report to MA UI any of her earned income regardless of the source or the state in which it was earned then she was committing fraud and must repay it at the very least. The good news is they have been working with people to set up repayment plans because they understand that a lot of people were acting in good faith but were just confused or misinformed.
I think that depends on each state's rules for determining legal residency, but she really needs to straighten out her taxes as well. She'll have an easier time if she maintained a permanent residence anywhere while temporarily relocating for work. It's complicated enough that she should really consult an attorney. I would start with a MA attorney to deal with the issue with MA Unemployment, and if she's hoping to get Unemployment elsewhere, then an attorney from that state. Ask the MA attorney if there's anyone they have a working relationship with.
She really should get a lawyer if she's planning to appeal. There was a lot of PUA fraud in MA and they have been cracking down.
