Also if we were to look at the list of nations that have played silly buggers in other nations aka international terrorism/freedom fighters the list would be somewhat long, Iran, Afghanistan, Israel (mainly its just sending its special forces out to do the wet work itself ie extra judicial killings, but now you get private companies messing around in democratic elections for a price) Saudi (how many of the 9/11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia?). Terrorism and the sponsering of it, is a poor nations method of imposing ones will like the great nuclear powers do. Virtually every nation on the planet has sponsered terrorism in one form or another (ok so apart from North Sentinel Island which hasn't but then thats a protecterate of India thats treated like a soveriegn nation).
At most I think they would get the US enforcing a no fly zone for them, air/missile strikes on Iranian military targets, and intelligence/logistical supply.
I doubt anyone would join them in a war on Iran other than the US and I'm even more doubtful that the US would have boots on the ground.
Yes, I meant US would enforce a no fly zone for Israel's attack on Iran. Sorry if I wasn't concise.
