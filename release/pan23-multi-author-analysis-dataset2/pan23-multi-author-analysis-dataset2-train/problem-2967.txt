You're not doing anything wrong. It's public parking and is not owned by any specific individual. You have a crank for a neighbor who was probably planning on parking his own car there before you took what he considers to be "his space.".
You should decide whether the confrontation is worth it. Irrational people tend to do irrational things, and you don't really want some sort of neighborhood feud, even if you happen to be in the right.
Even if he did call the cops, if they show up at 3:01 and you're parked there... you're legally parked there, and frankly I HIGHLY doubt any LEO is going to show up for a parking dispute.
The cops will tell your neighbor that it is a public street and any duly registered vehicle can park there - most jurisdictions don't permit unregistered vehicles to be stored on a public street. In our city, you have to move a vehicle at least a mile every 24 hours or it can be ticketed, however, enforcement only happens when neighbors complain long and loud.
I had a similar issue with a neighbor last year. My side of the street was signed no parking and she took issue with me and/or my guests parking in the only available legal street parking which happened to be in front of her house. She warned me she was going to call the cops and I told her to go ahead. She called them, they spoke to her and they left without coming over to say a word to me. Fortunately I never had any retaliation but a camera is probably wise.
