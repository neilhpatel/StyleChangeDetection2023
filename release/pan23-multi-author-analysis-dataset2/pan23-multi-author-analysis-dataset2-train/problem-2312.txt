NAL, if your sister’s name is on the deed you can’t evict her, as she’s a part owner of the property. You’ll likely have to go the more painful and expensive route of forcing the sale of the house through a court order. You also mentioned she has a well paying job...would she be interested in buying you and your other sibling’s portions? If not...probably time to contact a probate attorney.
"Notice to vacate" is a thing yes. But only the executor can give it, and enforce it in court. What do you mean "no executor" because there has to be an executor/administrator. No one else can legally do anything at all. In this case it might be the trustee if the house is in a trust, who is the trustee?
If there is a trust and the home is titled to the trustee, the trustee alone has authority to take action. The designation of an executor in a will is irrelevant.
