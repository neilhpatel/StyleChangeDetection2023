She is 12. She really isn't old enough to make that decision. You need to tell the parents and she needs to get into therapy asap. This is life long damage. The earlier she gets help the better.
We are most likely going to visit her mom tonight after work. But my Gf is afraid that her niece will inflict self harm or worse. I am also concerned about that.
The reason why my Gf wants to wait until January is so her niece has time to calm down and prepare to speak to her mom. Her mom isn’t the most approachable person.
Sorry if it seems like I’m rebuttalling towards the other commenter because I’m not. I’m just trying to give as much information about the situation as I can to receive the best advice. I have already planned to speak with her mom in a couple of hours.
I wouldn't speak with the mother, I'd call CPS. If the mother races to interview the kid it may result in a lockdown of the child, loss of memory, etc.
I’m having a hard time replying to your comment because it seems like you are attacking me. I just found out last night so I wouldn’t say that I’m sitting on it. Am I not reaching out for help?
They do have an active cps case already and I am going to inform them as well. But I must say that I am not confident in going to them because when this happened to me; no one care except my uncle. When he informed cps they did nothing after they examined me and made life at home a living hell. But this was in 2003.
