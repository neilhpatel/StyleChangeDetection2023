Look up tenant's rights in your state and only do what you are required to do. Your relationship with the former owner or the bank are none of their business. The bank should have tried to evict you a long time ago. You are now the new owner's tenant. They need to start from scratch to evict you and you very likely have not even been given proper notice of eviction; in many states you would have 30 days BUT CHECK your state. You are under no obligation to inform them of what you know, nor under what terms you will leave. You can just say "I will leave when legally required" or you can consider accepting a cash-for-keys offer where they pay you, say, two month's rent in your area to leave in a certain time. They almost certainly cannot cut your power or make conditions uninhabitable.
They need to formally evict you, but you need to start making plans to be out before that happens. Having an eviction on your record will make it so that most landlords flat out won't rent to you at all and the ones who do will likely charge you thousands more in various move in fees. You do not want to deal with that.
