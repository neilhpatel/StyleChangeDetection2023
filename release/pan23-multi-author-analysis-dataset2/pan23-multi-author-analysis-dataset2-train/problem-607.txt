Unless you and your roommate look very much different and the witness accurately describes your roommate which cannot be you... you are likely to be presumed to be driving your car in this hit and run.
This happened while I was in bed with my wife, I don't think I have any proof other than her as an alibi.
Time to call an attorney. Also, if you have any proof you were at home or have some way of showing you were elsewhere during this accident, put that proof in a very safe place with multiple backups.
Spouses are iffy alibis because others are never sure if they're telling the truth or protecting a loved one and themselves from financial damage.
Hopefully the witness got a really good look at your roommate and gave a very accurate description, because if his statement is "I didn't see who was driving, it was too dark" you're in trouble.
We look extremely different so hopefully a visual description will be enough. Should I talk to an attorney before anything else happens? I don't necessarily have the money to get one.
Thank you for your quick replies, I'll take your advice and speak with a lawyer hopefully today. I'm new to this kind of stuff, shat kind of lawyer do I need to talk to?
