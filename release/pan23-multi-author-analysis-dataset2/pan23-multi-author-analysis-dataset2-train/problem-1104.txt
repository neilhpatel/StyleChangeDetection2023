I bought a house in the Bay Area in 2016. I very quickly became a NIMBY person, because I had just invested $million into a house, things that would cause that to depreciate were scary, because I was super overextended on the price.
It's hard to invest a huge amount of money, knowing the problem, but then seeing your own personal finance and asset potentially being damaged by a project near your house that isn't really garenteed to fix anything. I know it's greedy, but it's also self preservation. All the things I voted down/signed petitions against were extremely vague in what they were doing. They talked about "potential low income housing".... but the land they wanted to develop was basically beach front. You aren't building beach front housing on the peninsula for low income people. The infrastructure of the area also wouldn't be able to handle a lot more people, it was hard to get in and out of the town.
They elect politicians that enact exclusionary zoning. They're the only people to show up to council or planning meetings, opposing new housing that could "impact the neighborhood character" or house people.
