You have no legal right to see this child at all, full stop. You will have to go to court and attempt to compel parental rights by filing an "Affidavit of Parentage". Once that's filed, the mother will dispute, and then you'd have grounds to try to compel a DNA test via court.
If you are ultimately added to the child's birth certificate, you may owe back-dated child support. I cannot say with any certainty.
I understand I have no legal rights “right now” but it’s been nice to visit when she’s been okay with it. Seems like the nice time is over though.
It depends on a number of things. NC can order you to pay backed child support, but usually only do if you've been missing legally ordered payments, or, if you are claiming benefits for the child like filing with them as a dependent on your taxes.
Another user mentioned that I may not have to backpay child support because I was never legally aware because there’s never been a paternity test? Why can you add or say to that?
It seems they may be moving to Georgia sometime soon, what state would it all really matter in? The state which she was born? Or the state where she resides? Doesn’t make sense if it is where ever my baby mama moves to since she could conceivably move to where she would benefit most? I imagine it’s based on where my daughter was born...
