Well when one of our biggest enemies Russia can’t take over one small country our military industrial complex has to up the ante with another one of our enemies. All to keep the money flowing to the military.
China’s military is also more corrupt than Russia’s and is mostly composed of inept officers and generals who bought their positions.
There are too many major points of contention between the stereotypical "Western World" and its adversaries, and we seem to be running out of options to resolve them peacefully. The Ukraine invasion feels like just the first salvo.
Are we just slo-rolling to some form of WW3? Not necessarily nuclear or as massive as the previous World Wars, but it really seems that tensions keep rising, and alliances are slowly forming based on common interests/tactical goals (even if the allies have little in common.) You already see the atheistic, communist North Korea, the theocratic Iran, and the plutocratic, capitalist Russia, getting closer to each other and supporting each other's political goals, by the simple virtue of making themselves the world pariahs, and deciding that sticking together is in their common interest.
I fear things will gradually keep on escalating until all major powers are directly involved in some kind of conflict, even if a limited proxy conflict (think less of WW1/2 or a nuclear WW3, and more of several Vietnam-size wars going in parallel all over the globe, each world power fighting a proxy war with a weaker ally of the other, to reduce the nuclear risk of a direct confrontation.).
