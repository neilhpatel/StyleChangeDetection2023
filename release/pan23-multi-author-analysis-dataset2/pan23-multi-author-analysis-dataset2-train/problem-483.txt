No credit whatsoever goes to the government. This is a surge due to progressive acts of Pahlavids. If Islamic government and mullahs could, they would have banned or limited female entries to higher education.
Throughout their tenure the participation of women has grown every decade, so I don't think it's right to say it's because of some progressive acts 50 years ago when there were less women in college than men.
I agree with your first paragraph, but they were probably too busy with other things that they did not ban women from colleges. About your second paragraph saying "50 years ago there were less women in college than men" is like saying there are more mobile phones in Iran than 50 years ago! That is, if you had given 50 years time to the system of 50 years ago, now Iran would have undoubtedly had the most progressive equal liberal governance in the middle east by far.
The country only needs a little of support for its highly educated large portion of population to fully wipe off Islamic backwardness altogether. I really sincerely hope to see this in my life time.
I mean they absolutely could have if they wanted to. They forced every woman in the country to wear a hijab for 40 years. They could have easily said they can't go to college either if they wanted to.
The reason why Iran is so ‘evil’ now is primarily America’s doing. Everything was going fantastically well until Iran decided they werent going to do exactly as they were told, then America toppled their regime and installed a religious dictator.
This is what happens when you learn history off Reddit and twitter; apparently the Iranian revolution was spearheaded by the Americans and Khomeini was installed by the US. Lmao.
