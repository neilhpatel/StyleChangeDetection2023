It's not terribly cold, only a low of about 42 degrees, which beagles (the dogs I have) are much more equipped for the cold than other dogs. They have plenty of food and water, I wouldn't keep them out there if I weren't completely sure they'd be fine.
Also, you've been a bit vague about who came to pick up your dogs - you talk about their website but you don't seem to really know who they are. Were you there when they took the dogs? Did you meet or speak to anyone from animal control?
"An animal rescue" - Is this animal control by the city or state? If so, there's things missing here. Or just some random animal rescue? If it's not operated by the city and you didn't have an investigator over to talk to you etc then it's possibly theft of property. You wouldn't be able to sue the neighbors, but you need to focus on the dogs and making sure you get them back.
If it doesn't say something like (Your county) animal control or has a .gov ending, it is likely a private organization and your dogs were stolen. Call the police and give them the name of the website and all communication you have had about your dogs. Make sure you state that you want to file a report for theft of property. (Your dogs are property.).
Based on your spelling of some words, I am going to guess you are not in the USA. Can you please provide your location so we can either answer you, or point you toward a more region-specific legal information subreddit?
I'm not 100% sure but I think it might be because the website describes the rescue as a "Federal tax-exempt organization" which I'm not exactly sure what that means.
It's a pretty widely known organization and as a .org site. I'm not sure if that changes anything but I don't think it's really a private organization.
