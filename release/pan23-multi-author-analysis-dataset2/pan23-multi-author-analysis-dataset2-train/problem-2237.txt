Typically, once you get the 3 day pay-or-quit, and you move out, the contract is severed. You might still owe back rent for days you were already there, but the landlord can't charge you for not giving enough notice or whatever.
If you didn't sign a lease, then most likely you're only responsible for your share of any outstanding rent or property damage.
The thing about being sued is that you don't have to show up to court with money and pay immediately any judgment against you. You can take your sweet time to pay. The important thing is that if you do get sued, make sure you file a response with the court (if one is required) and make sure you show up to the hearing once it is scheduled.
So, because of how shitty the few months I did live there were (I literally did not have a way to pay rent for the first 3) I have not paid any rent at all. Wonderful I did at least think that the 30 days notice would be void.
You generally don't need a lawyer for an issue like this, especially if you haven't been sued. This is just an opinion, but I think it's very unlikely you will get sued at all.
