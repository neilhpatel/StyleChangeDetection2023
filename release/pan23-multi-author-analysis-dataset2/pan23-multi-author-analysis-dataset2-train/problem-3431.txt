Walmart requires a US address from sellers for returns. They are most likely overseas and don't care about receiving them. Walmart's enhanced marketplace returns program exclusively uses FedEx so this makes sense.
You need to call Walmart and ask for escalations. They can pressure the seller to respond. If that doesn't work, you need to find a way to contact a department at Walmart called "Trust and Safety". They can suspend the seller and that should stop the returns.
You should know that stopping mail delivery to your address will only cause you a lot of headaches and not solve anything since these are FedEx packages and not USPS.
Not trying to hijack the thread at all but I had something similar happen in the past, is there any harm to OP legally if they decide to work things out with the seller? If they are an outside company that needs a US address for returns, but don’t actually care about getting the returned items, then would there be any harm in contacting the seller and saying something along the lines of “Hey I’m getting your stuff delivered to my place, if you don’t want it is it cool if I keep select items?” Feel like it would cut down on waste that way.
Edit: As long as the people returning the items are still getting their money back/ item exchanged that is.
Walmart will refund the customers within 48 business hours automatically. There is a literal countdown timer in the sellers account.
Most sellers specialize in a specific category or two. So getting a grab bag of random cool stuff is rare. I'd be more worried about attracting porch pirates or having to deal with holiday return volume. Imagine having 40 to 50 boxes a day of the same items showing up? Say you go away for the holidays and come back to 300 soaked cardboard boxes just sitting outside.
I'd also be hesitant to have my address on those labels as well. Imagine an angry Walmart customer who received a defective item and they notice you live right down the road.
