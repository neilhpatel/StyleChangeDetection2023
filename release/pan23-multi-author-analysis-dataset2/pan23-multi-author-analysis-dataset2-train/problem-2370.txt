Why would you believe anything the guy said that showed up with an AR-15 to buy shoes and then tried to scam the money out of you a few days later? Stop communicating with him. On the off chance the police show up or call to discuss - follow redituser1211's advice.
If police come to arrest you on any changes, claim your fifth amendment right and refuse to speak no matter what they tell you without your lawyer. Don't be rude to police, just respectfully decline to comment without a lawyer. You can do this for as long as you want.
As for the possible charges, what state is this? What law/crime did the guy claim you were violating?
How long ago was this? You haven't been charged so it seems like something that might not be worth police time or maybe you're local prosecutor just didn't care.
As for the civil side, he probably can't sue you for this but he may argue in court that this was intentional infliction of emotional distress or something stupid like that. If you are gonna get sued by the guy, that's between you two. Someone would come to your house to serve you papers explicitly telling you you're being sued.
I work in the criminal justice system in a different state, death threats (fall under “aggravated menacing” charge) are a misdemeanor here, max sentence is 6 months in jail and/or fine of $1k.
I have literally never seen anyone go to jail over a death threat. I’ve been doing this for 10 years.
For now, lay low and relax. Don't contact the guy again, backup any records of your interactions with him as well.
You can also call your local Clerk of Courts and ask if you have a warrant. You don’t need to explain anything, just ask if you have a warrant.
I'm in Colorado. He claims he's a bounty hunter (is there any way to check this?) and that I am guilty of aggravated harassment. I haven't heard from anyone yet though. I'll keep my mouth shut and get a lawyer if anything happens. Thank you so much.
