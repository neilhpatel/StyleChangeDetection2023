Are we just going to start referring to Paul as hammer man then start posting parachute pants GIFs and MC Hammer songs? Stanley Burrell could use the money.
His inner dialogue has to be aware it's a lose lose to even try to engage. His followers however will look at this statement as a sign of strenh. To only further their beliefs of "he stands up to everything and stands down to nothing.".
It's like Team America: World Police .. whenever there's an issue in the middle east, you just hear "death to America, Muhammad Jihad" .. even as they greet eachother.
I don’t like the sabre rattling of Iran and North Korea right now, especially on the heels of all the talk of Russia using a dirty bomb or blowing a dam in Ukraine, which would create a big distraction, for Russias biggest adversary, the United States.
That’s fair, also a great distraction, doesn’t feel far fetched to think Vlad has asked Kim to stir up shit, maybe even fake intelligence to support it.
This statement was made only to show strenh within his followers, within his country. This isn't a threat to the US as most know. Just an echo chamber within to further strenhen his "morality" of their society.
In short, crazy dude speaks crazy sentences. Causing crazy people to believe crazy beliefs. It's nothing more. Hell, we see it here in the US daily right now during the election season with borders and gas prices.
