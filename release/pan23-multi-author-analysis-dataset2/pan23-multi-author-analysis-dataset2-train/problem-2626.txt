Omg Twin I was just coming here to say that I didn't think I'd enjoy all this reality t.v. "mean boy" stuff...but here I am. More drama, please. Pass the snack bowl, please. I'm waiting for an actual, literal explosion of someone's head; Trump, DeSantis, McConnel, any of their heads.
I actually think that the fact that one of them is now Donald Trump, and he isn't likely to be the winner this time, makes everything different. EVERYTHING. That unity has mostly been a result of disciplined messaging from the overall party, lockstep unison from those running it on the really big fights (like the presidency).
He had to be personally massaged into doing it by the head of the RNC, after a private conversation that Trump emerged from very happy. I can only imagine what they told him to get him to go along with it (perhaps convinced him he was going to win anyway).
That trend is going to finally see its first exception. I remember during the 2016 primaries that he was refusing to sign a loyalty pledge for the RNC that promised to support whoever won the Republican primary. Every other candidate but him was fine with it.
