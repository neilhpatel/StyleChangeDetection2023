The frustrating thing is that there were multiple body cams in play, but because they intentionally obfuscated their vision, it seems only a lucky street camera caught the worst of the brutality.
I mean, they likely didn't know that there was a camera there, and they likely submitted some report about the incident before all hell broke loose on them. I'm curious what that police report says.
Five police officers do not go rogue on their own. This is a systematic departmental wide culture that permits this behavior. The department needs to be investigated and this should be SOP anytime this happens. I bet this isnâ€™t an isolated incident; just one that was caught on camera and one that led to the death of the victim.
