No, there is no cooling off period for marriage. Once the license is completed and filed, that's it.
The good news is that a 1 month long marriage shouldn't make for too tricky of a divorce, provided there's not much you own in common. Good chance this will be a very straightforward divorce where you both walk out with what you walked in with. Speak to a family law attorney to get the ball rolling.
The house is in my name with no mention of her, no kids ((hopefully), we were trying). I just hope she doesn’t try to take me over the coals with this. I doubt that she knows that I’m going to file, I have months worth of messages from even before the wedding (courtesy of the mans girlfriend).
Speak to an attorney certainly, but it would be very difficult for her to truly rake you over the coals after only a month long marriage. Since the marriage only existed for one month, there shouldn't be too much to divide from the marital estate. The court's goal will be to effectively "wind back the clock" on the marriage and have you both walk out with what you walked in with, or as close to that as is reasonably possible.
I'd be shocked if she takes anything other than what she brought based on the lenh of the marriage. Annulment may be the way to go. A good lawyer can show you were duped the entire time. Just please say that you don't live in CA cause that state is a shit show based on what others have posted in the past.
Now that your friend is gone, your wife obviously wants to make it work with you. My ex did that too (after his AP left). Glad to see you're not falling for that BS. Never be anyone's plan B.
