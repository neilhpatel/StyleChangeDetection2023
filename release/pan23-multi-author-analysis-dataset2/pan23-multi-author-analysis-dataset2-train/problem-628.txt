You should check the copy of the paperwork that you signed when you made the offer on the house/wrote the sales contract. The disclosure may not have come in the form of an actual contract. It simply could have been a piece of paper that informed you of the business affiliations. It should reference RESPA (that’s the acronym) on the form. If you were provided anything like I have described, there’s not much you can do. If you don’t have that form, refer to the rest of this post...
You're at the point where something very fishy seems to be going on. There are multiple things that seem off and that you were unaware of. Are these things illegal? or just a bit sketchy/bad luck? A lawyer reviewing details is seemingly where you're at. I know there's the fear that it's wasted money, but, some lawyers will give you a cursory review as to whether you have a case at a reduced cost, or even if they don't, might be a few hundred to potentially save thousands. Worth the risk in my opinion, and at least you won't have a "what if" in you're head. You'll at least know if you had any legal recourse.
