It depends. Does she have surviving children or surviving parents? Does she have property that would pass through a beneficiary, like a 401k or life insurance policy?
Details kind of matter here. Assuming there is no will, and she has a parent, the spouse is entitled to all the community property (which may not be much) and half her separate property. The mother gets the other half of the separate property, which is probably most of her property unless they did something like close on a house immediately after getting married. Again, this does not include anything that passes outside of the estate, like bank accounts, insurance policies, 401ks, or brokerage accounts with named beneficiaries. Those go to whomever is listed.
Talking to a couple of mutual friends, it is amazing how many people are asking about foul play. But since she’s not yet 40, with no known health issues, it’s not a nice thought to have.
The estate will have to go through probate, an administrator will need to be selected, and the mother should have her own attorney. It would behoove the mother and the husband to work out an agreement, because contested probate proceedings take forever and cost a fortune in attorney fees, to the extent they tend to eat up estate assets until there's not much left to split up.
If there was foul play, however, the husband is not only really stupid for killing his spouse so soon after the marriage because it looks sketchy as hell, but given the community/separate property distinction, he's also stupid for not waiting until there was more community property, or an estate plan. Spouses often leave each other everything.
