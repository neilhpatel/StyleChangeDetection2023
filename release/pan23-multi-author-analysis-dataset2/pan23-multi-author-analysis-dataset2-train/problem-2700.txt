This explains how to do it by mail. It is from an organization that supports LGBTQ individuals, so the page talks about supplying gender change documentation as well as name change documentation. If gender change doesn't apply to you, ignore it. There is a link to the proper form. You can pay by check, money order or credit card.
Why do you need that ? The NY court order will allow you to change your name with Social Security, and on your passport, and your driver's license, and in every other meaningful way in the future.
Oh wow thank you so much I am enby and didn't know that colorado would allow me to change my birth certificate to reflect that so that's a huge help for me this is exactly what I needed.
I am intimately familiar with the importance some people put on documentation about their names, especially names that connote gender.
But lots of people don't understand the differences between their various ID documents and their function.
Many people, including OP, think they need to change a vital record maintained by the state (their birth certificate) to allow them to live their lives with a name they weren't given at birth. They don't.
That's not what OP thinks lol. OP wants every document with their dead name changed to the proper name regardless if it's "needed" I've spoken with OP about this and even if the birth certificate isn't needed to have ID and name change they want it because it has their dead name on it. It's meaningful to them.
