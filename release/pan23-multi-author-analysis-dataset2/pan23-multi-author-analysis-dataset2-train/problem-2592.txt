Thankfully so are Arizona voters. The more the GOP doubles down (quadrupled down?) on this bullshit the more they’re going to lose independent and moderate voters who will take just a functioning adult in office compared to the crazy idiots the GOP keeps putting up.
In a competitive presidential race the GOP will have an extremely hard time getting to 270 electoral votes with swing states showing in 2020 and 2022 they’re not tolerating this no platform fascist bullshit GOP playbook.
Arizona had some pretty bad candidates this year. I don’t want to say they were the worst candidates. Republicans ran bad candidates all over the country.
They are going to be the epicenter of 2024, 2026, 2028........ unfortunately, I don't think crazy is going to go away anytime soon. As thier rhetoric becomes more violent, I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before the nutsos lash out. You can see the way the alt-right politicians are running interference for them in the way they are questioning the warning signs of extremists.
