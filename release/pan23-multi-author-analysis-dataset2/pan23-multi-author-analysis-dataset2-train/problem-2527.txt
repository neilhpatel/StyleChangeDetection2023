Likely depends on the location. Where I live there’s only two permits; one for any septic system on site, and one for the culvert at the entrance to the property. They don’t really care about anything else, like wells, power, building code, etc.
So where I'm at in the US, a bunch of houses burned in forest fires. The locals that lost their homes are pissed that they can't get permits to rebuild, but some of the reasons for it are 1) the roads where they're located are to narrow for fire trucks to get to 2) they were unpermitted in the first place 3) landslide risks.
Earthquakes are largely unpredictable and we have no way to manage or prevent them like we do with forest fires.
The crazy thing about forest fires though is that they should be manageable. Prescribed burns, underbrush clearing, cutting fire breaks, etc. all mean less uncontrolled wildfire during fire season. Instead, many places have a decades long burn ban in effect, the land owners don’t maintain the woods, etc. and the recent droughts have made it all even worse.
