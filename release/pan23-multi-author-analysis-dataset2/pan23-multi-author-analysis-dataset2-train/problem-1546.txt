I strongly suspect that the DoJ might already have the warrants to search Trump’s additional properties. However, I think that Merrick Garland really worries about criticism from the Right about being partisan so he’s searching Biden and Pence so he can say, “See, I’m searching the others too!”.
Why has the FBI searched every nook and cranny for Biden & Pence - the two guys who have voluntarily handed over data.

I'm pretty NARA has a list of things that are still unaccounted for. Things that are important enough to track properly, unlike the stuff that Pence and Biden have been turning in.
I’m hoping this is the case, but who knows? Perhaps this is just another way for Garland to drag out holding Trump accountable for anything.
