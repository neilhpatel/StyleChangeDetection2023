The area south of the Belarus border in Ukraine is very well fortified, and the troops in Belarus are pretty much infantry. If the tried to go into Ukraine, it would be a mind-bogglingly brutal slaughter of Russian infantry. They’d be fodder in the truest sense of the term. Either Russian intends to formally annex Belarus, or they are going to intentionally sacrifice the majority of their forces there, perhaps as a stunt to justify other escalations to the Russian people. If another couple hundred thousand Russians learn that their brothers and fathers died in Ukraine and TV’s got you convinced they’re the aggressors, suddenly everyone will be keen on fighting indefinitely with the most expensive resources and destroying the economy to do it.
As events of winter 2020 showed it may break out on a swift move, especially with rusnia weakened as war in Ukraine backfires. When they're invaded with russian onuce (foot wraps) on the ground, and annexed that may be way more difficult. Maybe if Kalinowski battalion grows up in numbers it may be a difference?
