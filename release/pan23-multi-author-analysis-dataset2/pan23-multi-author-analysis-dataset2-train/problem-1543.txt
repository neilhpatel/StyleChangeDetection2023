No. I don't know that they have any legal requirement to keep eyes on you. They certainly are not obligated to sit next to you to catch you when you pass out.
Also, i said “i think”. Maybe your mommy can buy you a pin that says “unnecessarily trolls people on Reddit”.
Yea i don’t think you have any grounds to sue here. They’re required to ask you to stay for the 15 minutes, not to prevent you from fainting. They are asked to monitor you, but they can only do so much when they’re also still doing their entire job as a pharmacist.
You can certainly call them and see what they say but I don't see what obligation they had to keep you from falling when you passed out.
Cool for me. Not cool for other people you shed your useless advice on. Dont quit your day job buddy. Maybe your mommy can buy you a pin that says “Certified Reddit Attorney”.
Idk thats why im here. Are they supposed to monitor you or something? These pharmacists didnt even know I passed out until I told them and they saw the blood gushing from my face.
