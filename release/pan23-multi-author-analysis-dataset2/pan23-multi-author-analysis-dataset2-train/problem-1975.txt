Do you have an actual work contract or just an offer letter with these terms? The former is exceedingly rare.
Unless you have an employment contract with breach terms this isn't a legal matter. You're quitting. If you don't work your hours as required your employer may terminate you before your last week ends. There's also nothing in an at-will employment agreement that requires you to work out your notice period; if they're being unreasonable you could just quit immediately.
My employer and I signed a "work contract" that stated these terms (""position can schedule its own hours as per demands, needs, and deadlines of entities/principles"). However, this "work contract" was my initial offer letter. I despise working at my current work place - employer is terrible to its staff; first time I have ever encountered an employer I despise. I have had enough.
Anyways, how do you think I should respond to my employer? I'm thinking of saying something along the lines of, "According to the state of California and our contract, I am not obligated to work any certain amount of hours. However, out of respect for you and the company I will be working at most 8.0 hours day until my departure.".
Just understand that by doing so you are burning this bridge to the ground behind you. Make absolutely sure you will never need a reference from this employer. You will likely be ineligible for rehire, and they can tell that to any prospective employer who contacts them in the future.
