Identify a thing you want for yourself (Ukraine and its people), cause problem in/with the thing that you can then claim to have the solution for while ignoring/hiding that you caused the problem in the first place (invade country and blow up infrastructure, causing unsafe conditions for children and most likely a lot of orphans), implement the solution in a way that gives you what you wanted (abduct/relocate tens of thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied zones to raise them as Russian or at least pro-Russian).
> Additionally, Russian officials in Zaporizhzhia announced they would soon transfer 40,000 Ukrainian children to Russia, saying that the system of care in occupied Ukraine is inadequate.
I'm glad for every child who can be reunited with their Ukranian relatives. Sadly, there seem to be many more that haven't yet been, or are at risk of being abducted:
I think of the ones, where their parents and family were wiped out, where noone is even looking for them. Will they get left behind, after pootin is death and russia grovels for the worlds forgiveness?
