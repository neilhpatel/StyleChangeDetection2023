How long and how hard is it to manufacture that type of ammo? Is it possible or is there some sort of a proprietary thing? I think my question makes sense?
Anyone else questioning the logic of an arms company that doesn't sell its products in a time of war?
The problem, I think, is that the 35 mm ammo used by the Gepard is quite specific and is mostly produced by Oerlikon, a Swiss company. I assume that ammo manufacturers are already struggling to produce enough of their usual products, and would have a hard time starting up new ones.
As much as I appreciate the whole 'company (or country) with a conscience' concept, the point of manufacturing weapons is for them to be used as a deterrent, and if the deterrent isn't working, to actually use them.
It's even dumber when you consider that the Swiss have already seized Russian property inside their country.
yea.. apparently they have this weird mentality about being neutral (they even traded with the nazi's) .. their thing is they can't really be attacked from any direction because they have choke points in the mountains and like literlly giant guns set up on the only roads in existence. the swiss sleep well lol.
