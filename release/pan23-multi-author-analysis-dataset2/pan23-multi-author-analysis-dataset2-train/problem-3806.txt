My honest question is, what is the difference between this new Israeli government, and the Italian or Swedish new governments? I will be interesting to see how the media portrays them since I actually believe this new Israeli government is more radically right-wing than Italy's (not sure about Sweden).
This article points out the extreme views (lessening the powers of the courts etc) of this new ultra right wing Israeli government.
It will change drastically if the government will be comprised only from the right and the far-right. A lot of humanitarian measures that Israel currently employs as the carrot in a carrot-and-stick paradigm (like the huge uptick in work permits inside Israel for Palestinians from Gaza, the permits for traders to come and trade inside Israeli and for the first time in a very long time construction permits in Area C, all part of Gantz's and others from the professional side of the Defense Ministry perspective on the conflict) are going to be withdrawn because if the Defense Ministry is going to be headed by someone from the far-right, they'll come from a paradigm that comprised only of sticks.
