It's discouraging for the future to see all thèse people offended by digging this Deep just to get victimised because they have nothing else in this world than the need of being Taken cared of from A to Z. Humans are not going anywhere for the near future.
You can create the appearance of a consensus by having a couple nations push a point that you care about, without ever bringing it up yourself.
In this case the people looking to be offended are allying with Russia against the west, and so ignoring them is likely for the best.
Apology that countries which visited by Lavrov have more tourists coming to see wildlife? That Germany used animal naming traditions longer that many countries have their independence? Or that offended people are too stupid to get pun with elementary school level of complexity?
Those who feel offended by that tweet should save their energy for the neo-nazi Wagner group indiscriminately killing Africans in Mali.
“The Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov is in Africa, not to see 🐆, but to bluntly claim that Ukraine’s partners “want to destroy everything Russian”. Here is a 🧵 with all of his “evidence”: 1/3”.
—— Much of the tourist trade to Africa is to see the wildlife. Honestly I’m trying to find the offense in this tweet. Seems like an overreaction to me.
