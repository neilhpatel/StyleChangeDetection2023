It sounds like they still have your things in storage and just lack the ability to deliver them to you now right?
Can you arrange to have another moving company pick the things up from the storage location and deliver to you? It'll cost you obviously but much less of a pain in the ass than having to replace all your stuff.
I would recommend you have a heart to heart with your new boss. Explain the situation and get them to give you Monday and Tuesday off one way or another. Fly to the location Sunday. Line up a giant rental truck (but don't execute), and go visit them on Monday first thing. Hopefully they'll just be happy to be rid of a final client.
You may not have much time left. If the company has lost its cert, and has let it's mailbox fill, it is very likely in the process of going under and will be shedding employees and liabilities. Liabilities like the rent on various storage facilities. If they pay off the storage and abandon the contents, it could be thrown away quickly (as compared to a unit that is forfeit for lack of payment).
Property records are public; many are searchable online. If you research the property records and see where in NC that entity owns property, you can look on Google maps by address and see which properties are equipped for long term storage of either property or loaded trucks. That may give you a better idea of what to do; the sheriff or state police MAY be more helpful than city police.
When talking to your boss, keep it short and sweet. The moving company you hired didn't deliver, you've discovered their cert has been revoked and they're avoiding your calls. You need a couple days to go handle this situation and retrieve your belongings.
