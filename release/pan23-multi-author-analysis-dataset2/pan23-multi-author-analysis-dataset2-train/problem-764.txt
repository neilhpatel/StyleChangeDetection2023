Example: I personally work a schedule of 4-3-3-4, so I’m on 4, off 3, on 3, off 4. Our pay period goes from Sunday 12am - Saturday 11:59 pm, so if I’m working a Saturday night and start at 8pm, I get 8-12 on one week and 12-8 on the other week, a majority of the time that Saturday night shift ends when that 2 weeks period ends, so I already have 8 hours into the next pay period when I get off. Some checks I have a 36 hour week and the second is a 48 hour week, so I get paid 8 hours OT, but it’s not always the check that I’m about to get that coming Thursday, sometimes it comes two weeks later, but it all evens out in the wash.
They can change when the work week starts and ends, but cannot change the actual lenh of the work week. It has to be a consistent, continuous 168 hour period, whether that starts on Sunday at midnight or Tuesday at 2PM.
Overtime is calculated based on hours actually worked in that period. The employer is allowed to adjust the schedule so that the employee doesn't work more than 40 hours in a work week.
