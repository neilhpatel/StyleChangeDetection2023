Have you reached out to your professor? They should have designated office hours for you to stop in and ask for some guidance and help. You can schedule a meeting too if you prefer. Since your professor is the expert in this topic and is likely quite used to navigating these difficult-to-understand texts, they should be able to give you pointers on how to approach them. Seeking some help can go a long way And I hope someone here provides good advice on how to approach these readings as well.
What helps me is to take it slow. We are used to modern language where we can read a text very quickly, sometimes even skim it, and still understand the gist of a text. With older texts, that won't be your experience at first. Go through very slowly. Like u/mayaxs suggested, stop regularly and decide in your own words what the text was saying. That may also help you remember what is being said.
If you get overwhelmed, take a short break. Pushing through when you're stressing may make you even less likely to understand. Go take a walk, play a video game, whatever clears your head, then come back to the text.
I also find that having the context of a class helps a lot. Let's say the professor has been talking about (or will be talking about, according to your syllabus) nobility in Renaissance Italy. Now you know what you're learning about! Now you can look at your document knowing that. What's going on in your document? How does it tie in to the course? What can it tell you about the topic? I find that reading with those sorts of things in mind makes it way easier to me than if I'm just blindly reading a document with no idea what it is or what to look for.
