I would be excited about that, unfortunately that's not the reality of where we are. I personally believe we are stuck voting for democrats or traitors. I don't believe for a minute they would not tear it all down "save freedom". We got lucky that enough politicians chose their duty to the constitution over their party, will we be so again? Not a gamble I'm willing to take with my grandkids future. Until the GOP faces a fundamental change in policy and rhetoric I will vote for anyone not them.
