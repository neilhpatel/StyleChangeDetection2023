Assuming that they have probable cause to arrest you, yes they will eventually arrest you. This could take anywhere from days, to months, to years.
There are very, very, very few circumstances where it might be better to confess. This isn't one of them.
2. Should I contact the detective and tell him I refuse to make a statement, or should I just ignore him until they try to contact/arrest me? (He gave me until sometime next week).
It is typical that a first time offender does not get jail time, or if they do, a very short sentence followed by probation.
Do not speak to the police, do not speak to the detective, you do not have to and it can only hurt you. If they had enough to arrest you, then you'd be arrested. They don't have enough, so they're hoping you tell them something.
No sentence at all is the best option, which you can only talk yourself out of by trying to rush this. Don't speak to them.
2. It will "look better" remaining silent/pleading not guilty and letting your public defender do their job.
Remember police can lie and claim they have video of you, that three people identified you, that if you just give them your "side of the story" that you'll "not be in any trouble" and "get to go right home.".
