So let me get this right, you think we’re giving Ukraine 80 billion dollars so they can give that money to Hunter Biden? That is legitimate nonsense lmao, how about when Trump blackmailed Zelensky into declaring a phony investigation into Burisma to damage the Biden campaign resulting in his impeachment? Let me guess that was just a democratic conspiracy to overthrow Trump or something ridiculous like that. It scares me that you people have an opinion in the way our society is run yet I still respect freedom of speech no matter how stupid that speech may be. On top of all this you still can’t explain your Hitler comment which shows how hysterical you are when it comes to politics. Quit letting Fox, Breitbart, and CNN spoon feed you misinformation and look at the primary sources yourself and determine your own opinion, one google search disputes literally everything you’ve said so far.
Calm down buddy you’ll get your welfare check too, personally I’m happy that my tax money is going to the battle for freedom and democracy vs fascism and repression. If you don’t like it maybe move to China, you’ll probably like it better there.
Ukraine is a dystopia right now. Zelensky refuses to even try to negotiate peace with Russia, he insists on fighting a war we are paying for that brings our country to the brink of a nuclear WWIII. He’s getting rich in the process. Educate yourself. Stop feeding the monster.
