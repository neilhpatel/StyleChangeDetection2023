Unless you know how old this Reddittor is or where they are located, you really don't have anything to go on. A romantic relationship doesn't have to be sexual in nature - a 17 year old can date a 13or 14 year old and as long as no sex or exchange of sexual explicit photos occur, there's nothing illegal. Dating someone is not illegal.
There is no set age of consent in the United States - it varies state by state. Some states have Romeo and Juliet laws which outline age differences when it comes to sexual relations - for example a 16 year old could have sex with a 14 year old even if the age of consent is 17.
Note that nowhere in the USA would a relationship like that likely be illegal unless there was actual, physical sex involved, or explicit photos/videos exchanged, and in many places in the USA, depending on the ages, actual, physical sex may not even be illegal based upon their location and the age of consent in that location.
