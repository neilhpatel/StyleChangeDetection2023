Deeds are public record. And actual surveys aren’t that expensive. At least compared to your dad assaulting or getting assaulted by said random dude over a spat.
It should be noted, though, that the GIS is not a legal document. It should be used only to locate the actual deed that proves ownership.
I work in local government and we have access to a GIS (geographical informational system) which shows each tax parcel of land and it's ownership. There is a public view which anyone can access, I'd suspect your county government has something similar.
Most counties in most states are going to this kind of a system. Sadly, it is not quite universal, yet. If the OP's county has such a system, it could help him tremendously.
Alternately, the quick and dirty would be to review your county land offices gis website to see general boundary lines and names of owners. It’s not going to give you black and white encroachment lines but if you have the dudes name you will be able to see if he actually owns any adjacent parcels or if he’s just being a weirdo.
