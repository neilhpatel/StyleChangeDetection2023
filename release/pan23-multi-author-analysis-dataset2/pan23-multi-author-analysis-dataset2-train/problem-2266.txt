You don't need an LLC to do this; in NY, you need a Certificate of Authority, and then provide the seller with an exemption certificate (or file with the state for a refund of sales tax paid.).
To complete that process, you'll need an EIN from the IRS. And once you have the EIN, a business bank account.
NAL, I own a business in NYC. You don't need an LLC for this (you may want one for other reasons of tax or liability). Forming an LLC in NY is expensive and complicated.
All you need to do is file the forms for establishing a business. When I did this, to my recollection it was about $150, I went down to city hall, filed a short form and got the certification immediately (temporary form, the permanent copy showed up in the mail a week or so later). This was about 10 years ago so fees and things may have changed.
Ebay should have a process for a business to submit sales tax exemption. If you are buying cards in the thousands of dollars then I would think it is very much worth it to not lose 8%+ of your margins to sales tax that you are not legally obligated to pay.
Bear in mind that this means that you will have to file a sales tax return with the state every quarter (or once a year if your amounts owed are low enough). This is not usually a negligible amount of extra work, but it may not be too bad if ebay is actually collecting and disbursing the sales tax from your sales on your behalf. I'm not sure how that works because I don't sell through ebay but you should look into it (and possibly talk to a CPA).
