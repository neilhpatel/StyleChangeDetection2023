If i could offer my 2 cents, learn to respect your right to say no to some kind or evil offers if you absolutely cant agree to it. Learn to turn away an offer and, in some cases, turn away from the party or person when you cant come to some kind of agreement that you know you want or donâ€™t want. Only identify what saying no means from the start and what, if anything, you might say yes or no to because it will help you to identify other possible paths to an agreement and can ultimately help you determine when to actually say no. And it will help you . In negotiations this is called a BATNA or a best alternative to a negotiated agreement. The best case in this example is to tell China to politely and diplomatically fuck right off and shut them down.
I have family who are expats from China and they left as Xi tightened his grip. This "extraterritorial policing" thing terrifies them.
It's complicated. Embassies explicitly do have to follow all laws of the receiving country. A Saudi embassy in Turkey has to follow Turkish laws, which is why Turkey's prosecutors built a case for that assassination.
