Not specifically. Dentists have a legal obligation to you as a patient to meet the standard of care, but the actual standard is not a matter of law so much as a matter of professional practice.
Whether the law actually requires X-rays or not, dentists are certainly entitled to their position they won't treat you without them.
And to their interpretation that delivering care that meets a minimum standard calls for X-rays - which would give sense and meaning to their position that they're legally required even if there is not statute proscribing "thou shalt perform X-rays.".
In any case, you don't have a right to a cleaning on your terms. Like any other business, it's up to your dentist what they're willing to offer.
That being said it's a completely different claim that it's "legally required" by either state or some other government body.
There are very few scenarios that are analogous to this situation and it seems strange on multiple fronts. I don't believe that the x-rays will cause cancer but I do believe there is a DNA damage factor and that there is no need for them for the services I'm requesting.
After calling more dental offices I found two that would clean teeth without an x-ray if you sign a waiver. I guess that answers it to a degree as they're going to do it seemingly without repercussions.
Their position that the law requires them to take an X-ray is one that theyâ€™re entitled to and one that is reasonably supported by fact.
