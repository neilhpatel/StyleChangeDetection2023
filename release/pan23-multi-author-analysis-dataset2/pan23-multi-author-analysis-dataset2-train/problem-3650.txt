And it doesn't sound like they're requiring that. The ESA accommodation is specific to a disability though, and if your original letter doesn't state that explicitly they can require one that does.
They can't require a specific diagnosis either, just that you specifically have a condition that rises to the level of a disability.
Depending on your therapist's credentials, they may not be qualified to diagnose disability on their own, and they could require documentation from another provider that is.
Is your therapist a doctor, or otherwise qualified to diagnose you with a mental illness, and treat that illness? And are you currently in ongoing treatment with that medial professional for that illness?
And I have to say: "therapist I have actually spoken to and diagnosed me with PTSD from military service" does not sound like you have an ongoing relationship with this doctor. Obvs this could just be poor phrasing on your part in this post, but if the letter does not clarify your doctor's qualifications, and this is how you described your relationship to this therapist to the leasing office, I can see why they would be skeptical that you didn't just buy an ESA letter.
The letter you've posted is word for word from one of the ESA form farm sites they specifically stated they were being cautious of.
