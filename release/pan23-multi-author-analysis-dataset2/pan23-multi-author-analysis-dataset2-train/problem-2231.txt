NAL, but worked in accounting for a large property management company. Is the landlord refusing move-in until the 18th, or are you unable to move in until the 18th for personal reasons? What does your lease state as your start date?
Earliest move in is at the least start on the 18th. I will be moving in that day. I spoke to another employee and they said they don’t prorate because the lease is for 12 months…..but they do not offer that type of lease and mine is strictly 11 months.
The only immediately reasonable explanation I can think of is if your second month of rent will be prorated, and the employee isn't understanding your question or explaining it properly? Landlords generally require the first month of rent up front at lease signing. The company I worked for "couldn't" prorate that month, but would prorate the second month of rent that was due from the tenants. IE: A tenant moves in on September 18th, pays 1 full month of rent up front to take the unit off the market, and only pays a prorated amount on October 1st.
Is this a rental for college students near a university? In addition to /u/HorseGirl666 's comment about the prepaid 1st month not being prorated for various reasons, it also isn't uncommon for near-campus housing leases to be formatted as "Total Rent for DateX through DateY is $Z, to be paid in 12 equal installments on the 1st of each month". In that case your rent isn't prorated because the check you're paying on the 1st of august is not specifically for the days in the month of august, it's just a convenient division of the total term's rent.
Prorating at the end of a lease is covered under some state laws, but that's not what this is. What do you mean "not allowed" to move in, why, and what was day did the lease start? You have a very good argument to not pay rent for an unavailable apartment.
