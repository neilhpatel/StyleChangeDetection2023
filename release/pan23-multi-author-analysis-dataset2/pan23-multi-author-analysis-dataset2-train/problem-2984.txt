It ignores the possibility that she's a poor debater who wouldn't have done well against Kari Lake's TV experience.
End of the days, Hobbs just let Lake run her mouth and more and more people voted to keep Lake away from any sort of power. Lake offered nothing but Trump talking points but in a female voice.
I love how they tried to trash Katie for not debating a proven lunatic. First of all, if debates mattered we would've seen reverse results for senate and governor in Florida. Second, Katie predicted it would be a shit show and was immediately proven right with Lake's antics at the town hall that got her removed. And finally, Lake insulted the McCain republicans which just won't fly down here.
I didn't follow the race closely since it's not my state, but everyone here seems really confident she would have won the debate. Why?
