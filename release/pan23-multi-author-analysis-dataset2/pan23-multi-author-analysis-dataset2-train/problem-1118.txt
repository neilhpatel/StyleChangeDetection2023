I'm assuming you never made a request for a medical accommodation (not all businesses are required to give it to you, depends on number of employees and if you're needs are reasonable for the business to accommodate)?
So basically, if you're fired your options are to file for unemployment, which you may or may not get, and look for a new job. If your illness makes it difficult to work you should talk to your doctor about a disability claim.
There's not really anything you can do to prevent being fired. Unless you have a contract stating otherwise you're at will, meaning they can fire you for pretty much any reason that isn't protected by law.
NAL but I'm pretty positive there's nothing you can do legally, but I would like to offer some advice because I also have bipolar and have basically been in this position before. Just try to chill out and get ready to talk to the owner next week. When this happened to me, I was called in for what I'm sure was planned to be my firing, but I explained my condition to them and they changed their minds, either out of sympathy or they themselves worrying this is some sort of scary legal territory because honestly the vibe I got was that they were afraid to fire me, not that they were being compassionate. Obviously I can't assure you it's going to go that well, but I think you should at least try it.
