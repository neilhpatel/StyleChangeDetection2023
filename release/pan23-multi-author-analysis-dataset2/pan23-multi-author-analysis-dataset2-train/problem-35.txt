I don't think its much of a paradox. The fact just is a lot of the tolerant groups are just bigoted against other groups then never choose to look inward and fixed flaws.

Red flags which can't be perverted from something benign so its easy to enforce/unbiased.

"The ban will apply to any form of commemoration or representation of persons, symbols, information linked to totalitarian or authoritarian regimes and ideologies.
The prohibitions will not apply to museums, archives, libraries when organising exhibitions, informing the public about totalitarian and authoritarian regimes and their consequences, and using such objects and information for the purposes of education, scholarship, professional art, and collecting.".
