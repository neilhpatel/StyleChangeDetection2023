Lolololol I genuinely appreciate the honestly. I'm just saying if we're legalizing something why are we still charging people for the use and possession of it. We can't sorta abolish it. It's either in or out and their offering a middle ground that only helps owners not Missourians or users or minorities which is who they said it was supposed to help most. Furthermore the cops don't bother anybody for smoking currently but this gives them fiscal incentive to engage with the gen pop for non violent petty crimes increasing the risk of another protest I.E. George floyd Mike Brown. Another interaction thT went wrong that absolutely didn't have to happen.
Current policy is actually better and we don't live in NY. But In NY you can smoke PUBLICLY and anywhere cigarette smoke is allowed so we can do the compare and contrast thjng all day I jist want to talk about the actual language of what's inside of A3. Yes thank you for pointing out their ruining the best thing we currently have in the home grow program. They've reduced the amount you can actually cultivate in your home grow in this amendment as well.
I was confused based on the picture but it seems only a small amount of folks will control the majority of operations.
