Kind of ridiculous that the GOP has sunk so low that he deserves a pat on the back for conceding but given all that's going on he does deserve a pat on the back for conceding.
Yes, it truly is, but although I expected Warnock to win tonight, I fully expected a GOP county or three to refuse to certify results, and Walker or his campaign to claim election fraud. So, all in all, it's good news that he did concede.
This is exactly why you saw election deniers concede. 1) many didn’t believe it and 2) they saw it doesn’t work. All it has done is make independents and non Trump conservatives slowly back away from election denying candidates. They also have seen that after 2 years it didn’t work.
HOWEVER, we must continue to fight the voting suppression tactics they use cause that has been working for them for so long.
Yes there are still many election fraud believing conservatives they are losing elections cause enough independents and a portion of conservatives are over it. Those margins matter and were enough to give Dems a surprisingly strong midterm performance. Obama said on the Daily Show that small uptakes in people turning out to vote Dem do matter. For example the turnout of young voters is still in the 20s% but just going from 18% up a few points does make a difference.
