yeah that's not really how these things work. It will take hundreds of hours to even define that. I'll actually have to help them define what's wrong, what's needs doing, etc.
I definitely need the clause amended. I just am not sure how exactly or what language to use to ask them to amend it.
You can put this into the contract: your assessment of the existing whatever can be billable time. Or they can go off and assess on their own, define the scope of the changes/additions needed, define clear milestones/goals, then just have you perform the work under contract. Or whatever. It's a negotiation until all parties are comfortable with it and decide to execute it.
I'm a software developer. This is exactly how things work the overwhelming majority of the time: no agreement is entered into and no work begins unless and until the scope of the project and deliverables are well-defined, and there are always clauses about what happens if the scope of the project changes -- and, frequently, even if it can be changed mid-contract.
It may not be exactly how your specific contract in your specific situation works, but it's incredibly common for the scope of the work and end result to be well-defined so that all parties are on the same page and it's somewhat easily determined whether or not the contract is being adhered to.
But without seeing your specific contract (and contract review is generally beyond the scope of this sub), then I have no idea what kind of contract you're entering into, what it involves, for what work, and what changes might be needed to bring it up to a level you're comfortable with.
