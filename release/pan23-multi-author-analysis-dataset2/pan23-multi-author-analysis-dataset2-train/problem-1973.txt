You were not licensed to do what you did. That's a bigger issue and risk than the $2,000 or $9,000. You should pay him back of course but you should speak to an attorney as well and never break the law like this again.
I mentioned I wasn’t licensed. I’ve been a profitable trader for some time. FTMO and all but I really just had a rough night that resulted in my trade. Was my first time using meta trader on the PC. Idk where I went wrong when plugging in the information. It was swing trade that is now in profit on my FTMO account but I got margined out on the other account. I trade friends and family money to help them make a little more monthly when covid happened. I was always able to cover a bad month with my FTMO. BUT this person has gotten impatient and wants it now or court.
Is like saying "I've been a profitable hit man" or "I've been a profitable drug dealer" if you mean you trade for others illegally.
Didn’t know I was breaking the law until this came up and I was reading around. I always traded for friends and family and they’ve been able to pay off some things with the gains.
