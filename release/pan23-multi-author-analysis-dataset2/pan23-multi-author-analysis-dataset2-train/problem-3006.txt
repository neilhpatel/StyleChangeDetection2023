This is probably legal, many studies have actually shown that standing desks are better for individuals. If you have a disability which makes standing for long times problematic then (assuming your company has 15 or more employees) you should ask for a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Then pay an attorney for a formal opinion, if anyone on the internet gives you a firm answer without having talked to you in person to get more information about your job and your personal circumstances they are a fool and you would be a fool to rely on it as a “solid” answer. The law, particularly with regards to workplace safety and accommodations is inherently fact based and requires analysis of specific facts. In most cases it would be unethical to provide a firm answer anonymously on the internet.
Candidly it did come across as rude and sarcastic, but the reality is that it doesn’t change the answer, you cannot get a firm answer, without a consult with an attorney. I can think of many situations where this would be legal, I can think of some where it would be an issue. A regular joke about law school is that when you graduate it can be said that three years ago, when asked a legal question, you could answer, in all honesty, “I don’t know.” Now you can say with great authority, “It depends.”.
If you don't like the advice you get here, you're free to go PAY for consultation. You're not doing yourself any favors being rude to people helping you for free.
I wasn't meaning to be rude. It's not a solid answer, which is what I'm after. I up voted and said thanks, too. I guess that wasn't taken into consideration? I wasn't being sarcastic.
