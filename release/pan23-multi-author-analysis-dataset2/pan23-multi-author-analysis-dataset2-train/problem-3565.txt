3. Employer sues you for damages related to whatever you create (supposing it is a competitive product/service).
Without knowing the specifics of your job and the specifics of what you are planning to do as your side hustle, and without seeing the document, it would be hard to give you more specific advice.
Most employers aren’t going to fight you having a side hustle if you’re in a lesser-powered role, and if the side hustle has NOTHING to do with your day job. But it all depends.
Thank you! This would not be competing with them, it'll be more of a consulting service and I am not in any high level position... Still an Individual Contributor and I do account management work for cloud service.

Your view of “competing” isn’t the decision point. It’s going to be THEIR viewpoint that matters. And if you’re in account management and have access to client data, they’ll fire you in an instant for fear of you taking their client database.
The folks who start things generally keep it completely on the down-low… 100% secret and then simply leave their jobs once the side hustle is income-generating. This is still in violation of the agreement, but most employers don’t check up on former employees.
