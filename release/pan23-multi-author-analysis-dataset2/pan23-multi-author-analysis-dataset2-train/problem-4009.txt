I'd like to ask about the history of compulsory smallpox vaccinations in the UK. The 1853 Vaccination act made it compulsory for children to recieve the vaccination within 3 months of their birth.
Was there much opposition to mandatory vaccines? Were there any anti-vax movements comparable to modern day ones?
To summarize a bit for you, though, there has been a long history of anti-vaccination campaigning, though in the 19th century it looked quite different from the modern MMR causes autism myth. In the 19th century, in response to the 1853 (and 1867) vaccination acts the resistance focused on concerns about political overreach: that making vaccination mandatory was the problem, not the practice itself. The National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Reporter, which appeared in 1874, for example, argued in its header that by passing these Acts "Parliament, instead of guarding the liberty of the subject, has invaded this liberty by rendering good health a crime, punishable by fine or imprisonment inflicted on dutiful parents.".
I'm curious about Y. Pestis outbreaks in the early modern and modern state (whatever you feel comfortable talking about). Nowadays, mentioning "The Plague ☠️" causes a really strong imaginative response, even though the y. Pestis bacteria is very easily treatable with modern medicine.
