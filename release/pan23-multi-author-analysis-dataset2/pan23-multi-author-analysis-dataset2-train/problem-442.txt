I presume there will be a worker's comp claim? Insurance is your friend here, they will provide legal support as well.
It is legal. If the police are investigating this as a crime, they can go to a judge and get a warrant. If they aren't, you can tell Walmart to retain the video in advance of anticipated litigation.
That she was part-time doesn't affect whether she is eligible for worker's comp, although Wal-Mart may argue that the cardiac arrest was caused by a pre-existing condition. Here is the OK guide to WC:
Worker's comp still applies to part time employees. The only question is whether the cardiac arrest was caused by work or not. If something at work caused her to be injured then worker's comp comes into play, if she had a non work related medical emergency that just happened to occur while at work then worker's comp does not come into play.
Not a lawyer - relevant experience in risk and compliance at major retailer - immediately file a report of the injury and file a workers comp claim as soon as possible. Retain all records of these reports reference numbers and encounters, who you spoke with and how to reach them again. Documentation of the injury and reporting of the injury to the company and its insurer are very important steps that may help you down the line.
I think you should consider contacting a local attorney. Call the local bar referral line and let them know what's going on. Again I am so sorry about your SIL.
