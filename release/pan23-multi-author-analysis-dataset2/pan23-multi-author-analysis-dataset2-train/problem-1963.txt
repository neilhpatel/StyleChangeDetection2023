Yes you can put in a camera in any room that there is no expectation of privacy. No cameras in bathrooms or tenant bedrooms, but your bedroom is fine.
I would also install a camera watching external entryways, on the off chance this isn't your tenant, and you had a burglar.
Yes, you can put cameras in your room and in all common areas, just not bedrooms or bathrooms where privacy is expected.
Personally, I would talk to the roommate today, explain what you found, and ask him if he knows what happened. It could be a simple explanation that he was drunk and went into the wrong room. Then get some locks installed.
You should use cameras that do not record audio. CT is a one party state for in person conversations (2 party for phone calls) but when you aren't present you have the consent of 0 parties to the conversation and the audio recording would be illegal.
Yes you can put cameras in your bedroom, it’s ridiculous in today’s society you would even have question your own privacy. Now if you start noticing things going missing, I’m not sure what state you are in but usually you give them an eviction warning, then an eviction notice of 30 days, and if they dispute it; lawyer up.
