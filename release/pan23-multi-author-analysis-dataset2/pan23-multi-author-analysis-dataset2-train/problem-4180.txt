"U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was at that match too, the night before he met with Qatari officials for policy talks. He watched as Tim Weah, the son of the president of Liberia, who was in the box with Mr. Blinken, scored the American team’s first goal of the tournament. This past Tuesday, at a summit with African leaders in Washinon, Mr. Blinken referred to that moment when he introduced the Liberian president, George Weah, himself a soccer legend.
“The best part of that was turning around and getting a quick look at your face as you watched your son score that goal, and I could see the extraordinary pride that was there and an entire stadium cheering him on,” Mr. Blinken said. “So I guess the apple just doesn’t fall too far from the tree in this case.”".
