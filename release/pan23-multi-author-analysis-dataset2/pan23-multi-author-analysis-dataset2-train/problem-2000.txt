Your brother needs to get mom under control. It's absolutely unreasonable and a crime for her to pierce a kid's ears when the kid doesn't belong to her. She's proven that she should not be allowed the child unsupervised.
Your mother has serious boundary issues. Your SIL's doctor had to get a restraining order against your mom because your mom wanted to know the child's gender? Then she pierces your niece's ears with her parents permission? If I was your SIL , I would demand supervised visitation for your brother and a restraining order to keep your mother away from your niece.
My brother had a lawyer but she couldn't represent him anymore so he's in the middle of retaining a different lawyer right now. I'll tell him to to talk to that lawyer once the paperwork is signed even though I'm sure he knows but just to be safe. For the other incident with my mom as I said she recognizes that she was wrong and I don't condone nor defend her there. I don't think she should have pierced my nieces ears. I'm just hoping for my brother's sake that he isn't denied custody time by the court.
