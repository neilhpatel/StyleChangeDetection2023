Except for the PD, who was presumably defending you, all those people have some form of immunity and suing them is pretty much impossible. Suing for legal malpractice is also extremely difficult. But feel free to spend as much time as you want looking for a lawyer willing to try. It will be much easier if you can pay a cash retainer rather than expecting a lawyer to take this on a contingent fee basis.
We can't really tell you anything without knowing what happened, except "you start by finding a lawyer.".
Okay, so this is why I am here. I shouldn't have been convicted. The Judge found me not guilty of conspiracy, withdrew that, and later found me guilty after my PD refused to question the only witness to that crime, the police officer involved. Had he asked the same questions he had when the case was initially dismissed for lack of probable cause, the outcome would have been not guilty. This is because the burden of proof requires objective evidence that more than one person planned to commit a felonious act. There exist none.
