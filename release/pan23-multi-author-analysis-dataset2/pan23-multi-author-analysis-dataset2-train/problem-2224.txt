But DO email them explaining the facts and saying you’re not interested in their service and please don’t trespass on your property again.
It’s likely the previous owner never told their company they were moving. I work in pest control, and this happens from time to time. You got free termite work, don’t pay it. If they try to bully you to pay it, remind them that they didn’t have the consent of the land owner to treat the property, and threaten to report them to whatever agency oversees pest control in your state. They could receive a heavy fine.
You don't have a contract with them. Therefore, you're not bound to pay the invoice. Don't pay, but also don't go dark and avoid it - communicate with them explaining why you aren't paying the invoice.
Edit: missed the part where they left a note telling you to sign over the contract. That’s a scam. Don’t pay, if you want a pest control company use a different one.
Former Pest control tech, NAL Contact them and ask who to send a bill to for removing the chemicals put on your property. Also ask if there are any medical bills from a reaction, who should be notified besides law enforcement. That company probably used the cheapest chemicals, if it wasn't just scented water/oil, that they could and put false or misleading names on the invoice. As others have said probably a scam or unethical sales tactic. Most states pest control is regulated by the Department of Agriculture. Also check if the company is licensed and bonded to work in your area.
