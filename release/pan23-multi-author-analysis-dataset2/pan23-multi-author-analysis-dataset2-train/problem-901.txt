I couldn't say, would need more context and is that in question or being challenged by him to your knowledge? I wouldn't necessarily jump to that. This wording doesn't necessarily tell me they're talking biological here.
Since you and ex weren't married and presumably didn't file your location's equivalent of a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity, your child and his father are legal strangers. The first step in getting child support is establishing that your ex is the child's father either through DNA testing or because of his actions. I'm guessing that the paperwork is indicating that your ex has never acted as if he were the child's father.
The court can't force him to have a personal relationship with his child but they can compel him to offer financial support.
Well, we aren’t married. I got pregnant in December of 2020 and my baby was born in September 2021. He’s always denied the baby but has spent time with him regardless. I’ve offered for us to get a paternity test multiple times but he never actually moved to do it. I’m the main caretaker of the baby and from September to December 2021, he’s only come around once or twice a week for a few hours. He hasn’t seen my baby since Christmas after saying something incredibly hurtful. I’ve asked him everyday since then if he wants to see the baby but he either never responds or says he’s working. I filed for child support in December but I’m still waiting on them to contact me.
