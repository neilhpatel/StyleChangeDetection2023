It's actually an interesting case because dominion wants free and fair elections because it is good for their business.
And fox are directly interfering in the "free and fairness" of elections, this case ultimately will prove that fox directly damaged an org integral to the US election system in order to subvert the results of said election.
One thing that has gotten real clear is they should have let the dominion lawyers conduct the house investigations into Jan6th coup and the q fucker. They are digging up shit from every corner imaginable.
Just another example of Trump destroying everything he touches if only the real damage to Fox is yet to come. That and you have to hope Trump does the same to the Republican Party. Heâ€™s already impacted their last two election cycles.
This ruling is basically their insurance against this exact thing in the future. And if it happens (with any of the networks) they will be asking for a heck of a lot more and point to this ruling to justify the sum.
