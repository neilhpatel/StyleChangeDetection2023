If this ends with you just taking Benadryl, then yes getting a lawyer is an overreaction. You need damages. You can complain to management and probably get a refund.
If you are that allergic carry an epi pen. If you take a few benedryl and feel fine enough to not go immediately to an emergency room and write this post? Most likely no damages.
There will ALWAYS be cross contamination. Restaurants, ESPECIALLY fast food, do not generally pay their employees enough for them to do what would need to be done to make a prep area allergy safe. In fast food, they are pumping out hundreds of orders a day, they DO NOT deep clean their prep area just for one person, or change gloves in between that they grabbed cheese with. You should understand that.
Also, get an epi pen. If you are that concerned, you should have one. The off brand are not as prohibitively expensive.
Does it suck having to avoid restaurants? Yes. But they are not obligated to cater to allergies, and in many cases, it is absolutely unreasonable if not impossible to ask of a restaurant to do so if you are avoiding a severe reaction because no matter how hard they try, unless they deep clean the whole prep area, swap out gloves, grab fresh ingredient trays, grab new burger wrappers, and more that I'm likely missing, it isn't ever going to really be CLOSE to being "allergy" clean.
If your allergies are serious, you should not be eating at restaurants at ALL unless they cater to your specific issues as a cornerstone of the business (i.e., a vegan restaurant would probably be okay, since they don't even have dairy in the place). Even then, you never know if an employee ate a pile of cheddar covered in butter for their lunch and didn't wash up well enough.
I'm sorry this happened, it does suck. But it really seems to me like your allergy can't be that severe or you're not taking it seriously if you're willing to eat out.
