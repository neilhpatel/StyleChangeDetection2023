Seriously. There's no proper way to call 911, especially if reporting on a traumatic scene. Some people might be borderline hysterical and unable to put together coherent sentences, never mind accurately describe the scene in front of them. Some people might go into shock and sound abnormally calm or detached. You would also need to know an individuals regular speech patterns, education, cultural background, and tons of other information if you were to even begin to judge whether or not they sound "normal" on a 911 call. But this guy literally claims that anyone who says "please," "hi," or "huh?" at any time is showing indicators of guilt.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
