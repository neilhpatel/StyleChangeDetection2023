Previous renter died, in the house, hepatitis, i was handed his keys, floor never even swept. My point is, at what point does stupid negligence become a crime? I got evicted for demanding things be addressed. He never got my money. He sure did mess with my damn life.
So you want to sue for something that never happened? You never got sick and have no way of knowing if it is even possible for you to have gotten sick.
I am, and i will find something, no ac all year, soon as i leave he installs ac? Text my phone says please just leave? Theres no vacancies and who hates on a dude giving you a free remod?
You are correct, i am, but thats part of a lawsuit, emotional distress. I have a wrongful eviction on my record, written harrassment, motive, destroyed my peace intentionally, peace alone is what im paying for. I lost my woman, and my boss, during covid, directly from this mans harassment. He stood in my living room and ordered no women allowed To a vet in a 3 bed house Ill go take the damn bar test myself This is easy money, and he will settle, hes 86 Easy, guilty, motive is inheritance by bookkeeper.
Not to my knowledge, but i lived in constant fear, replaced all counters with granite, replaced cabinets, drawers, scoured entire house, painted entire house, stopped when the jerk refused to replace ac, bit did the rest free of charge, it was the nastiest building ive ever seen, and i work on houses I demand better living conditions, but also how about some accountability for jerk landlords, i paid this man 60k already in rent Id call the mob if i could.
The man chased off my gf, went to my boss and recruiyed him to harass me, went to my neighbors inviting them to harass me, i lived covid 19 free of covid, under assault by landlord, no vacancies, no heat, no ac, no woman, no family, had to quit job, for a eviction on a house that equalls a shed.
