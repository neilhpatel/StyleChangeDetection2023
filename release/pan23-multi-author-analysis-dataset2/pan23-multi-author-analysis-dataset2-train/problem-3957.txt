For me the headline is auditory. The crickets where I live sort of play a monotonous atonal music with very little rhythm. I'm not a fan of the genre. I can't imaging wanting to eat ones that drop sick 4-on-the-floor house beats.
These are people who not too long ago ate each other to survive, and they act like getting nutrition from mashed up insects is a horrifying and debasing thing.
Plenty of cultures eat insects (good source of protein!), it isn't any weirder than eating snails in France or shrimp in general. Certainly it isn't shockingly inhumane, especially in a situation where they literally can only eat what they can farm or grow on a moving train.
Even in Korea they eat , so you can assume it wasn’t the director’s unfamiliarity with cultures eating bugs that caused them to put that in. That’s to say, just the concept of eating an insect wasn’t meant to be the horrific part.
But there’s a big difference between eating specific bugs that have been proven nutritious and being forced to eat only bugs that may or may not be actually nutritious. There’s almost certainly a reason that no culture eats a primarily bug diet and every culture that dies eat them has a pretty limited set of species that they eat. No culture just eats an assortment of random household bugs. Even in Mexico where they eat crickets it’s a specific type of wild cricket if I’m not mistaken, not house crickets.
My guess is that bugs can have some pretty nasty diseases if you don’t prepare them right. I’m reminded of that kid who died from a ratworm infection eating his brain after he ate a slug.
