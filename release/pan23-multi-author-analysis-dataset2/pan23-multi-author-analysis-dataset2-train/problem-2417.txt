Honestly, a lot of lawyers don't appreciate being texted. Our time is money and it takes time to answer texts with any meaningful context. If you want to communicate with your lawyer effectively, schedule an appointment with them.
Are you saying that you have scheduled several appointments, but during every one of those appointments, you did not get to speak to your lawyer?
Scheduling phone call appointments because of covid is much different than texting your lawyer expecting them to respond that way. Lawyers have systems on how to communicate with their clients. If they have an office phone number and a secretary there to answer that phone, they generally expect you to use that line and talk to him or her to schedule a time to talk or leave a message with them so they can put it in their system.
In any case, I happen to agree with u/Internet_Ghost \- i don't give my cell to all of my clients because, in the past, that privilege got abused. Now, if I give you my cell, we have a chat about how it's not an open line to chat wherever/whenever.
I'm confused about texting Canada....assuming that's a typo? it's hard to say because punctuation does not appear to be something you're using - guessing this was uploaded via mobile. You may get better responses if you edit so we can properly understand your inquiry.
