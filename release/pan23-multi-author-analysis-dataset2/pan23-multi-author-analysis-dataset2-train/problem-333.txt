Other than making legitimate complaints as they happen (such as noise. Suspicious activities, etc) to the police, nothing. Stay back from this, very far back. Depending on the levels you could become a target from a bunch of thugs and you won't come out ahead. They will damage property, threaten you, or worse. Let the police due their job but stand back and observe and report. Don't make contact with them.
OP I work for a City Govt and this is an on going issue almost everywhere. There are a lot of restrictions that make it hard for local PDs to bust drug houses. That being said we have seen State and Fed level agencies take out drug houses in one sweep. That being said they end up working under cover for months to get enough evidence to take out huge teams of dealers. We aren't kept in the loop and don't even know they are working until we get a heads up about a raid from them about an hour before it happens. So your local PD probably won't be able to tell you much even if they do know because of the sensitivity of the case.
