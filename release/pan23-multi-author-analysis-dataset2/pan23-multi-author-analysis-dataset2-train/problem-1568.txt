Other than the vaccine, has any treatment or medication against COVID ever made it into production?
There's been a new "promising new treatment" for COVID pretty much every week since it began, yet none of them ever seem to go anywhere.
To expand on what /u/Man_Bear_Beaver said - paxlovid is an absolute gamechanger and could (if actually used...) prevent around 60-80% of the hospitalizations, depending on the study.
The evidence is there, that's why it has also been approved by (at least, don't know about other countries) and to be used for treating covid.
As long as it's being taken as soon as the first symptoms appear/you test positive, it's going to improve chances by a lot.
Sadly, for some reason physicians seem to be massively lagging behind and don't prescribe it often enough to high-risk-patients.
I read in india they just give you 2 pills of those antivirals in the same box instead of paying for paxlovid.
The funny/ not funny thing is it costs a fortune per dose and the govt pays for it. But the paxlovid recipe is just 2 existing antivirals for hiv that have been around for years and are cheap generic drugs repackaged in a single pill and re patented.
With some drugs price gouging is absolutely ridiculous, no question - especially in the US. Though since I'm not from the US, I can't really comment on the specifics.
If somebody can link some comprehensive numbers, that would be awesome. On a quick search I couldn't even find the government-price for germany, any details are welcome.
Considering the insane cost of hospitalizations, I'd guess it's still quite a positive trade for the governments buying it.
