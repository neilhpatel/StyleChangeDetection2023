If the accident was deemed your fault then you do in fact owe that money to the insurance company of the person who’s vehicle you damaged. You are entitled to see a receipt for the estimate on that cost so that you know for certain that $10k is the amount of money needed for their repairs. I would do that if I were you.
What I wouldn’t do, is ignore the issue and hope it goes away. And don’t “take the issue to court” (as you stated in other comments) when you’ve already been deemed responsible for the accident. This will only be a waste of time, potentially cost you much more money, and will be a lot of additional stress to you and the individual who’s car you damaged. You drove without insurance (since it was your brother’s policy as you mentioned in another comment) and caused a wreck. Use this as a learning experience and take responsibility for your actions. I get it; you’re 19, you’re scared, and $10K is an amount of money you’ve probably never had to deal with. But you need to put aside any thoughts you have that put blame on someone else or clears you of any wrongdoing.
If you live in the same home as your brother and aren't named on the policy then you are likely excluded and should not have been driving. You and your brother are SOL. You can negotiate a settlement or they can sue you. If you negotiate a settlement that can include a payment plan. If you're sued and lose then you can expect to have your wages garnished.
Work out a payment plan with the insurance company. They will ask for proof of how much money you make and they will base your payment amounts off of that. It’s not the end of the world, but you need to take this seriously and not delay things unnecessarily.
