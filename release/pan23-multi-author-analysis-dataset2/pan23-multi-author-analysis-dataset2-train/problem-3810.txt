NAL, but dude, he referred you to the specialist to fix your problem and didn’t charge you It’s your stupid decision not to follow medical advice that put you in this position. A root canal should generally but not always be finished with a crown, but he referred you to the specialist to finish the root canal Then you could have gotten the crown. You don’t have a leg to stand on.
NAL. However, they can’t do a crown, if needed, until the root canal is completed. It couldn’t be completed until the metal piece was taken out. You neglected to follow up and finish the needed procedures with the proper doctor.
Malpractice has a statute of limitations for how long you have to pursue a case, generally 2 or 3 years, but longer or shorter in some states. You didn't provide your location, a listing for US states. Beyond that, nobody here can advise you on medical malpractice, it's best to seek a probably free consult. In the meantime, you might have some luck by posting to r/askdentists. They may at least be able to make some guesses as to why the crown wasn't placed.
