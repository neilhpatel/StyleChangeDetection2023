This assumes this is 100% your cat and not something that was bought during a relationship/ family situation where the name on the chip is one thing but others might have legit interest in the cat.
In some states, the person who finds your microchipped pet has no legal obligation to return it. If a client brings a found pet into my clinic, we have to have them sign a waver if they want us to scan the chip and contact the microchip company for previous owners. This is why it's still important to make sure pets are properly trained and retained indoors even if they're microchipped.
It is still important to microchip your pets! In many cases, the person who finds your pet just wants to get them to the right home.
Some small claims can issue an order for property (it’s called a writ of replevin). If that’s allowed in New Mexico, that’s an option. Otherwise you can hire a lawyer to make the claim in a court that can.
My friend (not the thief) was watching him for me for a while. The thief is the roommate and is claiming abandonment and that they got used to the cat. Does that hinder anything on my side?
