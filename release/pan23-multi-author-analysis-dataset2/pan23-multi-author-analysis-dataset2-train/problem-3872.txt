Bruh, "load shedding" has been going on since we emigrated from that dump back in 2009. It's been 14 years of constant shitshow.
Even the damn coal trains are being stolen and resold after inspection and replaced with lower quality coal, which undermines the grid continuously. This is a race to the bottom, Russia Speedrun style, without the forced ethnic honogeniety, unified internal Jackboot force, and national identity to paper over it and keep up the facade.
The problem our state owned energy distributor is super corrupt and doesn't do any maintenance etc- most of our coal power stations are not working due to continuous lack of maintenance and sabotage over the years. If even 60% of them were online we would have no problems.
You cannot sustain a nation on corruption and theft on that scale. The tipping point was crossed when people kept voting in Zuma and the ANC.
South Africa is a failed state, people just haven't seen it fully realised yet. In 20 years, I'd be surprised if the political entity known as South Africa could even exist. A dwindling tax base (which is constantly squeezed, promoting even more youth brain drain), fleeing foreign investment, alignment with Russia and China... It's a dead man walking.
