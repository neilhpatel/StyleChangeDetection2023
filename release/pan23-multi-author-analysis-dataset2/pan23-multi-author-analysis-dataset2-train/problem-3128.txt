We are the employer, we are worried if we mandate it, will we be opening ourselves to liability if we’re the reason they took the vaccine. We understand the vaccine side effects would not be our personal responsibility, but we have had members mention we may be opening up liability because we’re the reason they took the vaccine. Not responsible for the side effects or what not but responsible for them “having” the side effects because we mandated the employees to get the vaccine. I think it’s a legitimate question.
Even if it’s mandated? We are concerned with the mandate issue, it seems like we’re leaving ourselves open for future litigation if there is an adverse effect to our employees if we mandate them to take a shot they otherwise would not have taken. Just want to be very clear.
There isn't any, but speak to counsel to assuage your fears. But think about it logically. Of all the many, many, many things that employers require of employees, are employers ever liable if there is a freak injury/accident? No. Many employers have mandated many vaccines before, and there's not a single case of the employer being held liable.
