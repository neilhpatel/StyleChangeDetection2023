I am not sure who told you this but if someone says NO during the initiation of sex or STOP during sex, that’s withdrawing consent. If you continue to try to have sex with someone AFTER they have said NO, you’re a creepy person with little respect for boundaries. This discussion is not about someone saying no then 30 minutes later saying yes because they changed their mind. The situation being discussed is one where the person articulated that they did not want to have sex, they said no. The person continued until they gave in. That is absolutely not consensual sex. If you don’t understand to STOP when someone says stop or to quit pressuring someone when they say “NO” then I don’t know what to tell you.
also to clarify because I didn't state this in the post, we had just consented to oral sex prior but he tried to hold me down, gag me, and initiate penetrative sex before I pushed him away.
Actually if someone continues to try to have sex with you after you’ve said no, it’s rape. It doesn’t matter if eventually you give up fighting them off. This person is absolutely a rapist. However, due to mindsets like the comment you posted it’s true that it will be difficult to convict which is why so many rapists are not held accountable for their actions. Your best bet OP is to get a restraining order against him. There’s resources to help you through this.
