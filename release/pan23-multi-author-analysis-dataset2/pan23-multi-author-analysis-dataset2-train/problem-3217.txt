Ok thank you for clearing that up for me. I am the used to be employee because after that I quit so did the the other employee. We gathered all of our belongings out of his truck nothing that did not belong to us was taken. We walked almost 3 miles down a road to met up with a family member that actually happened to be at this festival we went to. Now the business owner has filled a lawsuit against us claiming we stole his truck wrecked it ransacked it and stole $20,000.00 of merchandise and othere things that was never even in the truck in the first place. But when we left the vehicle it was parked in the same location where we was told by security to park. And I was the one to park it and afterwards I gave the keys to the business owner and within id say an 2 hours later is when we quit and left. What would be some advice for when we have to go to court? Mind you im 40 years old and have never even had to go to court except for a minor fishing violation almost 15 years ago(sorry for long post).
Unless the boss has physically prevented the person from leaving, it's not kidnapping. Here I mean they're restraining the person or they've taken their wallet/ID/etc. to keep them from finding other transportation. The boss cannot force them to work, but they should not expect to be paid if they're there and not working.
