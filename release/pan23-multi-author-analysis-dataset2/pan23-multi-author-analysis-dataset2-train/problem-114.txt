She has to terminate your tenancy according to the law in Texas. For a month to month tenant that is one month’s notice.
If she agreed to provide vacant possession to the buyer and that causes the sale to fall through that’s on her for not understanding her responsibilities as a landlord.
What does the original lease say about ending the tenancy? Unless there's some language in it that allows the landlord to end the month-to-month in a different time frame (which is allowed in Texas, see 91.001.e.1), defaults required notice to 1 month.
If Monday (February 22nd) is the day you were served notice, your lease says nothing about allowing a shortened notice requirement, and you are not delinquent on the rent or in violation of the lease in some other way, the soonest your landlord can require you to be out would be the 22nd of March.
“Tenant will vacate the Property upon termination of the Agreement, unless: (i) Landlord and Tenant have extended this Agreement in writing or signed a new agreement; (ii) mandated by local rent control law; or (iii) Landlord accepts Rent from Tenant (other than past due Rent), in which case a month-to-month tenancy will be created which either party may terminate by Tenant giving Landlord written notice of at least 30 days prior to the desired termination date, or by Landlord giving Tenant written notice as provided by law.”.
