What does your lease say about failure to deliver? You're free to negotiate anything, but if you're given suitable accommodations rent would be owed.
If the accommodations aren't suitable to you and your lease doesn't give them the time you might be able to cancel your lease.
However, it says abatement does not include cleaning or repairs that don’t prevent me from occupying the premises. They have told me the delay is because they need to check for repairs and clean, but that I am NOT allowed to move in before that. So I am assuming the option of abatement still stands.
Thank you for pointing this out. I went and re-read the lease. It says I am entitled to a substitute that is “comparable to the rent due by resident”. If this is not met, I am entitled to abatement (rent being lowered). I would say their current solution is not a comparable substitute because it is advertised for hundreds less a month by the same exact office.
My best advice would be to ask if you can get a partial credit added to your account for next months rent. They are a business and they have to be professional and will most likely comply. They won't refund you or anything but part of what you paid would carry over to the next month. That's how I did it when something similar happened to me.
It seems like it'd depend on what they're amenable to. If there's no habitability repairs needed they might just say you can move in if you push. There's no general requirement for cosmetic damages/cleaning to be done before move in.
