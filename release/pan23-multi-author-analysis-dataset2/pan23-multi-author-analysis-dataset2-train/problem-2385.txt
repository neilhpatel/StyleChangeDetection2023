Yeah. But saying Mexico makes it sound like he bombed the mainland or something populated. At least that's how it comes across to me. I'd rather specify that it was an island.
Gotta be careful with assuming cult members are all morons. It's a lot of emotional manipulation when it comes to cults. We're all potentially susceptible unless you're told about the warning signs. Not to say there aren't stupid people in there too, but you can be a genius and still fall into a cult.
I take umbridge with this statement - we know from psychology research that intelligence is not enough to prevent someone from falling for cult tactics / outlandish conspiracy theories.
If it was as simple as "stupid people gonna stoop", that would be much easier to digest. But it's actually a very nuanced and complex social interaction that ensnares people looking for identity and a sense of community.
So I would amend your statement to say, instead: "They're using the same strategy; exploiting the emotionally vulnerable.".
Scientologists just go for the full wasp build. They're horrible to have around, nobody likes them, they don't make any honey, and they're so fucking annoying to fight that in most cases people just ignore them in the hope they move on.
Just writing off the people you don't agree with as morons is a very dangerous line of thinking, and will just reinforce the divide between both groups.
They are annoying and considered social pests when they nest around buildings but they are not destructive pests that harm crops and livestock. They do a great job of killing destructive pests.
