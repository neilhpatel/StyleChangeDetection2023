Either way, Hutchinson's testimony ended up being a doozy, on top of her other shocking and revealing testimony, Hutchinson described the event in question to the January 6th committee, it's no wonder she was basically ordered to keep quiet.
Cassidy Hutchinson... said she initially lied to the panel in a deposition about whether she'd heard that President Donald Trump lunged at a Secret Service agent in the presidential SUV on the day of the riot.
At one point, she agreed to be represented by Stefan Passantino, a former Trump White House ethics lawyer. She told the panel the understanding was that if she listened to him, she would be “taken care of.”.
