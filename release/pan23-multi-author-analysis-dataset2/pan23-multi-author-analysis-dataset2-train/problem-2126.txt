That's a great point. I actually found an article from the 80s where Mission Beach homeowners were trying to get volleyball banned so it looks like this will just always be a battle between the wealthy homeowners and people trying to enjoy the beach.
Last I checked, all California beaches are public property and it’s illegal for people to claim any portion of it for themselves. It doesn’t matter if they bought beachfront property, the physical beach is not theirs. They should’ve known this before they purchased their house. This has been a MAJOR issue up north in Orange County with rich coastal residents adding gates to prevent people from accessing public beaches. Residents in Dana Point were recently fined for this behavior and warned not to do it again. As for your situation with the beach chairs, I’d move any obstacles in your way as if they were obstacles in your way on a public sidewalk. If the owner left it there on public property, then you’re safe to assume it has no owner anymore.
