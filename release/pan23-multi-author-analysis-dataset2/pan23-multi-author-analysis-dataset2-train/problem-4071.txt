right, but they'd still only be options in a private company that likely aren't worth much. You'd have to find a private buyer to by options for a company you no longer work for, which I'm guessing would be pretty difficult. You'd only be able to cash them out if the company eventually went public, or was fully acquired by someone.
The fact that "T" in Transaction is capitalized strongly implies that it is intended to have a meaning defined within the agreements and not necessarily the generic meaning of 'transaction'.
Take a look at the "Plan" and the "US Sub Plan" in addition to the contract to see if Transaction is defined in any of them (or any other agreements that may be incorporated by reference).
I looked at mine and rather than transaction it uses "Change in Control". Which 51% ownership change would justify change in control IMO.
but I think there is another factor. Even IF the transaction caused your options to accelerate vesting and you got them today, so what. Even if you had all of the options today, you still have to sell them to someone to make money off of them. The new round of investing is buying 51% of the company, but they aren't buying all of it.
