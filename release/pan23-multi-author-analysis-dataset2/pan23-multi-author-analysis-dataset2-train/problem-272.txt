You get a survey to beyond a doubt confirm the fence was on your property. Then you get an estimate for what it would cost to rebuild the torndown section. You ask the neighbor to cover the cost of the rebuild. If you refuse, you sue them in small claims court.
On the survey or the property drawing? These things can make a difference its why people have told you to hirer a surveyor and confirm since developers can get lazy with actually laying out fences correctly, this is a beat to death topic on this sub if you search it. In Texas your city matters as this is likely is subject to your local code if you're bfe enough to be without a local code the fence is yours by default but if the neighbor has ever maintained it or had any agreement with any previous owner of the home and it actually is right on the property line Texas case law says its a shared fence.
Thats an estimate a surveyor will actually put stakes in the ground using whatever method rhe county used to define your parcel and without that you don't really have any ground in a property line dispute. You should also look into whatever the closest level enforcement is to you so HOA city county one of those and read the local law on fence disputes they'll likely have a link right to it somewhere on the code page as it's one of the most common issues for them.
If you do a survey and the fence was on your property and they tore it down they will be responsible for paying the cost to replace it. Having that information will allow this sub and a lawyer (if it gets to that point) to provide you information.
