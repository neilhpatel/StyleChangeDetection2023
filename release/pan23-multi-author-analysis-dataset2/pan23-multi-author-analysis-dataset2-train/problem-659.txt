I just had a thought. They are supposed to answer to us and for us. Ask questions from us and pass bills we want to pass. We are so divided and coupled with interstate mass exodus. I would suppose that our representatives will have to chang their minds on a lot of things. The people's voice flip flops too. This isn't necessarily directed towards Graham defense... actually not at all but as the people change should not our representatives.
John McCain likened him to a lying traitor when he called him out during Graham's testimony to a congressional panel in regards to his dealings with Russia.
Also they should not be allowed to speak on the news, where as they would be required to give factual and appropriate commentary, in more frequent, officia, press conferences. As apposed to the talking head opinion trash. Lobbyists should kill themselves for dishonor.
Why are they ganged up running their own objectives. We need to get rid of politcal parties which have essentially become coup conspirators every 4 years.
It can be said about most politicians, ( self-preservation is their greatest motivator) however, the republican party has become a bucket of crawling maggot-filled steaming rot, speaking conservatively.
