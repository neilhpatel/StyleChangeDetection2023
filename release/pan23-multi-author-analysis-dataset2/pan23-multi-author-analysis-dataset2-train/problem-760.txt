I can't cause of her privacy fence. If I was to put one up she would say she can't access her property cuz it's too close to her fence.
In Indiana you have to get permission by your neighbor to put up a privacy fence if you put it on the line. So she didn't have to do that she put it 2 feet on her side. I would have to do the same. And that leaves me no room to put one up cause of water meter. And to close to my garage to put one up.
No I would have to put it up 2 feet on my side of property line. In order not to have her permission to put one up. That leaves me no room to put one up.
I am not sure I follow. 2 ft should be more than enough of space for her to access anything. Is your property the only access to her house? Unless there's right of way, it's not your duty to make it easy for her to access her fence...
I believe in Indiana if you put up a privacy fence between you and your neighbor and you put it on your side not the property line you forfeit the other side of that land to your neighbor that's what I'm trying to get the answer to.
