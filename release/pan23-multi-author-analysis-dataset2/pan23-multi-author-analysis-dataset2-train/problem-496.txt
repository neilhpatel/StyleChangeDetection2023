2. as-is sale will protect you in court. if anything, it sounds like the Cousin did due diligence, IE inspection, and either there wasn't a problem then, or he didn't spot it. either way, "as-is" means not your problem.
That is correct. A "summons and complaint" for a small claims case must be . The court generally provides that service (for a fee) in Michigan.
In Michigan, the is obligated to provide the vehicle, the Certificate of Title with the appropriate "release of interest" signatures, and a truthful odometer disclosure. Nothing else.
In your title, you say that the buyer has filed in small claims. If he's actually filed, your sister should have received official papers from the court. If she hasn't, it might be a good idea to check with the court to see if a suit has actually been filed. It's true that facebook messages aren't legal service, but it would still be good to show up if an actual court date has been set, because he could lie about proper service, and it would be a pain to get the default judgement set aside. Besides, it would be fun to see the judge's face when she tells him that she was "served" by facebook.
Anyway, all she has to do is tell the judge what happened, and the case will be dismissed. Unless the guy can come up with some kind of written warranty, a used car sale in Michigan is "as is" and any problems belong to the buyer.
Also, if they have any copies of the ad they posted for it (like a screenshot of it) saying that it is sold in "as is condition", that's really all they need. The truck wasn't new and the buyer had 3 weeks to do who knows what with it and wants to hold them responsible? Nah.
