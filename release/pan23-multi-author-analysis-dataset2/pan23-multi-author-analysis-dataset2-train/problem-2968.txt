If you give a Ukrainian some intelligence and small arms, they’ll ask for HIMARS. If you give them HIMARS, they’ll ask for tanks. If you give them tanks, they’ll ask for planes. Moral of the story… Keep giving so that they can retain their independence and regain their territories.
Let's just lease them an aircraft carrier. Temporarily suspend everyone's Enlistment and commission. And have them be volunteers for Ukraine. Look at that loophole it's awesome.
That ain't no loophole. That's legal bullshitting for putting an American aircraft carrier in war against Russia. If it's a full strike force, it could dominate, not just Ukraine and the Russian border but pretty much all of Eastern Europe on its own.
Ukraine has been spending the fall and winter after Kherson and Kharkiv repairing everything its captured from Russia and is getting all its troops that trained with NATO countries and NATO equipment back. Russia's 2nd mobilization should also be finished and ready to go by that time. Its going to be a very bloody spring.
Also, how much would you charge per week of war? $1B? $3B for a full month? Double that for all logistics support. Add another 75% of that for the entire strike force, including subs. Nuclear SLBM with turn key nuclear strike is a cool $500B deposit for each missile (95% of that back at end of conflict), 5X that if you actually fire it wit full payment in escrow.
