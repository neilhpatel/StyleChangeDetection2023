There's a chance this is an unlawful termination, but there's also a chance you don't have the full story.
Michigan is an at-will state, so employees can be fired for any reason besides a protected class. Disability is a protected class, but that doesn't necessarily mean that your brother was filed for his disability.
It seems highly dubious that he would be fired with no warning over a wrist brace that he had been told he did not need a doctor's note for. If he truly was fired for that reason then he can speak with an employment attorney to see if he has a case. My initial reaction though is that your brother was fired for a different reason (or didn't give you all the details) and is telling you it was over the wrist brace.
Sadly, my dad also works for this company and also was chastised for wearing his brace and the reason they gave him was that they couldn't be responsible if the condition was worsened by his job and in not so many words - that they didn't want to pay out for workers comp.
