The fact that a payable on death account doesn't go through the estate doesn't really change anything. There are some odd things about this situation that OP has mentioned. This sounds almost like it is a trust with the mother as trustee. I don't know what she signed, but the various things the OP has said about the situation align with that: no access until 50, too young when over 18, needing the mothers (trustees) signature to access anything. The loan to the mother might be a breach of duty, but everything else might be proper.
Call a lawyer. NOW. Find your state bar association phone number via Google and call them to get referrals for a few local Estate attorneys. Talk to them and explain what is going on find one you feel comfortable with. If they cannot help you they will/should refer you to someone who can help. Do not try to "work this out" with your mom, she is stealing your future.
Because you've been betrayed and robbed. Talk to a lawyer. There may be future payments to you at age 21, 25, 30, who knows. Or maybe not.
