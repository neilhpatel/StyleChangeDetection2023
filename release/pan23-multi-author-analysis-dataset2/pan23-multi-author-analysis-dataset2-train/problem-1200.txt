When a minor is involved and a parent starts dating while they are separated it is considered adultery. When a child is effected in a negative way, he will be found at fault. I have protected my son from this. And I feel very happy that I took the necessary steps to stop it.
What legal action do you think should be “put against him”? It’s unclear. Was your son adopted by his step-father? Have you discussed your concerns with your attorney who would be more familiar with your case?
Yes, I have discussed with my Attorney and he was very concerned about my son. Since my soon to be husband was sanctioned legally to not discuss our divorce proceedings with her, the bs stopped. No he did not adopt my son.
I do have a divorce Attorney. And yes. I did take legal action. He has been sanctioned from speaking to my sons best friends mother about any matters regarding our divorce. Yes, we are adults. No it was not okay that he was sharing information with her resulting in my son having anxiety. My husband had since asked to work it out between us. We tried but again we are separated. This time without involving this woman. Thank god.
