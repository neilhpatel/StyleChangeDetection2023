You can't comply with "her" demands, because money only rents silence. There's nothing to stop her from demanding more money once you make your first payment, and these scammers have been known to do that exactly. Presumably you met this scammer through FB and they indeed have access to your friends list. They've likely shown you proof of this fact. If you didn't actually meet them through FB or a social media account associated with your real name, and they haven't shown you evidence that they have already identified your friends and family, there's some chance they haven't done so yet. You should very scrub your accounts. I mean, you should do that anyway, but it's even more important if they don't actually have what they need to make good on their threats yet. Other than that, these scammers may or may not actually share your dick with your friends. It's hit or miss. It's important that you understand that everybody has sexy-time, and nobody cares about your dick. What would you do upon receiving explicit photos of some dude you knew in 4th grade? Delete the photo and move on, right? That's what everyone else will do.
Step 3) stop having adult exchanges with strangers on the internet. Watch pornhub or get a gf that you know in real life.
