That's not... proof, actually. While I don't like to say "it's impossible", the fact that she was in the laundry room and you think she gave you a dirty look does not, in fact, prove that she was the one who damaged your hoodie. As a matter of fact, you can't prove that you didn't touch the hoodie after accidentally touching bleach (perhaps on a counter), perhaps when you first tossed them in the washer or dryer.
You wouldn't get a brand new one at MSRP, you'd get a used hoodie because that's what you had before. So you'd need to get on eBay or threadUP or other used-clothing sites and find a pre-owned version of your hoodie and see how much it is going for.
I have only found one listing for it on eBay but they didn’t have it in my size or one I could reasonably fit in, none on poshmark, there are not men’s clothes listed on thredup, do you know other men’s clothing sites?
Right now I’m more interested in replacing the hoodie, a used one isn’t that big of a deal if it’s in perfect condition, which mine was.
You don't know for sure it was her - you just think it was. If you had any proof, you could theoretically sue her in small claims for the value of a used hoodie.
