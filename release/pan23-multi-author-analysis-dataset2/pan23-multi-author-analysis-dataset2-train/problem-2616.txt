Yes I think it would be the latter. Every time I asked if the persistent pain was normal, they just said “some people just take longer to heal—take more ibuprofen,” but by the time the endodontist saw me, he said my tooth was in awful shape and there was no question it needed the root canal. It seems crazy to me that the dentist could just say “it’s fine, it’s fine” repeatedly.
Is the "negligence" the dentist somehow causing you to need the root canal? Or is it the dentist allowing some period of time to elapse before the referral the endodontist?
Generally speaking your remedy for a provider who doesn't understand or act on the seriousness of your concern is to get a second opinion.
I would have gotten seen by the endodontist sooner to see what they thought, but my dentist’s receptionist neglected to send the records until both the endodontist’s office and I called twice. If I had gone to another regular dentist, I would have run into the same problem or had to shell out for more x-Rays.
