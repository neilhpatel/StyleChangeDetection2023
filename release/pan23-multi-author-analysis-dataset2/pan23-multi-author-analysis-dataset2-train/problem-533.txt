Unless she was under 18 when it was filmed there is no discussion of child porn to be had here because there is no child involved. Two adults can have sex (real or imagined), on camera if they want, while pretending to be any age they like. And adult role playing as a minor doesn't make it child porn.
Maybe not on purpose but on the series Dark, they're are at least 1 or 2 scenes where teenagers are filmed participating in an erotic scene. Do you think that is okay?
I thought it was? So then the crime is child nudity? But even if the actors were legal adults it is still a scene depicting fictional teenagers nude which is disturbing and should if it's not be illegal.
That show really needs to be pulled from Netflix and the producers of the show should be sued or arrested. We're about grown adults in a room writing scenes where a teenage girl exposes her body. Not trying to get really specific. I also know adults who watch this show and that thought is just cringey.
That's absurd. If the actor is of legal age who cares what age the fictional character is? Laws and taste are entirely different.
