There's next to no chance of a parent losing custody solely because of their personal beliefs about trans identities. Family law is very hands-off on lifestyle and personal preference issues, even where those issues have material consequences for children raised with those families. This isn't just about trans rights, although that's one of the hotspots for it: you also can't take someone's kids away because they subscribe to Quiverful beliefs, or because they're a moon-landings conspiracy theorist, or because they're sovereign citizens, either, even though these beliefs are closely tied to real, material harm.
You'd have to show actual signs of abuse, not some chance that it may happen because their beliefs don't align with each other. You're not guaranteed a parent that fully understands and accepts you. Parents are only really required to give the child basic necessities and not doing anything physically abusive and overtly mentally abusive.
If your relative is actually being abused or neglected, get CPS involved and let them know you're willing to house your niece or nephew if need be.
Generally speaking, parents are presumed to be fit to raise their children. You have to overcome that presumption in order to take a child from a parent and that's a much higher bar than say taking a child from one parent to another parent. It's even harder to do if both parents are a couple and raise the child together.
