They know the video exists. It’s doubtful they can get an order to delete. They can agree to not sue you in exchange.
Ok I’m just not gonna share the video then. And hopefully the company won’t use facial recognition to find and fire me…. And I’ll talk to a lawyer too.
What about a solid black Censor bar! If that’s not enough I don’t mind keeping it down. I have a swinger friend who wants to see it but I’m concerned about wether sharing it with a friend is considered distributing…. Or if it’s ok to do that with a black censor bar over the logo…… especially if I lie low for a while I should be fine… also what are the chances my workplace will use facial recognition to figure out who is in the video….. I really want to keep my job.
As for a lawyer, there won't be much they can do for you. Posting an explicit video containing the company logo is going to be a legitimate firing offense pretty much everywhere.
I'm guessing if they've seen the logo, they know it's you (unless this is a big company i.e. the vet hospital in a certain large pet store chain). If they don't yet, I'd wager it'll creep its way back to you at some point.
