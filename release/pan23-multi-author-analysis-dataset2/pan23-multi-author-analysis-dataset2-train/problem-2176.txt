Secondly, more details are needed about the contract. What does it entail? What is the wording? What type of phone is it, and is there a preexisting contract with a company or is it pay-as-you-go sim and handset?
- A valid oral or written contract exists. To be valid, a contract must contain an offer, acceptance of that offer, and consideration. Consideration means that each party offers something of value as part of the contract terms.
Breach of contract is a separate matter. There are two criteria for that that you may wish to look into for yourself.
The key matter here is the last one. Damage occurred to the plaintiff. Would your parents suffer financially specifically from the phone contract and the health insurance if you stopped paying $300 dollars a month?
- Material misrepresentation of fact, where a person is convinced to sign a contract based on misleading or untrue information. This means that something of importance was intentionally concealed, misrepresented, or withheld, thus voiding the contract. In this case, how much money your phone and health insurance are worth.
Truthfully I think in all likelihood you’re probably legally safe from parental retaliation. I am not a lawyer and if your parents try to sue you should of course get professional representation.
- Cases in which a contract was signed under duress, such as blackmail or threat, or where significant pressure or force was applied in order to obtain a signature. For example being held in the building until the contract was signed as you say you were.
You can give them notice you are ending the contract. You legally probably have to give 30 days notice.
On a personal level - move out soon and seriously consider cutting them off from contact. These people do not sound nice and you’re better off without them.
Hahaha Sorry about this I have no clue how Reddit works. Thank you so much. I doubt my parents will be at a disadvantage if I don’t give them the money because my father is loaded. I’m definitely going to have to look into how much they’re actually paying. They already apply late fees, so I wouldn’t put it past them to make a big deal about the bills. You have no idea how much I appreciate your time and your response. Thank you.
