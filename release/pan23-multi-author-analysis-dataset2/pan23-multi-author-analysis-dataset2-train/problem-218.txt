Well, what you have is not a single source, but a compendium of sources taken from the archive of Milan. I’m looking at a copy now, and they’re all documents that reference England in some way. If you were going to talk about the entirety of the collection, you’d need to talk about English historiography at the time. Otherwise, you need to probably just pick one document and focus on that.
I'm currently focusing more on Margaret of Anjou in a somewhat imagological sense (perception of her and rumors about her as is presented by the Milanese ambassadors). However, I think John Hawkwood could be an interesting topic for a later work, it's a good suggestion.
Although I don't know Italian per se, I've studied Latin and know some Spanish, so it'll be alright, I think, especially with modern translation technology. And even if I didn't, the link to the original archives would have helped tremendously in any case. Thank you so much for everything, I really appreciate it Have a wonderful day.
No problem. I think you could do a very "meta" piece on the collection as a whole, but I'm not sure that you could do all of that in a source evaluation. I think you're better off just taking a single source. The first source is about John Hawkwood, about whom there is a great modern biography by William Caffero (sp?): You could break down all the parties and talk about what's going on here.
