Depends, I guess. Syrians and Iranians most likely wouldn't because Russia is too close to the respective regime. For others it's a question of language proficiency. There are about 8 million Central Asian migrants in Russia for example.
"Many of the migrants set sail in small boats and are rescued by charity vessels during their journey.".
They don't have it either. Usually they collect money from the entire village. Once they have a job in Europe, they are then expected to send remittances back. It's an investment.
