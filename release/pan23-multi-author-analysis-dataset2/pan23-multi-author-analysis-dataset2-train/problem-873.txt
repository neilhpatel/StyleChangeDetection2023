There's nothing wrong with their asking. And nothing wrong with their mandate if that's where this is going.
There's nothing stopping them from asking for a copy of your vaccination card. Or requiring that you be vaccinated and demonstrating that to continue employment.
Right, but my employer is NOT mandating anything. The submission of the vax card is voluntary. I asked if they were mandating now & I received no answer. Doesn't seem unreasonable for them to answer my question. If there's no mandate & it's voluntary, & I already reassured them I've been vaccinated, I dont see what basis they have to keep asking me for it.
Your employer has some specific obligations to public health authorities. You’re a barrier to their compliance and they’re figuring out what they want to do with that.
This is one of several sort of odd lines you’ve drawn seemingly to pick a fight for no obvious reason.
It's possible you're making your fellow employees uncomfortable. Your continued precautions send the message that you have not had the vaccine.
Nah - we've all had to face many scenarios this year during Covid about whether or not we comply with practices with our employers we felt were unsafe or questionable all out of fear of losing our jobs. This is is just another example. But I didn't really post this to collect an opinion - your response really just tells me exactly the answer I suspected all along. And that is, "maybe, maybe not." But more info/discussions need to be had & I dont think that is outrageous. I, as the employee have responsibilities too, but this is not one of them.
Your employer already has your birthdate, social security number, address etc. What privacy are you trying to protect? Your lot number? Which vaccine you got? It seems to me that once you verbally informed them you had the vaccine, the card contains very little additional information.
