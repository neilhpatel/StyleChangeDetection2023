For a few reasons, but most simply because more states voted. In the 1789 election New York did not send electors because they couldn't decide how to appoint them (they debated common vote vs legislative vote/appointment amd failed to decide - most states in early America allowed the legislature to vote for president, not the people directly) before the deadline to do so. Rhode Island and North Carolina had not ratified the Constitution so they were likewise unable to participate. In 1789:
Total = 69 voters, times two votes for each delegate. Waahinon recieved 69 votes, Adams recieved 34, the rest recieved 35, cumulatively.
Results: Washinon again cleared house with 132 votes (of a possible max of 132 votes). Adams again solidly secured second with 77 votes. George Clinton (not the phunk master, though) scored 50 votes, and my boy Jefferson pulled the 4 from Kentucky despite his desire not to be involved at all. The final lone vote went to Aaron Burr.
Was it growth, or the fact that the first presidential election took place before the first census? The allocation of House seats/electoral votes was based on Article 1 Section 2 in 1788-89, but based on the census by 1792.
The House progressed from 59 seats in the First Congress (1788) to 67 in the Second (1790) to 105 in the Third (1792), all from growth, which is what accounts for the other votes (however the math isn't that simple as some votes are "double counted" in this methodology - for instance the addition of new states is included in the above congressional seats in addition to growth of existing states in representation).
In other words while the original ('88) may not have been properly apportioned by total population, a growth in the calculation resulted in more reps by '92 (and actually an increase in amount of citizens represented, too, from 30k/ea to 33k/ea). The population definitely didn't suddenly double from '87 to '92.
