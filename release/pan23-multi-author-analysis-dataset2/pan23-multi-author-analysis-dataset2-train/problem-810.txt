He inherited a perfectly viable investigation that he killed for no legitimate reason. I have no confidence that he won't just extract another Trump payoff to kill this one as well.
Maybe they have something on the guy and he is referring it to another official to claim 'it is out of my control'. He may still backpedal if he gets pressure but, maybe, Trump and his cronies are too busy with other investigations and don't have the money.
This guy revealed his hand when he dropped the investigation last year. I have no idea what his angle is here, but its a pretty safe bet this is just for show.
