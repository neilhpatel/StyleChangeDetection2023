Wills don't necessarily address all of a decedent's estate, though any one that's even slightly well written should deal with the residue/remainder. Anything that isn't covered does default to intestate succession.
Your grandmother may be owed less than half, pending what's actually addressed in the will and what falls under intestate succession.
Intestate succession in TN says the spouse can either split the estate equally with the deceased's children or the spouse can choose to have a third, whichever is more.
Since your grandfather presumably had at least 3 kids (2 + whoever your parent is), your grandmother is looking at 1/3 of whatever's covered by intestate succession.
My grandfather has two children from his first marriage, and no children with my grandmother. My mother is his stepdaughter from my grandmother’s first marriage, so technically he’s my stepgrandfather.
Grandma can force an elective share of the estate. That means regardless of what the will says, she is entitled to a percentage of the entire estate. The amount of her share depends on how long they were married, but ranges between 10 and 40 percent. If the value of the house compared to the total value of the estate falls in her elected share percent, she can try to work it out with the executor that she will take the house as her elective share.
No one else is mentioning this, but I believe that the surviving spouse is entitled to a life estate in homestead property (i.e., grandmother can keep living in the house, or rent it to others, until she dies). I don't believe that the homestead allowance is in any way dependent upon whether grandmother takes an elective share of the estate or chooses to inherit according to the will, nor does it matter what the will says (or doesn't say) about the homestead property.
