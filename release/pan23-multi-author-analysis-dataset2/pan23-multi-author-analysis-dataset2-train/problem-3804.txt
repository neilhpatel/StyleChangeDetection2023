When you have a short-term crisis, this can be the better option for the long run. If local growers can't compete, they won't be able to normalize prices down to a point where domestic production solves the shortage, and you'll lose that farming sector entirely. Then you'll forever be at the mercy of international markets for food surety, which is typically bad (as we've seen with grain in MENA recently due to the Ukraine conflict).
The Philippine president assigned himself as the agriculture secretary of the country. After that happened, the price of sugar, rice, onions, eggs increased.
Due to a bad harvest, experts warned that there would be an onion shortage a few months ago, but the government did not allow importation. And then, just when the next crop is almost due, that's when they give the green light to importers. Local farmers will not be able to compete against cheap imports.
This is what happens if you do not have net neutrality. Facebook was free to the masses in the Philippines, and Marcoses employed troll farms spreading misinformation through Facebook. Cambridge Analytica was approached by Bongbong Marcos, the current president, years before the election, into how to rebrand the family name, and they came up with spreading misinformation about facts and painting the honest politicians into villains based on lies.
