That sounds like more than "little sales". If she owes that much taxes on that income and taxes are a fraction of the income you make, you made a significant amount of money doing auctions on Ebay. What did you do with the money?
And that's the issue. Income earned during a marriage is a marital asset. Debts accrued during a marriage is considered marital debts. Most states follow an equitable distribution model, if that's the case you're supposed to split those debts and assets up fairly. If you helped spend the money that was generated and didn't help pay the taxes on it, it would be feasible for her to get you help pay off some of the tax burden on it. Having said that, I'm not sure small claims court is the appropriate venue for this. Without knowing your location and the laws of your state, I can't give you any more advice than that. If it were my state, it could be argued that family court has exclusive jurisdiction over marital assets and debts and that the appropriate way to go about handling this is to reopen the divorce case if that's even possible.
The 2-hour hearing on the merits of your case--is that meeting conducted in front of a judge or just you meeting with your attorney?
Yes, you can't open a new family court case. There's likely no jurisdiction for that. You likely can't change the divorce filing. But you may be able to reopen a divorce case where there's additional marital assets and debts discovered AFTER the final decree. It's not easy to do but in some instances it's possible.
