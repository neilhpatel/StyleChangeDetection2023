I understand how DDoS protection works. It’s something that always intrigued me ever since gaming platform was hit off during holiday (Very sad times). What system is completely DDoS proof? Not trying to be rude, but in csec we never speak in such absolutes. Before I go diving into the theoretical power of a state sponsored cyber warfare unit and imagine what a successful DDoS attack against an enterprise cloudflare client would involve, I have to ask… have you really sat down and thought about it? Are we just disagreeing on what the term “DDoS proof” means?
Sorry, but calling a DDos attack a terror attack cheapens the term. Russia is committing enough genuine terror attacks and war crimes without adding stupid stuff like this.
you may laugh, From Russia with Love. Flemming had experience in military intelligence, authors write about what they know, read the first chapter which describes how the Russian government operates. It’s chilling. We’ve known how they operated for decades, if not centuries.
