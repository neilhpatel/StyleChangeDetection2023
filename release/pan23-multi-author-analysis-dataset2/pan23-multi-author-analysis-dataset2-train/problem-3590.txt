File to sue him for the cost of the deposit in small claims court. Google for small claims procedures in your city/state. It will require a fee (something in the $50 ballpark would be normal) but you don't need a lawyer. Sit down today and write down the details of any interactions you've had with this man that aren't already in written form, to preserve your memory. For anything you have in writing, keep a backup electronic copy in the cloud. Go to your court date and tell your story to the judge.
You may not win, and if you do win, you may not be able to collect if the guy has no assets. But that's your legal recourse to try to get your money back.
You can, depending on any contract clause preventing it, give factual and opinion reviews. It's only slander or libel if its false. He may still sue but the truth is a defense to libel. That's the risk you take.
For your deposit, the terms of the contract applies. If he thinks a change is a cancelation the contract is the only thing that defines what a cancelation is. Essentially you will need to read it and sue if what he did is against the contact. Depending on the amount involved you can sue in small claims. Document what happened and keep your texts. That should be enough to make a claim that they are refusing to commit to the contract as written regardless of any attempt to make a change.
It really depends what the initial contact says, but it sounds like you signed a contract for the guy to cater a whole wedding, probably promising to pay a commensurate amount of money, but then cancelled the agreement to cater the wedding and instead just buy the fruit dish. Need to see the contract, but the cancellation sounds like a breach.
Breached how? Asking for a change isn't a breach. And when the caterer decided to cancel, they explicitly said okay let's go by the written contract. Where is the breach?
