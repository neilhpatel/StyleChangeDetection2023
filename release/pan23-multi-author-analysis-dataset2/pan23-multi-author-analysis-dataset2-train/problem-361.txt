Blocking does work. If it was a business who refused to stop sending emails that would be illegal. This is basically political emails that are being sent to everyone asking for private info. And then refusing to being taken off a list. Is that not a problem?
This is my work email. This person has sent 4 emails in 2 days asking for info my admin. I have asked to removed and they have refused. I can mark as spam. Iâ€™m asking if I can report to FTC or something else even though it is a public school employee email since they refuse to stop emailing 800 of us. Others have complained.
If it was a business that refused to stop sending commercial emails that specifically would be a problem.
If your work email is separate, then there should be no reason to take it off. If you are a teacher, you have a responsibility to your job and keeping it separate.
You say spamming, but what could they be spamming that's making things so difficult that you're the only one complaining?
Chances are, that if you did report this to the ftc, they would probably consider your report as spam. Your employer is allowing it, which means you have to deal with it or quit. Your work email is your work email for a reason. No one goes around reporting every spam emailer to the ftc, nor would they do anything about it.
