Where are you located? In the us there’s no right to a rent reduction. That’s a negotiation. The law either says rent is owed or not.
No. You lived there. You can possibly break your lease. Depending on the specifics of heating, you can possibly force him to fix the issue.
There are plenty of tenants right's group in SF who can go over the details with you and advise you.
I’m in San Francisco. But so even if he doesn’t want to reduce rent going forward, I could still probably make a case for getting some rent back for months that have passed considering he breached our contract, right?
Yeah I have reached out before but will do so again once we know if it looks like it’s going to get fixed or not.
But just in general from a legal perspective, how come I can’t sue him for money since he breached our contract? If he decided he didn’t want to follow the terms of our lease, couldn’t I have done the same and just not paid him rent? (I’ve always paid the full amount and on time though).
You have a set recourse when the landlord breaches the lease which is usually you can break the lease. It’s not you get a windfall for you and you get months of free place to live.
