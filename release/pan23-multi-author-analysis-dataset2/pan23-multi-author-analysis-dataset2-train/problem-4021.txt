That's kind of my thought. Regardless of how this goes down, the rail companies can only lose. Whether they make this a short-term or long-term loss is up to them, and whether they just give the goddamn sick days.
I bet there are trucking companies drooling all over themselves with 24/7 hardons looking at all the potential business the rail companies will give them.
They might not be drooling for long. A great deal of cargo is transported by rail, and while that shift would likely occur, trucking companies won't be able to make up the difference alone, and that'll cause havoc that will, paradoxically, inevitably spread to the trucking companies themselves if the chaos lasts long enough.
Daily reminder, President Biden and/or Congress can tell the Rail road Barrons to give rail workers what ever they want.
Biden calls for railroad workers to be legally brutalized to force them to work without rights. Totally disgusting. Forgive PPP loans so rich people will have the money to sue poor people student loan forgiveness. Why should Bidenâ€™s affection for the rich be any surprise at this point?
