It is an incredibly deplorable and scummy practice, but it is legal; chances are you're buying limited term subscriptions rather than full permanent access. You can try to bring down costs by buying secondhand, renting from cheaper sources, using , but that won't help you if the class also requires paid content modules from those resources. I would also recommend trying to talk to teachers personally; sometimes they have spare copies they are willing to give out to students in a pinch financially. I was able to save myself quite a bit of money using all of the above.
Look very closely at whatever receipt you got when you used the book the first time. Most likely it was some kind of limited term subscription. So you "purchased " access, but only for several months or a year. This is a relatively new model in textbooks, but it's perfectly legal and increasingly normal.
2) Usually your courses provide a book list. Buy your books secondhand or rent them online. I don't think this is a legal matter.
