Fear causes fatigue and people get desensitized to it after years of being drained by it, even under grave and potentially life threatening circumstances.
It is unfortunate in the case of a pandemic as we let our guards down, but we must adapt and life must go on.
This is it, people naturally become less afraid. There will be people who know someone who was terribly impacted by it and so will retain their fear while many more people will have just got over it like an unpleasant cold. I've got to be honest, I haven't really thought about it for a while, I'm not pretending it doesn't exist, I've just had other things to worry about. The thought of bird flu flu jumping to humans worries me more.
I think there's the additional angle of, Covid isn't going to be eradicated. There's always going to be a possibility of a new coronavirus, just like there's a possibility of some new turbo flu.
How do you eradicate something this infectious when modern medicine can barely keep up simply admitting the victims?
