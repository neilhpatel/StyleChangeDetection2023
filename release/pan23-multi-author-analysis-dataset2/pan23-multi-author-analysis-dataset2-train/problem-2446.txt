If you're taking him to court, I assume you have retained an attorney. They would be the person(s) most versed in the facts/details of your case and be able to provide you the answer best suited to the specifics of your case.
Typically, any disagreements about non-emergency medical decisions would have to be discussed in court and/or lead to the appointment of a Guardian Ad Litem.
I completely understand why you want to do this, but you shouldn't do so without asking your attorney first. Since you're already going back to court because he isn't following the order, you not following it as well could cause issues.
Your lawyer will absolutely know best and will be able to tell you if you should/when you would be able to if or when the custody order changes.
I know it can be expensive, but if he's not following the custody order now, you need to take steps to ensure that he will in the future. Will your lawyer accept a payment plan? You should ask them.
Thank you. I mainly don’t want to do it in court because it’s so expensive for anything to have to go through there and I don’t have that much money for it.
