I've long been convinced these types of operations are active literally everywhere. Even in places as relatively insignificant as newspaper forums on Facebook.
I can name like 5 really suspicious accounts that regularly post on Belgian newspaper forums. They clearly know the language, but their povs are always in line with what some third parties would certainly pay them for.
Yes, they're appearing everywhere. Even on the NextDoor app there are people posting incredibly nationalist, pro-Russia views and I know I've never seen those people in my neighborhood. Now, I can't claim to know everyone who lives near me but I have a hard time believing more than a few of these posters are real.
That's the underlying goal of strategic misinformation - not to get people to believe a certain thing, but getting people to inherently distrust everything that's said.
And what better example of that is Elon's recent tweet where he undermines journalism. The replies in that thread were horrifying, and made even worse by bots.
Political beliefs often fall on a spectrum. Irrespective of where you fall on that spectrum, there's always people either side of you that want to challenge your viewpoints - 90% of people on the spectrum will disagree with you in some way, shape or form.
This "friction", and the healthy discussion between others that share views different to your own is essential for a functioning democracy. However, if you're in an environment where politics has become toxic, where de-platforming is the goal rather than discussion, then democracy is not sustainable.
The lenh of time a democracy is able to stomach toxic politics before imploding (revolutions, coups, civil wars) is based on the strenh of its institutions.
You can talk to them about local affairs, no problem , everything about them screams "I live in Belgium and always have".
