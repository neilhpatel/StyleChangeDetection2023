What a remarkably one-sided article. No mention of the American/British/European cyberwarfare efforts. It's like listening to a Liverpool - Chelsea Cup Final where only Chelsea's moves are being reported.
Oh ye of short memories - how long ago was it that the CIA were discovered to be hacking into the phones of German cabinet ministers including Chancellor Merkel?
You know why a Russia hacking group is need, and not other hacking groups? Because Russia is actively fighting against world peace and stability. Whereas the US in undeniably invested in peace and trade.
That's what I'm saying. Intel gathering is just that. From russians I expect everything. Power killed to hospitals, wrecking electric grid and what not. They have showed they are capable to be reckless.
Hacking is hardly a problem. End goal is a problem. Worst US has ever done is wrecking a uranium enrichment facility. It's mostly Intel gathering ops otherwise. I'm sure russians are prepared to do anything. I mean... Russians lie and deceive and attack and kill and rape and pillage and then we have surprised Pikachu faces when people trust US more.
