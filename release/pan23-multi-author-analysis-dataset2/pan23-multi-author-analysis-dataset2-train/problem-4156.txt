I wouldn’t argue with this idiot he’s literally pulling a what about BiDeN bullshit line these people use instead of focusing on this issue of deregulation by the people who are causing these problems. Regulate private business. This isn’t difficult.

This was always my belief. Biden doesn't even have to fix anything Trump did. Why on earth would they roll all of it back anyway if it's going to benefit them all so much?
Lol, so you fell for the photo op. How cute. The local officials actually requested Biden not to come yet, since the enhanced security of a presidential visit would slow down recovery efforts. Apparently, for the great orange cheeto, a meaningless photo op was more important.
It's us who are the assholes for assuming anyone who voted for him wanted a remedy. When all they ever asked for was a replacement.
What I don't see any of is praise for Biden outside certain media outlets. The public certainly doesn't seem to be swinging from his dick in an attempt to suck it for "a job well done.".
