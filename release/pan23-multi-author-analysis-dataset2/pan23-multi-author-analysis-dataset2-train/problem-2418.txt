1) you can’t change the locks on your own if the house is in both of your names. It sucks, but that’ll have to be a wait-for-the-lawyer thing.
In VA you need to be separated for a year before you can file for no-fault divorce. However, a fault divorce can take even longer because there’s a lot you have to prove. VA only started hearing divorce cases again in February so they’re also pretty backed up right now. Your lawyer can help you figure out what to do about that.
The divorce will deal with housing, daycare etc. Talking to him or not isn't really a legal issue, no one here knows your husband to say anything.
You can't change the locks, it's the marital house and he's got as much a right to it as you do until the courts say otherwise.
Divorce settlements take months, and sometimes years. OP has several options to establish temporary legal agreements before the divorce is final. Her kid doesn't have to live in limbo indefinitely.
To get finalized yes it can take months. But daycare/housing isn't only dealt with after finalizing. In the process of divorcing, op can get that addressed.
Yes, do talk to a family law attorney ASAP. Call several and leave them voicemails this weekend, hopefully a few will call you back Monday morning. You can file for an emergency order of support for yourself, although that may be trickier since you are a dual-income family. You can also file to establish a temporary child custody order, as well as temporary child support. I know in some states you need to be legally separated for a set amount of time before filing for divorce, and the separation filing may cover these things as well.
Once you have an attorney, you should not be contacting him directly, as you should let your attorney speak to his attorney. But if there's anything you think you could work out with him directly today and tomorrow, feel free to tell him, "I'm talking to a lawyer on Monday unless we can work out daycare and mortgage payments.".
