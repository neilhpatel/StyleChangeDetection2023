Of course. The person who rear ends isn't at fault if another car pushed them into the car they hit. How would that make any sense scientifically, physically, or legally? Fault requires action or lack of action. Your action (or lack thereof) caused damages to three cars, not one.
These are relatively small amounts, I've seen $60,000 demand letters in such cases for just one car. You should make sure you get a full release of liability when you pay. And obviously don't drive illegally, you could have been criminally charged in California for that, and could spend up to six months in jail.
I assume I’m at fault, I hit one stopped car, then a car behind me hit me and caused the car I hit to hit the car in front of them. That’s what I’m confused at, do I have to pay for the car I hit and then the other cars as well?
Correct me if I’m wrong. OP is at fault right or no? OP caused a chain reaction. If OP weren’t going fast, they wouldn’t have hit the car in front of them and caused a chain reaction behind them. Or is that not how it works?I’m curious to know who’s at fault for chain reaction accidents. It’s almost winter and snow will becoming. The 60+ car pileups are about to start.
Yes, of course, you caused all that damage. It doesn't matter what you hit (one car, three bicycles, fourteen tractors, or a cow and a scooter). Now the other drivers' insurance companies may or may not think it's worthwhile to go after you for it. So you don't "have to pay" in a proactive sense, but they can all demand subrogation from you, and/or sue.
Didn’t have a license at the time nor insurance, but now I have both. The insurance that I got happened to be with one of the other cars that was involved in the accident, they just told me to pay them for the damages or the ppl asking for the $10,000 could possibly sue me.
