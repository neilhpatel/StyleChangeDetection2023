He speaks in Persian and says â€œI dedicate this medal to all the noble women of Iran and the people of Iran wherever they are and I hope... racism ceases to exist among us and that we can all be friends and be proud of each other no matter what country we're from.".
And it's not just a medal lost, too. Winning a medal in Mr. Olympia gives you hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money (and not to mention sponsorship deals). And he was in the top 5 in Mr. Olympia every year from 2017-2022 (except for 2018 due to the travel ban). So it was like his whole year's salary was robbed from him as well in 2018. And there's only so many years in your physical prime that you can be a top contender in Mr. Olympia. So in a way, he was robbed of a good chunk of his lifetime earnings.
So he was banned around the time that he was winning back-to-back gold medals. He was a top contender for Mr. Olympia in 2018. But he didn't get anything, all because some Orangutan didn't like Middle Easterners and issued a travel ban. After that, he wasn't able to win gold in Mr. Olympia until now. So for him, it was like redemption for having a medal (potentially gold) robbed from him in 2018.
The racism part was sad as Hadi has previously spoken out about some of the discrimination he's had to endure as an Iranian trying to compete in the sport.

In 2018, Hadi qualified for the Olympia but could not compete due to USA travel bans by you-know-who. He physically wasn't allowed to set foot on U.S. soil to compete in the Olympia. So yea... simply because of being Iranian, he wasn't allowed to compete in the sport that he dedicated his life to.
