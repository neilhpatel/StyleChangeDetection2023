In answer to your question, you did not commit fraud because you actually believed yourself to be part Native American. And you might still be -- these tests are based on genetic data gathered from real individuals all over the world. But, they don't have a lot of data on smaller groups. Your native American tribe may be one such group. Don't think "genetic test. It's 99.99999% accurate.".
Oh and about the fraud, no you didn't commit fraud. You were enrolled based on your bio dad and he fully accepted you as his bio child so there was no fraud.
I did my Ph.D. in statistical genetics and agree that these ancestry tests are not very precise. They are heavily dependent on the existing samples that Ancestry has, which is likely skewed towards Europeans with few Native Americans. The estimated ancestry proportions will frequently change as Ancestry or 23andMe update their datasets.
Before you blow up the family dynamics, as others have said those tests aren't the best with testing for native American ancestry. You should do a paternity test with you Bio dad first. After that you will know.
