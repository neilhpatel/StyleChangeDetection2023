Get a second opinion on if or how much that repair should be and put in your notice. Tell LL that you will be vacating after the lease is done because of his poor maintenance record.
If has come to my attention that you expect me to pay for the heat pump. I would like to respectfully request the following information:
At least 3 quotes from reputable professionals outlining the cause of this damage and the best recommendation to fix it.
First, I would get a few of your own respectable HVAC vendors to come in and review the system and note exactly what is wrong with it. get estimates for repair. (if the LL refuses to grant you access to the equipment, then full stop, you will not be paying him anything) Then find out if the lack of any maintenance over the previous years caused the problems. Or, even better, did the problem exist last year? (some issues are obvious that they existed for years before) Or worse, did someone sabotage the system recently to cause the problem now... (fresh damage is noted).
This sounds like it wasn't working correctly to spec before now, any competent HVAC company would be able to determine that, and so the LL would have been responsible.
And, sadly, the way the lease is written makes it possible that the LL (or his maintenance guy) broke the unit now, knowing that you would have to replace it per the terms of the lease.
