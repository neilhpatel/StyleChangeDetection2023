No, if the cops show up without a warrant you are not legally required to open the door any more than you would have to open the door for another civilian. See: 4th amendment.
1. They have a search warrant or arrest warrant. This does not have to be a "no knock warrant", which is just a specific type of warrant.
Ok. For my own sanity I just called the county clerk and there is no warrant out for my arrest. There wouldn't be, just making sure I'm not crazy lol.
Probably won't happen but just in case ... if they do come back with a warrant, comply with their direct orders, don't interfere or resist and above all, don't try to sort it out by talking with them. Regardless of the question, the answer is "I wish to remain silent and I would like to talk to a lawyer.".
2. Exigent circumstances. An example would be if they have reason to believe someone in the house is in danger or they are in "hot pursuit" of a criminal suspect.
They quite literally showed up at like 730 am pounding agressively on my door while calling to me by name and demanding that I answer the door.
At one point the person on the other side of the door was hitting it so hard a picture fell off my wall.
I would make sure you donâ€™t have anything in your apartment, vehicle or person that could cause you grief with the police.
