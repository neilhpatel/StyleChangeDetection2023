It’s worth noting that in the original article, the reporter Amelia Knisely was reporting on a letter sent by the Republican Senate president Craig Blair to Gov. Justice detailing abuse of disabled patients. And yet the Justice administration goes after the reporter, not Craig Blair, as a way to silence her and try to discredit the allegations. This is how autocracy works, pay attention! Also, who will be the voice for the abused? The abuse stories are horrendous.
This could have been a local story forgotten about in a week or two, but they just had to get the reporter fired. Now the whole country knows about it. Really buried that story huh?
I don’t know who Tim Robbins is, but he overstates things. A lot. Antietam was fought a few miles from Harper’s Ferry but there really weren’t a lot of large battles fought there. It was contested by the South until about 1863 and there were cavalry raids. The state itself was born out of the Civil War but other than Harper’s Ferry and a section of the state museum in Charleston there’s really not a lot to see.
