Then this will almost certainly be covered by your school's online learning/computer use policy and be completely acceptable.
So under my schools electronic devices and network resources section it states that any device with district software may be subject to monitoring and censoring, however any device that doesn't have district software is not subject to monitoring or censoring. My laptop hasn't had any district software installed on it, and I've only ever used it at home. Does this help? Also the only reason I'm using my personal laptop is because the school issued one doesn't work well and I can't accomplish my work. And the reason I accessed my bank account and other accounts was because I do have bills to pay.
I'm trying to figure out if this is legally ok for the school to do. Because it seems really shady to me, especially since they didn't disclose it to us. I only found out after a teacher happened to mention it. And I don't mind them monitoring my online class work. What I have a problem with is that if I'm logged into microsoft teams outside of school hours it tracks what I'm doing. So, if I happen to forget to log out, or I log back in to do something real quick it can see what I'm doing.
