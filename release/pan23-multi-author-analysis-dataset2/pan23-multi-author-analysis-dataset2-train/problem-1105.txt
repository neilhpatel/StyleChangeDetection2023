If the fountain is on your property and you have told him that he is not permitted to allow his dog onto your property, this is trespassing. Your location matters, however, as to whether it would be a civil or criminal matter. In most jurisdictions, this would be criminal. You may, however, have a difficult time having charges brought because the police and/or prosecutor may see this as a minor matter, decline to prosecute, and tell you to handle it in civil court.
You could put up a no trespassing sign but that would likely be unsightly; so you could go the comedic route and put up a 'no dogs in the fountain' sign and see if this guy gets the picture. If he lives in your neighborhood, then the next time this happens take a picture of his dog in your fountain, call the police, and send them over to his house. They might be more persuasive in telling the guy to keep his dog out of your fountain.
In many places a fence is required around any fountain, pond, or water feature on private property. Primarily this is to prevent drowning should a child have easy access to the water feature. In my area a fountain requires a 4 foot fence, a swimming pool required a 6 foot fence, and neither can be in front yard of a house. Check your local codes before contacting law enforcement about the dog.
