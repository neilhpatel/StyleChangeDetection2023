This is not kidnapping. That dog is a family pet as soon as you purchased it. If the dog was bought with marital funds it could be part of the divorce separation of assets.
As u/DiabloConQueso and u/wot-mothmoth write, YES, even if you purchase the dog with your separate account, it can be a marital asset. But there are so many factors here. State is important because equitable distribution versus community property. Also if your separate account was pre-marital and generated by say, a personal injury settlement/award or a pre-marital inheritance--that account COULD be deemed separate, unless you commingled it. How to commingle? Deposit anything--even a penny--in it from the marriage. Some states also provide that paying marital debts from a separate account could result in commingling too.
ALSO, you say soon to be ex-wife--was the divorce already commenced when you bought the puppy? I know you say you just consulted with a lawyer, but it's not clear if that was regarding the divorce proceeding or whether it was for the puppy. Some states have a look back period to the filing/service of the summons and complaint.
On the aside, you may want to let the place you adopted know your plight. Some breeders may have sympathy and could give you a credit to adopting a future puppy (after the divorce, of course--otherwise we would just be repeating the marital property issue above). It is a long shot, but you never know what a breeder might do to someone who clearly cares about the puppy like you do.
The dog can be marital property even if one spouse paid for it out of an account in their name alone.
Many married couples have a single source of income with one spouse's name on the account -- that doesn't inherently mean that one spouse owns 100% of everything and the other spouse owns nothing, or that things purchased out of that single account are not marital property.
