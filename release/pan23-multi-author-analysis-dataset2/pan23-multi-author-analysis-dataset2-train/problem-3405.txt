If the AC is included in the lease and the landlord refuses to fix it, you may have the right to fix it yourself and deduct the cost from your rent. Maybe someone with more knowledge can comment on this. You would obviously want to notify the landlord first that you expect him to fix the AC by \[DATE\] in accordance with the terms of the lease and if he does not do so, you will have it fixed/replaced at his expense. If it's possible to get a free estimate on repair/replacement (might not be) then let him know what the charge will be when you give him the deadline.
In Tennessee, landlords are not legally required to provide notice of entry for routine maintenance or repairs, or for showings. Check your lease to see if a notice of entry is included.
Your landlord needs to fix the AC as it’s included in your lease. As for what to do next if it isn’t fixed, maybe someone else will comment what to do. You shouldn’t have to pay for it, though. I am not sure if you have any sort of renters association you could go to.
