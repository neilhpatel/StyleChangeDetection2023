If that gets you nowhere, a lawsuit for the value of your possessions that were improperly disposed of might be a second or third step.
Is it possible the landlord thought you were fully vacated and was remodeling, or does this look more like vandalism?
If they refuse to offer some amenable resolution, you can explore suing them for the value of the belongings they disposed of. Depending on that value, small claims court may or may not be an appropriate venue.
Review your lease for any verbiage surrounding abandonment of your unit, or things related to notifying the landlord if you'll be gone for more than a certain amount of time. While somewhat uncommon, there may be something in there about your duty to inhabit the apartment, or duty to inform if you'll be leaving it vacant (and therefore unsupervised for things like a water leak or fire or what-have-you).
In my opinion, OP should add onto the value of his missing property, the cost of the last month of rent. The landlord does not get to take rent money on an apartment that he is also working on.
