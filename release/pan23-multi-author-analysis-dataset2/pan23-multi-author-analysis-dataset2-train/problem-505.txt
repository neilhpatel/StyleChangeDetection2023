You were assaulted. Which is a crime, and you report crimes to the police. Because someone is a "worker" doesn't mean you get to commit crimes against them. File a police report.
It was around 1pm ish, I get off around 3 pm usually. I want to file a police report. But I don’t know where to begin and how to start, this never happened to me before. Everyone is usually nice to me, even the people who is angry about their food. Plus I’m very nervous to file a report.
The police take reports all day long, that's their job. You call them up or go in and say "I'd like to file a report for an assault that happened today." You don't need it to file, but do you have a license plate number and/or video?
I do not have the license plate or anything but since I work at McDonald’s, there are cameras and such. So they do have it on video(I assume, I have never checked the camera because I’m not a manager). I’m not worry about wanting to tell the police, it’s about my father. My dad doesn’t really like the police and knowing him, I’ll have to run it by him and I doubt he would want me to file a report. I haven’t told him yet because he’s still at work, but he’s more of a “let’s beat their ass” type of guy.
