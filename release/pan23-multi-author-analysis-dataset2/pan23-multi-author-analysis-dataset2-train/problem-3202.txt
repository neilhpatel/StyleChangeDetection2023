Ok that's an ill advised way of framing his empathy. Guessing PR team is none too pleased. (Fun tip, do NOT post this on the r/soccer reddit. They are a bunch of worked up, over sensitive babies who seriously can't handle something like this. I posted a cool article I'd seen about a . It's going to also have an entirely new neighborhood around it, shops, pubs, apartments, everything. As someone from NY, I thought this was pretty awesome. Soccer is really taking off when something like this happens. Well anyway, the author of the article used a little flippin hyperbole in their headline. Kind of the norm for substack types. I mean, it's news but also fun opinion. They had a meltdown over it. Couldn't get past a headline. So stupid. ).
Oh yea of course. Just saying it’s not on the same scale of, for example “I know what it’s like to be discriminated against because I’m a rich white guy.” Gingers do get shat on.
...I mean, the idea of “the red-headed stepchild” exists for a reason. And again, I’m not saying they’re the most discriminated group. Just that they actually ARE discriminated against.
