You mean like getting a moderate to propose a $15 minimum wage bill in, say, Tennessee and then letting people vote? Am I understanding that correctly?
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I think that conservatives support progressive legislation, they’re just really vulnerable to toxic strong-arm propaganda as well so they focus more on the person rather than the policies.
Progressive initiatives in general seem to pass when on the ballot by itself and not attached to democrats. Florida in 2020 passed a $15 minimum wage, Nebraska did as well this election, pro-choice ballot initiatives are 6-0 so far including Kentucky and Kansas, ranked choice voting was put into place in Alaska a few years back, and weed legalization.
Honestly I almost wonder if it would just be a smarter move just to get progressive ideas onto ballot and have republican voters vote them in one by one?
I am saying maybe actual legislation is not the way to go. All these are passing as ballot initiatives of some sort. The rub comes in though that these things may win on ballots in red states, but then that leaves it up to republican politicians to actually implement the publics’ will.
