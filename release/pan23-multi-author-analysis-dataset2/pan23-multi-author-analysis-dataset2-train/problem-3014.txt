Cases like this are never easy. One of the main reasons why it isn't easy is because you likely voluntarily subjected yourself to her being able to do that because you didn't just walk away and cut contact from her.
That's fair, but she even admitted she knew she was hurting me and I had made it clear to her that she was hurting me and I needed it to stop, yet she continued. Does that play a part in it?
How does that change anything though? If the relationship were abusive, and we both stayed, she could easily be held liable for physical abuse over the course of the consenting relationship.
Because you are also responsible for your own actions. We don't award people monetary judgments when they contributed to causing them. You did not HAVE to interact with this person. You chose to do so knowing her personality.
Ok, but why? I know I'm "arguing" but I'm genuinely just trying to see the whole picture. If it were physical abuse, the judge wouldn't say "you could leave whenever you wanted so they are free to go". Why would it be different for mental abuse, deliberate at that?
If I can't consent to physical abuse, how could I consent to emotional abuse though? I guess I just don't get how someone can deliberately cause you pain and suffering and get away with it and if I were to have even touched her I'd have been hung before the courts.
I'm not saying it's okay or right. I'm telling you from a legal standpoint it's a dog case because you contributed to your damages. Does she even have money to begin with? I'm guessing probably not if she's a college student. Are you really going to want to spend thousands of dollars paying an attorney (because they aren't likely going to take it on contingency if she has no money and they think it's a bad case) to even attempt to get a monetary judgment you might not be able to collect on?
