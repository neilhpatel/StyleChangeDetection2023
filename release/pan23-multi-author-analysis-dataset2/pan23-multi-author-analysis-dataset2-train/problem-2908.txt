You're going to need to explain the nitty gritty a bit more. In CA a worker would need to be compensated for some of this time, but not the time spend waiting for the result. Can you describe the process?
So I’m trying to calculate what that compensation should be. Normally, I would assume it’s just “whatever I normally get paid for forty minutes of work.” But my contract for the work I’m doing guarantees a twelve hour days. So I’m assuming that if going to the test counts as calling me in for work, I’m entitled to twelve hours compensation.
I got in my car, drove to a site, sat in line, and they put a thing in my nose. Whole thing took forty minutes, tops.
But my contract is 250$/12 hours, with a guaranteed twelve, which usually means if they call you in for five minutes, they bought twelve hours.
According to the , you need to be paid for the time you spent getting the test, including time in line, time filling out the forms, time getting swabbed, and travel time to and from the test site.
Work you had to put off and do at another time, or lost wages from work you couldn't do in order to make their schedule will not be compensable.
Edit: that said, I did respond to that panicked email declining to come in, so maybe that changes it?
