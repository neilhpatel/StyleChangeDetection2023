The average American wants a job that pays a living wage instead of stagnant, slave labor wages preferably from their hard work and physical exhaustion. The conservative position is that people who are born wealthy and have never worked a single day in their lives should be able to reap the rewards of the working class without actually doing any work. The government’s role is only to take money from the working class to bail out the wealthy class’s countless mistakes and bad business decisions to assure they never suffer any consequences from their incompetence. Stagnant wages result in wildly low taxes for the rich (sometimes none at all) and spending absolutely as little as possible on public services that benefit the working class allow the wealthy ruling class to hoard even more wealth. Passing laws that harm poc, the lgbt community, single parents, or any person who belongs to a religion which isn’t “Christianity” creates a distraction from the countless pedophiles in religious and political communities. This allows people who sleep with porn stars and fly minors across state lines for illegal sex to present themselves as “strong” and “family friendly” as they commit these acts on the taxes of the working class. Fixed it for you.
