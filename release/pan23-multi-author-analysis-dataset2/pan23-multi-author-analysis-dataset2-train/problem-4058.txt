Russian AA aren't perfect but certainly strong enough to prevent Ukraine from achieving air superiority. Ukraine probably won't achieve it anytime through this war, even if they push Russia out. Something would have to change a lot. Ukraine has a very small air force.
Hell, the Russians had issues supplying the front north of the river. And there was a partial bridge, a pontoon bridge, and various tugs.
This probably does not prelude a full scale push across the Dniper tho, logistical challenges would be intense. Makes more sense to push south to Melitopol and cut the Russian force in two.
wasnt there reports about the Russians wanting to blow up a major dam upstream of Kherson? that threat maybe still out there. maybe thats why ukraine maybe taking it slow to try set up a toe hold on the opposite side on the river??
Not sure I agree about in the air. Ukraine has been very smart and has managed to prevent russia from achieving air superiority, but Russia still has the advantage in the air. It's only really good for launching cruise missiles from inside russian territory though. Both air forces have very limited ability to fly close to the line of control though they both try. I'd probably give a slight edge to Russia there with the larger air force and larger AA network.
