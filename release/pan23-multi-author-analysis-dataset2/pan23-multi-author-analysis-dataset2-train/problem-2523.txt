There's been liberals chattering on about "demographics is destiny" for the past couple decades but it never actually seems to happen. Meanwhile the GOP ignored the 2012 postmortem saying they needed to get more inclusive, and instead nominated the candidate most widely seen as one who would crater support among minorities and instead that candidate went and got surprising GOP gains among minority voters. And young voters are still turning out very lowly, and again, those who do vote are clustering to the urban coastal blue areas where their votes matter less than when they were living out in Iowa or Ohio or whatever, plus gen X is potentially shifting to be more conservative than boomers, which could at the very least lead to a big postponement of any demographics is destiny style wins, and while millenials aren't exactly darting to the right as much as past generations did as they grew old, they are starting to trend in that direction too.
In order for Congress to even pass legislation protecting first trimester abortion, we'd need to not only elect a democratic house but also at least 52 democratic senators.
