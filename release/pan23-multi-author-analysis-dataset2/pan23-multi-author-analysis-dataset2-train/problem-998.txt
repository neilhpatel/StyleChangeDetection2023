I agree, but I worry that they'll argue the pile was larger than the width of a normal car and the road can't be used to store personal property. I have to reread the HOA governing documents...
Here's a similar case from Portland. They ended up settling for $50K (paid by homeowner's insurance).
I don't see how you have any liability here. He ran into (and on top of) a stationary object. If the kid is so blinded by the sun that he can't see an obstruction in the road ahead of him, then he shouldn't be driving at all.
That case is different in that there was bodily injury. In your case, the damage is to an old car that isn't likely worth $2000 even if it's repaired. You need to know the make model and year of the car and look up the value. They're trying to sell you their car. As far as actual liability if you were in the court room, I can't answer that for your state. You would need to know the rules that you broke. What evidence there is, ie photos? You said it was cleaned up the next day, so it's not there now to complain about. And you'll need to know the liability standard in your state for stationary items left in the road as to what portion is yours and what portion is his own. In general a driver is obligated to not run into things. But there are exceptions when it was impossible to see. How much do you want to pay to make them go away? You could pay nothing and make them go public, which they clearly do not want to do. The other possibility is that they lie and make a claim for bodily injury. But that would be suspect as well since they did not make a report and they haven't mentioned it.
It doesn't even matter if it was wider than that. He didn't try to navigate around it -- he tried to drive straight through it.
