And if you think that's something, look into all the diverse stuff they developed from wild mustard. Broccoli, cauliflower, brussles sprouts to name just a few.
So, is all corn GMO? Yes, technically all corn on the planet has been modified by human activities – or, put simply, there’s no such thing as non-GMO corn – but only around 80% of corn in the US has transgenes inserted by the modern technique of transgenesis.These GM corn varieties have been created with insect resistance traits to help farmers more easily manage pests – such as the corn borer or corn rootworm – and protect their harvest.
It has also been genetically modified to be resistant to the weed treatment round up. It’s called round up ready corn. The farmers just spray the crops with round up and the weeds die and the corn doesn’t. The round up is absorbed into the corn though.
And the quote was straight cut and paste. So someone who knows more than me thinks 80% isn't a lot when it comes to corn. ).
We're a big supplier. I'd much rather eat natural corn, and not buy GM stuff at all. Nor those steroid cattle or chickens.
