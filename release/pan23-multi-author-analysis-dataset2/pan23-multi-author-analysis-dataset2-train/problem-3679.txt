I used to browse the comment section of conservative media and screenshot all the terroristic threats. It's all spelled out, exactly what they plan to do. They were talking about taking out power stations back in 2019. Other plans include blowing up bridges, roads, and other access points to blue cities so that food can't be trucked in. Disruptions of water treatment facilities. Violence against media outlets.
GOP voters think they are safe from the effects, as if these terrorists are going to check someone's party affiliation during a mass shooting or bombing.
You could see 1/6 coming like a slow trainwreck just by browsing surprisingly mainstream places like Breitbart.
Even the bluest city still has a ton of Republicans in it. They should be furious and fearful that terrorists are happy to sacrifice them as collateral damage to hurt the libs.
This is what kills me about all this right wing shit and the response. Every fucking time it’s awww shucks guys we didn’t know or well we couldn’t do anything bc reasons. Then you hear about them blackbagging protesters blowing apart babies w flashbangs shooting innocent people and yet again awww shucks.
Mark my words we will get the awww shucks well maybe we can do something next time and proceed to point fingers while doing nothing to address any real issues bc we got elections bc it’s always elections.
