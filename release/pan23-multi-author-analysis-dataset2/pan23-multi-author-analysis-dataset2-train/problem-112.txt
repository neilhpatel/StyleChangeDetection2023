You might 'win' and prevent him from showing the unit due to the 22hour notice thing, but he'll just reschedule.
Seeing as the LL has the paint you need to fix the walls AND he will soon be doing the walkthrough checklist on damages to the unit, this seems like a very ill advised fight to pick at this particular moment.
If I was the LL, I'd be entering into a 'two can play at this game' mindset right about now and come to the realization that giving you the paint isn't required per the lease but returning the unit to a move in condition is.
I didn’t explain that properly, the paint is for me to use. They don’t have white walls so I needed to request a small amount of this particular color to cover up some marks.
You're not going to get really anywhere complaining about being short 2 hours notice on an apartment you're not living in. It's just not something that the law deals with.
Yeah, I understand why that would be the best option. There have been a few issues between us during my two years there, so reflecting on it, it’s a petty thing to be upset about. But it’s still shady behavior, right?
