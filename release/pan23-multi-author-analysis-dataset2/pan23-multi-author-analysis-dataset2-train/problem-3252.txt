What does your lease say about your ability to keep/store stuff outside? You can send him the video and ask if he still has it to return it. If he does not, it's questionable if he would be liable if it was someplace that you did not have outlined in your lease. The cost to pursue this very likely could exceed the value of the rail.
There's nothing defined in the lease about where we could store things. The rail was not an eyesore, it was leaned up against a fence and invisible from the sidewalk/street. My landlord also has quite a bit of remodeling material he keeps in a garage behind our apartment, so in my eyes there should have been no reason to have spare material spilling out into our walkway anyway.
The rented space is the 2nd and 3rd floors of a house, with the first floor being rented by another tenant. There is a walkway between our building and the neighboring one, it is the only access to my door and the other tenant's door. It does not lead anywhere else, so nobody without business at our building takes it. This walkway is not mentioned in the lease, the rail was kept across from my door leaned up against a fence.
Then it sounds like you do not have any rights to store items there. If they thought it was scrap they removed it. You should ask if they still have it and see if they can return it and store it in your rented space. Otherwise it's probably best to just forget about it.
