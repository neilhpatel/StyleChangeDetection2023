California law does not require that disclosure. Of course, being at will employment either employer can also fire OP when they find out.
California, non-compete is not enforceable unless OP owns a significant part of the business or his non-compete agreement was negotiated with an attorney representing OP and has venue and choice of law clauses outside California.
But the noncompetes really aren't the issue -- those are intended to address what you do after you leave a company. The issue is that you're working for two competitors at the same time. Have you disclosed this to each company and gotten their (preferably written) approval? If you don't, and things go badly, yes, one or both of them could sue you. Trade secret laws aren't something you want to mess around with.
I mean when you fail to be upfront about this, and six months or six years from now one employer finds out you're working for the other one, assumes you're a spy and sues you.
You are asking for trouble here. If what you're doing isn't against policy for both companies I'd be shocked. If you're lucky, you won't get sued, and instead one employer finds out, tells the other employer, you get fired by both, word gets around, and you end up unemployable in your entire industry.
People moving companies happens all the time. There's no reason for them to make an assumption that by changing jobs openly, you're doing anything illegal. It's a far different situation when you are secretly working for a second company while still working for the first.
