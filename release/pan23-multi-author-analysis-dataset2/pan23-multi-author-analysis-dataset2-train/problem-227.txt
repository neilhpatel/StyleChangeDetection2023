The story doesn't even demonstrate the point that removing a judge for terrible judgements is in any way bad for democracy or the judicial system, it just asserts it (again). And they’re not even comparable cases. The outlined story suggests the judge was following the letter of the law. Cannon was clearly being partial and bending law, even to the extent that the 11th circuit said she was reinterpreting the constitution.
They really defended Cannon’s terrible judgement with a story of a judge who sentenced a fugitive slave to be sent back to slavery?
So basically, let corruption judges get away with favorable ruling for their benefactors otherwise it might be weponized to go after progressive judges.
The one group most reluctant to criticize itself is the judiciary, viz Justice Thomas and his rolling list of conflicts of interest, and now we learn that Justice Kavanaugh is sipping eggnog (or quaffing BEER) with seditionists. The one remedy for removal, impeachment, requires a supermajority. The most important fact that seems to have been overlooked in this episode is that Cannon assumed jurisdiction where she had none. That’s a problem. Even if she offered opinions and rulings that were flawed, she may have achieved the goal of slowing the process and thereby hobbling the investigation with no apparent legal justification — as the Appeals Court found — other than she decided on her own that she could.
