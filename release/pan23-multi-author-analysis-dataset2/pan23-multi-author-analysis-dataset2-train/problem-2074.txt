NAL Was in same circumstance. Advised by lawyer to register our lease at town hall. Seller had to buy us out of our lease. Was enough for a down payment on our first house.
If they’re actually a realty company, they know that they need to honor your lease. They were probably just bluffing to see if you would actually move out in 3 days.
Watch out for when the deed changes hands. If you’re paying the previous owner, and not a property manager, you will need to start paying the new owner eventually.
If you have an existing lease, that is still in effect with the new owners of the house, and they'd need to give you notice as specified in your lease. Three days is insufficient.
I couldn’t recall what extended it past 60 days, so listed 30 as that’s the absolute minimum per California law regardless of the situation.
If they left contact information, let them know of your existing agreement and your intent to stay through the remainder of the lease but are willing to negotiate (look up cash for keys). This should be done via email and/or certified mail.
They have to honor any existing rental agreements. If you are month to month, they have to provide at minimum, 30 days notice to vacate.
Make sure you have a copy of your lease agreement and copy of utility bill with your name and address easily accessible in case they try to illegally evict you.
In this case, California law would require them to honor the lease term regardless if the owner wanted to move in. Simple case of state law adding additional protections.

They have no way of knowing who is living there. It could very well have been the previous owner that defaulted on the loan which is why they sent the 3 day notice to vacate.
