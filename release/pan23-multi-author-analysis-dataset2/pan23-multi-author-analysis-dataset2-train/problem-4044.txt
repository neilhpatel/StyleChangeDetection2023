Pay it and don’t work with them again. The time to refuse their service because you didn’t receive a quote in advance would’ve been before letting them pick up the item for delivery you did not have the details hashed out and yet you let them do the delivery. The time to stop and get the full quote and full details would have been before letting them pickup the delivery load.
If they tried to charge you something exorbitant and didn’t back down, you’d probably both end up fighting it out in court. That doesn’t sound like what happened here, they were expensive but not drastically out of line. They didn’t have any duty to minimize the cost because they never gave OP a quote. Of course they’re not going to optimize the delivery they have no cost limit on.
IANAL either, but this passes the smell test to me. If you have people perform services for you without getting a quote or estimate in advance, you are, in some sense, writing them a blank check. That’s why it’s an absolutely terrible idea to do so.
I don't think this is correct, I'm not a lawyer, but are you? If I'm reading your answer correctly, your claim is that the delivery service could charge any amount at all. You could perhaps argue that OP was charged a standard rate for the services, but this is also expressly not the case. This was clearly an exceptional delivery, as a result of conditions outside the realm of a standard delivery.
