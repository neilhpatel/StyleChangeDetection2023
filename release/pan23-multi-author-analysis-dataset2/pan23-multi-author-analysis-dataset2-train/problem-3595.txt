Airlines must file their cancelations with the government. It is to some degree improbable that they would falsify a government filing this way.
You can file this in small claims court. It won't be heard there. The issues are far too complex for that.
I should have mentioned this earlier: the weather need not be in the departure or arrival city. It could be anywhere along that aircraftâ€™s path during the day.
Thanks! It was $150. Financially it's not worth the hassle but I hate that aspect. I mentioned too that they needed to report accurately to the DoT/FAA on cancelations and the woman freaked out and said "well we won't tell you what we filed you can subpoena us".
I wasn't sure how small claims court worked with airlines and if it would be a slam dunk but from what you're saying it's not and in that case I should just cut my losses. I'll redirect my efforts into shitting on this airline forever instead.
I can't imagine this would be a slam dunk - unless AA moved immediately to settle because that's cheaper than fighting. Which is possible - though it is also possible that they're going to the wall to set a precedent.
Weather in Denver can scrub your flight from LA to San Francisco if that plane was to do Denver to LA first.
