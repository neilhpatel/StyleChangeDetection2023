Cops aren't as interested in getting the right person as they are in closing a case. Glad to hear you were released, but don't ever think a cop who wants to talk to you is ever interested in anything that could be to your benefit.
Overall the advice is good, but I'll point out that there are plenty of times where it can make things better.
You were a suspect. You still may be. They're allowed to lie to you. Don't ever do that again, don't ever "go in for questioning." You don't have to and it can never make things better, only worse.
The problem is that for most people it is difficult or impossible to tell when that is- hence the real reason why the "shut up" advice is so important most of the time.
Don't ever willingly go to talk to the police. If you're ever detained, the only words you speak are "I want to talk to my lawyer".
I concur with the previous commenter. In either case, if you're detained, say nothing other than "I want to speak to my lawyer". Until they detain you, stay as far away from the police as humanly possible if they ask to talk to you.
