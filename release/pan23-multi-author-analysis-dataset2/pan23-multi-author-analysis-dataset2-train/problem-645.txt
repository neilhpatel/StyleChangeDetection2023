Hi! IANAL but I have worked in the domestic violence field. The aggressive behavior by your ex-boyfriend is a little concerning to me. I don't know the reasons you broke up, but you may consider reaching out to the National hotline or your state's domestic violence hotline if there was domestic violence involved (FYI not just physical abuse, but verbal, economic, psychological, threats to property, etc. "count" too as forms of control and abuse). Laws vary by state, so reaching out to your state's DV coalition can help you get more information. You should be able to connect with a victim advocate who is familiar with the federal and state laws and can help guide you about what your options are. Often these advocates work with a lawyer or have a background in legal advocacy. As others have mentioned there may be steps you need to take such as calling the police when he gets violent. Also, someone else mentioned the police can come and witness him moving out to ensure everyone's safety. Again, there are most likely other steps that need to take place before this point, so reaching out to a DV advocate for your local laws can help.
In addition to what the top person said, maybe squatters rights, too. Look up the eviction laws local to your state, but almost always he has 30 days minimum. However....
