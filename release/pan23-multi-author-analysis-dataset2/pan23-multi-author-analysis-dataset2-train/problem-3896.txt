The seller is trying to avoid paying sales tax on their purchase, which is called title jumping. Don't purchase the vehicle unless the title is correct and complete with the current seller.
Unless this was an incredible deal or rare car after 18 months I wouldn’t give much hope of the seller getting a title to you. I’d return the car.
(EDIT: What has he been doing with it for 18 months? Has it been left to rot, or has he been driving it illegally? I'm going to upgrade from 'walk away' to 'run away').
It doesn't sound like this is a blank assignment, since seller/buyers name was filled out at the original sale (18 months ago). It's just seller never got the title put in his name.
Title assigned in blank would be if current seller got original seller to sign the title and didn't put the buyer/current sellers info on the title and have him sign it.
The implications for you are none, other than this sale might not go through. The current seller is going to have to get the title put into his name, and pay any taxes or fines from the state. Once he has title in his name, you can then make the purchase.
