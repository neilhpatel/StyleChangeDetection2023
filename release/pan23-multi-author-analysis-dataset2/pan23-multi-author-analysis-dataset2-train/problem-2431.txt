You should call. The main reason to do this is not really to help your old company out, it's to make sure this guy doesn't keep contacting you about a debt that isn't yours.
You aren't obligated to tell him, but from a practical standpoint, if you continue to ignore him, he may continue to call. One simple, "I don't work there anymore, here's the number you should call." could alleviate future headaches with this mechanic.
I'd call the mechanic and let them know you don't work there and aren't responsible. If the mechanic persists, tell them to never call you again.
Did you own the truck? If not, you aren't responsible for the debt unless you signed something agreeing to pay.
If you signed any paperwork with the mechanic how you signed could be important to what/if any liability you have but I would just call them back and say that you don't work there anymore and direct them back to the company itself. Even if you did somehow have personal liability for the debt with regards to the mechanic because of how you signed/who the mechanic thought he was dealing with, the company would still be liable to you, so at the end of the day the company should be the one footing the bill.
