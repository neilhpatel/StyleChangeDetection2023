We own a property together and have two children. We both are on the title but the loan is based off my finances. I have always had a stable income and he has jump around and has never had a stable career. He currently does not have a job and shows no real interest in getting one. If we were to separate, would I have to buy him out of the property we purchased 7 months ago?
Yes, if you are both on the title you'll both stay owners when you separate. You'll need to buy him out, or force a partition sale through court if you can't agree on a buyout.
He's on the deed but not the mortgage, meaning he has partial ownership of the home but is not on the hook for the debt. That's a very good situation to be in, so I would be surprised if you didn't end up having to buy him out. If he is cooperative, you can negotiate an amount that you both feel is fair--this might be half the increase in equity in the house since you bought it, but definitely not half the value of the house. You'll still need to be very careful (good idea to consult with a real estate lawyer), since taking him off the deed could trigger a clause making your mortgage due immediately because of a change in ownership. If he is not cooperative, you'll have to go to court.
