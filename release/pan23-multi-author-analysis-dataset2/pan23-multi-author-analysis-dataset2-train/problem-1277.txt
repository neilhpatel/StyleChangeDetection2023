Thank you for your advice. Now that I think about, that linked quote probably isn’t the best choice for me.
I was wondering if you could expound on this: “if police show up, do not talk to them.” How exactly do I do this, I assume they would want to ask me questions about him. What do I say in this manner?
I know the general advice is to never talk to cops without a lawyer present. Should I tell them to redirect all correspondence through a lawyer? Perhaps, plead the fifth if that’s possible in this situation.
This is kind of pushing into "unreasonable expectation". You would not be facing any kind of legal repercussions if this person commits suicide. His parents could not sue you (at least, not successfully).
However, if the linked comment is your concern, then what you're worried about is not any legal consequences to you, but social ones. And that's not really a risk you can reduce to zero. Not to mention the somewhat... distasteful request of "If you kill yourself, don't mention me because I don't want my parents to be disappointed that I knew you".
If you're that concerned about your parent's disappointment, the best way to head it off would be to get ahead of it and explain the circumstances to them.
Thank you, my intent of this post was to figure out what the police protocol was and whether or not I need a lawyer if police end up coming to my door.
