Many because evangelical churches are super into supporting “mission work” in Ukraine, Christian adoption agencies in Ukraine, etc. Ukraine is rare in that it’s a mostly white country where evangelicals can travel to convert white people (and can look into adopting white children from orphanages). The ties are pretty strong and decades old at this point. They know the country or people who’ve done mission work there/adopted from there & have heard/seen the realities of living next Russia and having so many resources Russia wants.
I can think of one small caveat, the Ukraine war falls right in line with the Reagan Republican philosophy dealing with the Russian system. I suggest the Biden team is playing a serious game of chess and the Republicans can’t find their damn checkers board. Reagan must be rolling in his grave right now!
