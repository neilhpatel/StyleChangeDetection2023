>An inspector general’s investigation found three main security failings, starting with “human error” by a gate security guard who allowed the man to drive onto the base even though he had no credentials that authorized his access. Hours later, the man walked undetected onto the flight line by slipping through a fence designed to restrict entry. Finally, he walked onto and off a parked airplane without being challenged, even though he was not wearing a required badge authorizing access to the restricted area.
I think that occurrence was the one that happened in 2/21, at least that's how the article reads to me.
Yes, I agree. The mouse ears detail definitely applied to the 2/21 guy. It is said right after they mention him. Especially since they said they only apprehended him, rather than open fire and then apprehend.
