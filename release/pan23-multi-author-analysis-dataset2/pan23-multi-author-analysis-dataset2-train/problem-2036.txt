"Hitler was fond of dogs, especially German shepherds (he considered 	boxers "degenerate"), whom he liked to control and dominate. At the front 	during World War I, he befriended a white terrier, Fuchsl (Foxl), who had 	strayed across enemy lines. Later, when his unit had to move on and Fuchsl 	could not be found, Hitler became distraught. "I liked him so much," he 	recalled. "He only obeyed me." Hitler often carried a dog-whip and sometimes 	used it to beat his dog in the vicious way he had seen his father beat his 	own dog. In the Fuhrer headquarters during World War II, Hitler's female 	German shepherd, Blondi, offered him the closest thing he had to friendship. 	"But with his dogs, as with every human being he came into contact with," 	writes Ian Kershaw, "any relationship was based upon subordination to his 	mastery." ".
