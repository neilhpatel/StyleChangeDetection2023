Maybe not professionally, but legally they are now. NJ is very hard to terminate, even pre-COVID, so an attorney is best here to help. But you'd give her written notice to vacate, and if she didn't, then you'd take her to court. She can only be "kicked out" by a sheriff with a court order.
Can they still give notices to vacate even though the eviction moratorium is still active? To my understanding the halt only effects those who can't make payments, but she is able to make hers. It's other issues which are causing a toxic environment.
I'm not sure how the name transfer would work, personally. I'm assuming her mother would add me to the deed, then remove herself.
EDIT: Not sure if it matters, but there is no written contract (to my knowledge) with terms or conditions of the rental.
Can we make a contract now, with a lease expiration date, and just choose not to renew it at the end of the lease (forcing her to leave)? An agreement like that would probably be less than a year. I'm planning to move into the house early next year, which means my name would replace her mother's name and I do not want anyone else in the house but my girlfriend and myself.
Hypothetically the dates would be from today to March. It's not my position to say what the agreement would have in it, but I assume cleanliness and other related matters would be included. Would there be any complications that could arise making an agreement just for her, and not including siblings who also live there?
