I definitely noticed I was getting close to them when I slammed on my brakes. They obviously had too because they had started pulling forward about the same time (I assume they noticed me coming close and were also trying to give me more room). In either case I either came very close to hitting them or actually did hit them, however minor it may have been. I really actually can't say for sure one way or the other with absolute certainty. But that is neither here nor there at this point. I just don't want to cause any further issues for either one of us because of what is / was / could be a very minor issue.
But if I didn't hear or feel anything to make me believe I did hit them, I didn't pull over to check for damage.
You can call the police and report that you were in an accident if you think you were in an accident.
If the situation were reversed and it was me and I actually was hit and I felt like the other driver left I imagine I would stay at the scene and call police to take a report. This driver seemingly looked at their vehicle and left which leads me to believe that even if I did hit them there was no damage to their vehicle worth reporting. Can they leave the scene as well and still report it as if it was a hit and run if they also are not on scene, I made (I feel) every reasonable effort to make contact.
