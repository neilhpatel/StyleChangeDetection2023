Something to think about with apartments and similar living situations: Neighbors is a reality, and sometimes you get really nice neighbors and sometimes not. He's free to utilize his living space, and unless you can quantifiably show he's breaking a law fairly regularly (noise ordinance), he's well within his right. For upstairs neighbors, if they don't have carpet or rugs, sound can easily travel between units, even if it's not apparent to the person making the noise. It may be useful to suggest some sort of carpet or rugs in situations like this.
Right, I get what you mean with the sound thing. When he does not think I am home, I can barely hear his footsteps. They are quiet and sound far away and he does not stomp or throw things on the ground like his exercise equipment. But the moment I start cooking or using the restroom or showering - making noise after getting back home from work, he will start hitting the floor over and over again and it is not just regular footsteps. These sounds are like if I were a 200lb man and putting my weight into it to make the ceiling shake by stomping intentionally in place kind of sounds. Or him throwing heavy exercise equipment and letting it roll around. I've even heard him a few mornings in a row scrape his desk from one end to the other of his studio back to the same spot. Who does that without the purpose being to bother someone?
The timing is the most suspect of all. Like it'll be quiet and then I go to my closet and move stuff around in there and the moment I do it sounds like he's hitting the floor with the end of a broom over and over. For like a few minutes.
