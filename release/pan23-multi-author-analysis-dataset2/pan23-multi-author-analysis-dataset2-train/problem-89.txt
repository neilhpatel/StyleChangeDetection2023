Medical marijuana is legal in Minnesota, how did the landlord know you didn't have a prescription before entering the premises? Sounds like an attempt to kick you out without having to go through a costly court battle. Find a lawyer asap and get advice.
What was the reason of their inspection? Many leases allow for emergency entrance if there is reason to believe an emergency exists â€¦ someone smelling smoke, hearing screams, finding leaking water, etc.
I'm assuming you're in the US and are in the middle of an annual lease. They can't come into your unit with no notice like that, except in the case of a bona fide emergency, which this wasn't.
There's no such thing as an "immediate lease termination". If they wish to terminate your lease and force you to move out they must go to the courts and get an eviction order. The process will vary based on your specific location, but you'll be notified in advance and be able to be present as well. It's highly doubtful that having drug paraphernalia is a valid reason to evict you anyway, but that will depend on the specifics.
For now, you're free to ignore the letter if you wish. Less ethical places have been to known to throw a tenants stuff out and change the locks while they're gone. Carry around your lease or at least an ID that has your address on it with you at all times while away from home and call the police if that happens.
