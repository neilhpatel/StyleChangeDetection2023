Yes, he can ask the court to force a partition sale if she won't agree. Just have her buy him out of his portion of the home. He gets his money, she gets to keep the house, everyone is happy.
We don't have the money to pay him the amount he's wanting. The house is apparently worth about 240k based on what the other houses around us are worth, but with the major repairs needed we could probably only get 100k for it if we did sell. So he wants over 100k which we don't have right now and the house isn't even worth. Is there anyway to force him to accept a certain amount to buy his portion?
No, it's highly unlikely that the court would order him to accept a certain amount, but family court judges have a great deal of power and latitude (if they file for divorce). It also depends on the local laws and procedures for your jurisdiction Most people don't have the cash to buy their partners out, but she can do a cash out refinance.
She really needs to get an appraisal to establish the true value of the home. If there are major repairs then she can get a contractor to write estimate for those repairs.
Right, if the house is only worth $100K he gets $50K (assuming there is no mortgage on it). A court will actually make sure this is done correctly so I think mom has nothing to lose by letting him file.
