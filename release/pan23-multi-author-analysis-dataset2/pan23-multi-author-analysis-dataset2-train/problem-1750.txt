You are not entitled to complete and utter silence in your unit. Everything you describe sounds like the normal & expected sounds that any attached unit will have. You're talking about kids running around and people moving; not jackhammers & DJ sets.
In that case, what noises are you experiencing? Because between you and your partner the only thing you mention is "constant running around, sometimes up and down the stairs".
Here's another way to put it: Asking to be released from a lease generally includes a request to cure. 'Do \[X\]/fix \[X\] or you must release us from the lease.' What are you asking your landlord to do that would require them to release you if they don't?
I never said I was entitled to complete and utter silence. I'm surprised you'd jump to conclusions like this not knowing the extent in which I've been affected by this, or exactly how loud these noises have been. I'm sorry if I struck a nerve with you personally, maybe you have kids or something, but what I'm describing here in my situation is a clear and direct violation of both the lease agreement and city ordinance laws.
I have a detailed sound log explaining every instance of intrusive noise we've experienced over the last few months. It includes but isn't limited to: stomping, running, excessive vaccuming late at night, loud music, running up and down the stairs, etc.
