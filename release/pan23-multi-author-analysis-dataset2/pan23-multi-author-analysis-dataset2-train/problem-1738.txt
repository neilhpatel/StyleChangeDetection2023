Then IT Contractors can fax over the procurement platform RFQ responses to the individual states' processing department, receipt of which will be confirmed in no more than 30 days via Deutsche Post (please make sure your address is up to date by securing an appointment at your local State Office no more than 28 days before your submission - appointments go fast, so log in at midnight to the appointment portal to see if there is any availability in March!).
This is such nonsense. The guy accusing Scholz of this is the head of Merkel's party, which is the party that is most responsible for Germany's political situation over the past 16 years.
He accuses Scholz that the military budget is 300 million Euros lower, which he knows is misleading. The additional spending will come from a so-called sonderguthaben â€“ a special fund outside the official budget. There was never going to be an increase in the official military budget. The alleged reduction of 300 million Euros is completely dwarfed by the 100 billion Euros in the special fund.
Merkel's party have been trying to do absolutely everything they can do for a year now to smear the traffic light coalition, suddenly grew a conscience over Ukraine. Disgusting.
