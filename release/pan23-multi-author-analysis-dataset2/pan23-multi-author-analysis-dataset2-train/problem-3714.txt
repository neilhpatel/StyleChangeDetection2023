Here is a crazy idea, why doesn't the self proclaimed party of small government let doctors and patients make medical decisions, let teachers and school administrators make education decisions, and let each person do what they want with their own private parts?
The mainstream (like their fundamentalist brothercousins) LDS Church has lay leadership and a rigid hierarchical structure. Basically every male is an "Elder," and at the head of each "ward" (basically a parish) is a lay "Bishop.".
To be fair, the official church has reformed somewhat. But the original church doctrine commanded men to take many wives, and, the younger and more impressionable, the better. Child brides were the norm. Lots of followers of Mormonism today reject the reforms and still follow Joseph Smith’s original edicts regarding this. You should read John Krakauer’s book Under the Banner of Heaven.
I grew up Catholic so it takes a lot to shock me, but I never had a priest bring up masturbation in the confessional. Utah Mormonism in particular is on a whole 'nother level of sex cult craziness.
