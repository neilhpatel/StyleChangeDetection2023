If Russia takes all of Ukraine. The next one would be a nato county and I am willing to see what happens. You can’t say the west didn’t do some provoking. Well here we are. Nato and the west broke a lot of agreements made and the current Russia is not the old USSR. Russia tried to join NATO a few times and they wouldn’t let them. Christianity is exploding in Russia and the west is mad they overthrew their control gained during the Bolshevik Revolution. Also, I don’t think there is any government worth fighting for on the planet so yea. I mean Putin is so bad they are making money hand over fist, Have a strong currency, and have Christian values. They are so terrible. My point is ever country has done really bad things and justified it. I don’t think Russia is the demon everyone makes them out to. Let’s talk. Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan. I guess China can’t do any wrong. A US Russia Alliance would basically control the world and support Christian values. That’s what I would do. Peace through strenh.
I'm not too sure about that. I remember in the opening days of the war when the Ukrainians realized that Russian tanks were coming to kill them all. All the men went away to war, then I saw a video of local musicians that had gathered in the park to entertain a large crowd of women, children, and the elderly, who were all preparing food and singing songs as they all worked together to prepare thousands of Molotov cocktails for their unwelcome guests. It was then that I knew that Ukraine could never be defeated.
