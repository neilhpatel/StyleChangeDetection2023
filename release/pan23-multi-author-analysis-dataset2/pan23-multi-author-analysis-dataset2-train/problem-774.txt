She's a symptom of a very dangerous disease. There have always been Marjorie Taylor Greenes around. It's just that previously they were mostly confined to being that crazy person that corners strangers in a grocery store and forces them to listen to conspiracy theories or spends their days furiously debating the minute details of imaginary shadow governments on private facebook groups. The disease is that the overton window has shifted enough over the decades for people like this to squeeze in around the edges and get elected to public office.
One or two might not seem like a big deal, but have you ever had one or two rotten shrimp in your trashcan? It's gonna stink the whole place up, and the only way to fix it is to take out the trash.
She is also part of a disturbing trend within the Republican party. In a normal political party, moving too far to one side would result in a correction moving the party back towards the center.
With the Republicans, however, they have set up a cycle where they elect candidates and then have those candidates get challenged from the right for not being right wing enough. The party gets lopsided, but it just leans into it further pushing further and further right with each iteration calling the previous ones RINOs for not being extreme enough.
Again, this would normally result in a loss of votes and a correction to keep the party alive, but the right has a group of locked-in supporters who will only watch FOX News (or "news" sources even further right). This means that the right wing politicians can push their supporters rightwards as the politicians move to the right. Add in voter suppression from the right and it's a dangerous path.
