Info needed: location, please? Did they give you any documentation from the visit where you initially were diagnosed with the std? Do you still have it? Is there any mention anywhere on it of the std?
New York. When they told me I was positive in March, it was a phone call. But I can see the test result on my patient portal. When I go to my test from November, it also says I was positive for chlamydia and yeast, they only told me I had the yeast and did not mention nor treat me for chlamydia. Again, it was a phone call when they got my results.
I am NAL but work in the medical field. Before doing anything else or saying anything to that office I would go in to their ROI/Release of Information Office for that clinic and request a complete copy of all your records from them. Document, document, document. I'd be very interested to see if they noted in your chart that they verbally notified you of all your results from November (including the chlamydia) or if they noted that they only advised you of the yeast. If you are able to pursue legal actions your attorney will want to look at these records anyways so might as well have them handy for the consultation. I'd also screen shot what you're seeing now in the patient portal as well.
