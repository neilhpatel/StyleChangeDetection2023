I'm not aware of any book that does precisely this, probably because we don't actually know that much about the day to day lives of the First Crusaders - pretty much everything about them was written after the fact and so is kind of light on what the chroniclers thought would be boring details (but we would obviously love to know!). That said, I have a few ideas that might help you:
I'll tack on Conor Kostick, The Social Structure of the First Crusade. I'm not a Crusades expert, but it's got the most about the non-elite that I can remember reading. Kostick explores what the various chroniclers mean by pauperes, and tries to uncover motives for non-warriors to tag along on the First Crusade.
I finally finished Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman, which was probably longer than I needed it to be but really interesting and overall a worthwhile read.
I'm currently reading something much more my usual speed: Bloodied Banners: Martial Display on the Medieval Battlefield which has some really interesting ideas, even if it isn't always successful about persuading me of the value of all of them.
