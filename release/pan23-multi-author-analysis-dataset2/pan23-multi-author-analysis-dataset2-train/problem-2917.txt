So yes, legal and nothing to file a complaint about unless you really want to, which is your right. Just understand that from what you posted, it is all within guidelines and there wasn't anything mentioned that states there was a discriminatory basis for the detention.
Former Police Officer- The story does ramble a bit but if I got the gist of it, someone called in to 911 about a possible theft from a residence porch. If included in that call was an even partial description of a possible prepetrator that was close to the kid in question, it is reasonable for the responding Officers to detain him until he is ruled out.
You could make a complaint to the police department, but itâ€™s not clear that anything illegal happened here. Someone calling to say that they saw a package removed from a porch would be enough for a Terry stop if police encountered someone who matched the description while they investigate further. Police only need reasonable suspicion to detain you during a terry stop, which they had.
