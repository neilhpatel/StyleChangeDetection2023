Good morning everyone, especially those of you who are new or casual readers of this subreddit. This note is to remind everyone that you need to take a moment and prior to commenting. Pay particular attention to the fact that all responses must be answering the legal question posed, and we do not allow tangents, opinions, anecdotes, or life/personal/relationship advice. \[Also I will launch anyone into the sun who suggests that OP also arm themselves.\].
Edit: Stop commenting with nothing more than "get a camera" or the relative probabilities of police taking action toward a relative of a former LEO. Neither of these are legal advice.
Edit again: Well, this was a wholly ineffective warning post. OP, I apologize, but I've had to lock your post to new comments as people are just commenting whatever garbage comes to their mind. You've gotten all of the advice we can responsibly give here already. Take care; best of luck to you.
Call the police. She threatened to use a firearm on you and yours, and is now brandishing said firearm when walking by your house.
