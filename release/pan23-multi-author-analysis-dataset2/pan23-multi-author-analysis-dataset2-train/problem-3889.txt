I’m aware as of now she has no such obligation! What does absenting a court order mean? Does that mean she’s gotta show up for court regarding the situation?
I don’t have one and I plan on taking her to court to get one the baby is about a year old and I would have done it sooner but I was in highschool and then joined the military but decided I should be at home for my child so I left and came home. She let me see her once but won’t reply anymore and I wanna take her to court to hopefully get partial custody I don’t wanna take her from her I just want to see my child even if it’s only on the weekends.
Meaning without a court order you have zero ability to get her to do anything. You need a court order before you can do anything. So stop texting her and file for custody.
