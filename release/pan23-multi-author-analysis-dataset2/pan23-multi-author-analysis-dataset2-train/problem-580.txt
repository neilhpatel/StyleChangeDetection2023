If you're both on the lease then this is an issue between you and your roommate. You're both responsible for following the rules. If either of you fails to follow the rules then you can be evicted.
yeah were are equally signed on one lease, so what he does affects both of us, thats why i want to try and take preemptive measures to stop anything happening again. If i have to i will most likely move forward with removing myself and getting him to sign a roommate release for myself to get myself away from this situation.
The lease runs until April, I know I can’t force him to sign a roommate release, he has agreed to abide to no loud music and having no alcohol in the apartment, however I will talk to him and see if he will agree to sign it willingly, if nothing changes.
That’s a good point, I will stay cordial with him as to not escalate it further, however he knows now the extent of the problem, and I will weigh the options further, thank you!
Additionally, if your roommate is actually an alcoholic, it might be a good idea to give an anonymous tip to your college's anti-alcohol/drug counseling program because they might be able to help you with the issues of him constantly partying and drinking.
Campuses have hundreds of resources which students are often not really aware of and can be of huge help for many of the common living and other issues college students might encounter.
