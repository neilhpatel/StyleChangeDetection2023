Going to watch the press conference hoping to see the moment this alleged person collapses and the mount of spiders fall out of the bag theyve been in.
No real press coverage, means no scrutiny. The only ones with the ability to fact check is the news media and reporters, without having anyone to report that things don't add up, you get people like Santos. This is what the death of independent local news gets you. A few years ago, reporters would have cut their teeth cracking Santos like a rotten egg. Now he's a footnote, Trump takes all the air time, and so small but important stories get left behind.
