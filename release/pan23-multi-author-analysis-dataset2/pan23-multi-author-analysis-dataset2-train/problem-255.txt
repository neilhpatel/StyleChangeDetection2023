...and instead of blaming the Regime, and their archaic, bigoted, hateful ideologies, mooks blame the US. Iran was a real country waaaay before the Ayatollah took over. Citizens don't forget that level of freedom no matter how many people religious fanatics murder.
Are their citizens armed? I don’t know the laws on gun ownership over there but it’s probably quite the uphill battle if their citizens are t allowed to have the means to actually fight the government, right? It’s not like these protests accomplish much but raise awareness. The guys in charge are still going to be I charge without some persuasion.
Plus, I assume most civilians wouldn't want to start killing others. That's why they've been protesting without instigating violence.
Arming citizens would most likely give Iran full justification to start bombing residential areas with artillery.
I guess it is useless for me to show you the tens of thousands of dead people that were brutally killed and tortured by the Shah and his secret police (SAVAK) since you would ignore those human rights abuses as long as people can go to drag shows. Disgusting and despicable mindset.
Current Iran is a totalitarian shithole. Check out some pictures from the early 70s. You'll actually see people smiling, and women looking comfortable.
