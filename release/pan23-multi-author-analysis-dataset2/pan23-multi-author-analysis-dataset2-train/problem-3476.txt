Losing support is bad news for Kosovo but giving into western proposal is way worse. Serbs have proven themselves to be xenophobic on Kosovo and there is no guarantee they won't try it again.
They lost any claim to those kinds of privileges when they decided to try and genocide their way to power over the entire region. If they want to live under Serbian law, they can go live in fucking Serbia.
Fuck that. Why should they let Serbs set up what will effectively be separatist enclaves within Kosovo territory? Cause it worked out so well for Ukraine?
I agree with the point that they need to live in Serbia. Albanians were separatists, and it has nothing with “genocide”. After Yugoslav war in 99’. they used same tactic in Macedonia between 2000-2002. Difference was that Macedonia immediately called NATO troops to be present, and to deescalate the situation. In short Albanians in Balkans want Greater Albania. On the left is a “PM of Kosovo” Kurti with a map of Greater Albanian which shows Albania + parts of countries (Macedonia, Greece, Montenegro, and more territory of Serbia). To the right is “president of Kosovo” symbolically holding one of the part of the Greater Albania all ready conquered.
