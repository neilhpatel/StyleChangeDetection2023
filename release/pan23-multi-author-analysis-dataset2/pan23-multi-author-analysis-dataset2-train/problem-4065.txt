Not only that, but mroe importantly, it will block the party to access the subsidies. This is much bigger then the fine, Brazilian parties run on those.
Holy crap, the US needs this so badly. There has been so little accountability for 1/6 outside of handful pawns and some goobers and none of the ringleaders and GOP. The 60+ court cases Trump lost that were 100% frivolous need to get this treatment.
It's a fixed percentage of the "value of the lawsuit": a somewhat arbitrary value claimed at the start of legal procedure.
For example, if the objective of a certain lawsuit is a house, the value of the lawsuit is the same market value of the house.
I'm not sure what the value of the lawsuit mentioned here is, but IIRC, the maximum value of a penalty for bad faith litigation is 10%.
The value of the cause was set at over a billion reais, which would be the cost to replace all of the voting machines they were trying to say were defective. The penalty was set at 2%, and nothing will convince me that the criteria was "what percentage between 1 and 10 will get me closer to 22 million, for the lulz".
The cherry on top is that 22 was the number you typed In the electronic ballot to vote for Bolsonaro in this election, the R$22 million amount was totally on purpose.
Everyone involved also got referred to an ongoing criminal investigation into the effort to undermine democracy, I had a lot of fun reading the full decision. Here's hoping you guy get to have the same fun soon.
