Assuming US and service dogs are ESA and paperwork are ESA letters from the medical professional treating you currently. As long as you provided the letter to the landlord prior you should be covered.
ESA are not protected by the ADA. It must be a service animal which serves a need that the patient canâ€™t do. Emotional support is not the same thing and rely on discretion of establishments. Make sure the paperwork from your doctor specifies service animal vs emotional support. Some take the shortcut in defining but it makes a major difference in protections available from the law.
What paperwork did you give them? Where did the paperwork come from? Are these task trained service dogs? If yes what task do they perform? Why are they rejecting the dogs?
Wow, a reply to a 21 day old comment. ESAs fall under the FHA and are protected, it is not up to the establishment unless the owner occupies the building and/or owns less than 4 units.
What paperwork did you give the landlord? Where did it come from? And why are they saying they're rejecting it?
