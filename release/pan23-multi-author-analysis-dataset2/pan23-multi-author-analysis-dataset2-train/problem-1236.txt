For comparison, Ukraine claims it has killed (not "killed or injured or captured" which is what a casualty is) 127500 as of Jan 31, vs 106720 as of Jan 1 - and the Ukrainian kill claims line up pretty well with Western causality claims.
So Russia is likely losing soldiers at a rate of at least 3:1, based on their own claims, so it's likely even higher.
A lot of Russians I know started migrating in 2014, almost everyone left after 2022. These all are highly skilled and educated people. The brain drain is unreal...
It just never ceases to amaze me how these relics with antiquated, cruel tactics continue to hold and push power. Itâ€™s true everywhere right now but Putler definitely takes the cake of Chief Shithead.
Yup, I agree with this. I don't think China would just march an army into Siberia. But I think they would set up resource extraction knowing Russia couldn't really do anything about it.
I wonder how this will play in relation to China. More than the West or the US, China is a natural geopolitical opponent that is significantly stronger than Russia and they share a border. They play nice now, but I could see China making plays in the near future due in part to the broken Russian military and economy.
