Basically - you can petition the courts to have this person's right to make decisions for himself taken away from him. As you can imagine, this is not done lightly.
If guardianship is required, do you need the consent of the person as well? As I said they are refusing to get help.
To make sure I am clear: With durable POA, you do not require the consent of the person with dementia?
No, but without their consent, you need to have a court order it. If you need to take the step of getting court-ordered guardianship, you'll want a lawyer's help to do so.
If you mean can the person who issued the durable POA revoke it after it goes into effect, then probably not, because of the nature of durable POAs (as I understand them). It can be revoked by a third party. It would almost certainly require court action, and you'd have to show good reason for them to lose their power of attorney. You'd have to have evidence that they're abusing the authority they've been given, like spending money on things that aren't for the benefit of the person they're supposed to be taking care of (as one example).
If a durable POA is already in place, and the person issuing it doesn't want to change it (or is incapable of changing it) you'd need to go to court to have that person removed. You'd have to show good reason for it to be changed though.
