It sounds to me like she has it in writing that you wanted her to take it back, so she did. I am not a lawyer, but this sounds the same as if you had written "void" on the bill of sale, cancelling the deal. To me, it sounds like you are out of luck and should have not been so hasty.
Because I wasn’t sure what my back taxes were and didn’t think I could afford it until a friend stepped forward to loan me money. Not because I’m stupid like you might be thinking. Lol. She pushed my buttons a bit too many times, as well.
Lessons learned. Take your time on things in the future. Do your best to get a lawyer. Along with knowing the law, they can prevent you from making hasty decisions. You need that right now, knowing that your strings can easily be yanked.
Text messages can count in court, so can this. Yes, marital property is a thing. At court you can likely get half the value of the car. Doesn't mean you get the actual car. That value will be figured in with other assets, like the house, furniture, etc, that was bought during the marriage.
It just seems like a signed document would outweigh a Facebook message. Especially since, if I’m not mistaken, it falls under marital property which belongs to both of us.
