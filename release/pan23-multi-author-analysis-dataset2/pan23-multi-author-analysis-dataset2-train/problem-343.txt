You are correct about responsibility. OP is responsible enough to leave the dog in the place that they are leasing. They are not however leaving the dog outside. The roommate(s) are putting the dog outside possibly causing harm. This is the root of the problem.
No, OP is responsible for the dog. They have ownership, custody and responsibility for the dog. If they ask the roommate to mind the dog for a few hours while they go out, and roommate agrees then, yes, roommate becomes responsible. But from roommates perspective, they are jot responsible, they can leave open the back door and if the dog gets locked out it is not their problem. They do not have a responsibility to make sure the dog is fed, watered to sheltered because that is OPs responsibility. They obviously should not be actively abusing the dog but it’s unlikely to be proven they are intentionally doing so and again, why isn’t the OP there to intervene or alternatively restraining/crating the dog?
I do not know why no one else has brought this up, animal cruelty. section (2) clearly defines this.
