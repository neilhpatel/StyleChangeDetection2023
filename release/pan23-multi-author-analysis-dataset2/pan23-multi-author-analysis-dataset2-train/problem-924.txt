I don't know if that'll matter by that time. The wealthy have been quite effective in generating an army of fanatics to fight for them by subverting democracy. In ten years, I think we might be a neo-feudalist oligarchy with no hope of changing things except by direct action like the French and Russians employed.
The wealthy who own the congress and the papers are making us fight each other. The wealthy hope for a revolution where they can make even more money by picking at the corpse of what was the USA.
If you want to save the USA as a democratic country, you have to get rid of the ultrawealthy. There's no other way.
