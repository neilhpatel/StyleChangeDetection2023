Okay. I already spent some of the money and when I realized how scammy it was I canceled what I could but I will definitely call them back and tell them the situation.
You're not committing a crime but the money isn't real and when the check turns out to be fake (it is) the money will get withdrawn back out of your account.
There is a literal ZERO percent chance that the money stays. It might take two weeks, but 100% of the time, the money is getting pulled back out.
"I'll send you a big check and then you just send me some of it back" is the most common fraud/con scheme out there today.
I deposited it today, but the person at my bank told me that it’s legitimately there and that it can’t just disappear and they can’t take their money back.
And when they take the $3000 back out, you'll be at -$400 and have a bunch of bounced check fees and stuff to deal with.
But the check is not a good check. Call back tomorrow and tell them "So I got this check for $3,000 and they said just send them $2500 back" and they'll tell you "Yeah, that's a scam and the money's going to disappear.
