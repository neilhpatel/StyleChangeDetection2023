Im glad the US seems to be moving away from russian assets, tho i doubt support for Ukraine is at the 80ish % level over there.
Some much more than others, and had it not been for this war that woke a lot of people up, Germany would be reaching critical mass soon after which you end up with russian assets like Trump for good. US is healing but Germany was a bit too comfortable with the level of penetration russia had in it.
We have gotten a new government after over a decade of Merkel and her party. The new government has taken a way harder stance than anyone expected(we want way more, but so be it). Germany is the 3rd largest supporter of aid to Ukraine.
The idea of mutual cooperation with russia is dead in Germany. it only works with rational actors and russia isnt one. the german people are taking an economic hit and still supporting Ukraine at levels of 80ish% last polls thanks to our old government's shit policies(the economic hit that is).
