Your sister has an easy solution: she can shred the fake card at any time and should do so immediately. She doesn't need to talk about her vaccination status, but if her mother asks, "I'm not comfortable carrying fake ID, and I'm not willing to go to jail" is a true and complete answer. Replacing the fake with a real one, quietly, is also reasonable.
Under no circumstances should she present the fake to anyone. Forgery and its friends are all serious crimes, and most jurisdictions that have set up vaccine passport systems have also passed related regulations targeting fake documents. Your sister should have no part of this.
She can do this. It's legal. I'm not sure she should, if she relies on her mother's support for things like schooling. What her mother is doing is wrong, and your sister is not obligated to repay her dishonesty with honesty.
If the seller were to be a doctor and had the access and means to alter online medical records if we assume enough personal and legal details have been supplied by my mother, is she in some sort of medical database? Where she couldn't get the real vaccine because it says she already has it? Or is this not true at all?
