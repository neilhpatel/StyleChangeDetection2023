I think it's more insidious than what you suggest. I believe the goal of the GOP is to hand count all ballots and have a deadline of midnight on election day. Rural districts can meet this goal because they are sparsely populated. But denser, urban areas tend to vote Democratic. There is no way to realistically hand count all the votes in a big city in one day. That would result in thousands of mostly Democratic votes getting thrown out. This benefits Republicans.
