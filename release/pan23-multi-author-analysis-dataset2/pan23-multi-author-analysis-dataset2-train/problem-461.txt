“Should we build more hospitals and schools?” “Nah, let’s blow each other to hell We only have one life to live, let’s fuck each other up”.
so war is actually good as long as it’s not in the name of a religion? We should have a little more sympathy for men in ivory towers sending the poor to their deaths because hey at least it’s for oil and money right?
do you people even fucking think about the grander point you’re trying to make or is the single brain cell you have purely dedicated to making knee jerk “gotcha!” posts.
I mean isn't this the point of christianity, the second coming of Jesus, the end times? Just look what proportion of the christian world entered conflict rather than a peaceful resolution? Many in leadership in the US see their role as bringing the end times closer.
The ol’ holy land may have changed hands a couple of times. Make no mistake, I am no fan of what people do in the name of religion. Using God as a justification for any violence is a hard no from me, dawg.
Three, war almost always requires a subterfuge, a pretext. It’s rarely the true motive. Do you think Russia invaded Ukraine because “Nazis”? Plenty of wars have been fought with religion or another reason as subterfuge, with power or resources as the actual goal.
