Assuming they're nurses or orderlies or otherwise lower on the medical totem pole and aren't making a whole lot anyway... supermarket jobs are even less money, but benefits include less stress, better hours (no overnight unless it's a 24hr store, and definitely no staying awake up to 36 hours straight), and far less physical and verbal abuse from an ungrateful public. And any Karens or Elons are gone in minutes so you don't have to look after the same ones again every few hours.
They probably are, its exactly what certain members of the U.S. government are effectively doing right now and what they campaigned on. They can turn around and state the opposite party has broken the government, and how they should be the ones to make all decisions. While conveniently ignoring that they themselves caused the current conditions.
The US model is massively increase costs to users, so you can bribe global doctors and nurses with slightly higher pay while letting millions of people go bankrupt for basic medical issues.
