Employment lawyer here. If my client did this I would tell them to be prepared for a massive settlement, best case scenario.
I’ve never heard of a more clear FLSA violation than this. Probably state wage law violations too. Maybe even false imprisonment. This is so illegal, it’s not even a close call.
Not a lawyer: The part that makes me think you have legal ground is that they are clocked out, but told they can’t leave. If you are told you can’t leave then you should be clocked in and getting paid. They may argue that it’s only “a few extra minutes off the clock” but you should keep record of every time they take 15 or 30 minutes to let someone leave who was already off the clock. You should all be refusing to clock out until you can leave. If it’s a larger company, bring it up to HR or corporate somehow.
Edit: since this is all of your coworkers too, it’s possible you could bring this as a FLSA 216(b) collective action and get an enhancement fee (basically extra $$ for being the named plaintiff).
Right, I should make myself clear, many places in the US consider it illegal to use a emergency exit in a non-emergency. I was not advising you to exit that way. I was just ensuring that the locked door up front was not your fire exit.
We do have fire exits and I think they have alarms on them. I have considered exiting out of those but I know they'd make it a huge deal and probably fire me or something if I left that way.
No expert, but the front door might be for reasons of fire safety a necessary door to be unlocked if the fire doors are too far apart. It can't hurt to (anonymously) ask the Fire Marshall to check it out if there are not obvious exits.
