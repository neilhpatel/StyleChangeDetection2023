Modern appliances have computers which fail more quickly than the physical unit itself - we had a refridgerator go that way. The board was $500, and it was a $350 appointment to fix once the part came in...2 weeks later. So i just bought a new fridge since i didn't have an extra lying around to rely on. I'll admit i didn't look to see if there was a quick fix on YouTube for it.

I'm not sure what kind of oven you had, but unless it's professional grade $600 for parts/labor is essentially buying a new oven...which is the advice you were originally given. You chose to order the part and schedule a repair...and then didn't need the repair. OK, the repair company cancelled the appointment and did not charge you. How is this their fault, again?
