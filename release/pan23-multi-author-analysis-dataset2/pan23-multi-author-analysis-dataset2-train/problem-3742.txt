If it's $5.4K, have then forget installing a new A/C unit. Instead have them "rebate" the new owner with $5,400 after closing. Proceeds come out of closing. This isn't unusual in a closing, and the new buyers can purchase the unit that best works for them.
If I'm a new buyer, that's a lot more attractive, as most certainly your folks are not buying the best unit but rather one at the lowest cost, to say "new A/C! on the listing.
Get it in writing. Verbal Contracts for amounts over $1000 are... limitedly enforceable at best. Doesn't need to be especially complicated or legalese, just that they agree they owe you money. Consider a clause for if the house doesn't sell that they have to start some kind of payments after 2 years.
Be aware that the contract itself doesn't enforce things, but instead gives you easier routes to sell the debt to a collection company or to take them to court for it - unless you act to enforce the contract, it won't force them to do anything, and I know that can complicated situations where it comes to parents.
You can also have them sign a mortgage, which you can then record with the county to create a lien against the house. All liens will need to be satisfied as part of the closing process. You'll likely have to pay a fee to record the mortgage (every state is different).
It's Michigan and it's May. Open the windows prior to the showings. $5,400 for an AC system for a 4,200 sq ft house is garbage and few buyers will want that garbage in their house. I second the other posters saying provide an allowance for the new buyers to replace it with what they want. If it's been dead for years, it can't be that uncomfortable in the house.
