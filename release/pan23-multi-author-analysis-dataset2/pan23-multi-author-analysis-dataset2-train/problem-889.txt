It sounds like you were detained, not arrested. While you don’t have to mirandized at the time of arrest, you should be mirandized prior to questioning, lest it be inadmissible.
It sounds like the answer to the question, have you been arrested, is “no.” But that’s based on what you’re saying and assuming it’s accurate.
OP, did your potential employer find out about this themselves, or you volunteered this information? If you were simply detained, it is not a matter for a criminal background check. You were not arrested, and do not need to tell potential employers about this. If, however, this is popping up in a check that a potential employer is doing on you, you need to figure out what is going on. I would suggest running your own background check from one of the online providers and see what pops up. Additionally you may run a criminal check with the FBI on yourself ( and see what pops up.
Sometimes, civilian criminal background checks pull up records for people with similar names. Additionally, do a google search of your name and see what pops up.
Ok, so you certainly need to get to the bottom of this. You need to first figure out exactly what is coming up for you. Based upon my understanding a criminal background check in an employment setting is subject to FCRA regulations. This means if you fail it, the employer is required to present you with a pre-adverse action notice before making final hiring decision, furnishing the candidate with a copy of the background check report and a summary of their rights under the FCRA.
