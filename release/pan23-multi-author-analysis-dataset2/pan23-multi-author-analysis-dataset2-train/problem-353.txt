Man that poor animal. It was the last know tasmanian tiger and you know how it died? They negligently left it out in the cold and it froze to death. Then they apperantly lost the remains for decades only for it to be stuffed in the back of a cupboard? C'mon now folks.
I think you need to re-read that... its a family of marsupials which includes many species. One(?) species will be (or has been) chosen for gene editing.
"If Colossal succeeds in bringing back the Tasmanian tiger, it will be an all-new species. The plan is to create a hybrid animal, using "CRISPR gene editing technology to splice bits of recovered thylacine DNA into the genome of a Dasyurid".
Anthropocene Park See the strange and bizarre creatures mankind has not encountered for decades, even centuries With thousands of exhibits and more being added every day!
I donâ€™t, I am just making an assumption that the largest one, by far, will be the best match for a thylacine.
You are right in pointing out that this is an assumption, though. It may well be that the bits they need are from one of the little insectivores. It is pretty likely, actually.
I was also looking at what would have a pouch big enough to bring it to term, but they could have other plans for that, too.
