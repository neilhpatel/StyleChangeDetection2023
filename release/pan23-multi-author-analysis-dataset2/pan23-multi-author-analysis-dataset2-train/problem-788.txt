Non legally - do you have any idea how selfish it is to bring life into this world when you cannot afford it, and are depending on other people for your own care? You can have children when you’re older and can finance it yourself. Right now, be with the guy, have the Romeo and Juliet thing, whatever you want - but don’t have babies just because you want to start a family. Being a responsible adult means realizing what you want is only half of the equation. You have to do the prep work (in this case, having a place to live, having a job, having an 18 year outline for how you’ll care for this child.) It costs, on average, $12,443 just to give birth in Kentucky, which is 17% lower than the National average. Do you have that amount of money? Ok, now the first year of life is $13,186. Do you have $25,629 for the next two years? Excluding rent and your own care, of course. Do you have health care? There are so many little things that CPS can and will use to show that you are an unfit parent.
No you cannot get married. You should also be aware that if you get pregnant the state may chose to criminally charge your boyfriend and/or you for statutory rape. You will not get a choice in that.
