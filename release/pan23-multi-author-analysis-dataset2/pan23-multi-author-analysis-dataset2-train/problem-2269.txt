Your friend is giving you crap advice, ignoring the suit will not make it go away and will infact result in a default judgement against you. That being said, they do have to serve you first.
Since OP knows a process server is on the hunt, he should try to find the case and keep an eye on the docket. That way if there's a problem (i.e. they file a fraudulent affidavit of service) OP will know about it sooner than later.
For a court in NY to have personal jurisdiction over your company the plaintiff must prove one of three things to show your company is "at home" in that courts jurisdiction. According to the US Supreme Court during the 2017 BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrrell, a corporate defendant is only "at home" in three jurisdictions: 1 the state in which the corporation is incorporated, 2 the state in which the corporation has its principal place of business, or 3 in an "exceptional case," any state in which the corporation's operations are so substantial that it also is "at home" in that additional state or states.
