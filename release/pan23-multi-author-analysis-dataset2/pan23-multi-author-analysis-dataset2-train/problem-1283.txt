Unless your contract says otherwise you'll have an uphill battle to get anything from them despite how you feel about the situation.
The fact that they installed lights for you last year doesn’t mean that they’re somehow obligated to do so in perpetuity.
You paid them for a service last year which they performed, now you’re asking them to do it again and they have new stipulations surrounding your request, nothing about that is illegal.
It’s not illegal to sell you useless lights (though that’s obviously not even the case since you used them already). they’re not obligated to put your lights up forever.
You'll have to go over the contracts and documents signed. Unless they agreed to install and remove lights x amount of times for whatever price they aren't obligated to install them at all once the initial agreement is complete. Companies are allowed to have private internal memos about customers and property that they can use to determine if they want to continue doing business after the initial agreement is over.
