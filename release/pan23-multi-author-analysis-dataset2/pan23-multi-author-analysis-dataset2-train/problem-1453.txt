Yes they can fire you. No it's not illegal. If you're studying to be in the medical field as you say then you should be aware that working in a medical setting, regardless of task, does have certain requirements for vaccinations - not just Covid. Get the shot, protect yourself and the people around you.
Yes they can fire you for it. It’s part of a federal mandate that says any healthcare provider that accepts Medicare or Medicaid has to have all its employees vaccinated by Jan 4.
But actual religious objections to the vaccine are very few, so your belief wouldn't really qualify as a sincerely held belief to qualify for the exemption.
Religious exemptions are being widely denied across the country because they're being used by people in similar situations who simply don't want to get the vaccine, not because they have actual religious reasons not to.
I’m a RN, my hospital just denied my religious exemption. I reapplied for “reconsideration” but am expecting to be let go the beginning of January.
Myself among other nurses and staff have joined a group suit against our hospital for this inevitable termination we expect to face.
