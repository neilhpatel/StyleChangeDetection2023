Alright. So now that the ticket is paid for. I can go about looking into this driveway to prevent any future problems. They literally made it so they have the entire front of their house their own private parking.
I would assume the driveway was properly permitted and even if it wasn't it really doesn't affect you. They probably could have gotten a permit even if they didn't.
Also, if you get this guy parking tickets when he parks in front of his own place, wouldn't that just encourage him to park in front of your house instead?
Hmm yeah I was upset and wanted revenge but as stated earlier by someone I will go talk to him and find out what his deal is. Like we both go to work at the same time and you could of came to my door if it was an issue. But anyways.
Okay thank you so much. Yes they actually do block their own garage and driveway daily. So this is great information to know. I didn’t know they could get tickets for blocking their own driveway. I’m going to call parking enforcement anytime I see it happen. Can they contest saying it’s their own driveway?
Found out through my Nextdoor neighbor that he has confirmed to them that the driveway is not permitted. He just doesn’t like anyone parking in front of his house. He won’t have any of his daughters park their either unless there’s absolutely no parking on the block.
