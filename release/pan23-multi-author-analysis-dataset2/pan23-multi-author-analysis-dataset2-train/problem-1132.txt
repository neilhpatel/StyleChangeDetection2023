IANAL. The literal reading of that section specifies a time period for the inspection, but not for the cancellation, but that's being really pedantic, and the dealership obviously does not have a right to cancel the transaction at any point in the future. A quick search online doesn't turn up any laws which restrict what this period would be. That doesn't mean they don't exist.
I would agree that they missed the deadline. Respond that the contract specifies a 2 day period, and after that period elapsed, you used the money to facilitate another purchase.
I agree that “the conditional sale period” is also 2 business days. So on Wednesday, the third business day, the sale should have been final. Hopefully Monday was not some obscure holiday?
I sold a car to them that had a blown turbo that was plain as day and they called me two weeks(!) after the same wanting me to come down and “discuss” the sale. I ignored it, and they stopped calling after a few times. I let it go to VM every time btw.

If the dumbasses don’t want to do a thorough inspection prior to the sale, that’s their problem, not yours. I’m assuming you didn’t intentionally hide anything from them.
