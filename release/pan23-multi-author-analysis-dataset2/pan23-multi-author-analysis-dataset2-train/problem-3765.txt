EDIT: Let me be perfectly clear; this "political intrigue" stuff is just clickbait. When McCarthy gets all but two or three GOP protest votes for Speaker, the media narrative will be how the Dems "failed" to take advantage of Republican disarray. The outcome is certain. The media just needs this horserace to get your clicks.

All this "political intrigue" bullshit is just clickbait. The newspapers know what I've written is the likely outcome, but when McCarthy is elected Speaker, they can point to how the Dems "failed" to take advantage of the opportunity. It's always horserace bullshit to the media.
