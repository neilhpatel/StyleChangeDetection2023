Not yet; it’s on the agenda, but just wanted to know what the law says regarding this matter as my ex is proceeding as if she’s pretty sure that I will pay half the cost.
Seriously if you haven't talked with your lawyer yet go do it now. Your Ex has changed your kids education without attempting to 'reach and agreement after a “good faith attempt at compromise”' informing you of the change only after she 'notified his current school that our kid will not be returning next year.'.
I would not say 99% in this sub have to talk to lawyer. Some things you can do on your own like paperwork and phone calls regarding some issues like HOA/missing paperwork with marriage records or going to small claims court or some things are more police matters and some just don’t have any case. Of course you can pay lawyer to do easy things for you or say there is nothing to do be done but that isn’t always what people need after they know what to do on smaller issues. Of course the issues that hit top page in this sub are more lawyer material (like this one, op even has a lawyer already). But I read things that often just get a couple of upvotes and one answer too that can be pretty simple.
This sub is really designed for people who are considering the need or questioning if a lawyer should be consulted. You're way past that point largely because you've already had a lawyer handle your divorce and child custody. You already have a lawyer intimately familiar with your case, and you wont find that anywhere on reddit. about 99% of posts on here can be answered with "talk to a lawyer" and you're no exception.
The sooner your lawyer documents this instance of her failing to attempt at compromise the better position you will be in the next time she attempts to impose a non-compromise.
