As a Lebanese I can tell you there is no hope unless all the militias and zealots leave Lebanon and since this will never happen there is no hope.
It wasn't meant to be there long enough to be a hazard. It had already sat in the Mediterranean heat for six years when the fire got it. I'm not a chemical engineer, but I believe ammonium nitrate becomes significantly more volatile the more it degrades.
I work with these materials and have designed storage facilities at minesites in Canada. There are very firm regulations and quantity/distance tables that must be adhered to. How anyone thought this was safe in a major city is bewildering to me.
None of the ones who got called in for questioning went. Actually, they themselves sued the main investigator. One of them even ran for elections and got elected.
Its hazardous as soon as its combined. It becomes less hazardous as it degrades. The main danger of ammonium nitrate is when it burns in a confined space. The minimum distance between a facility of say 200 metric tonnes and a well travelled road is 1600m. The distance to a habitation is even farther. There were thousands of tonnes stored there.
The other thing that sets off ammonium nitrate is shock waves. So fireworks are basically primer explosives, which we use to set off AN mixed with diesel oil in industrial blasting.
