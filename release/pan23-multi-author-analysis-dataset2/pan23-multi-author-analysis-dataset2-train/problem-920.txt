« All available evidence indicates Ukrainian forces no longer maintain an organized defense in Soledar. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s January 12 statement that Ukrainian forces maintain positions in Soledar may be referring to defensive positions near but not in Soledar.».
Best guess I can gather from various sources is that they are surrounded on all sides except the salt mine and Russians are already doing atleast recon within Soledar tself.
There has been pictures of Wagner soldiers on the west side of soledar. Incl Ukrainian soldiers confirming they have fallen back to outside the city. Still an ongoing fight, just not inside the city center. There is a YouTubers called Denys who covers Ukraine daily and brought it up last night.
Fully taken and under control, however, is not something I could gather. But realistically it's (probably) sadly just a matter of time now given the Russian topological positions around Soledar (highground).
To put it carefully: it's still heavily contested, but yes, Russia is conducting a very strong offensive operation there and has entered most of the city according to unofficial reports.
