Lots of people threaten legal action to see if you'll make it right. Wait until he serves you with the papers, which I don't think he will. It's not worth the fight.
Hi OP. I'm not your attorney and your best course of action is always to seek legal advice from an attorney licensed in your state. That said, here are some Michigan-specific resources you might not otherwise be aware of:
(1) This is a summary of important aspects of Michigan's contract law. Especially relevant to your case is the section on the state's statute of frauds, which explains the general rule that the terms of a written contract will govern, and that oral evidence is generally not admissible to change/add to the unambiguous terms of a written contract. It also cites to, among other things, case law about the conditions under which oral modifications can be made to written agreements.
(2) If you sold the car for more than $1000, here are some related Michigan statutes: [see subsection 1].
(3) Not a legal analysis, but a practical one - I've been in similar situations with landlords who spit legal jargon out of their ass to scare people into submission who don't know any better. Don't play his game. If he wants to waste his time going to small claims court, let him. But until he serves you with that lawsuit/summons, why bother playing his game?
