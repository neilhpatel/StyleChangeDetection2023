Thank you. I haven't a clue what to expect in damages. I empathize that the girls were scared, and that it could be traumatic. But, could damages be in thousands of $$? That's my fear.
You may have some exposure here. You will want to talk to a civil attorney if and when you receive a letter / get served with a lawsuit.
About 1 month ago from the 1st letter received, and another boy received a letter several days ago. Is there something to this order of boys receiving letters?
Maybe that lawyers are also people. Sometimes people go on vacation. Sometimes people ask paralegals to send things out and it falls through the cracks until 3 weeks later when they ask whether that letter was actually sent.
If the demanded figure is low enough, sometimes it makes sense to just pay a nuisance fee, but, be careful negotiating with terrorists. Figure out whether you're dealing with reasonable people or a shakedown. Also, Courts don't grant apologies--so sometimes offering an apology as part of a settlement goes a long way.
