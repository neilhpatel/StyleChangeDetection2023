The owners of property are the only ones able to grant an easement. A town could take land for a road through eminent domain, but the town would have to pay the owners. I doubt the town took your land so the condo could build a driveway. I see three likely scenarios:
1) there was an easement granted by some previous owner that you were not aware of. It may be worth while to order a title report on the property or search the county records for easements on the property.
3) there is confusion concerning where the boundaries of the property are located. A survey would help here.
Do a Google search for, “your county” surveyors office. Once there, do some digging on the website for key terms like ‘tax map, assessors map, record surveys,etc...’ and do a search of your family’s property to get a very broad view of what is on file.
Prescriptive easement or adverse possession is 10 years (7 if they pay the property taxes on that property) so if an easement doesn't exist and it's definitely on your property after a survey you would be able to do whatever you want with that road.
— Under Washinon State law, an adverse possessor can only claim right to the property after 10 years of use and possession. If the possessor is paying the property taxes on that piece of land, the time period can be reduced to 7 years. Display continuous and uninterrupted use.
