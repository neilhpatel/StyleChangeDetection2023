I don’t know how 700 families and a Democratic minority fight this, but they can’t do anything without mass recognition of what they’re doing, and media and community support. And that’s the point of divide-and-conquer.

You forgot the third rail. Eliminate the pesky problem of counting the votes. Actually we'll make a show of counting the votes, if we win they yay for democracy, if we loose then there is obviously rampant fraud and we'll have to nullify those results and let state legislators decide who won (yay, what do you know we won). Hurray.
