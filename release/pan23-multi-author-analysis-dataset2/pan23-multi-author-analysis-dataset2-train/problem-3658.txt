Your HOA/condo association almost certainly has the ability to levy special assessments as part of their responsibility to you to maintain a reserve fund and to pay common expenses. The bottom line, up front, is that it's very likely this is completely legal.
No, you're right, but an HOA pays for things through member assessments. A special assessment means the HOA's reserves are insufficient (and the repairs are probably desperately needed). This is not uncommon in small HOA's, especially if they are self-managed.
Washinon's specific statutory rules for special assessments are . Your HOA likely has additional terms as part of your CC&Rs and current bylaws. Your HOA's board has a number of obligations, including an obligation to hold a hearing if there are objections to the assessment. The decision to pay for this out of special assessments, rather than by building up the reserve fund pre-emptively or replenishing it after the fact by raising regular assessments, is something you can address through your HOA's political process, as well (i.e., you can vote in new directors if you don't trust your board any more).
However, needing a special assessment for repairs suggests that the reserve fund may be badly depleted, or that the expenses significantly exceed the most recent reserve fund forecasts and that the HOA would fall below reasonable reserve levels if they paid this out of the reserve without restoring it somehow. The HOA needs - legally and practically - to keep the reserve fund liquid, so that if there are other unforeseen expenses, they can pay the bills rather than waiting for the members to pay into the fund to pay the bills with.
