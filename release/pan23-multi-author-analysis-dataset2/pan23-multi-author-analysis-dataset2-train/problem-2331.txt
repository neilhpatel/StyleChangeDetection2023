Do I look for a lawyer in my home state or the state in which the accident happened? Sorry for the silliness of this question. Grown ass man who doesn't know how the law works.
Every state has different ways to view this situation. Your best bet is to find a reputable lawyer with MVA (motor vehicle accident) experience. They get paid if and when you collect. Your medical issues will continue long after any settlement. The lawyer will factor that in. I would not sign anything until your lawyer reviews it.
My reading of the release is that it is for property damages only. A property damage release should not harm your claim for personal injuries.
Massachusetts is a PIP state, which means that medical damages up to the PIP amount would be covered by your car insurance regardless of who is at fault. If you haven't yet, you should open a PIP claim with your car insurance company, and I concur with people who say to you should definitely consult with a lawyer in PA about the accident, even though the timing may be bad, if there is an MRI that shows damage and given the extent of the property damage, there may be a pursuable claim.
