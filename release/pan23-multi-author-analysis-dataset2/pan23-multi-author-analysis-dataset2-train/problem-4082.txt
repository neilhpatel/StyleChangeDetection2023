U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission based on sex (sexual orientation) because this is protected by Federal laws.
Assuming the company has 15 or more employees then federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (as a subset of discrimination on the basis of sex). This includes hostile work environment claims which would exist if you are constantly called slurs. As the person doing this is a supervisor there is no requirement to report the conduct to a supervisor before filing with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (if it was a co-worker rather than a supervisor you would have to tell your supervisor and give them an opportunity to correct the issue first).
Aside from documenting everything and filing a discrimination lawsuit as others have said, I would like to add a grim reminder that if you do plan to take such course of action, you will almost inevitably be let off at the first possible opportunity for the company for non-protected reasons.
I would definitely start with them, but I recommend you to seek a lawyer if you are looking to start a discrimination lawsuit.
