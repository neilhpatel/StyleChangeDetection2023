It's really going to hinge on that for the most part - you should talk to your mom and get all of your ducks in a row.

You may want to post over on r/asktransgender too. You may be more likely to get responses from people who have been in the same situation there.
And you and your mom needs to talk to legal experts who have experience in custody law as it relates to trans youth. A lot depends on your specific situation, what state you're in, what state your dad is in, the exact terms of the shared custody agreement, etc. Some legal organiations you might want to contact:
Contact PFLAG. I don't know specifically how custody laws would work in this case, but PFLAG can likely give you some help. Another one to try is the CT Trans Advocacy Coalition. They should be able to help you and your mother navigate this.
And if either you or your dad are in the US south, . Under Provider Types check "Legal Resources" and search; there are some law offices that may have the kind of experience you need.
