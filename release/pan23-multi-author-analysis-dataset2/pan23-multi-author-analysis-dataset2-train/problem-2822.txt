The “coup” bit is kinda colorful language to refer to a sudden shift in diplomatic relations… clickbaity, but not really untrue. Edit: to clarify, I’m not sure what the Czech stance is on Taiwan but I’m speaking from the US perspective of strategic ambiguity.
its almost like rejecting longstanding principals of international law like national sovereignty and human rights, and substituting them for such diplomatic tools as - \checks notes\.
\- meaningless saber rattling and the general erosion of truth and fact in favor of authoritarian myth-making (shit, really? this is what they came up with?) could turn you into an international pariah.
Just keep threatening to nuke/declare war on everybody though unless you get exactly what you want. I'm sure this time that'll work.
I understand that it’s not incorrect, as I said. It’s just a colorful choice of words when the subject is political divisions and war. In that regard, it’s a bit provocative on purpose. Otherwise it didn’t stand out to me at all.
Taking a call from a head of state in Taiwan is equivalent to denying that the CCP rules China, in their perspective. Trump was also lambasted for doing this when he was elected president of the US.
