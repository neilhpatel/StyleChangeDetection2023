Criminally, if the police want to talk to you just don't talk to them, it won't help you at all. If you are arrested or charged with a crime talk to a criminal defense attorney.
You should talk to a criminal defense attorney before going to the police. It is possible you will be charged with a crime as a willing participant in a fraud ring even if you were not a willing participant or committing any crime. There are small details that can be important here, like if the friends gave you any money to let you use their account, if you knew they were using stolen or fraudulent checks, and the specifics vary depending on your location.
Civilly, mostly yes, if you pay this back the bank won't pursue you for anything else directly. Expect to have a negative mark in chexsystems, to not be able to open a debit/checking account for five years because your account was used to cash multiple fraudulent checks.
Yes criminal charges are separate from the civil side and you could be charged with a crime even if the bank is paid back. But many police departments have a policy not to pursue fraud, property damage, vandalism or similar charges when the victim has been made whole and isn't "pressing charges". And criminal charges have specific requirements above just a bad check being cashed. They require the police to prove that you intended on defrauding the bank or a customer, or that you gained something out of this.
It depends on the loss amount because this is such a common occurrence. The absolute certainty is your account will go into charge off. Less than $5k most banks send to collections. Most does not mean all. Over $5k they can reach out with a repayment plan or get straight to the Legal. Legal for the bank is the most costly so they will avoid it if they can, but you should too because it can affect other factors in future banking.
