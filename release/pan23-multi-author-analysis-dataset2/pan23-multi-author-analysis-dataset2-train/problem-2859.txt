Thanks for the response! No, the part about being 1099 was something I was aware of from the beginning....and I’ve never had an issue like this until now.
1099 are not employees and don't go through payroll (at least they don't have to, and in my experience never do).
It’s very suspicious to me that they’ve decided to leave all the payroll stuff to this other company and the people that answer the phone all sound as if they are working from home and have no idea how to handle this issue so they keep pushing it off on someone else. It is extremely odd that my job has decided to use such a flaky company like this. I’m thinking that it might be time for me to just find another job in light of this but I do want my pay of course!
Yes..I believe I am legally classified. This company probably has over 200 independent contractors that work for them. It’s a virtual call center. They send us tax forms every year.
That doesn't sound legal to me. It sounds like you should be classified as employees. How are you independent? Do you make your own schedules, do you have multiple clients?
