Unfortunately, our Idaho politicians have decided that the only place to take a broad stance is in a bathroom stall ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's infuriating that a state once known for pragmatism has devolved into narrow partisanship.
Unsurprising, you don't run for Idaho congressman to read things and make crucial decisions. Instead, you do it because you hate working, and if you're an incumbent republican, it's guaranteed reelection for life unless you get caught having gay sex.
Idaho congressmen have always been heavily partisan. It's people's perspectives that have shifted as partisanship becomes more evident.
I respectfully disagree about the tenor of Idaho politics (remember Church and Andrus - granted, he was a governor, not a congressman), but I will agree that within the last decade Idaho's electorate has taken a hard right turn.
