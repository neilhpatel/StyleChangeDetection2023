Remember that this man does not use computers or accesses the internet. He is completely detached from any perspective in which he looks pathetic or weak. I have no doubt sycophants are feeding him daily affirmation. Daily clips of Tucker Carlson on TV must also help. I'm convinced he still feels that victory is right around the corner.
This almost sounds like rhetoric from that one Austrian guy…. You know, he was a World War I veteran… got into art… published a book. Can someone help me remember?
Yes this. They started off demanding a change in Ukraine's government and they choose the prime minister (the audacity), demilitarised army etc. The demands stayed that way for a while but now as they withdraw from each region it's slowly changing. The range of demands is shortening. It needs to keep going until they will be happy for just a lease on Crimea (which shouldn't happen imo as Ukraine shouldn't let them anywhere that peninsular.).
Putin just released a doozy of an interview with Rossiya 1. It's apparently a standin for his yearly State of the Union he chickened out of this year.
