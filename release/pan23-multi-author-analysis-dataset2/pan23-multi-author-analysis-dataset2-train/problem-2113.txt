Hello. I hope it's OK to ask this - I've just had an older relative ask for a DVD on the Spanish Civil War for Christmas. He never asks for very much, so I'd really like to try to get him a good one.

I recall hearing about the Carnation Revolution and decided to learn more. I had looked around and multiple sources were talking about this long war Portugal was in from 1961 to 1974.

I recall hearing reading on Encyclopedia Britannica it wasn't a particularly deadly war, so why did it matter to the Portuguese people?
