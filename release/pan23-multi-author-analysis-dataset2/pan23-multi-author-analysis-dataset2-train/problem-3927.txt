Yes it is possible to sue a homeowner for a slip and fall. To be successful the homeowner would need to have contributed in some way to the slip and fall, to be negligent. If you have substantial medical costs, usually your health insurance co or the provider would ask who is responsible and pursue it, or you could talk to a personal injury attorney.
Have you submitted a claim under the homeowners insurance yet? That would be your most likely recourse for compensation.
You can sue just about anyone for just about anything. It is extremely doubtful, based on your post, that you would be successful.
No, living alone. My ex husbands dog does live there still. His water bowl is outside bathroom door and he drools more than he drinks hence water on floor.
