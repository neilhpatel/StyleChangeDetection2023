This is a purely semantic argument. NPR isn't telling us that the facts are other than has been alleged, they're just objecting to the word used to describe it. Fine, "crime" isn't increasing, it's "murder, robbery, rape, aggravated assault, larceny, burglary and auto theft". Maybe tax evasion is actually on the decline. Great. So, what's to be done about that list?
Holy shit! The media actually doing their job and looking into the bullshit GQP talking points they spew out???
