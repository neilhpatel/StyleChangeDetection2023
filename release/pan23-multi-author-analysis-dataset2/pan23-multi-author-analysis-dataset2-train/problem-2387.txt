best to not give full name on your google review account. Just better to not make yourself an easy target.

i take it the photos are off facebook? 1st thing you can do is change all your settings to friends ... if they are contacting you through facebook... facebook might be able to help.
I don't get how they would get your number and photos unless you have a facebook account with no privacy settings setup at all.
The photos are from Facebook, they're my wife's old profile pictures. She has her account set to just friends, now she's deleting it, but I believe you can still see profile pics. As far as my number if you Google my name and city it's easy to find that info. It's not the fact that they found it, it's the fact that they're trying to scare my wife and myself.
