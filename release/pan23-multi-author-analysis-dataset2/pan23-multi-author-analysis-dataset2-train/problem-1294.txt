Most banks won't cash checks older than 90-180 days anyway, so I don't think closing the account is an issue, and you won't get in trouble for a bad check. If he wants the money from you at this point, he's going to have to come to you for a new check.
So the only issue is you still owe him the money. At least until the statute of limitations on that (probably breach of contract, which is 4 years in TX) has passed, I would keep that money available to pay him if he turns up.
Personal checks expire after 6 months so no bank would even be able to try to cash it or anything like that so you’re safe from getting into any trouble for writing a bad check or anything like that. If you want to be extra cautious, keep some sort of documentation that proves the amount the check was written for was in the bank for at least 6 months from the date of the check.
In terms of if he ever tries to reach out to you and asks for the money I’m really not sure if you would be on the hook for it or not.
Also I wouldn’t write him a replacement check without him reaching out to you first. You’ve done your due diligence at this point. Again just keep documentation of your attempts to contact him.
Gave you tried googling his name? He may have passed away and you might be able to find an obituary. It’s also possible he lost or forgot about the check.
You gave him the check and he let it expire. Technically, you still owe him the money for a time, but you have met your obligation in the matter.
