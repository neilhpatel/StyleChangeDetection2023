Doing it before is obviously logistically simpler, and has the benefit of hopefully preventing the war from happening in the first place.
America is unloading old cold war stock, our vast donations leave room for new tech and cost justifications. To re-arm with the latest weapons to face off with china.
But the burden shouldn't be on the US alone. All allies in the region should be rallying together and sharing the load as it is in everyone's interest to deter aggression. In particular, Taiwan should be spending 3-4% of GDP on defence. They've increased it significantly in the past few years but it's still at 2.1% only.
We've forced Taiwan to be contented with so much less than what they had before. There was a time in the past when we had a full defensive alliance with Taiwan and granted them full recognition. Now we only sell some weapons to them but withhold formal recognition and expect them to be satisfied.
When ISN’T China ‘angry’ about something? Methinks they begin to cry ‘wolf’ a little too often. Should learn about devaluing the currency. Soon, no-one will care about their so-called ‘anger’ any more.
