She “aided and abetted” state sponsored and state conducted murder which she likely would have been killed and imprisoned for opposing in any way……. Not exactly like your standard scenario where someone aided and abetted murder. Not to excuse what she did she clearly knew at least a good portion of what was being done and in her own small way helped it be done, that’s morally unconscionable. That being said I don’t really see what this accomplished. Was she party to one of the most horrific events in history sure, does trying her 70-80 years after the fact really accomplish anything, not really. It’s a gesture, but the fact is the people who actually did these terrible things are long, long dead and many of them escaped any real justice (operation paper clip anyone), I just don’t see how putting on this public spectacle accomplished anything beyond humiliating an elderly individual and creating a PR stunt for the German government. I’m sure many others feel very differently and I’m more than open to hear their opinions (so long as they’re presented respectfully).
she got a 2yr suspended sentence though so it won't actually affect anything, but then I guess nothing that happens now will take anything back either.
It's a shame these things couldn't have been done 50 years ago so closer relatives of those directly affected could see it happen.
