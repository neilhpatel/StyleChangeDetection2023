“the company urged workers to “please return to your dormitories” on the campus. It also promised to pay them 8.000 yuan if they agreed to quit Foxconn, and another 2,000 yuan after they board buses to leave the sprawling site altogether.
“According to a document setting out the salary package of new hires seen by CNN, the workers were promised a 3,000 yuan bonus after 30 days on the job, with another 3,000 yuan to be paid after a total of 60 days.
The protest erupted on Tuesday night over the terms of the new hires’ payment packages and Covid-related concerns about their living conditions.
However, according to a worker, after arriving at the plant, the new recruits were told by Foxconn that they would only receive the first bonus on March 15, and the second installment in May – meaning they must work through the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts in January 2023, to get the first of the bonus payments.
“The new recruits had to work more days to get the bonus they were promised, so they felt cheated,” the worker told CNN.”.
I wonder why Foxcon doesn’t simply perform on their contract, and I wonder how bad those conditions are in the dormitories that the workers are refusing to go there.
I wouldn’t be surprised if that money was just a lie too so they’d leave the factories/dormitories relatively peacefully.
Not gonna argue about who can rightfully afford iPhones, but willing to pay 5k for an iPhone is definitely a bit over the top.
saw ad for iphone 14 the other day... i have model 4 which i use as a wake up alarm and emergencies. reliable little thing, still working like a charm, except for having too old IOS incompatible with any modern day app, which is a sort of a made up problem, as apps were working at the time perfectly. i'd use it any day over my big ass surf board of a phone i have now, if i could tbh.
