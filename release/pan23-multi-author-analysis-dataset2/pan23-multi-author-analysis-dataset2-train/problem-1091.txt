They did the work, you paid them. There's nothing left to the transaction. Tell them to stay off your grandmothers property and have a nice day.
If they come and remove the ramp then you call the police and report them for trespassing and theft.
You might consider notifying them of this in writing via certified mail and noting on the letter that you are also sending this to the state contractor's board.
If yes, I would simply tell the contractor that they pulled the permit and thus nothing else should be needed. Do please make sure you have a copy of their insurance binder. If should have been emailed to you from their carrier before work began.
What specifically in the liability waiver are you concerned with? Or is it the fact that they want a waiver to begin with?
Do you live in town? Does your town require a permit for a ramp? Did this contractor pull that permit? Did code enforcement inspect the ramp?
It sounds like you have a verbal contract with you paying and they building a ramp. They've built the ramp, you have paid via check.
