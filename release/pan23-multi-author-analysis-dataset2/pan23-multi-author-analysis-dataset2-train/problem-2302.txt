I went to Notre Dame law school while she was there. She is extremely intelligent and it is very well qualified to sit on the court regardless of how much I disagree with her opinions and methods of interpretation. She seems to pick and choose how she interprets things to get the result that she wants which is entirely inexcusable. As much as I disagree with her judicial behavior her qualifications Are roughly similar to Elena Kagan Who had never served as a judge prior to being nominated to the Supreme Court and had only served as solicitor general for about a year. However, from my experience with her her legal acumen is exceptional.
