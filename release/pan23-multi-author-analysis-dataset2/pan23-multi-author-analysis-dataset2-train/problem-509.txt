So, this likely wasn't proper service. However, your wife should still respond as if she were served. She can ask the judge to address this, but the point of service of process is to ensure that the parties are aware of filings and motions, and that obligation has actually been met.
If he's previously been ordered to serve documents properly, then the judge might find that he's in contempt of those orders. From your other comments, he's already running out of rope on that front, and allowing the natural consequences to follow his actions may actually resolve this.
If your wife is served with inadequate notice, she can contact the courts to reschedule the hearing to give her the appropriate amount of time to prepare. If she's consistently served late, the judge will generally notice once she starts asking for more time on a regular basis.
They way it was served is part of this case. The judge hasn't ruled in his favor in 3 years and he keeps filing more and more. He waited almost two weeks to serve. He waited because he knew it would be harder for my wife to get the day off. He constantly uses court to try and intimidate my wife and when the judge threatened to put him in jail for contempt after he yelled at him, he filed a change of judge. That was denied so he appealed.
That likely isn't proper service. (1) Interested parties can't serve their own documents, (2) you aren't a party to case, and (3) you weren't in an area (like at home where your wife lives too) where you'd be considered a designated person for the purposes of personal service.
You guys aren't doing yourselves any favours by not having a lawyer then. He's doing these things because he can get away with it, because you don't have a lawyer who knows the right things to do to get it all stopped and shut down. I STRONGLY encourage you guys to get a family law attorney to help you out here, any way you can.
