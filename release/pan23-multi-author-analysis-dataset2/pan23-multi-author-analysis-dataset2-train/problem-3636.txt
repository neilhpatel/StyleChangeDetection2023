They donâ€™t typically get filed anywhere in advance. Only a small number of jurisdictions in the US even offer it as an option.
Cold calling attorneys they might have used or continuing to search through their records is about it.
They are not required to be filed with any government agency; they are usually given to healthcare providers. You can ask doctors, pharmacists, hospitals, health insurance providers, perhaps even employers. They may not be willing to share your mother-in-law's Advance Directive due to privacy laws, but if they have your father-in-law's, he can ask for a copy. That may have the name of the law firm.
Thank you for your help. I just found an article about healthcare providers thing as well so we're going see if we can ask their doctors if they have anything. And we have been told about the other ways we can get POA it's just, if this document exist like he says it does, it would make things a whole lot easier.
Some states have a registry where Advance Directives can be voluntarily deposited. There are also private registries. It doesn't sound likely that your in-laws used one of these, unfortunately.
In the absence of a written Advance Directive, state law usually defaults to the spouse as the person to make decisions for someone who is incapacitated. If the spouse is not able or willing to do it, then an adult child.
You can check with their doctor or hospital if they've had procedures done - they are often asked for and out on file.
A lot of states have email lists of estate planning attorneys - if you know or work with one you can ask them to email the list and ask if anyone has the documents (we see these types of emails a lot).
You can also ask your father if he remembers how they found this lawyer, which can help narrow things down (was it who their friends used? Or the person who helped them with a lawsuit, or?).
