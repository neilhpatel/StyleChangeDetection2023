Sorry bud humans needing water to drink outranks sealife. unless you have an alternative please stop spouting nonsense about being "misinformed" desalination is the only option for providing water at a large scale if your natural sources are unavailable.
Moreover, if this was really such a hurdle, the brines can actually be dried and use to extract minerals like lithium and magnesium which are abundant is sea salt. The sodium chloride itself is a valuable chemical feedstock that is the common starting point for hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide which are two of the most widely used chemicals in the world and form the basis for a whole range of very useful items. If the process is operated on solar energy and the salts are processed into useful commodities then what's the problem?
I would say create a storage system, Clean water during the day and use it during the night. Like suggest Egyptians to take bath during the day, And other such habits so that less water is used at night.
It could be damaging in certain contexts but it doesn't have to be that way. Unfortunately, the Persian Gulf was one of the first places to move to industrial desalination and their situation is more like a salty lake than an ocean. Naturally, in a closed body of water the high salinity portion of the stream is going to accumulate and destroy living conditions.
