Thank you, that is the plan Monday. Unfortunately over the weekend many lawyers are not easily accessible, and I’d like to look into finding a reputable one, most hours usually consists Monday to Friday. I am curious as to whether this sounds like a case or not. I do not need to meet a lawyer on Reddit, just curious on options.
There's nothing wrong with asking, and the reluctance of people to answer isn't from a lack of desire to help.
It's just that in the case of malpractice (medical, legal, etc) the only safe answer is "It could be malpractice, but you need to talk to a lawyer".
Anyone who said "No, that's not malpractice" would be taking a risk. It's not bad to tell a person who has no case "you have no case". It's literally the worst thing possible, though, to say "you have no case" to someone who does. Telling someone who has no case "you totally have a case" is nowhere near as devastating as being the person who talked them out of pursuing a legitimate legal claim.
But there's another reason for the stock answer: if only for your peace of mind, if this troubling you you should talk to medical malpractice lawyer.
It’s fact specific on a legal and medical side. Someone is going to have to look over your medical files and see what should have happened and if what should have would have made a difference in outcome. You’d need to prove they deviated from standard of care or were negligent.
By the nature of these things lawyers usually give free consults so it’s no harm. And you have a long time so you don’t need to rush to find one today.
Tip for finding a lawyer, it’s like hiring any professional. If you or you know someone who has had a good experience with a lawyer get a recommendation from them. They will be able to find someone they’d trust.
