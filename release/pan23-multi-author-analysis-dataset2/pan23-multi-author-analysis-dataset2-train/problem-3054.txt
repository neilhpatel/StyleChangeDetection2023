Albanese has always had a hate-boner for Israel; or at the least, a lenhy history that would call her impartiality into question.
The only possible reason she would be named as the Special Rapporteur is if UN brass were seeking a predetermined outcome.
For those who aren't reading the article, the remark was that the Jewish lobby controls the United States foreign policy, and that the Europeans support Israel out of a sense of guilt for the Holocaust.
Scratch the surface of almost any Israeli political figure and you will find a raging anti-Muslim racist. Maybe give Palestine it's pre-1967 territory back, stop bombing them, stop razing their homes with bulldozers, stop right-wing settler violence, and allow full nationhood for Palestine and you may find "anti-semitism" drastically diminished.
It's crazy that you know every single israeli politician in the last 55 years ao well on a personal level, wow, just wild.
Or, keep being violent, hateful fascists and continue to piss and moan about "why do they hate us?" for the rest of eternity.
