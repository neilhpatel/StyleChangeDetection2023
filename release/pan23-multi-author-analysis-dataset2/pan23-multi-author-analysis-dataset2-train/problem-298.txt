Well, the answer is surprisingly personal, as in, in large part because Klemens von Metternich personally wanted it that way as part of maintaining the pre-Revolutionary balance of power because it was valuable if not essential to absolutist rule, and the European powers who had led the Sixth Coalition were more happy than not with his vision of European peace because the conservative victors of Waterloo who weren’t Austrian were 1. at their most liberal still only British constitutional monarchists who A. were still themselves aristocratic landed gentry and didn’t care for _too_ much democracy or bourgeois reform at home B. primarily cared about isolationism and wanted stalemate through balancef power on the continent because a balanced Europe prevented Britain from being dragged into wars or 2. just honest-to-god absolutists like Prussia and Russia worried about French-inspired populist revolution at home, given the events of the last 20 years. Metternich chaired the Congress of Vienna on behalf of Austria and was an aggressively, repressively anti-liberal who saw the necessity of cooperation among Europe’s monarchies to each maintain their individual dynasties in the face of bourgeois liberal revolution, or even liberal reform that would chip away at ancient (and proper) absolutist/monarchical rights to govern. (There are some who blame the First World War on Metternich because his maneuvering at the Vienna Congress and afterward to maintain Austrian absolutism and generally hold back the tide of liberal reform allowed or at least helped Austria to continue as a cultural patchwork rather than reforming along cultural, nationalist lines, nationalism being a co-product of bourgeois ideas of self-determination, self-governance, and ‘the state’, and it was the desire for Bosnian independence that led to Archduke Ferdinand’s assassination, which we all remember launched Europe’s web of defensive pacts).
To explain Metternich’s thinking, not in a divine-right-to-rule manner (which, I understand he believed in), but pragmatically, the simplest version is: a strong France was necessary and good to keep a strong Prussia in check, and a strong Prussia was necessary and good to keep a strong _Russia_ in check, and a strong _Russia_ was needed for their antics around the Caspian to keep the Ottoman Empire busy across two fronts to prevent them from entirely focusing on _Austria’s_ possessions in the Balkans. France’s territory had to go _somewhere_ if not to France, and that necessarily meant either strenhening someone else, probably Prussia or Austria, or engaging in the kind of artificial state/dynasty creation along the lines of the French Empire’s sister republics, and that had a slew of problems that were just harder to manage - the new dynasty would lack legitimacy and need support from other absolutists, and aside from still moving the fulcrum on which the entire mess of European monarchical regimes rested on, Metternich guessed (basically exactly correctly) that unless the threat were existential to the whole system of aristocratic government, as revolutionary and then Napoleonic France had been, most of the conservative governments (except Tsar Alexander of Russia) were pretty happy to abandon each other to fend for themselves - cf the Belgian Revolution that split the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Some rulers might’ve seen a shift in power as an opportunity for further Austrian gains, but history pretty well showed Metternich was correct in guessing that this particular genie of republican/populist/nationalist government and bourgeois reform/rule was particularly dangerous to hereditary privilege, would not go back in its bottle, and would only be kept away with active repression _and_ cooperation among aristocratic regimes, so anything which damaged the legitimacy of absolutist rule in _France_ would also lend itself to liberal/bourgeois revolution somewhere _else_ on the continent, so rather than open that Pandora’s box, it was safest to just... turn the clock back, and kind of pretend the whole thing, ie the last two decades, hadn’t happened, which included letting France remain a strong opponent to its victors with its borders, in addition to the ill-fated Bourbon Restoration.
"Vienna 1814" by David King is a fascinating book about the congress itself, and how the personal lives, personalities and beliefs of the major individuals involved shaped the ultimate outcome of negotiations. He spends a long time looking at Metternich, and the Austrian position as hosts of the congress.
