You've said you're concerned about violence if the other parties don't get their way and that you have no intention of letting them get their way. What point is there to meeting with them? Cancel the meeting, tell them you have no intention of giving them any amount of ownership of the house. If they get a lawyer to try and sue over ownership, get your own. But there's no sense in setting yourself up to get beat up or whatever, if that's your fear.
The deed to the house defines ownership. If your mom and aunt are on the deed then that is the current state of ownership.
If your mother's and aunt's estate haven't been probated yet, they need to be. And that probate probably calls for a lawyer in the the circumstances.
If your uncles want to try to unwind the last change in the deed to the house that would be their prerogative. In general arguing that someone exerted undue influence in a transaction 12 years ago would be a pretty big hill to climb. If they actually litigate that argument you may need a lawyer.
