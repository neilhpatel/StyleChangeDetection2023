They are angry that they were forced to get vaccinated but can still get COVID. They are not willing to listen to any explaination on how the vaccine works to reduce severity of the symptoms and to make the disease much more treatable. To them, vaccine must shield them 100% from ever contracting COVID otherwise it is snakeoil/scam. There is no way to explain the science to them or reason with them.
They still refuse to test before seeing people who are at high risk for fatality. So done trying to figure it out, the only thing that makes sense is that they are a party of undereducated, low effort narcissists.
