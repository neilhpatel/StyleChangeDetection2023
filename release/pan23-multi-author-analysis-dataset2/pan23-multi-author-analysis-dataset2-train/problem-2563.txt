my work is not entirely aware. They are aware that i take from time to time. Its been said "if you can take old equipment and make use of it, its better than going in the trash". so gray area i guess.
This really isn't a legal issue (yet) it's a business issue. You can decide what you want to do: refund him, don't refund him. Wait to see if you are sued, or not sued. Is your work aware that you are doing this? There's a difference, legally, between "destined for the trash" (or e-cycling) and "free to fix up and sell.".
Um... you are totally running a business. Also, are you reporting this income on your taxes? Because you have to, it's tax fraud/tax evasion if you do not.
Im not sure i understand what you mean when you say business issue, i dont exactly run a business doing this.
It's a business issue. If you are selling these computers as-is then he is taking on the risk. But he can always ask for a refund, and that's not unreasonable as a request. If he sued you in small claims court, you'll need to go and explain to the judge that the computers worked fine when you sold them, etc. The judge will decide if you have to pay him back.
