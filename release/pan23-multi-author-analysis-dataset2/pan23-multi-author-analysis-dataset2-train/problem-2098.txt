It's absolutely infuriating. He invaded them. Ukrainians are defending themselves. The entire war is his doing and he can call it off whenever he wants. If Putin brought his goddamn thugs home and declared the "totally not a war you guys" operation to be concluded, Ukraine wouldn't follow them into Russia. The only person who doesn't want peace is Putin himself.
Let Putin keep killing his army in an illegal war to occupy Ukraine. Let him keep destroying military hardware. At the end Russia will be completely unarmed by their own doing. And the question is for what? To steal resources from Ukraine? What was the reason for this invasion?
But if you dig deep enough, you can still find a pretty fair account of the situation from the anti-establishment left. Look at Noam Chomsky interviews since the war began. He thinks the American MIlitary Industrial Complex is corrupt as all hell, has a heavy influence on our media, and wants to keep this war going. That is not to say that the Kremlin are the good guys or that the war is "just". But it's a good place to start. The Jacobin Magazine is pretty fair as well.
Dearest cancer and aidsy cunt, Poostain, get yourself in a bin and then have someone throw you in the sea. I would like to sit next to you face to face and cough on you and then pray you have a slow and very very painful death. I would do this for any russian who supports what terror you are deploying so don't ever think you're special, you shit stain on humanity.
Ukraine has become an ally of "the west" and, as such, all mainstream western media that covers the war is literally propaganda. So you (and I) know very very little about what is actually happening. I's called the fog of war.
