Incidentally capturing a naked minor is not enough to make footage child pornography. Every once in a while some bright spark gets this idea and thinks that taking their top off in front of a security camera will mean that the footage can't be used as evidence of shoplifting, for example, only to discover that it doesn't work that way.
A prosecutor is unlikely to lay charges against your sister for anything related to the placement of those cameras if they're not in areas where you actually have an expectation of privacy, and if they're there with at least one resident's permission.
You have a reduced expectation of privacy in the common areas of your home, and an increased one in private spaces such as your bedroom and the bathroom. All else being equal, a resident could legally put up security cameras in the common areas; if you're aware of them and choose to jerk off there, that's on you. However, the fact that your sister doesn't live there could complicate this: does she have your parents' permission to put the cameras up?
Yeah, but literally nobody uses any of the rooms because my mom can’t move. So I feel like I have a heightened expectation of privacy in the front rooms, as they’re further from the only other person in the home. My mom is allowing her to do it.
You're free to take them down. Set them aside so that you can return them to your sister: they're still her property. Don't damage them - you may be civilly liable, at least in principle, though I doubt she'd sue over it.
Your mother is free to discipline you for it or to allow your sister to put them back up. So this probably isn't that productive.
Honestly, the most effective way to manage this would be to stay in your room or spend time out of your home, until you're old enough to move out and have your own place.
