Probably the very best way from your perspective is to setup the account yourself with you and your daughter on it, and allow them to make deposits to that account.
If they're not content to deposit into an account you setup, your choices would be to give them your daughter's SSN, or visit a bank with them to see if you can open the account together and whether your daughter's SSN would be exposed to or secure from them.
They say college but I don't want them having the SSN of my daughter because I don't want him trying to claim her on his taxes this coming year and getting the stimulus money or messing up my taxes, I have her full-time. He was extremely mentally and physically abusive so when it comes to him I just never know.
Again, that may not give grandmother the control she wants. Or the tax benefits she wants. And in that case youâ€™ll have to make a decision how willing you are to go forward.
That may not be what they're looking for. And it wouldn't be uncommon for grandparents or great grandparents to want to have the account in their name and that of their grandchild. And obviously in many family relationships that would be perfectly common and appropriate.
