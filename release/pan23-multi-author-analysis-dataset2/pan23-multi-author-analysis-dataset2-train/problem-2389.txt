At this point there's no chance Russia is succesful and this will likely end with Putin "removed" from power. He fucked up when he declared large swaths of land, Russia never even controlled, to be Russia. He also signed this annexation and technically this is Russia (to the Russians). There's no going back. Russia offers nothing in the negotiations, and wants to take everything. There's no off ramp, no way to win, and no way for Putin to come out alive. Russia will be fucked for a generation, and there's nothing they can do to stop this.
