You're asking about contemporary Russia, which is within the last 20 years. If you want to ask about population density in some previous century or period, you may rephrase and repost.
Excuse me but I don’t think the question can be specified for any time period, population growth takes a lot of time. Since I’m not well knowledged on the subject (hence why I am asking) I don’t which time period would be appropriate?
We don't allow "throughout time" questions. They're too broad, and tend to attract low-quality answers. Maybe you should focus on what you're really trying to figure out? Or maybe you want a more general Ask subreddit?
Sure, that question is fine. I will add that population and amount of arable land are not necessarily directly correlated, so the answer might not be quite what you expect.
I feel like questions relating to historical population interaction and agriculture can only be answered by proper historians. I really want to figure out why Russia’s density is so low for the amount of arable land it has.
Would “Why does France (10 million) have a higher population than Eastern Europe (8.5 million) in 1000AD despite Eastern Europe having much more arable land?” pass as a question? Does it follow the rules?
