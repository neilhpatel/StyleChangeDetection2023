Not only that, if he were intent on actually retaking these areas, he probably wouldn’t want to bomb the infrastructure. He only does that as a last resort “fuck you”. These strikes always seem retaliatory and happen more after significant Russian losses.
Alot of armchair generals here on Reddit who like to think they know better than actual generals waging war. Nothing is ‘obvious’, for all we know once Ukraine freezes Russia may reach some form of negotiations through their civillian infrastructure attacks.
Ignoring that there is historical precedent for bombing civilians doing fuck all to weaken support for the war. The Blitz on the UK and then the mass bomber strikes on Germany during WW2 did fuck and all to break the civilian population and that was wholesale carpet bombing, not, targeted strikes on infrastructure.
Then the total destruction of Ukrainian civilization is ensured, with Russia having nuke, Russian will take time to destroy the country. Many countries comes and go, what make you think it is over when the history said otherwise?
