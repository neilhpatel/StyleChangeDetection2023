While the embedded link is an interesting read, the authors completely ignore the how of how our current political situation happened, completely ignoring gerrymandering, voter caging, voter intimidation, and all the other voter suppression techniques the Republican Party uses with great frequency and usually with great results (for them). There are more citizens in the US that identify as Democrats or leaning democratic, but due to all the methods Republicans use to squash the will or desire of the voters, conservative voters have more input on elections than their numbers should allow. Couple that with the fact that a large number of conservative voters are grossly uninformed (fact: people who only watch Fox News know less about political issues than those who don't watch any news at all), and conservative voters allow themselves to be manipulated via emotional tropes and other supposed "issues" that rarely impact their daily lives, and this leads to getting outrageous candidates like MTG, Bobert, Gatez, Gomert and the others of the idiotocracy elected.
Yes we do, but we're stuck in a cycle where the only way to change the House or any of the system is to overwhelmingly win in the system itself with a huge Dem majority while the GOP has gamed the system via gerrymandering to keep themselves competitive in the House. So we're basically trapped with it as it is.
