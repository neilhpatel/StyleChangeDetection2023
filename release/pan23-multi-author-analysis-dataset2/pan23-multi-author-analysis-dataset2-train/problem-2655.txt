Sorry. I understand your hunger, though. I'd actually eat lunch if it looked like lunch in South Korea or Japan. I actually skipped lunch in school, because the food was so awful. I'd just go into the computer lab and hang out, and I'd refuse to go to the cafeteria to eat, because school lunch made me vomit. I think that's why I can only eat two times per day.
Yes. It also helps children be able to eat daily, and that helps their education levels. Other countries feed their kids freely (and much more nutritionally), and their higher education scores are reflected in that. Republicans most certainly seem to always clamor for better test scores, and yet they don't care about doing anything to help kids improve in school. They actually delight in seeing kids do worse, in reality.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
