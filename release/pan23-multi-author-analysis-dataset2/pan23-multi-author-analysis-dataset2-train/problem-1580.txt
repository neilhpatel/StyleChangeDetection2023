Only if the house cat is scared of humans from being abused by them, it has not been my experience after petting and playing with hundreds of cats in my life.
It was supposed to be my cat, I was nice to it, I was gentle. I left it alone when it didn't want to be disturbed.
Cut to a few years later, I couldn't even enter the house if mum wasn't home. It put me in hospital, twice. Once by severing a vein in my foot when I walked past it. The other time it left a claw in my leg which went unnoticed until the area started going green.
Out of hundreds of house cats in my life ive never met one before that attacks you without any provocation at all. Nor did I hear of anybody in my life that has been put into the hospital by them, even though house cats are very common here. Almost every day I meet a stranger's house cat or two in my town and pet them. Your story sounds unlikely or there's more to it.
If I understood the article right, they found that the Pallas cat was in the park by taking DNA analysis of its shit.
