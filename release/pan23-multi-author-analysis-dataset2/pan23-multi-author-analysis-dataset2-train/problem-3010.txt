That would be London, Ontario, with 86.4% of all condos currently owned by investors. I went to a sales office to look into buying a new condo there in 2019. While I was there, some asshole in a G550 AMG rolled in and bought 40 of them all at once. He was an agent for an investment hedge. He asked me if I was putting down a deposit. I said I just had and he offered me $25,000 plus my deposit back to sign it over to him. Some investor-owners are just one person looking to buy a second property to rent out. But many others are these funds with so much fucking cash that they can do shit like this agent I saw was doing, and it’s just another Tuesday for them.
Many landlords are only renting short term to resell for a profit when market changes. Some might be feeling bite of interest rates. Some been complaining they can’t afford to do this short term thing anymore due to costs.
Either way these short term landlords playing a type of stock market sales but with houses are the worse. No fault evictions for their tenants who they barely make repairs for. Also they try to do work on homes for less. Which takes money away from businesses who do fittings or supplies for houses (as long term owners of homes put more money into home improvement).
