The not-insane rational part of me is excited that more people can be protected from COVID, disease sucks chunks, and I am glad more people can be protected.
The tribal lizard brain part of me doesn't like that China is getting anything for free, considering Beijing's treatment of Uyghurs and Honk Kong, not to mention it's affinity to Russia and non-stop threats to Taiwan.
It's more about the fact that China wasn't transparent about covid with the US. They imprisoned (and even killed) doctors who spoke out about it in the early days (Chen Qiuishi being one of them)... Fuck China, yet this doesn't surprise me given the political climate in Germany. Those bastards didn't even want to help Ukraine til recently.
They say that forgetting Germany was the one of the 1st to send any type of "military" aid iirc. The helmets mainly...which honestly they sent more helmets than what russia could issue to their troops I bet lmao.
Lmao, fuck off with the killing doctors bullshit. Itâ€™s enough to say they imprisoned them, but you lose all credibility with your bullshit propaganda.
