This person being a felon shouldn't be an issue. Living there without being on the lease might be an issue. What does the lease say about that, and when does the lease expire?
Second, does you lease specifically ban subletting. This may or may not be relevant based on your state. Sometimes landlords will throw things into you lease even if they are non-enforceable because most renters don’t know their rights, won’t know that the thing is non-enforceable and so will follow the rules for fear of punishment. So just because it’s in the lease it doesn’t mean you are necessarily bound to it. But it may be important.
All of these factors will play into the situation. My guess is that if you have been living there for 9 months and they were there before you, that’s a long time for someone to live somewhere without the landlord knowing. My guess is that the landlord knows at least to some extent. The people with the most liability are the original person who allowed the felon to move in and the felon themself. You have some complicity, but I doubt even in the worst case scenario that anyone would come after you for any reason. If you are all profiting from the felon living there, the landlord may be able to seek some monetary recourse from anyone who profited from the felon subletting or squatting.
3, is the felon paying rent and if so what is happening to the rent money they are paying? Is it more than their fair share (ie is someone or all of the other tenants making a profit on them being there)?
4, is the house being rented on a per room basis or is there a single lease for a set amount of time with all of the tenants on it? In other words, is there one sent amount for rent each month for the whole house or does each tenant pay the landlord their individual amount each month?
