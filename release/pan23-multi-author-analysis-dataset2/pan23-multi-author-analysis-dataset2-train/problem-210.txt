I printed out a lot of texts about him talking about his brother paying him, but there’s no mention of me at all. There’s also several messages and at least one voicemail of him flipping out bc I kept blocking him because he wouldn’t stop harassing me about the kids. The kids that he’s never met and that his brother is accused of abusing, he claims to have no idea why I don’t want his family in my life.
I have talked to my attorney about a restraining order, she basically told me to just keep gathering evidence and then if he pulls anything after this I should have enough to get it done. But she’s family law, not small claims, so she can’t be here for me for this one.
I want to concur with the other commenter. There likely isn't a case for him to sue you successfully. Your ex might be another story, depending on what's in writing, though coercion might change this in the eyes of a judge (given that this occurred after this person made threats).
It sounds like you have a lot of evidence in your court. It's wildly unlikely they'll be able to sue you successfully. Based on the fact that your ex eventually agreed strongly signifies coercion, especially because of the texts and voicemail.
