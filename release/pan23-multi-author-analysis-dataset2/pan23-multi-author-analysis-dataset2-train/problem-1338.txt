what part of it is common, i dont wanna get scamed again? the story just felt so specific, like they had reasons i was doing thing the way they had me doing them. i feel like an idiot!
And there is no reason they couldn't pay for their own movers. Anything that makes no sense why they would pay you to do it, is a scam.
The common part is that this scam has been around for over 20 years and happens to people whether they are selling cars, household items, animals or people that get "hired" by jobs that are too good to be true (secret shopping, wrapping your car for advertising, assistants that are sent money to purchase gift cards). There is never any reason for a stranger to send someone too much money.
I used to breed and show rabbits for 4-H more than 20 years ago and would have people email offering to buy an entire litter for hundreds over what I was asking - same scam back then, too.
There is a scammer halfway around the world who is now richer due to pulling off this scam. You will have to pay the bank back. You have absolutely no recourse here and will have to chalk this up as a life lesson.
