Whether or not Jews (such as myself) actually fit the definition of a race is immaterial in this instance. The Nazis treated us like we were a separate race and persecuted us for it.
She's neglecting to consider the fact that Naziism was predicated on the notion that the so-called Aryan Race was superior: the "master race".
And Jews couldn't simply convert to get out of persecution. If it was a religious persecution then conversion would end the persecution. However, with the Nazis even having a Jewish grandparent was enough to send a person to the camps. Heck, they'd even measure people's noses and send them away because they thought "long nose = Jew.".
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
