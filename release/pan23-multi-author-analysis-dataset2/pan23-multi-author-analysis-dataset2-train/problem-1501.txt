Of all of the terrible things he does and believes, I think wanting Jews to be able to visit holy sites in their own country freely isn't one of them.
When the person visiting believes in violating land treaties and taking away more Palestinian territory, furthering their oppressionâ€¦.I can see their anger. Come on now.
The two situations are nothing alike. Ukraine never attacked Russia or used its territory to attack Russia. Russia invaded unprovoked and occupied a soverign countries territory, a thing they promised they would never do if Ukraine gave up its nukes in the 90s which it did. Israel did not come to occupy the West Bank unprovoked. The West Bank was invaded and annexed by Jordan and used to attack Israel multiple times and Jordan eventually lost. Israel has been left holding the bag that Jordan created ever since. Israel cannot just leave the West Bank without a peace agreement, it would turn out just like Gaza and become a terrorist safe haven used to attack Israel. Learn some fucking history.
Wait how was Israel created again? Kind of... Unexpectedly? Maybe creating an ethnostate out of thin air in a historically unstable region was a bad idea?
You should do yourself a favor and learn the history of the region and Israel. Israel was at the very least half a century in the making and that only covers the Zionist movement, in reality it goes back millennia.
