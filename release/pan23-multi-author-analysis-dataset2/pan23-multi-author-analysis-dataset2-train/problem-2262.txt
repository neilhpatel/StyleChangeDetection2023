They wanted me to follow up with a gastroenterologist but he was going to perform a colonoscopy, and I was told with my condition that very easily could have been fatal.
Yes he had seen me in the hospital and was well aware of my diagnosis at the time, and what all was wrong with me.
It sounds like your condition needed a colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. If you didn’t complete the recommended diagnostic test then how could preventative treatment be started? Insurance will not cover preventative meds for conditions like inflammatory bowel disease without documentation of disease, not to mention that several such meds affect the immune system. Clinicians won’t prescribe them without clear evidence.
Seek the opinion of a med mal attorney, but you basically have Dr. A and Dr. B having different opinions on a case.
They ultimately got the biopsy needed when you had a rupture and they removed colon. That biopsy could have come during a colonoscopy.
The gastro I saw in th second hospital I went to told me if I had gotten a colonoscopy it could have been fatal if anything got torn or the abscesses we're ruptured.
My condition only needed a CT scan in the second hospital, not to mention I don't have IBS or ibd or any other bowel disease, I was told the piece taken out of me was tested and they found no markers for anything.
I also had a blood test done in the hospital and was told something similar although it's not 100% accurate.
