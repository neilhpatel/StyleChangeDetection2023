Personally, I would say talk to Luke more. If he is a freshmen and gay and already dealing with a history of bullying the last thing he may want is someone else fighting his battles for him and making him seem like more of a child and a gay who needs to be protected from the world. Talk to him, become friends and see his perspective and where he is coming from, why he doesn't want to make an issue out of it. IF he is just scared of repercussions then that would be a reason to go ahead without his permission as fear of backlash is not a reason for inaction.
Because the NCAA prohibits this behavior under their broad anti-hazing policy, and the coach needs to be notified that they need to enforce their anti-hazing policy.
The NCAA recognizes that it is contrary to the purpose of student athletics and is therefore an issue of concern for them and their stakeholders (partner schools).
At the very least it could be advised to read the athlete code of conduct/hazing policy to see whether a bystander report or confidential reporting is available for anti-hazing/bullying purposes.
