Obviously you need a criminal defense attorney. You also need medical care, have you been recently diagnosed with brain damage? Do you have a social worker from the hospital?
Montana I was at the ER in my city for 8 hours and I had to go home to take care of my child. I will try to go again tomorrow to get written proof for brain damage. I’ve lost 80% of my vision and I keep passing out blacking out and not being able to remember the time and date without looking. Thank you for the advice given.
Would you suggest telling them about the laced joint? I’m sure they drug tested me upon intake but I don’t want to incriminate myself further so I have said nothing about it. I was incoherent and unable to remember anything so they would have had to know.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
I would never suggest holding back information from one's doctor. And legally speaking, you wrote "on what tested to be fentanyl" so that's apparently already known by whoever tested it, the police and/or hospital.
