You can almost certainly make a worker's compensation claim, assuming you work in the United States. Generally speaking you can't sue your employer for workplace injuries unless the employer was grossly negligent. That's what workers compensation is for.
You need to file a workers comp claim asap. Who do you actually work for, does Amazon sign your checks, or a subcontractor? Whoever it is, file a workers comp claim with them, or the state. Which state are you in?
CA. And no I don't work for actual Amazon, it's a delivery service provider. Everyone is saying to file for workers comp but what I want to know is of the apartment complex can be held liable for having nearly invisible speed bumps. Amazon or my actual employer had no actual fault in this besides it's just where I work. Workers comp is like pay you get from being out of work due to injury though right? Or am I mistaken?
