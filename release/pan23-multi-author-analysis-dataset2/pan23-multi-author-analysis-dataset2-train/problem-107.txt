Its like having a house where the children are abused, and they decide to throw a fancy dinner party, inviting family and other children. The children who come will be allowed to behave however they want with no consequences, but the ones who live there know that if they participate, they will be abused once the guests leave. Why would you go to that dinner party at all?
It's not quite the same. Russia actually did a pretty brilliant job on the PR front for both the world cup and the Winter Olympics. Most of the press and coverage was positive for the country and most of the visitors reported having a really good time. The police backed off, the locals were friendly, it went exactly as an authoritarian state looking to sport wash would want. After that though.....
This is a great comment actually. I've never really understood the sportwashing, but this makes a lot of sense. It's not, look West we are just as good as you, it's look Arabia, we are also up to your standards.
Yemen, Iran, Brunei, Mauritania, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates, Pakistan.
Edit: To answer comments yes all these countries are Muslim majority. And as an American who is an immigrant from a Muslim majority country yes the religion is generally antagonistic to gays and non believers. Although most other religions (including Judaism and Christianity) aren't very gay friendly either.
