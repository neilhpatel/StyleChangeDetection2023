In the hopefully impossible scenario where Russia actually descends into a multilateral civil war, does NATO have any kind of plan to deal with that? Like that's a lot of nuclear devices just suddenly not being kept tabs on.
Yes NATO has plans for this and almost any other scenario you could imagine. The US has even brought in fiction writers in the past to help them imagine possible scenarios like this. That doesn't mean it will be easy no matter how prepared NATO is.
It's been reported that the US has engaged in back channel discussions with China over the same issue. This isn't something either side would openly admit to, so it's hard to judge the credibility of any of these reports. Look into this for yourself, and make your own determinations. This type of cooperation on nuclear weapons is normal, so I believe this to likely be true.
In the process you will possibly find other interesting details of alleged conversations between the US and China. Some of the other reported discussions between the US and China pretty inflammatory, but others are comforting if true. Its impossible to fact check some of these claims, so just be careful with this rabbit hole.
IIRC the "zombie" plan is a politically correct way to say "an infectious disease that's so bad we'll shoot the infected on sight".
