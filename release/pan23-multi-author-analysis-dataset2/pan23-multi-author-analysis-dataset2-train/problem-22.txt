It wouldn't be a surprise if Bayer is doing this. After all, this is the company that knowingly sold HIV tainted medicine to people rather than lose money by destroying the batch.
I'm not saying pesticides play no role, but your source says climate change and habitat destruction are by far the most important causes.
Bayer owns Monsanto. They decided to join together their houses to make one consolidated empire of evil.
By continuing their push on questionable insecticides and similar chemicals, they gain by wiping out farms that are not in their own system.
From the abstract: "millions of acres of tropical forest are cleared each year (, ), atmospheric CO2 levels are at their highest concentrations in more than 3 million y (), and climates are erratically and steadily changing from pole to pole".
What I said is that in absence of natural pollination in the field, farmers will have to depend on whatever solution Monsanto offers. Including many of their agricultural products that don't need pollination.
