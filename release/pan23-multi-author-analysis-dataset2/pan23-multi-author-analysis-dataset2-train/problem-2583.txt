If you’re a liberal, or generally on the left like me, you’re gonna have a face a difficult decision. As much as you may personally hate guns, or want substantial changes to gun ownership in this country, which I agree with most gun regulations proposed, you’re gonna have to decide whether it’s necessary to own a gun and begin training in firearm usage. Cause the crazies are getting bolder, and soon enough, the dems won’t be enough and we can’t trust the government to protect our lives anymore. Your life matters, so it isn’t controversial to say do what you must to make sure you’re alive at the end of the day.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
