Hungary is as much afraid of Russia as all the other neighboring countries. They just also really like to piss of the rest of the EU.
Well, due to helping Russia so much Hungary has been rewarded by having their main oil pipeline destroyed today in the bombardments (it's in Ukraine). Since I really heavily doubt Ukraine will send anyone to repair it anytime soon (and odds of Russia doing so are even lower) - the whole country is going to be utterly screwed within next month or two.

That must be it. Orban is not a stupid guy, he plays his own people like fiddle and it works. I suppose at the end of the day whether the country manages to climb out of it’s decline or not he’ll still be sitting on a big pile cash, he just better hope it ain’t all in forints, they worthless .
It's more playing no sides than both sides, while still demanding protection from one side against the other.
