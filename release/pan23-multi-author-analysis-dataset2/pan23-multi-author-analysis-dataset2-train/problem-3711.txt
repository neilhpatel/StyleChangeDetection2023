Why would you refuse entry? Just because you are unhappy with the way it was posted? Tomorrow the landlord will be on here asking about tenants not allowing inspectors in. Not letting them in can only make your life harder unless you have some legitimate reason to not want them in.
I will allow them in, im just asking about the legal side. Because what if something similar happens again when I'm away? I don't want ppl in my apartment without my knowledge.

The best action would be to then follow up with the landlord/manager and ask if there is something like an email distribution, or another way you could receive notifications that may be be preferred.
That's why you follow up and ask if there is, or kindly suggest there be, some sort of direct notification such as an email blast. Your concern isn't unreasonable.
