Thank you for the advice. The furnace is undersized, but not by much and the city inspector did say they matched up to an acceptable standard. The auxiliary drain pipe is what's missing in this situation and so the water is just staying in my basement. I have called the owner and am waiting for his response.
It starts to seem there's a lot of reason to wonder what's going on here. Are you sure you're working with the licensed contractor and not a rogue employee?
Yes they are a licensed company with a website. They are on Homeadvisor and the BBB. They say that Lennox is not currently making my furnace unit to keep up with AC demand at the start of the summer since no one is using their furnace. I have called them this morning and am waiting for the owner to call me back. I am recording everything from here on out and hopefully they will fix everything without me having to take the next step. Thank you for the advice.
2. If the installer did something wrong and that wrong caused you loss, you'd likely be entitled to recover that loss.
