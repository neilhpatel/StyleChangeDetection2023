Is there any other information listed on the paystub? A software logo or watermark or anything like that?
My first assumption would be it's user override regular pay, which sounds like something related to the payroll software.
What did your boss say it was when you asked? And is your pay correct according to how many hours you worked and what your hourly rate is?
Yes, my pay looks correct. And when we ask, he just says he doesn't know and is looking into it. He hasn't told us what it is and we found this issue like 2-3 weeks ago. I have no idea what it could be/mean.
Sure. Do you have multiple rates of pay? Like maybe you get a certain amount for doing deliveries, and a different amount for waitress work, or something like that? It might be related to that if so.
No, we all get payed the same even if we are doing other things. Personally, I answer phones, do the register, help with dine In, and sometimes help cut our pizzas, but I get payed the same, 11 per/hr.
As far as I know, our boss pays some guy we don't know to deal with our checks. I've been told that the people who do it are often changed alot. And we have no idea who does it.
