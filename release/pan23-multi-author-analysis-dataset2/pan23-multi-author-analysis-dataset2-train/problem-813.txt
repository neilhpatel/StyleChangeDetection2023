The difference it makes is that most employers have a legal obligation to accommodate disabilities and religious needs, but no obligation to accommodate personal preference. Being asked to choose between your wants and your needs is not fair, but it's not illegal in Illinois.
The difference is Illinois is an at will state and they can fire you for any reason that isn't a protected class. Religious or medical exemption could be one of those reasons, but from your responses that isn't the case. So yes they can fire you, you could attempt to sue, but would not win.
So you don't think an employer should be free to fire workers who don't follow their rules? You want the government to step and and dictate how the employer runs their private business?
I mean sure, you can first waste money and time suing and losing, and then either get vaccinated or get fired.
Edit: Cancer actually would be a pretty good reason, as most cancer treatments seriously compromise your immune system and make vaccinations unreasonably risky, but it's not the only good reason. An allergy to the vaccine or to its substrate would be a more common example of a reason you can't receive it.
