Sexual harassment is harassment based on sex -- which can include a gay man making an unnecessary stink about a woman exercising because he doesn't like how she goes about it.
This entire situation sounds like a minor miscommunication that got blown entirely out of proportion because you have a massive chip on your shoulder. Your fixation on people being "female" "black" "latino" and so on like you've been watching too many legal shows doesn't help.
There is no "defamation" going on here. You have suffered no harm -- and any you could claim to have suffered has long since become at least mostly attributable to your histrionics. Calm down.
And, until you have become the recipient of serious allegations and have done nothing wrong, please do not tell me to calm down.
Those descriptives are merely to characterize individuals because I did not or do not know their names. Nothing more than that. I date only men of color so that blows your hypothesis out of the water. Nice try...
I am sorry that you have such a large chip on your shoulder. I hope for your sake and for that of the people (especially the women) in your life, you find some way to move past whatever hurt you so much.
You aren't legally entitled to the first two, and since there has been no injustice, there's no "justice" you're entitled to either.
