My god, it's finally happened. We've found a credible allegation of vote fraud committed by a Democrat. It's only taken a few years and many dozen instances of vote fraud by Republicans, but we finally have one. Hot damn.
Fair point. I'm assuming based on what I saw at a quick googling that he's probably a D. He's black, the son of a civil rights lawyer, and he voted in the D primary. That makes me think he probably is a D. But you're right that it's not completely certain.

As a Democrat, let me say that these allegations should be investigated fully, and if Turner is guilty, he should be punished to the full extent of the law.
