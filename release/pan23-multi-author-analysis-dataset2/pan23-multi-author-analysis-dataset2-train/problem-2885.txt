Dude won't understand that the sacrifice of a soldier man or woman as is the case here is worth the twenty or more lives of those too vulnerable to fight. It is not a sacrifice or math anyone here can calculate, it is their math to do when they VOLUNTEER. There is a very Chinese push to equate giving up with the greatest preservation of life. They don't understand that russia intended to shoot every strong minded Ukrainian, which is most of the country. They wanted to replace Ukrainians with cowed russians, sending those of strong will and "valuable" into siberia to be broken for a few generations. Aka... genocide.
Either way, the official numbers won't be revealed until after this sick war is over. I see every day that Russian numbers are posted but any reference to Ukraine's losses is almost always removed or corrected. I am not saying they are lying but in every war/era there is a media narrative as well. At the end, its the people fighting and families who are losing, these numbers are just numbers to most people not realizing each number has their own story and life to tell about.
