Hey guys, just want to warn everyone here that New Jersey law is both relatively unique in the United States and is EXTREMELY tenant-friendly. There are a number of non-lawyers in this comment section giving advice for other states which is likely inapplicable in NJ.
Unless the landlord is brand new or clinically insane, they are heavily incentivized to avoid a NJ judge. I've successfully used this as leverage in the past.
Yes thank you. This needs to be a sticky on every NJ landlord/tenant post. Generic advice for the US simple does not apply to NJ in a majority of cases.
I came here knowing to take the advice I would get with a grain of salt, so Iâ€™ve been trying to do that especially for the less optimistic commenters. Can you elaborate on my situation and what you think the outcome would be if she actually tried to enforce a higher rent?
Unfortunately, I only know enough to know what I don't know here - the particular pieces that I'm seeing are wrong the top voted comment (what the clause around termination means is actually related to just cause termination and is NOT a reason to break a lease mid-lease) and the people who are saying "if it's in his lease she can do whatever she wants" (it appears to be superseded by NJ case law).
