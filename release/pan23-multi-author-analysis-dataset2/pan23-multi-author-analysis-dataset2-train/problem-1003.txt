Private companies typically have the ability to block sales of shares (more often, they have to proactively approve them). But the Board also has a fiduciary duty to shareholders, and you are a shareholder. Keep all documentation regarding your share ownership, and all communications regarding potential sales. You will need to talk to a lawyer with expertise in Delaware commercial/business law. A phone/zoom consultation is worth your time and whatever small cost it entails. The lawyer should be able to tell you whether or not the company is potentially violating your rights.
Often times the shareholder agreement includes "right of first refusal". Sometimes this means that the company can buy the shares on the same terms as the proposed sale or let you sell to the third party. Sometimes it means other things.
Thank you for your insight on this. I've kept all documents and communications, and had not considered the fiduciary duty. The bit about it being commercial/business law is also very helpful because I didn't know what expertise to look for.
You should try to obtain a copy of your options agreement and or your shareholder agreement and consult a lawyer.
If the company made a commitment to sell to you and you have proof that the sale was in the pipeline, you can sue them for specific relief. This is not legal advice.
Thanks for the insight. I understand it does not constitute legal advice. I had not consider that suing for relief might be an avenue to look into. Will get a lawyer ASAP.
I had a buyer that the company did not want, and they picked another buyer of their own choice. Then the company drafted the stock transfer documents and send them over for review. Before sending the finalised stock transfer documents, the company threatened me with blocking the sale and gave me the option to sell to the company at <30% of the value listed in the drafted documents.
