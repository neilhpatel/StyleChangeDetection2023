If you weren't investigated for DUI at the time of the collision, and a forensic blood sample was not taken from you in the hospital, then no tests taken weeks afterwards could be legally relevant.
I wouldn't expect police to try to blackmail you by arresting you for DUI or drug possession because of an auto collision claim, but I don't know your police. In general, when in a dispute with police, do your best not to commit crimes.
This was only a few weeks ago: is there really a lawsuit and trial involved ? Is the driving officer being charged with a crime, or are you anticipating litigating against the police agency instead of allowing insurers to handle the costs ?
They are not admitting fault and refuse to give info of their own insurance. They are also holding the incident report and will not let me get a copy. I plan on getting a lawyer to help resolve all this, and I only needed to know if smoking could allow them to turn this around on me somehow.
