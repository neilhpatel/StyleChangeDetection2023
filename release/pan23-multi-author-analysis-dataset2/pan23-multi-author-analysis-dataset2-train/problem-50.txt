What you are describing doesn't sound like an eviction notice, it sounds like it's a 60-day notice of the landlord's intent to terminate your Granny's tenancy.
Regardless as to whether or not that notice is going to be effective, if the church owns the home then they can get her out, absent a lease that says otherwise.
Then this largely comes down to a church governance issue. If the pastor has, within the organization, the authority to decide how the church's assets should be used, then he can issue eviction notices for tenants living on church property. The church is bound to any leases in effect and any other long-running interests, but there's nothing else in Arkansas law that would give your grandparents the right to continue living on the church's property otherwise.
Did they just allow your grandparents to live there or did they actually give them the house/have it titled in their names?
End of the day if the church wants her to go they can end the tenancy and evict, presuming the church owns the land and no governing body determines the use of the land.
They potentially need to provide a properly worded notice, but she will not be able to prevent them from terminating her tenancy. They are currently giving her more time than would be required by default, assuming she doesn't have a current term lease.
Normally, she would have 30 days unless the lease said otherwise. Needs to start looking for a new place to live ASAP.
