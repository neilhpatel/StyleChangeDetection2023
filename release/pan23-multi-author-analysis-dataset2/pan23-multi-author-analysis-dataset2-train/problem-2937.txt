You have two issues here. The intrusion on your land is one - and probably the more straightforward of the two to address. Have the dirt removed from your land.
But you also have a huge secondary issue here that might be even more important - the neighbor filled in a shared culvert that's vital to proper drainage near your property. Even if the culvert portion is entirely on the neighbor's property, if he fills that in you could have flooding issues in the future. So you not only need to have the dirt removed from your property, you may also need to get the dirt removed from his if it's changing the drainage pattern. It won't help you much to fix your side if his side remains filled in and now all the water dumps into your yard or backs up.
So when you're talking to code enforcement or an attorney, you also want to discuss the issue of the neighbor filling in shared, permitted (probably mandated and legally protected) drainage to ensure the dirt is all removed from the culvert, no matter whose property the culvert is on.
First things first just address it with the contractors, contact their office and explain the situation, and tell them it needs to be restored. They should not give you any trouble about it, things like this happen in fencing and minor yard work all the time.
Take photos to document everything and keep the police report and all evidence long term. This neighbor is likely to become a troublesome neighbor again in the future.
