Don’t ATMs just connect to the various banking systems though ? Whereas by its nature NOTAM information is spread and fed / updates across a massive number of systems ? It’s not so much that the system itself is “down” it’s that without the notification system working then planes could stray into dangerous situations.
I had a feeling that ATC system failure was a dry run for a bigger attack. My government denies that it was caused by bad actors but would you believe the words of a son of a dictator? Pretty sure it was China or Russia.
It's just Filipino-ism for telling times from the past. Normally it works for last January, last week, last Friday. Unfortunately the mistake is that most think it applies to specific dates as well, hence this error 🤷.
ATM is also Air Traffic Management 😅 I didn't read about the NOTAMs being the issue. AIM is a different topic to the core ATM system, being more exposed (there are B2B entry / exit points), but still they are very limited and heavily monitored. I still think that the most likely cause is a bug or a failure in the infra.
