IANAL. They have no authority over you, especially if you never return. Several things concern me: access to the DMV database to obtain your name and address information (may be legal in that state, but still sketchy), and issuing enforceable citations is a government/law enforcement thing. If the roads are publicly owned, then they are totally off base and you should report this to the government that owns the roads, if they're private roads that's a different story, and there may be some consent issues.
Okay, they likely scanned your driver's license and photographed your license plate as you went through the guardpost. If you signed anything going in you probably consented to all of their traffic rules and enforcement decisions. This could end up being a contractually valid penalty.
I don't know how actively they're going to pursue this, I've seen smaller debts handed over to debt collectors.
Did you hand over your license to the person at the gate? If so, you did so voluntarily. They are free to record that info and take pictures of you and your license plate.
I'm not sure what invasion of privacy you are referring to. You could have refused and not entered, but you chose to do so.
