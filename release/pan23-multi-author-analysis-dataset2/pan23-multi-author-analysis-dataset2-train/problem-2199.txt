Brain injuries and PTSD are almost specialties within the PI industry because the knowledge and access to experts required to litigate those cases takes a lot of effort and time to acquire. Most will also have experience with life-care plans to provide guidance with your settlement or verdict to ensure the funds are spent on years of treatment and therapy instead of jet skis and Mustangs.
How expensive do you think treating a traumatic brain injury will be for the rest of your lifetime? Probably more than getting a second, third, fourth etc opinion on actionability from personal injury lawyers.
NAL From my experience with PI attorneys, many only take low hanging fruit car crash or obvious negligence cases. Challenging cases get turned away all the time because they don't immediately see how they can get a win and money. This doesn't reflect on them as attorneys, but more so on their firm as a business. They have salaries and bills to pay like any other business. Don't let one attorney discourage you from getting the financial help you need.
