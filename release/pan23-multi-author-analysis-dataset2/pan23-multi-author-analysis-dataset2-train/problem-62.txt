The traitors in the GOP are trying to normalize the idea of abrogating the Constitution and all of the protections it entails. Make no mistake, if these fascists steal power again they will gleefully abolish the rights enshrined in the Constitution, and elsewhere, in order to ensure they stay in power and prevent continued democracy. Anyone familiar with Hitlerâ€™s rise, or the ascendancy of any other violent fascist movement in history, will recognize this and appreciate the grave, horrific danger posed by these RepubliKKKan filth.
