If I'm not mistaken, they usually will put you on court supervision depending on your driving record and won't report the citation to the state. Your insurance probably won't find out if you successfully complete court supervision and they'll keep the citation from the state. Is it a State of Illinois vs. You or a City of Such-and-Such vs. You case?
Sure, although that conversation will more likely be with the assistant prosecutor in the courtroom. Not the judge. You may be more likely to get this result if you hire a traffic attorney to handle. There is like a standard deal the local prosecutor offers on citations like this where there is a clean record.
I don’t know how things work in the specific courtroom you will be in. When you get there find someone who appears to work there and ask who you need to talk to about your case. If there are any officers in the room they will know who you should talk to.
I’ve got no clue I haven’t gone to trial yet because I haven’t decided my plead yet. I’m gonna guess it’s either the city or county though. Is court supervision or traffic safety school something I’m able to request from the judge or be like, “if I plead guilty, can I get court supervision or traffic safety school?” to the judge?
