The manufacturer can hire an attorney to sue you here in the US. Of course, we can't tell you whether you committed the claimed violation or how likely it is that they'd pursue it.
If you used their photo instead of your own it is probably a copyright infringement; next time take your won picture and use it.
I would check and make sure the letter came from an actual lawyers office first (google the name of the firm / lawyer). Did they list specific legal expenses they want you to pay? I.e. $$$ dollars? Or just threaten to do so.
The usual advice is that unless / until you are actually served you donâ€™t do anything. Many people threaten to sue very few would. I think international stuff like this is hard to file / enforce.
Yes, they have specified an amount. The seller/manufacturer seems to be trying to recoup the money spent on legal expenses. To me, that makes it seem like this action is meant, initially, to be cautionary. It seems bizarre to pay lawyers and only try to recoup your legal expenses rather than seek damages.
