If you go into court and try to tear into a cop for being new to his job when you clearly violated the law, prepare to have this backfire spectacularly. How new the cop is doesn’t matter, you drove the wrong way down a one way. Your best chance would to be to try to argue that the signage wasn’t clear.
I would go to the street take pictures and video showing that there was insufficient signage. Bring them with you on your court date. Maybe you will get a sympathetic judge.
Baring that maybe you could ask for traffic school. You will still have to pay court cost but it will keep it off your record.
In order to fight it you would have to say not guilty. Just keep in mind you may have to comeback for a trial. I am not sure how they do things in Bama. Either way bring your evidence with you and be prepared to go.
Take pictures and video of the whole route taken to show there are no signs/markings that would indicate you were turning into one-way street and challenge a ticket. Chance is probably 50/50 depending on the judge.
I've listened to a traffic trial for kicks. It would seem that when the judge calls your name, you say guilty or not guilty or guilty with reason. Which do I say? Or do I just start talking?
