If Musk just decided to do this on his own then it's all on him and nothing but a dick move. It's not his role to conduct foreign policy on behalf of the United States. Literal interference with military operations.
“Suddenly”? Musk has been adamant about his support of Russia. He talked about Ukraine going to the negotiating table with Russia when there is literally zero negotiations to be had. Musk threatened to pull access to Starlink months ago. In America, he publicly sided with those who said Russia was warranted in their actions of invasion. After buying Twitter, he has had a narrative that democrats who support Ukraine, violated laws by contacting Twitter to violate free speech when what happened is the White House were the ones who violated the first amendment when Trump was in office and he’s been spreading false information and propaganda about Ukraine. And as the CEO of Twitter, he has allowed false information to be spread on Twitter some of which was sensitive to the war efforts in Ukraine.
