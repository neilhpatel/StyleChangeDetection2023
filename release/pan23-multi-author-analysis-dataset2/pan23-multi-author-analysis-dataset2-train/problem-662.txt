In the Safaitic inscriptions from North Arabia you get both al ilah and allah. In Safaitic specifically he was not one of the more common deities and there is no distinct way to date the deity so it would be difficult to determine the date. However the Safaitic inscriptions are considered to have an end date of the 4th century as there are no references to Christianity in the inscriptions. This would suggest that the name Allah or al Ilah evolved independently to Christianity.
Do you think in those inscriptions al-ilah is being referred to as a distinct specific deity?, or just as a title to lots of different gods?
I wonder why christain arabs pre-islam would call to their god al-ilah if it was a distinct ordinary god.
Unfortunately there aren't enough Safaitic inscriptions to come to any conclusion. In the aforementioned thesis the author catalogues the inscriptions that are prayers to the deities and categorises the prayers made to ilah and allah (or ilh and lh as the North Arabian languages are precursor of Old Arabic and don't use short vowels) to determine if there was a difference between the two. But there just wasn't enough surviving inscriptions to really come to any distinct conclusion.
It is interesting that there are many inscriptions that mention allah in amongst many other deities which shows that pre-Islamic North Arabians considered allah as a separate deity and didn't just use the name as a way of saying "God." As for the pre-Islamic Christians I'm not sure as the Safaitic Arabs weren't Christian but that would be an interesting field to look into.
