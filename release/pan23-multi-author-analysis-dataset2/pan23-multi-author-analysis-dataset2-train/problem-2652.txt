United States isn't really an adequate location. Different states have different laws. But there's no apparent problem here.
That’s a bummer, my plan is to take the sign on bonus and quit when I’m in the new position then. Seems to me like a pretty shitty way to treat employees. My career goals lied outside of my current department, but still with the firm. Shame..
it's doubtful they would offer the bonus in that manner. They would almost certainly have language that would allow them to clawback the bonus if you quit right away.
To clarify the “sign-on bonus” is coming from my current employer essentially a pay-out bonus for the months I worked there. I would only receive bonus from the new company if I complete employment through one time in February and one time in July of next year.
So if I’m wanting to keep those licenses I have to quit and find an employee who will pay to keep them active. Thank you for your responses I appreciate them.
I understand and agree. It’s definitely nice we still have a job if necessary. My problem mostly pertains to the financial licenses I have: Series 7, 6, 63 and SIE. All of which will not be supported in the new employer.
Title: My employer is making a change, and the way they’re doing it seems unorthodox. Is this all perfectly legal?
