Submitting that information is likely not a legal issue. They are allowed to express opinions about you. being uncooperative is an opinion.
That’s insane how they can potentially ruin my livelihood and new occupational career with absolutely no consequences of perjury, repayment or restitution purely off of emotion.
I’m honestly upset they did this, but I’m more upset about the information potentially being public. If what you’re saying is true, do I have nothing to worry about in terms of my health information?
How did they get the medical information that you feel was illegal? If was info you told them then it isnt illegal or hipaa.
1- again, an opinion is legal. If I say I feel your are a lazy worker, that's legal. If I say you abuse dogs (and you don't) then that would not be legal.
You are still not really understanding what libel is. His side of the relationship and his view can differ from yours. He can see you at the bad guy and hate you and say all the things you did he hated. All the things that drive him crazy. All your actions he didn't like. That's legal and normal to tell people.
1. So what would one do if the defamatory opinion leads to loss of wages, extra court and attorney fees needed to dismiss it? If it doesn’t do anything to prohibit my life or my new job then I don’t really care.
This all could have been avoided if the frivolous, empty, PFA was just never filed. This is so annoying and messy and now I have to jump through all of these hoops because they’re an idiot and think they will get something.
