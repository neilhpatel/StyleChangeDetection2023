It’s a very common scam for someone to either steal a phone or spoof the number and claim to be the friend needing help. They target the people that have the most contact with the person who’s phone they steal. Knowing someone doesn’t really matter in this scam. Often they will contact parents/grandparents and they almost always claim phone problems that make it hard to make a call and/or explain why they sound different.
I would suggest that she contact a domestic violence shelter - while this isn't textbook DV, they are experienced in helping people receive mail securely, replacing documentation, and the various things your friend is dealing with. Homeless shelters also deal with this stuff, and may be able to provide a secure place to send documents and credit cards so she can get her affairs in order.
Finally, she should report the theft to the police. The police can also help connect her to similar services. Having a uniformed officer present when demanding your shit back can either help convince most people to cooperate, or result in hilarity when they decide to do something stupid.
