Honestly, they’ve always done it since Russia became a superpower (although it must be said that we have plenty of internally sourced conflict - Russia just takes advantage of that). It’s just they’ve never had a president and a political party on their side before. I think 2016 will go down as the greatest intelligence operation in history, although I think they got lucky because the Republican Party had already worked itself into a peak of depravity. I think Putin planned to run the table on politics in the US about as much as Osama expected the towers to come down. That is to say, a nice surprise.

But I do understand the problem, as a catholic I find it stupid these small independent churches and mega churches with rich pastors hellbent on a political ideology backed by god.
