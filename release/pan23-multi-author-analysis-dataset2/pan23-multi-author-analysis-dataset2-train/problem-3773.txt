As mainstream spy fiction goes, The Americans is pretty good in terms of verisimilitude — no doubt helped by the fact that the series' creator, Joe Weisberg, was briefly a CIA officer.
There are broadly two types of intelligence officer: the first are those who operate under 'legal' cover, commonly as diplomats or embassy employees. These officers conceal their espionage work behind the facade of other, more mundane government work. The second are those who work under 'illegal' cover (the US intelligence community uses the term 'non-official cover'); they are outwardly not government employees, and thus do not have diplomatic protection — but they're also less likely to attract the attention of foreign counterintelligence services.
In the KGB, foreign operations were the purview of the First Chief Directorate, a vast service-within-a-service with myriad sub-departments — some responsible for specific geographical areas (eg. First Department, responsible for North America), others for specific types of intelligence (eg. Directorate T, responsible for scientific and technological intelligence.).
(If that oath sounds faintly familiar to fans of The Americans, it's because it's recited verbatim in S01E12!).
Both are surprising reads, particularly the first. It's amazing how far and varied penetration if US and British intelligence operations and agencies were (are?).
