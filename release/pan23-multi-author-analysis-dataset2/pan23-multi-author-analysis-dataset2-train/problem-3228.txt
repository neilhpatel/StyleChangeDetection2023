I also suggest that if you do run away ( which i suggest don't do, running away marks you in the eyes of the law as a "problem child" it does not help the situation at all, believe me) you look up child advocate/ help places in your area or abuse shelters for woman and children. Again most places like those has a case worker on site/ personal help with some police to help children in dire situations, even running to a police station immediately after you have been physically attacked helps alot better then just running away, at that point you are literally evidence.
You can make a call to child protective services (CYS, CPS, something like that) and tell them you were abused. You can also go to someone at your school whom you trust and ask them to help you. You should not have to go through this. No one deserves this abuse. Fight for yourself and ask adults you trust to help you.
That is a good thing to do. If you need support from an adult at school, the school buildings usually have someone there that could help you connect to a trusted teacher or counselor. You are brave, and you are doing the right thing.
