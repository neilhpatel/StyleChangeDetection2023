Whenever I have interfaced with a licensed professional, or regulated industry, I find the quickest resolution is through a formal complaint to their license authority. Look up, “realtor complaint Your State.” There will be a regulating body and complaint form available. Based on your story, I think using the words “fraudulent misrepresentation” would have quite an impact. It has been my experience that industry regulators don’t put up with members that aren’t following the rules, and a black mark on their license is not good at all.
Since the lease doesn't specify of bedrooms, make sure they take screen shots of the advertisement that indicates it has four bedrooms before the ad is taken down.
Not a lawyer but if you have the ad saved saying it was a 4 bedroom you might have something. Any texts or emails to or from the landlord saying how many bedrooms?
They have the screenshots showing how it was falsely advertised as 4 bedrooms. And no I don’t believe the person ever disclosed that it really was 3 bedrooms, they deliberately didn’t show the half bath in order to make them think it was a 4th bedroom.
