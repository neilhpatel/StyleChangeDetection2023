You dont have grounds for a protective order but you also dont have to have contact with your father or for your kid to have contact with him. Document everything, if he starts to contact you, be firm and to the point that you do not wish for you or yourself to have a relationship, if he persists send a c&d, if that is ignored then look into taking things further.
Schools also dont let any random adult just take small children, you can inform the school of your concerns and why and request that they phone the police and you should he ever show up, but that will be years from now anyway. Anything can happen between now and your unborn baby going to school.
Thanks for the info. Just to clarify, he was living in the U.S. when this occurred, we have since moved back to the U.S. so we do live in the same country currently.
But you also say your father lives in a different country, orders of protection arent enforceable against a person in a foreign country.
If your father had been sending threatening messages or had tried to kidnap your child recently then that would make sense but if he hasn't contacted in years there is no grounds for restraint.
When the kid starts daycare/school, you can let them know that you have concerns about <your dad's name>. Bring the most up to date picture you have. Hopefully they will at least set a flag in the system. Schools/daycares should have policies in place about who can pick up a child, and I believe they are liable if they let someone pick up the kid who isn't on the allowed list. Also make sure the kid (when old enough) is shown those pictures, and told to let you/any adult know if they see that person.
