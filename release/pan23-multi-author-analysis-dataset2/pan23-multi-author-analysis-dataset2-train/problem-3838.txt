How is it an assumption? It’s basic math and I said elections with “record turn out”. If the population increases and you have record turn out the number will probably be bigger. No assumptions needed.
Honestly that means nothing at all. As time goes on the population will increase until it hits about 11 billion people. That will make any election with record turn out to have the “largest vote totals” in history as time marches on. Time x population = increased amount of voters.
trump is too popular with the far right base to remove from the GOP but is far too toxic to win another national election.
It’s entirely the fault of decades of GOP strategy relying on fascist tactics to consolidate their base and radicalize them to the point where they won’t listen to any perspective that doesn’t agree with them. The GOP radicalized their own base and primed them for someone like trump to come along and promise to make their ridiculous right wing fantasies come true.
The GOP can now reap what they’ve sown. A radicalized base that is loyal to a would be fascist that makes them an unelectable political minority prone to violent outbursts and domestic terrorism.
