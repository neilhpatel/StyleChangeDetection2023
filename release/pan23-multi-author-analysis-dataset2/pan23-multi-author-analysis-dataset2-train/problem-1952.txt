There is no “debate“ about an African American history AP class…. none. It’s an advanced placement course… a college level course one chooses to takes and pay for in high school so they don’t have to take in college. it has little to nothing to do with state curriculum. High Schools get to say they offer them so parents like that. What about Spanish or physics AP classes, should kids not take those? Florida has gone full Nazi but I can’t imagine northern Virginia Parents are gonna be happy about the governor pulling any AP classes out of school.
Had a buddy that moved to Missouri come back to VA for a wedding before the election. Drank the koolaid when he was there. He said youngkin was right crt is rampant in Virginia and he was glad he got out in time. These people have no idea what they’re talking about and soaking up anything the repubs tell them without actually researching but telling you to research it. I believe VA is learning from voting in youngkin and will be a perm dem gov state after this.
