I'm still skeptical, but the advice remains the same. You broke no law, and should block and ignore this abject creep. It sounds likely that you have written evidence of your arrangement, the details surrounding it, and his threats, you might consider preserving this evidence, (screenshots and saving pages for offline reading).
If you don't have proof of the initial conversation, it may be worth it to have him admit what he did or "hold" he has over you. If tries to after you, you can after him for extortion (trying to get nudes). Basically he has played himself and digging himself deeper, and may be doing this with others as well. Just ignore and block, he is not likely to do anything else.
Sounds like it was set up from the very beginning. Hopefully you have texts/messages that prove the initial conversation where he consented. Also would help if you can show that it was his idea and you shared the money with him. Doesn't seem like he could go to the police without it backfiring on him. Just ignore/block him and get an attorney if he decides to do anything else.
Definitely sounds like he's trying to set you up for blackmail. You doing a favor he asked you to do is not illegal. Him trying to blackmail you is.
Either break off contact or report him to the police. I would absolutely take the report if somebody told me they were being extorted like this, especially for sexual reasons.
Him saying he's going to go to the cops is almost certainly manipulative bullshit, and you should have nothing to worry about.
