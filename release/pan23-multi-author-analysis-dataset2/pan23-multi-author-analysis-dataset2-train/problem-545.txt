Most social media sites use DCMA for copyright claims. Submit it through Twitter it should be taken down. Just google Twitter dcma and it should be one of the first links.
The Twitter user ended up taking the video down a few minutes ago after my followers and other creators came after the user for a solid couple hours. I will see if Twitter still follows up regarding the copyright claim. I was happy my situation was handled but someone with not as large as a platform may not have the results I did so I want to see how Twitter handles it.
If you published (posted) the original video less than 3 months ago and you found out about the infringement less than 1 month ago, apply for copyright registration now. It's less than $100, you can do it online, and, most importantly, it may give you entitlement to statutory damages and attorneys fees. While those things are not guaranteed, they give you very useful ammunition when making demands of the infringer.
You do not need a registration to make a DMCA takedown claim, which it sounds like you already did. Unfortunately it may be a game of whack a mole if the infringer keeps reposting it under new accounts, but that's the system unless you can sue or settle with the infringer. Large platforms like twitter are generally responsive to DMCA requests.
