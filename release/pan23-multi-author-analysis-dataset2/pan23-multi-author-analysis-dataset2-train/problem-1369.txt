Not to discourage further discussion, but you may be interested in response to a very similar question by /u/coinsinmyrocket.
I haven't done much digging since answering that question (damned life getting in the way and all that) but I've seen a couple of other names pop up here and there. Nothing I can really go into detail about (I've had some names passed on to me or I've seen them pop up in secondary sources) since I haven't been able to verify it myself, but there is still a well of untapped info just waiting to be found and written about.
If pressed I would imagine one could presumably look at Census data from 1940 and once 1950's census data becomes publicly available in a couple of years, cross reference it to see who was still around.
Anecdotally, my grandmother, German emigree to Philadelphia in 1920 with her new American serviceman husband, talked regularly about "Germans who returned home", but whether because they shared Nazi ideology or just felt a responsibility as "good Germans", she never really talked about. I'm aware that the German government expected German males living abroad to enter service if they returned home, but that's not uncommon (the US shared this policy).
