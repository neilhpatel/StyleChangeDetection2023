I'm not for this btw - but if for instance you sent in wall-e against an armed gunman in a situation that civilians are at risk - you're probably getting more people killed, or at best the gunman just fucks the robot up.
Why would the robots need to be capable of deadly force if it reduces the chances humans are in danger?
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
My idea is MattressBots. Got a shooter holed up in a highly defensible position? Send in the mattresses and push him up against a wall, or even held in place between two bots.
Why can’t they just use enough robot force to incapacitate or distract or anything that’s needed other than “kill”?
But no matter how you take this the only winner is cops. It detaches them from the situation both physically and emotionally. And sure you want cool and calm, but emotion even in cool and calm are vital in a life or death situation. You're not gonna pick up on body and just fucking "the air" cues like you would in person doing this. You're not gonna pick up on "dude has lost it from a shitty day/week/month but likely isn't gonna actually kill somebody" when you're staring at him from a screen.
You're likely to make everything more deadly from a law enforcement scenario as cops aren't dealing with the fucking bloody terror that is taking a life in front of you (for non sociopaths that is).
