To find out who owns your property, you can search your county treasurer or assessor site. Go to netronline.com > public records online > Illinois > your county.
Look up property records to confirm that ownership hasn't changed. Send written, certified mail to the owner's address.
Illinois does not allow rent withholding unless you are in Chicago. However, you can apply up to half of your rent (not to exceed $500) to repairs.
As a note, if there was a recent sale, it's possible that county records haven't been updated yet. I'm still chasing my title company on status of filing my deed on a transaction that happened 7 months ago, but 1-3 month delays are normal.
It's entirely possible that they've sold the place and that's why she's no longer the property manager (and her mom no longer the owner). That might be why she would be telling you that someone is supposed to contact you and it's someone she doesn't have info for - it's a new landlord or company that's supposed to come in and deal with it. You may have to kinda wait this out and see what happens, if nobody contacts you then either the daughter was lying or the new company has dropped the ball.
