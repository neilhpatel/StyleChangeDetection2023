There isn’t much you can do, but there isn’t much he can harm you with about this. He is mixing up a whole bunch of things and most of it was misapplied information before it even got to him. Look up “soverign citizen” because that is the ideal he is going for and using really the wrong terminology. It would really have only hurt you if he did this before or right after you were born. Then he could have refused to get you a social security number, a birth certificate, refused to enroll you in school, etc. Basically, kept you from ever being recognized. Your Mom would have had to have been in it as well. But I assume you have a social and a birth certificate. Try to get them and keep them safe, but he destroys them, not to worry. You can get copies. It’s a pain, but no permanent damage. He can’t do anything about your citizenship. He could try but to denounce citizenship especially without having another is a very long and difficult process.
Well your mother is the one who will have issues if your father doesn’t pay tax and they are filing jointly. So she should care.
