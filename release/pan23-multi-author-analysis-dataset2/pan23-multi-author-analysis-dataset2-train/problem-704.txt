Thanks for the reply. From the little ive gathered getting a lawyer is a good move. The only problem is I don’t have a ton of cash to spare. If I can’t afford a lawyer is pleading not guilty still a good idea?
It was a shop lifting charge from a mall. Idk if that helps. I would like to be private but you tell me what information you need and I will let you know what I can. Thanks.
Petty theft. So a lawyer can probably get you a deferred sentence. Regarding your plea, were you stopped with merchandise outside or inside the store, and what was the item (looking for size here)? Was the item concealed or not concealed on your person? Was this your first time? Do you already have a record? Were you alone?
I was stopped outside. It was 2 shirts. One on me, one in a bag. It was less than 140$ of merchandise. It is my first time getting this charge. I had one other charge in my past but it was dropped and I got it expunged.
Just for clarity it was a completely different charge that I had in the past and like I said the charges were dropped and I got it expunged. (Idk if the judge can even see that you have an expunged charge?) Is it possible that I would face jail time for this current charge(Petit Theft 2nd Degree 1st Offense?).
