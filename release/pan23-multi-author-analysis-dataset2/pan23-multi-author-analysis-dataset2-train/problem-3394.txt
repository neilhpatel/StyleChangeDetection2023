The goal right now is to give Ukraine enough functional tanks that they can mount an offensive once the ground dries. Unfortunately not enough modern tanks can be given fast enough to meet Ukraine's needs. At the very least the Leopard 1s could free up the best of the Soviet and Russian derived tanks in Ukrainian service for offensive roles.
Russia: “NOOO YOU CAN’T DO THAT It’s not fair you’re escalating things Stop giving them cutting-edge weapons”.
Canada has, or at least had, 80 or so. They were being used as target practice starting a few years ago. If any of them dodged that fate I hope we can send them too.
I'll take your word for it when you say it's not technically correct, but a lot of sayings don't make perfect sense. And this was me explaining someone elses joke.
Saying 'it's like Swiss cheese' is just a common saying when referring to anything containing lots of holes.
Thus a tank used for target practice (and likely full of holes) could be jokingly called a Swiss tank, especially since the Swiss aren't sending any actual tanks to my knowledge.
