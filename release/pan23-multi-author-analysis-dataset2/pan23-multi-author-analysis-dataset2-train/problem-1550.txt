I won't upvote articles about this right now, but I'm not surprised the talk will ramp up quickly. Candidates will likely start declaring in about 6 months.

This is a political sub with lots of political junkies so of course its going to be talked about. I understand some do not want to look ahead that far but many of us do.
This is a pretty vapid and out-of-touch list. Omits several of the GOP candidates that I feel are more likely to run, and includes some candidates (for both parties) that seem a bit outdated now.
Only ones that i would show any real enthusiasm to vote for is AOC, Bernie and Warren. If most those Republicans run its going to be a chaotic Republican party with too many people splitting the vote giving Trump a higher chance of walking away with the most delegates. If Josh Hawley somehow walks away with the nomination and wins the presidency America is in serious trouble.
That would be my top choice but i realize its a extreme long shot in n the current political climate. I would also be ok with a Bernie/AOC ticket that way if Bernies age became a issue he would be backed by a strong progressive. Also AOC being a VP gives her more experience and puts her on the public stage some more.
