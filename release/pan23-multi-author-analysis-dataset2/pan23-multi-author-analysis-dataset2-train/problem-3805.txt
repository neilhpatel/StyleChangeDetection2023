You won't be assigned a new number for this, you wouldn't be assigned a new number for far more egregious activity. You might try setting up a fraud alert with the credit reporting agencies. It's less than a freeze, but alerts you to activity.
Is it really that common? I just can't imagine that an employer or car dealership or cell company wouldn't see that the name doesn't match the SSN when they run it.
I owned a tax business for years and had lots of folks dealing with social security theft. You should file a police report indicating that someone had opened up a Verizon account with your social. If they did that, then they could do other things with it to, like work under your social. IRS has always advised us to have the client file a simple police report so itâ€™s documented.
It takes a year (minimum) for the name and social mismatch to show up and for SSA to send a letter to the employee. We had about 450 clients a year and 3-4 were dealing of identify fraud and income reported on their socials.
