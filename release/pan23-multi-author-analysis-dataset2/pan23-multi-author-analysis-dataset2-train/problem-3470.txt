In 96 I had to do a nuke drill in school. I happened to be in ROTC class when we were supposed to do it. Our instructor told us, unless we were at the doors of a bomb shelter not to worry about. We were next to an air force base, army base, Philly, NYC, Philly shipyards, three mile island was sort of nearby. We weren’t gonna make it out alive. If we did we’d wish we hadn’t. There was some comfort in that.
We still had air raid sirens and monthly tests in socal in the early 70s. One literally across the street from my bedroom. By the time I was ten you just ignored them.
Oh yeah, we had the weekly ones in elementary. It just felt weird that even after the tests went to monthly and then eventually stopped that ugly yellow thing hung on the telephone pole across the street.
I remember the elementary drills, the fallout shelter was in the basement. At some point, maybe when I was in fourth or fifth grade, they only continued a test of the town alarm once a week in the evenings (I had actually graduated before they stopped those), but that was just a creepy siren for maybe 15 seconds.
