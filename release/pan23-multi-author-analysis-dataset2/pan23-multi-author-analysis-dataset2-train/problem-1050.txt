the problem you’ve got is economics. Most attorneys who handle cases like that do it for a %. Atty gets X% of what they recover for you. So, the potential $X must be high enough to justify the cost. Even if the car is an exotic, it’s a close call because of the hours of time cases like this cost. You COULD pay hourly but you’d likely spend a huge fraction of any recovery just getting it (which demonstrates why Attys don’t want to take it on a %). Since none of them have said “well, in this State, for this kind of case, if you win, the defendant pays your fees, so I’ll help” leads me to conclude that there is no statute shifting fees in your State on these facts. You’ll likely need to handle this yourself - sorry. IAL (probably obviously). And echoing other comments, you don’t get “I’m upset” damages. Nor do you (likely) get “I had to rent a car to get around” damages either.
Do you have full coverage insurance? If the other parties aren't cooperating, you contact your insurance who will have attorneys that will represent you in suing the responsible parties. Otherwise they have to pay, so they will take care of it for you.
