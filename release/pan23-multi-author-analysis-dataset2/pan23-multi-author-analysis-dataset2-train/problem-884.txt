What is the time frame in which this all happened. Recent? Things don’t magically progress as fast as you want them to simply because you want them to. The police’s job is to take your report and then investigate the report, which seems to be happening. After they complete their investigation they present their findings to the prosecutors office. Then it gets assigned to a prosecutor who determines what, if any, charges are filed. We are just coming off a long weekend so unless this all happened several weeks ago or months ago, you should let the case take it’s course. You have the deputies card, you have the report. Contact the office and ask for an update if you really want, but don’t expect everything to happen at light speed.
Contact the deputy, ask him for a copy of the police report. Ask him if he intends to pursue charges.
If he does not intend to pursue charges, and you would like to, then you need to petition the magistrate on your own with the facts you have. There is typically one day a week where the prosecutor will hear civilian criminal complaints. Contact the clerk at the court that has jurisdiction where incident occurred and ask them for details on filing a private criminal complaint.
If you are unhappy with the performance of the officer in his duty, you could also file a complaint with the department.
