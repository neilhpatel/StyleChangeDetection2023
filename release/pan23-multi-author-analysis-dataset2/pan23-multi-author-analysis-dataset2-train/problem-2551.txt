For the most part I am fine, albeit unsettled, with being recorded without my knowledge when I'm out in public, and don't care so much about that. But being secretly recorded by a couple who are considerably older than I and who I've barely interacted with for not even a total of 45 minutes whilst in my home, and without a parental figure nearby (both were busy chasing the neighbors chickens out of our backyard at the time) makes me quite uncomfortable.
I can understand being recorded in a public place and I'm not all that discomforted by that, but it's when they recorded in our private household that I have an issue with.
I do not know what exactly the intentions of their recording are, it's possible they just like recording for their own legal safety. I may just be reacting unreasonably, I've had instances in the past when I was significantly younger where I was subjected to some very not cash money things and learning that I was recorded unwilling brought back the same feelings of dread and discomfort that I felt back then.
NAL but as far as I can tell Arkansas is a one party consent recording state so there’s nothing there to get them on but I don’t know if there’s something separate for minors.
