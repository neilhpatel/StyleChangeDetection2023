Shortly after he did realise he misspoke and made another statement where the he says . Not the first time he has had to explain his actions / words afterwards.
Well since his original statement was rather nuanced with stuff like " possibly re-evaluate in long term" and so on. WHich like... is true, if it like starts to drag on something like 5 years or 10 years.
Since little argument is "someone slammed someone with words" or "heated war of words" and so on. Everything is so hyped and over dramatized. However knowing that is the media environment, he should be careful to not give ammunition to the media drama generation engine.
However he absolutely misspoke in that he spoke about this low probability, not at all at the moment relevant side scenario in the first place at all.
What I have read about Finnish polticians saying about, well, anything in English news, it's like "Finland will do this" and "Finland planning to do this". In Finnish news "Finland might reconsider doing something if certain cituation occurs, but no one has done any decisions about anything and are just waiting to see how things will develop".
Usually he is pretty good about diplomacy, specially in international setting. But I guess he got caught deep thinking aloud (I don't know... ehhh explaining the situation in deeper detail for "home audience", since it was on Finnish television morning show interview). He should be little bit more careful. Well now he had to do meaculpa and go around damage controlling all day. the international quick news cycle doesn't do nuance, so one has to be carefull to "stay on message".
Finnish news is much more uncertain and just saying possible options. English news sounds more certain.
