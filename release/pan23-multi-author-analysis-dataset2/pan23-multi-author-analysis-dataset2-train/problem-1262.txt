1) Renters insurance is a common requirement when leasing. Landlord's homeowners insurance policies specifically exclude coverage of any tenant belongings. For instance, in case of fire, their policy will cover replacement of the structure and appliances but will specifically exclude replacement of your belongings. Renters insurance typically costs less than $200 a year and is recommended for ANY tenant.
Home owners also would not cover damages op specifically does. If they leave a faucet running and cause 10’s of thousands of water damage that’s op’s responsibility and appropriately covered by renters insurance op has and the landlord is listed as an interested party.
When things are requested beyond what you are legally required to provide, ask for the request in writing- easy to avoid confrontation by saying, I’m so forgetful… can you email me exactly what you need? Then respond by quoting your lease and how you are happy to adhere to those requirements- documentation.
As an aside if this is the stance you want to take op, that’s fine. Prepared to have a lawyer on speed dial and spend a lot on every interaction. Reminder it’s a dual edge sword. She’s free to handle things to the letter of the law on her obligations to you as well. A non emergency repair that she’d usually send someone out right away? She has until Oregon law says she has to address it to acknowledge it. Then she can schedule someone who takes awhile for an appointment.
