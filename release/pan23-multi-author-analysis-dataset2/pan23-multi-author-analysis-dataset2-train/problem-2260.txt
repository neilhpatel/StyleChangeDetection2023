There actually is merit to building a robust wall especially with the upcoming climate refugee waves but the way Trump approached it created a backlash that will eventually backfire. To clarify I'm a democrat and I hate Trump and all Republicans.
The price of this anti-immigrant play is what is most outrageous. The hauling, clearing of land, and stacking of containers costs the people of Arizona about $130,000. Since they only travel for a mile before stopping, it won't deter anyone from crossing the border. Some future governor will be required to pay to have them hauled off and disposed of because they are an eyesore, hazardous, and ineffective. You're a smart one, Douchey.
