Even if sliding off the road were prima facie evidence of excessive speed, it is not evidence of "willful or wanton disregard." I encourage the OP to schedule a pre-hearing with the city attorney. If they don't give you a good offer there, schedule an informal hearing with a magistrate. If you don't like the magistrate's decision, you can take it to the Judge for review.
Officers don't witness the cast majority of crimes people are charged with. He can look at the evidence, such as you going off the road, and deduce what to charge you with.
The fact that you lost control of your vehicle and slid off the road is prima facie evidence that you were driving too fast for conditions. Having old tires, while it may have been the reason you slid off the road, is not an excuse for going too fast on the old tires.
I don't see anywhere in the statute or caselaw that suggests that sliding off a road is prima facie evidence of excessive speed. The jury instructions for reckless driving state that the prosecutor must show "that the defendant drove the motor vehicle in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property. Willful or wanton disregard means more than simple carelessness but does not require proof of an intent to cause harm. It means knowingly disregarding the possible risks to the safety of people or property.".
