The idea of DeSantis (a young hard-right governor who won overwhelmingly in a big "swing" state) is much more appealing to the GOP than the reality of DeSantis.
I was talking more about moderate R voters than elected officials. There used to be a whole bloc of moderates when the Far Right fringe was on the fringe. I donâ€™t recognize the current iteration of the GOP because the fringe has become the mainstream. The GOP have forsaken the principles that used to define their political philosophy and have adopted divisive extremist positions for power.
But then again, I don't want to see any Republican presidents until they clean house by getting rid of the hatemongers and plutocrats. (In which case... would it even be the Republican Party anymore?).
