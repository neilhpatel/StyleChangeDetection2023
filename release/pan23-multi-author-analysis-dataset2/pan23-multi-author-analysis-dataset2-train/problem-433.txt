IMHO, that's the same thing with capitalism. It requires critical thinking, wisdom, and attention from citizens. (e.g. enforcing anti-trust laws, keeping economic inequality at healthy levels, making sure the social mobility ladder is there and is very wide, and functions both way, i.e. rich but dumb and lazy people fall, poor but intelligent and hard working people rise, making sure education is free, including higher education; making sure unions have high degree of freedoms, and rights (as they're the checks-and-balances of the upper-class and their corporations), making sure parliament is elected by proportional representation, so that people from the lower and middle class can get elected with support from unions, and make sure taxes are fair, and inequality low, making sure the field is level and people rise on merit alone (but people don't fall too low, i.e. a rather equal society) and etc. etc.).
They do it for evil reasons. They don't care about others, only about themselves and their friends and family. And they never seem to enough. They always want more and more and more. And who cares if these policies crush everybody else into abject poverty and suffering.
Donâ€™t both of these countries have universal healthcare funded by the government? So effectively most nurses are federal employees? Seems like the anti-capitalist sentiment here is misplaced.
