I disagree. He is making an effort to solicit misinformation to the general public and to employers or other significant people in our social setting. His interest is in causing harm and reputation damage without regard for collateral damage or what other people will do or have done to us as a result.
He has abused public information databases including Pennsylvania's Unified Judicial System (online docket search) in a manner which violates an agreement onscreen which states it is unlawful to do so.
In what way are they abusing the docket searches, in a manner that makes it a crime? "They are doing things that I'd very much rather they would not with the information in the databases." is not what is meant by "abuse".
I looked at those two statutes and did not see any crimes listed that fit what you have described. And certainly nothing that even vaguely resembles "Doxxing is a crime.".
Run a "whois" search and report it to the web host of the site in question. Maybe it violates their terms and they take it down.
