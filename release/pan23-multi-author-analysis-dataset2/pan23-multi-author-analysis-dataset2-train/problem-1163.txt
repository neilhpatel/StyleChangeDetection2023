This sounds like the “noble savage” myth. The tribal sociologies of Amerindians are quite similar to those you find in Eurasia among semi-nomadic and herding societies. Human beings are much more similar than they are different. We can all champion institutions that are centered on human rights.
The power structure of today’s world are absolutely stacked against some while being empowering for others, the solution to that is to invest positively in better outcomes for the disadvantaged.
Here's a free life lesson: When somebody calls something 'violence', and it clearly isn't violence, they're trying to rationalise a violent response to it.
What’s ridiculous, confusing, and violently ideological is to call anything happening in Cananda today “settler colonialism”. The greatest irony being that only the descendants of empowered settler colonists have this perspective.
Central America and Caribbean nations are ongoing victims of “settler colonial” structures, not Canandians. Stop appropriating violent terms to drive clicks for your cause.
