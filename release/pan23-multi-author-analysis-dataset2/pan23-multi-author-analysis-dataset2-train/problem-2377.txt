You need to file a report with your local law enforcement regarding the fraudulent activity. You can provide your evidence to them so that they can follow up on it. It is probably a good idea to provide the info to your credit unions fraud department as well.
That is correct. Alabama’s fraudulent use of credit/debit card statute specifically addresses that jurisdiction is in the county where the victim resides. If the suspect was using the card/information in another Alabama county they could alternatively be charged in that county. Since the suspect is using it in VA, the appropriate law enforcement agency is in OP’s home county. OP should go to the municipal police department or county sheriff’s office.
At this point you don’t really know anything and once the charges are reversed you will have nothing to sue for. Did you file a police report? Sorry if I missed it in the post. Even if the charges are reversed you can’t effectively sue in Virginia.
I have fought this battle and it's brutal not having access to your funds while you're waiting for your new debit card.
Other commenters have pretty much answered your question, but I would recommend to stop using your debit card. Get a credit card which is much easier to dispute charges and they aren't actually using your money.
