Three consecutive nights of air attacks caused extensive blackouts in Belgrade, Novi Sad, and Nis, the three largest cities in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. In contrast with previous attacks on the power supply – in which allied warplanes triggered temporary outages by dropping carbon-fiber filaments that shorted out electrical lines – NATO forces' latest one struck at Serbia's five major power-transmission stations with high-explosive munitions, causing damage that could take weeks to repair.
>Serbia will ask NATO peacemakers to let it deploy Serbian military and police in Kosovo, although it believes there is no chance of the request being approved, President Aleksandar Vucic said on Saturday.
NATO is there precisely to prevent violence between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. I don't see how placing Serbian troops in Kosovo could achieve anything other than escalating violence.
I mean, violence goes two sides. Even if Serbia didn't plan to do anything (which I doubt, because why would they want to deploy troops in Kosovo otherwise?), Kosovars would still attack them.
