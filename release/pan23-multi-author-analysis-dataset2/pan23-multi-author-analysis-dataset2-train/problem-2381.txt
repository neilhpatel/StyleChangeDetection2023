Of course it's much better not to release them at all (need to reduce train derailments!), but once some airborne flammable chemicals are released, unfortunately burning them is often the less-harmful option than letting the raw chemical spread. With methane, for example, it's many times worse for climate change if released unburned. With things like the Ohio chemicals, it might've been a difference between people getting sick from the smoke vs dropping dead from unburned fumes.

Not to mention without that eye on equity, you know what happens the next time someone wants to build a polluting plant? They build it right on top of the minority community since that is where we built the last plant.
