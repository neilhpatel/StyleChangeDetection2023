Depends on where you’re located— schools around me have a teachers union you can refer to. If this is the case for you, see who your buildings union rep is and report it to them, and they can assist you with what to do further.
You can't "press charges" but you can inform the police a 14 year old kid pulled down his mask and coughed on you. If they determine a crime has been committed they can forward that to the District Attorney who can actually press charges.
If the administration is unable to protect the teachers could a lawsuit against them be put forth. Does the administration have a responsibility to keep teachers safe and fix a hostile work environment? Could the parents be held accountable for the actions of their children?
However I cannot see that happening at all. Courts are already clogged up and a kid coughing isn't high up on the priority list at all. The chance is almost 0.
This is the correct answer. Your remedy is going to come from the school, not some juvenile justice probation for a 14 yr old cough assault. Even IF (a giant if) the DA charges this assault, they would consider it a huge win to have the kid plea to a diversion program… which is essence is as or less severe then detention or suspension.
