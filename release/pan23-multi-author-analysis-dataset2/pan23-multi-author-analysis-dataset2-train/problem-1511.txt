No. They claim I’m an immediate threat, so that’s the reasoning for my license being suspended. It’s as if I’m being punished before being proven guilty. I think the cop is proving a point. There’s no evidence just going off of what someone called and said.
Have you called the police officer or rmv directly and talked to them or are you relying on calls made to you?
Yes it is all legit, I’ve been to the rmv, I’ve been to the police station. Have the police report, Just had my hearing today for my suspended license and was denied.
And your reaction to the officer when he called you. A lawyer is the best avenue to get your license back. Absolutely do not drive on a suspended license. The penalty for being caught is even worse.
Title: Someone called the police and said I was tailgating them, suspended license, and charged with wreck less driving.
