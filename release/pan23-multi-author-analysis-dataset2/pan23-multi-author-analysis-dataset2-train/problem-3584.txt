For lossless discrimination your remedy is to report it and involve the company’s obligation to see it stop. If you lost something worth pursuing you might talk to a lawyer or contact a regulatory agency.
I lost my dignity, will to live, and I have been overworked (40+ hours a week) for nearly an entire month with no benefits or raise given. The new manager more or less “demoted” me from.
Because you're hearing impaired and your new boss told you you were "not listening" does not amount to discrimination. It was maybe a bad choice of words but perhaps your new boss doesn't know you're hearing impaired?
See additional comments that I posted on here it gives a little bit of a better sense of it without me going into full detail. The company I work for frequently looks at social medias like reddit which is why I’m keeping things very vague until I get actual legal help.
My store and takes hours off my schedule despite me asking for at least 30-35 hours a week as I have bills, student loans, and a house to pay for.
You could report it to HR that you feel you were discriminated against based on your disability. You state in response to another question that you "lost the will to live" after the comment. Personally, I think you need to get mental health treatment if someone critiquing you causes you to lose the will to live.
I’m a severely hearing impaired employee and was simply doing a task my boss asked me to do, when she did not like the fashion I did it in she claimed I was not doing it right and that and I quote “not listening” to her and I took deep offense to that. There have been some other occasions where she completely dismissed any helpful ideas and suggestions I had to give for absolutely no genuine reason.
