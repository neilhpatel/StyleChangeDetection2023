While we had a con artist of president denying Ukraine military aid as well as blackmailing, impeached twice, caught multiple times lying and saying batshit crazy nonsense, talking to putin on a special cellphone no one else had access to, mishandled the covid crisis and then shat on Dr. Fauci, deriving billions of PPE loans to his family business and friends businesses, stealimg goverment documents, lying about having government documents, Incites a insurrection an has his rally break into congress to shit all over the place cause he didn't want to give up seat to Joe biden....
Dude even managed to make a bad joke using Putin's name towards the end of the speech, he repeated it to make sure they got it even lol. His speech was great, just glad he still has enough humor left in him to put those in.
Most learn it in school itâ€™s seen as the language of upward mobility, I teach English in Central Europe. My Ukrainian wife speaks English very well. Also English has replaced Russian as most of Central and Eastern Europes second language.
