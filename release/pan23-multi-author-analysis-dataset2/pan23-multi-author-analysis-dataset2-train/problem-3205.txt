This is a very common scam. Generally there is no girl, they just have random nudes, and there is no father, just a scammer. Block any communication from the “father” or the “girl”. Don't talk to anyone on the phone purporting to be some type of law enforcement. Don’t pay anyone any money. In the very, very unlikely event that actual police officers show up to speak with you, politely decline to speak to them, and retain a criminal defense lawyer. Are you getting the “don’t say anything to anyone” vibe here?
Thank you this had me very spooked especially when he started saying how the wife wanted to press charges but he thought he would talk it through first. And that his daughter was in the hospital going to a counselor because she had threatened to kill herself. All very scary stuff.
Yes, its supposed to scare you so you aren’t thinking. They make a lot of money this way, and having another number is a trivial expense. They will often even call pretending to be a sheriff coming to arrest you. Hint, a real sheriff will not be asking for money to prevent your arrest. Just keep blocking them and they will move on to an easier mark.
They are now threatening me with my job and information about me like how are they getting all of this?? And he is saying guilty men run and stuff like that. This is scary stuff guys and quite the elaborate scam!. But the fact he has now contacted me from 4 different numbers honestly says it all.
