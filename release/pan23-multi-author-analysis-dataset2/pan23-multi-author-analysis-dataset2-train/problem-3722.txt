Tried to sue the landlord because they entered the home without notifying us and started renovating the place. So we ended the lease but they didn’t recognize the ending of the lease, so now they’re suing for unpaid rent.
I don’t know if it was renovations or repairs, we weren’t notified of any work being done or the type of work they were doing.
I had notified them when I was moving out but continued paying rent after moving out in midaugust. It was in November my roommate had gone back to the apartment to find it being heavily worked on. He then sat with a lawyer and listed the laws the landlords had broken by entering and having maintenance in there without notice in a letter stating we were terminating the lease based on these grounds. An email and physical letter were dropped off and sent to the landlords. I moved out august 2020 and the lease was cancelled November of 2020. Lease was supposed to end July 2021.
Landlord can enter property in general with minimal or no notice for emergency repairs or any repairs. Depending on location and what was actually being done you may be on the hook for the rest of the lease.
Iowa requires the landlord to mitigate their losses by making reasonable attempts to rent out the property once a Tennant breaks and moves out.
