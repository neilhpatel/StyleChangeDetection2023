It will depend on how the non-compete was written. Most are designed to prevent an employee from resigning and taking a job at a competitor. If they are terminating your position, it's plausible that the non-compete does not apply.
Non-competes can be difficult to enforce but the lawsuits can be expensive to defend. Judges in many states (I am not sure about Alaska) employ a series of factors to assess the fairness and enforceability of the non-compete. Issues such as your position within the former employer (i.e. were you a lowly employee or did you have a significant role), access to confidential information that could be taken elsewhere (generally something more than just customer lists which are often widely known in some industries), and the lenh and geographic scope of the non-compete (75 mile radius may seem small in Alaska but if it is the entire island where you live it is a bigger deal).
Non-compete may not apply if they were terminated as well - it’s usually meant to prevent people from leaving with IP, seems this company just doesn’t care.
The company can (and should) let you out of the non-compete, given the situation. Review the document carefully and consider talking to a lawyer if you have any questions. A local lawyer familiar with the island will likely have very valid opinions about the way an Alaska court would handle this.
Have you discussed with your employer if they will release you from the Non-compete agreement? How long does the non-compete remain in force?
