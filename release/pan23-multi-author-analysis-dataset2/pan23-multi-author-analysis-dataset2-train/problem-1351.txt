Judicial murder is murder. If the death penalty showed significantly higher deterrent compared to prison sentences, I suppose a strong ethical case could be made for its use. I am not aware of any such deterrent effect. And even though I say the argument could be made I would still oppose the death penalty.
Judicial murder is murder. The existence of the death penalty in any civilized society is a scandal. I say this as an American, and as a person who grew up in the town that housed his states largest death row. The twisted lives of the men and women who work with Death-row inmates are nearly as tragic a waste as the murder of the inmates themselves. Capital punishment is a shame, it is a scandal and it is unjustifiable.
It'd be a very dumb move, considering they've just gone through accepting EU's terms and risking a minority government to get their COVID recovery funds.
The most likely case is he's an idiot who spoke when he shouldn't have. Although, if we entertain the idea that he's not a moron -- the only political party that supports bringing back the death penalty is Konfederacja. Because PiS needs to take their voters to even have a chance of winning in this year's election, maybe this is a play to take some of them?
Still, it seems like a really dumb idea. Poland hasn't executed anyone since the late 80s. Being the 'conservative' party and going against the status quo, especially when your main opposition accuses you of being far-right and not conservative, seems like a quick way to lose more voters than they'd ever gain. This is especially true when many older voters associate the death penalty with communism. This is doubly true now that there's a very large catholic conservative-liberal minority minority bloc. They just need to come out and say: "Vote for us; we actually believe in the tenets of catholism!".
