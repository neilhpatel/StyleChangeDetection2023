It doesn’t sound like you were even detained. It sounds like the police were called to escort you off the property, which is completely legal. The mall is private property and they can have you removed for any reason or no reason at all. The only reason it took 20 minutes is because you wanted to go check if there were signs on all the doors or not. There isn’t much of anything to sue for here. There are no damages.
They can just ruin anyone day they want and waste their time when they don’t post signs. There could be some malicious intent.l.
Or someone could have ripped down a sign or someone neglected to put up a sign at one entrance — slacked off the job.
There is no evidence of harassment just a mistake and you lost 20 minutes — were not taken away in cuffs, not suffered any financial losses. Undue stress is not really something one sues for in and of itself.
So the 20 minutes caused you serious emotional distress that was of a nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it?
I mean 1 door out of 10 is them not taking due diligence. Maybe if it was missing on one or two. People sue and win for emotional trauma all the time.
