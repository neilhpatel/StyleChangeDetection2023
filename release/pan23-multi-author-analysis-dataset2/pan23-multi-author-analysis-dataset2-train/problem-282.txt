While DPRK is larger in arable land area vs RoK, the quality of the arable land area is worse due to more mountainous terrain and also colder temperature. And due to poorer soil conditions, they need more fertilizers in order to produce same yield. In the old days, DPRK used to get free or nearly free fertilizers from USSR but that doesn't happen anymore which is why you hear stories about DPRK mandating people to collect 2 to use as fertilizers. On top of that general lack of mechanization when that's needed doesn't help the situation further - ox or human pulling farm machines in DPRK vs some machine burning diesel in RoK.
But if you roll the dice and kick out (or assassinate) Kim you have no idea who will replace him. Could be a reforner, vould be someone who's first order is to shell Seoul. Better the devil you know.
Need to watch that. I just recently listened to Jordan Harbinger's interview with Alastair Smith who wrote The Dictator's Handbook. Harrowing stuff for those in an autocracy.
