If the manager harasses you in-person without ever providing you a written notice, call the police to report the harassment.
You need to indicate in writing to the manager that you signed on to follow the community rules in force at the time of the lease signing. Additional rules would be considered a change to the lease and you can indicate that you're not open to changing your contract right now.
If the new manager actually files for eviction, retain a tenancy attorney prior to the end of the formal cure or quit notice.
Lease states tenant agrees to Community Rules. Are there any changes to such rules that would not be grandfathered in, that an existing tenant would be compelled to follow?
For instance, grills were originally allowed on balconies. But then management finds that it's a better deal on insurance if they disallow going forward. Or it's a new fire code violation that the building must comply with.
Would old rules stand until tenant signs new lease? I'll guess a code change would invalidate a grandfather argument. Like suddenly pit mixes were banned in the city. Just curious your opinion.
