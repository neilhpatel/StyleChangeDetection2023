This war will be felt by Russia for generations, if only in terms of demographics, regardless of which side eventually wins.
Not to mention an devastating and long lasting demographic disaster. Before the war Russia's population was aging and shrinking, with each year the population getting smaller and older, (apart from 2014, where it increased because it took crimea, only for it to continue its shrinking and aging the year later) and now they've sent hundreds of thousands of young men to die, a lot of them well before they're able to procreate, for seemingly no reason.
One year in; decimated army, thousands of pieces of armor lost, flagship sunk, 'unsinkable' transport sunk, 50% of special forces out of action, command structure decimated, infighting between commands, air power that still can't achieve air superiority against a Ukrainian air force well over ten times smaller, mercenary leaders threatening Russian power structure, worldwide sanctions crippling economy, hundreds of thousands fleeing Russia in it's latest great brain drain, but not to fear, they're making 'minor progress'.
