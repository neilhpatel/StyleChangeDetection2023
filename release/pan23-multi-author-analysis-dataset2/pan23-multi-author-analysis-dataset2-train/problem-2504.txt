So from my own responses, i think there is a large room for technical comments when they are necessary for, or accompany, an actual and sufficient historical answer. I try to avoid responses like my own on Originalism, as it is of such technical nature as to rather belong on some legal subreddit, and isn't even comprehensive or conclusive in regards to that technical nature. I feel like it can come off as just being critical of the questioner or their (lack of) knowledge, without that being necessary for, or giving them, the history they were seeking.
Got extremely good news from the university-level promotion and tenure committee Still a few more steps before it is finalized but we're nearly there...
But considering it's a history sub, i do feel like it's my responsibility to first clear up the premises, but then also give the historical context to the technical expertise as well, so the questioner recieves a proper and good response. I don't feel like there is much point to just criticise questions on Ask Historians without providing a historical answer.
