I cannot find any mention in the CVC that gives any weight at all to lane markings, other than they must be obeyed.
The CA Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices states that a yield line is made of a line of triangles, not a solid line. I can't find any mandate that every lane be marked, though I agree it is confusing.
I think that within the letter of the law, you approached an intersection with a stop sign and solid lines, and no positive indication that the right-turn lane was for yielding.
Without an explicit Yield sign, the intersection should probably be treated as a stop sign, such as an intersection with no signs/lights or malfunctioning lights. I looked around on Street View at a couple similar intersections in the area, and others have either explicit stop or yield signage, so it's hard to say for sure. One could speculate that the officer was posted up there because of the ambiguity of the intersection.
One thing that might save you is the California Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, says stop signs should be installed on the right hand side of the approach it controls. With that stop sign to the left of you, a good lawyer might argue it doesn't apply to you.
Whether or not you have a successful defense is hard to say. If I were in your place, I'd consult with a traffic lawyer.
