Beyond that Pompeo is just trying to get free press for fundraising and a doomed from day one potential presidential bid.
Mike Pompous Pompeo calling anyone else filthy is such a joke. Written up thousands of times for improper behaviour at CIA. This clown wants to run for President and doesn't realize that his entire record of poor performance will be made public and that's not even counting his self dealing while in the position of Secretary of State. By 2024 the Freedom of Information Act filings will begin to produce useable information that will hopefully lead to his being prosecuted.
>Speaking to the Guardian Weingarten said Pompeo’s remarks were not just demagogic, but also dangerous, warning that they could incite violence. She said Pompeo, who also served as Donald Trump’s CIA director, attacked her because she is “Jewish, gay, teacher and union” and was clearly stoking rightwing hate as he considers a presidential run.
Seriously, if ya didn't know the rightwing voter base has once again doubled down on Trump despite this latest neocons push of 'midterm blame' and 'anyone but Trump' narrative push.
