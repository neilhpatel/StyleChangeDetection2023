How old are you? What is your mother doing about it? If you go and report that you are violating your housing requirements (e.g. an unauthorized party has moved in) will they let you fix the problem, or will they start moving to evict all of you immediately? And if they let you fix the problem, how would you fix it, it could take weeks or months, depending on state.
Do you have any sort of agent or social worker who helped you find your housing and assists in making your rent payments? I would discuss this with them.
I work in this field. Last thing you want to do is tell housing agency or get them involved . You could possibly lose your sec 8 voucher. If he’s really abusive and your sister files a complaint there are certain protections she has under VAWA when it comes to housing in which case it would be a good idea to talk to the housing agencies housing specialist. Once you let him move in though it’ll be impossible to get rid of him . Good luck.
Going to the apartment complex is not in your best interest. They have a waiting list of people wanting to use their voucher.
I would let your sister know hes not allowed in and cops will be called if he does. Let the police know he needs to be removed due to apartment restrictions and he's trying to bully a move in.
