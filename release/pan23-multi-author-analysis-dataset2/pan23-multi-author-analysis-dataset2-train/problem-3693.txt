lol..only been about two years since a literal coup attempt..Running out of time are they? what a joke the whole system is. Toss everyone out and start fresh, since the corruption is clearly infesting everywhere.
Let it happen, but this time bring a proper force to bear and arrest every person who trespasses or otherwise commits a jail-able offense.
Half the reason it worked at all last time was because Trump hung the cops out to dry and his cronies refused to allow the national guard in to help lock the place down.
They want it to happen again so they can have political ammunition. The media will eat it up like they always do and disregard any inconveniences.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
