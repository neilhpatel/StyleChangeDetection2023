sounds like disabling the keypad like you did was a good plan. also for peace of mind while you are home you might want to invest in a "brooklyn door lock" its a bar that leverages against the floor and the doorknob. makes it impossible to open the door from the outside.
OP, Texas law requires that the landlord has a secondary deadbolt that can only be unlocked from the inside on all exterior doors.
I don't believe there are any exceptions based on building age or type of landlord/ property management company. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
The other option I did t mention was is there enough cause to break the lease. We don’t feel safe living there anymore.
For a one time entry, no, this wouldn't be a reason to break your lease without penalty. You can absolutely break it if you wanted to follow the termination procedures and pay any applicable fees that are outlined in your lease.
For peace of mind, it may be worth looking into some of the gadgets around nowadays that you can put on your doors and things to stop entry while you're home.
You don't have damages to pursue that you could sue them for. You can report them to the city if you wish.
Some of the doors to enter the building are broken and don’t lock. One is close to our apartment. They have been saying they would fix it for months but haven’t. I do feel safer having disabled the keyless entry.
I didn’t mention it in the original post as I was just trying to focus on the recent issue. I did call my city’s code enforcement and i’m waiting for them to send someone out.
the batteries are on the inside of the apartment. I took the batteries out and hid the piece that holds the batteries so only we can add the batteries back or someone would have to bring a replacement.
