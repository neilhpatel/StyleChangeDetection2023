There could be an unjust enrichment claim if the price was clearly an error that folks took advantage of. Check the terms for how they handle errors and omissions.

Whether they have the right to unwind the sale will depend on if they have something in the terms and conditions regarding this kind of situation. Any enforcement of the terms of that agreement (returning the kit, paying the difference, fees for collection etc) would be by way of on individual small claims actions. Again, unlikely.
An attorney in your state will clarify whether the company has a claim here but I'd bet they don't.
In order to succeed at an unjust enrichment claim they'd have to sue each individual. Unlikely they will do that.
It's not worth their time to have an attorney fight you on it if you decide to ignore them. Have an attorney send them a letter if you hear anything else on this issue and they likely won't fight you on it.
Have seen something similar happen on the legacy forum a few years back where an aluminum control arm went on sale for <$100 instead $500. There was a dogpile of orders, some got shipped before they realized it. I won't describe the legal outcome from there because that would be anecdotal and not permitted, but ISTR it put a serious hurting on the vendor. Hopefully this action doesn't put a new / smaller enthusiast vendor out of business.
