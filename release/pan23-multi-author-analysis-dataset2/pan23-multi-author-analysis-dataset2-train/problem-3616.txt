You can’t negotiate with a NPD. And I don’t say that mildly. From her clothing choices to her hanging off the arm of a Republican Senator on the floor like she was some damn damsel in distress to the leg injury with the leg wheel she hauled everywhere for “look at me” it’s clear she has a screw lose somewhere. She just knew her “specialness” had been eliminated so she did this ploy to remain relevant and hopefully keep her seat. Oh and the money, don’t forget the money. I can’t wait until this Hot Topic mall riot grrrl gets primaried so I don’t have to ever see her curtsy in ugly clothes again.
I understand that people can change their political party whenever the hell they want. The thing I don't really understand is how you can run for office in a specific party, have people vote for you because you're in that specific party, and then just be like "okay NVM lol!".
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
