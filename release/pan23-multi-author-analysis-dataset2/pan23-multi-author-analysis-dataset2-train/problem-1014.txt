There is no law of which I am aware banning discrimination for not having a vaccination. There are the usual exceptions for disability in employment situations, but that is about it. It is likely that in the coming months, as vaccinations become more widely available, that large swaths of society will require vaccination in order to participate.
Schools all over the world will deny enrollment without vaccine records being presented. Ethiopia and other countries will deny entry without proof of polio vaccination. The UK is proposing a "vaccine passport" that would take the verification out of the individual's hands and put it at the government level. You could opt out of getting this passport (if it becomes real) but countries and others could opt out of allowing you to enter or to stay, and airlines you opt out of allowing you to fly. Employers can refuse to allow unvaccinated people to work (outside of medical exemptions). All of that is legal.
Yes and yes. Most discrimination is legal. And you aren't being refused service based on confidential medical information. Information is just information, and you gave the information. If people want it to be confidential they can choose to keep it confidential, but there are many areas in which vaccination records are required to allow for something else.
I understand the logic for kindergartens and schools - you can't enroll your kid in one if they're not vaccinated. All good. If they want to participate in society, they need to follow the rules. And I'd have no problem at all if that was the case for all vaccinations in the case of this AirBnB. But it isn't. They didn't ask me if I had a flu shot. Or tuberculosis. Or hepatitis. It's just about COVID.
