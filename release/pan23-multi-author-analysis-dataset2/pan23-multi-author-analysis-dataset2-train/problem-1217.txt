I just had a couple consultations. I’m not disagreeing with what they said – I’m asking for advice based on what they said. If I didn’t think what they said was true I wouldn’t be concerned about my chances of getting my dog.
If your soon-to-be-ex has the dog today there’s really nothing likely to change that. Except something where he agrees to give you the dog.
Hire a lawyer if you do not have one yet and tell the lawyer you want the dog in the divorce and are willing to negotiate for it (ie give up some money to your soon to be ex).
If you (OP) haven't yet negotiated the who-gets-what part of the divorce, you could try to offer more of a financial incentive (lower spousal support than you're entitled to, more of the marital cash, more than his share of the house, retirement, etc.) for him to give you the dog. But if he refuses, there's probably not much you can do, unfortunately. As much as our pets mean to us, in the eyes of the law they are property. The judge won't care who gets the dog any more than he/she will care who gets the living room lamp or the microwave. (I mean, they may be a pet owner themselves and sympathize on a personal level, but won't be able to do anything within the law.) And since the dog is currently at your ex's house, and getting him to you would likely be contentious, the judge will follow the path of least resistance and have him stay with your ex, most likely. So your best play will be to try to settle out of court and include the dog going to you as part of your negotiations, and a lawyer is the best way to strategize for this to go your way.
