I used to do criminal law. Not your lawyer, etc etc. It’s going to be really frustrating but you gotta make sure you react to this the right way. Tell your lawyer ASAP, give them screenshots if you have them. Tell them everything, including whatever your boss told you the complaining witness told them that got you fired.
Whatever you do, DO NOT respond, directly or indirectly. Not even a reaction or like or anything like that. If you have friends or family that are getting on the posts and being confrontational at all, tell them to cut that shit out immediately. If any of them notice a new post, do have them tell you right away and save a screenshot of it to pass on to your lawyer.
Basically anything you say/do can sabotage your attorney's case. Remember you hired them to represent you. When you begin acting in your own capacity, you may be unknowingly hurting your case and not letting your attorney do their job.
It's not, it's huring my reputation in my industry and my pocket. However, I'm allowed to use social media just choosing not to do so to eliminate any conflicts that could potentially arise.
Don’t respond at all. Not thru you or anyone else. Screenshot, show lawyer immediately. If an issue then your lawyer will deal with it before or during court date. You cannot, I repeat you CANNOT let it get to you and you must not respond or like or emoji.
I’m going to emphasize that it all has to go through your attorney. In my experience, it’s a balance between dealing with the posts and avoiding something that will mess up your ongoing criminal case I.e. being careful to avoid anything that might appear like pressuring or intimidating a witness.
