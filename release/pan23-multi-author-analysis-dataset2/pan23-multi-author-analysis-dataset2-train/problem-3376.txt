Most employers are reasonable about it and will spread overpayments out over several paychecks (they've already offered 2, you can tell them it's Christmas and money is tight and they may offer more). But if you're being antagonistic with them, they may choose to exercise their right to recover the entire sum from your next paycheck (edit: barring any state laws that may limit this ability).
You're going to have to pay it, one way or the other. See if HR is willing to handle it over 3 or 4 paychecks, otherwise you're going to have to bite the bullet and budget around it. I'm sorry this happened.
This has happened to me, too. It sucks but mistakes happen. Also should note that it's itemized on your pay stub so the fact it wasn't being deducted is also something you should have noticed and asked HR about on your very first paycheck. Unfortunately I've seen way too many employers who can't figure pay correctly, I double check every pay stub for appropriate deductions and make sure my pay was calculated correctly.
