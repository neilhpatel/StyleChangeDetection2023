My grand parents were both born to Jewish Russian immigrants who came to the US in late 1800s. I'm pretty sure I'm related to the late Don Rickles but no way to know since both our family trees are missing pieces. Kinda random comment here but why not.
It sounds like you're not Jewish, not Russian nor Ukrainian, and you don't know match about yourself either. Basically, you care less about all of that shit - we call life.
I live in Manhattan so anywhere you can reasonably get around by car is the suburbs. One of the Russian families had a hummer, why on earth do you need that? Didnâ€™t even fit in the garage.
its... not turning back. its Bibiland and going to remain that way. an influx of normal people isn't going to fix that... especially not with the tens of thousands who have fled to other places...
Hell, one MILLION Jews left the Soviet bloc the instant it collapsed. Most of them went to israel, the rest seemed to have moved to suburban Brooklyn where they live in the ugliest houses on the planet.
when i was young and idealistic i thought to move there in my 30s... almost had a chance late 30s but the process for new immigrants then kinda sucked, and the military gave me cold shoulder when i asked about work there (so i could continue in my very specific field).
within 5-7 years i was thanking God that I didn't go, by talkinig to people who fled the country when it took the sharp turn to the right.
