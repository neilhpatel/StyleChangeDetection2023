It’s been a weird and wild trip. When I was growing up “anti-Russian” was still very much the default sentiment, it would be years before we got to know them as people. You saw the shift from every big action movie having a Russian baddie into some other paradigm, and even the Russians in Tom Clancy books started to be a bit less dire.
And then Vladimir Putin happened, and it’s been the weirdest thing to relearn all of the reasons why Russia was hated and feared. Almost two decades of utter brutality at every scale, from the individual such as Litvinenko and the Skripals, to Grozny, to Bucha. They really are an “evil empire” after all.
I remember the smugness and complacency of those times. The unearned moral superiority. The absolute conviction that we were moving forward and leaving behind that cold-war mindset; that we were so much more open-minded than the generations that came before us.
ah yes, the unexpected front that won't end well for Russia either. Historically they've never had a good navy except by numerical standards, with the only exceptional thing about them is their ability to handle the harsh Artic environment. Other nation's ships can also handle the Artic these days, but not to the same level of contempt as a Russian vessel and be able to get away with it.
