Have you seen how long Putin's tables are? None of these guys have a chance to get close enough to him without passing a window first and we all know what happens when you pass a window in Russia.
It could be that, it could be Putin doing some purging, it could also be infighting between oligarcys, it could also be someone else trying to isolate Putin.
The reason why they have been handed money is that their positions are key to ensure power in Russia. It's not possible to hold power over everyone alone without help and in a dictatorship, these key positions of power want a piece of the pie. This is why I think that these deaths are an indication that Putin is losing control because there are insufficient funds to maintain key positions of power in the same way as before.
Unfortunately, things wouldn't get immediately better if Putin were to die. That is part of the strategy. I would be willing to bet that many of these "untimely" deaths are less about Putin and more about rivalries among power-centers below Putin.
