The best interaction I had is when I had a car crash where I crashed against the railing on the autobahn and I lost controll totaling my car the police was realy nice even letting me wait in their car while I waited for pick up. When I honestly toled them how fast I was (I was to fast for the turn) they toled me you probably where driving with less speed would be kinda bad on the inshurence report if you where driving that fast.
‘A cannot be b’ which I have already predetermined with the transcendental idealism that is given to me by GOD.
Even tho we have such a lax law oh BTW this is all contained inside one single law. We only have as many guns per capita as Germany a country where it is nearly impossible to get any guns a country where you have to actively participate in a gun related sport to keep the gun if you stop participating or take a break for too long you have to give up your gun. Why we have so few guns is because Austrians feel relatively safe. Most violence is non Austrian on non Austrian like Serbs stabbing other eastern Europeans or Eastern Europeans stabbing asylum seekers. Crime directed towards Austrians is relatively rare.
I live in Europe and all police encounters where pleasant exept one where I had a car crash and the police didn't even leave their cars to properly asses the situation.
