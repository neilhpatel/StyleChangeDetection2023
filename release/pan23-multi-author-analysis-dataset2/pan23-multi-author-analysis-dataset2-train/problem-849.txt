It _will_ require melting and machining, but as you pointed out finding/tricking workers should be a minor issue and the metal itself has a comparatively low melting point (a shy higher than copper and much lower than steel) so no spesial tools or equipment is nessesary.
But if it is enriched to 'weapons grade' constructing a gun type bomb is pretty low tech stuff not requiring not much more than the ability to melt and machine metals and some high explosives with a basic fuse.
True, though also depends on what shape the uranium metal itself was in and whether it needs to be machined/forged/cast. Doing so would create its own problems but I suppose they could find some folk who don't know enough to ask questions or believe their deaths are worth it in the service of the cause.
Hadn't yet read the article when I posted. It said Iran's stockpiles were estimated at about 30kg and 60% purity. Don't you need 90% enriched for weapons?
Little Boy contained over 60kg of HEU and less than a kilo of that underwent fission, so wouldn't they need at least 20kg to get even a few kilotons of yield?
