If you fear that she may harm you, you may want to consider getting a peace bond against her. That is a tool under section 810 of the Criminal Code where the court will set up specific terms that she will have to abide. Since you are neighbours it may be restricted to non-communication and staying off your land and not interfering with your chattel property.
I'm not sure that your neighbour's behaviour would rise to the level that a peace bond would be issued. You may have a case that you fear she will cause personal harm or will damage your property. You may want to find a criminal lawyer to get an opinion.
I don't practice in this area and this is not legal advice. I'm just letting you know that I have heard of this.
You said you tried to file a complaint for harassment, what about one for assault for pushing your wife? Or charges for trespassing on your property?
As for the construction company, did they not press charges for moving their equipment and coming onto a job site when unauthorized?
Iâ€™m questioning why the police did not file the report because it falls under criminal code RSC 1985 c C 46 number 264 1-3. They knew it was happening and did nothing to help.
Keep a objective recording of all interactions with her including words and actions exchanged. You'll need it for the courts if you decide to go that way.
