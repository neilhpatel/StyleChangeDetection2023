The easiest solution to the problem is for your mom to evict him so you can live there. If he truly did this underhanded shit and your mom is okay with it, you need to find another place to live regardless.
My little sister told me him and her have been fighting and are going to separate soon. He has been sleeping in the guest room as of late, but my mom is also kind of spineless. I hate to say bad things about someone who can’t defend herself but I know her better than anyone. But you’re right, getting him out of the home would be fantastic, and maybe that’s where this will head. I know very little because they both avoided me like the plague for the past few weeks. Thank you friend, I appreciate your response.
Then you should really talk to your mom about having her serve him written notice to vacate. If that's been served upon him and you, your mom, and your sister go to the hearing and testify that there's no need for a protective order, nothing happened, and even if boyfriend is afraid of you, nothing is going to happen in the future because he's not going to be living there much longer and you will be.
Yes, it was an ex-parte protection order so I need to go into the court Monday and file for an appeal hearing, I think, which will be set for 5-10 days after my appeal is filed.
As said in the post, the constable came yesterday and removed me from the home with not much more than the clothes on my back and what little I could grab from my room in the 5 minutes I was given.
