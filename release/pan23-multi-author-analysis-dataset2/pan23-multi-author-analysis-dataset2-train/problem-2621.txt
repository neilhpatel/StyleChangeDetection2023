If you haven’t moved out yet, make sure to take a video and pictures of everything in the unit including every scuff mark and what not include a ruler on the picture for size reference. Also insist on a walk through where he signs off on the condition. At this point, if he is still playing games on you paying to repaint, I’d tell him that after three years repainting a rental is to be expected and you are prepared to take this to small claims court.
Even if you did paint one of the walls a different shade of white, the wall paint is at end of life for a rental property. Interior paint in rental property has a life expectancy of 3 years according to HUD. Any reasonable landlord expects to have to repaint and do some small scuff repair after 3 years.
This is not a wear and tear issue as such, as - assuming you had painted - that is not normal wear and tear. Instead, this is a dispute about the condition you received the unit in and whether you did or did not make unauthorized changes to it. Hanging things on the walls _is_ a wear and tear issue, but that's not what the dispute is about.
If he sues, the burden of proof is on him, but it would be prudent to assemble whatever evidence you have and to be prepared to present it in your response.
