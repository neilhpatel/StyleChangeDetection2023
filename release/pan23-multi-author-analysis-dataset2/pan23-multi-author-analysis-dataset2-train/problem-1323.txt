Georgia classifies bicycles as vehicles and as such you must obey traffic laws. You should not be biking on the sidewalk nor should you be biking against traffic. Under no circumstances should you ever bike across a crosswalk, you should be getting off your bike and walking it across the street in the crosswalk.
Given the facts that you laid out it appears that you did not properly follow traffic laws. The issue with suing the other driver is a different story. You can try to file a claim with his insurance or sue him in the appropriate venue depending on the extent of your damages. You've already gotten on lawyer to say that he won't take the case, I'm not saying it's impossible to get damages paid but that one lawyer is a lot more familiar with the specifics of your case than anyone here.
However, this is going to trial and I'm not going to plead guilty. If you can help me out with questions two and three, I'd really appreciate it.
Understood, thank you for the insight. Can you tell me if the officer cited me under the correct statute, and if not, could I use that as a basis to fight the ticket?
To answer question 3: I'd think that the police officer would be there. I don't see why the other driver would need to be there or what good he would be as a witness for you. This is not a trial for the accident it's a trial for you biking on the sidewalk/crosswalk. But if you really want to pursue this you should be talking with a lawyer.
Yeah, I guess I might have to talk to a lawyer. Thank you. The only other thing I have to say is, if I ever decide I want to be honked at, screamed the N-word at, run over and possibly shot, then I'll start riding my bike on the street in Rome, GA. Have a lovely day, sir.
