JFC - I thought Trump was bad. This kid is out of control - has a single claim he's made been true at this point? He's already lied about his voting record in office before he was ever officially sworn in. Our government is so fucking broken that the American people have zero recourse for a candidate like this. We really need to be able to recall government officials. If that needs to be done by a vote, so be it, but this shit is out of control.

The election of Donald Trump, the OJ Simpson trial and Saddam Hussein invading Kuwait were the three best things ever to happen to CNN. They all gave them a ratings bonanza.
