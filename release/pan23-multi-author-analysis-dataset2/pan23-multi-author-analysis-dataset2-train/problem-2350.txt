In practical terms, what is the difference? If the sale is forced and goes through she will be for all intents and purposes, be 'evicted'. No not evicted in a legal sense but that detail seems irrelevant.
Because she will have a right of redemption and can make arrangements with whomever buys it at the foreclosure auction. Or it may not sell. Depends how much equity is in the home.
Is she a homeowner or a tenant? If she's a tenant, unless the HOA is somehow also her landlord, then they can't evict her. That has to be done by the owner of the home. And if she's the homeowner, then they also can't evict her because the HOA doesn't own the house (though they can do other things that could lead to getting the boot).
Does she own it outright or is there a mortgage? Is she current on her mortgage? Has she tried talking to the board of directors to get back on track on her payment plan?
She should still seek out an attorney even if she seems to not afford one at this time. Very likely one attorney in your area would be able to work with you on the manner you pay for attorney fees.
