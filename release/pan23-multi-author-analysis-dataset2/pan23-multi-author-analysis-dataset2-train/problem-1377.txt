The vampires will constantly do things like take a picture of a person traveling at night, post it to Twitter and Facebook and explain in detail how that person MUST be a vampire because they travelled at night.
I'm going to write a series of vampire novels were vampires walk around accusing everyone else of being a vampire. The vampires will scream for anti-vampire laws to be passed. They'll demand a wooden steak in every house. They'll sell steaks with funny sayings on it. The MyPillow Guy will become super anti-coffin.
The twist ending will be that the vampires are scared of vampires. It won't make any sense, and everyone will hate it.
This is the worst case of voter fraud I've seen. Carried out by the party screaming about voter fraud. Same with the election machine tampering and Trumps effing with votes. The blatant hypocrisy is absolutely... epic? Cataclysmic? Gobsmacking? Biblical? How far ridiculous can these people go before it all implodes, and are they hell bent on taking our country with them?
Another republican voter fraud no wonder they know there is voter fraud they are the ones doing it in the front of everyoneâ€™s eyes. Jail these people for 25 years.
