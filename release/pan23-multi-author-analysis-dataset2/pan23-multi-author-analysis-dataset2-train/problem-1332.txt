In order to be considered to have "abandoned" the apartment, they need to be delinquent on rent and indicate "reasonably" that they do not intend to return. In my opinion "saying they are leaving" and leaving the key are good practical indicators, so their tenancy probably ends at the end of May.
Unless you are the master tenant, this is your landlord's obligation to release your roommate from the lease and deal with their personal property.
They are on the lease with me and no they haven't payed me or the landlord rent for June yet. I have messages from before they started refusing to communicate that definitely show they plan to abandon the apartment. I sent the apartment manager an email so hopefully I will hear back soon and we can get the process started of getting them off the lease.
It can be tricky to end a joint lease and enter into another cleanly with a new roommate. Be proactive explaining the situation to your landlord.
Inventory your roommate's stuff and take some photos before boxing it up. I don't recommend removing it from the premises until after June 1.
