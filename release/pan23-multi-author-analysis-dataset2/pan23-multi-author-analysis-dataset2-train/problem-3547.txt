As it stands, there are no obvious objectives for the west in Iran. In addition to that, since Iraq and Afghanistan, the US doesn't have the military backing of its allies in offensive wars, and still on top of that the west is already entangled in a war in Ukraine. With Iran being a large country with a decently powerful military, a military intervention will be an extremely expensive project that the west is absolutely not interested in right now. Iran in its current state is actually quite useful to the west since its the local boogeyman being used to sell expensive weapons to other countries in the region. If anything the west would be more inclined to look the other way as Iran signs the execution of 14'000 people or commits other atrocities than to try and help its people. Which is literally what they did and were going to continue to do were it not for mass protests internationally which at least got them to just acknowledge that there's unrest in Iran.
The full quote, from Thomas Jefferson, is “the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants.” Never forget that it isn’t just the blood of tyrants spilled, it’s also the blood of those with the courage to stand against them.
