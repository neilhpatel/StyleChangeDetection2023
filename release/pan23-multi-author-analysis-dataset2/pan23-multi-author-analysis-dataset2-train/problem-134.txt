Contact your insurance and provide them with the evidence. I always love people that think that signs saying they're not responsible for things actually absolves them of liability.
Correct but rocks hitting windshields happen on the highway. If the person was driving in accordance with those law and was the proper distance away (99.999% of us don't) debris wouldn't hit you.
It does in some states, if your not the proper distance away like 3 seconds then you're following to close. 3 seconds at 65mph would be farther then 200 ft and the debris wouldn't hit you.
Well yes, but that's traffic law. It doesn't really have anything to do with the signage disclaiming liability. Around where I live, people love posting signs at garage sales that say "not responsible for accidents." I always roll my eyes.
If you don’t have glass coverage, you can still claim it, and it will fall under comprehensive. I did mostly commercial claims, so I could be wrong about this, but I believe comprehensive claims also don’t cause your rates to go up.
Sorry for multiple posts but try contacting the company, some large companies will pay it out in good faith, small ones won't.
I was the manager of a rental car counter for ten years in Arizona, so I’ve handled TONS of glass claims.
If you carry glass coverage, the fastest and best way to handle this is through insurance. In addition, if you carry glass coverage the claim will not affect your insurance rates.
Some newer windshields can be expensive for sure, but not expensive enough to warrant a lawyer, in my opinion. Go through your insurance, let them subrogate (fight) for you.
