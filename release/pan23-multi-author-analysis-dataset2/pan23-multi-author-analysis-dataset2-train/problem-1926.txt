I know a lot of people write off the whole "shit really sucked in the 80s with 15% interest rates" comments older people make because its different given just how much nominal debt people have now and how high house prices are compared to back then. But like, the lesson isn't about the specifics, its about how difficult things can get economically with big recessions and high inflation and interest rates to combat that. The idea that society has survived those things before and will survive this shouldn't be so crazy.
When Liz Truss became the prime minister, people began joking that her premiership would have the shelf life of a head of lettuce. In response, a British tabloid set up a livestream of a head of lettuce next to a portrait of Truss. She actually did resign before the lettuce spoiled, and the tabloid declared the lettuce victorious.
Basically when the Bank of England called out the lettuce government it's way too clear that every nation is just in a waiting game to see which one of them collapses first. Sri Lanka is just the beginning, just wait.
