>Police also released two composite sketches of the masked suspects, based on details provided by two eyewitnesses, as well as brief written descriptions of the three men. During the abduction, one had a holstered gun and another had imitation handcuffs.
A few years ago, someone converted a private vehicle to look like a police car (including with lightbars), and went on a shooting spree in the Maritimes with stolen guns / guns smuggled from the US. Perhaps that incident proved that you can do whatever you want to look like a cop.
Never forget that the rcmp hid this fact from Nova Scotians for 13 hours, while the criminal posed as a police officer and killed people by stopping them like a traffic stop.
On the contrary, as a 2nd gen Canadian immigrant myself, I'm concerned that our government, which has a record of doing too little, too late, will continue to ignore this problem due to 1) CCP bribes 2) fears of being labeled racist. Maybe we need to get a POC PM to get all these supposedly racist policies through cause white libs are too busy patting each other on the back over who can be the most woke. Fwiw, I am not a trumpist/trucker supporter either; those people are a disgrace.
