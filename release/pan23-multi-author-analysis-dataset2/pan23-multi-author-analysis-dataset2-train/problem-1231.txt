We wonder why teacher colleges are shutting down everywhere, with over 100,000 less teacher undergrad degrees compared to the 1970s?
We wonder why schools are having to go to 4 day school weeks because there are so few teachers left?
What's extra wild is that there's a popular belief spread by conservative media that American teachers make six figures salaries and get insane pensions, like the last time I heard it, it was 300k a year, as the norm.
Yeah, but the cost of living is abyssmal in America for teachers, and the rest of the world actually respects teachers to get them places to live and find financial security. America has no respect for teachers, and they wonder why they have to outsource to the Phillipines to find teachers.
