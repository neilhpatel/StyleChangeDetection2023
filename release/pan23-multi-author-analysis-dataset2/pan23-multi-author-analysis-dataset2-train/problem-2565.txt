How do you know? Do you know where they moved to? Where they got a new job? What the new job is paying? Sounds like you're making A LOT of assumptions to fit your narrative. Even if your assumptions are correct, that doesn't change the fact that I already pointed out a solution to that problem: if you want people to work for you, you have to pay them enough to live near you. It sounds like the area you're in is getting gentrified, which is why rent prices are going up. If the area is getting gentrified, that means higher income people are moving into the area, which means you can charge them more for food. Have you seen how much more people are paying for food through DoorDash and GrubHub and other services. People are willing to pay more than you think. Your assertion that people aren't willing to pay more also sounds like another flawed assumption to fit your narrative.
There is far more to homeownership and buying a house than the interest rate of your mortgage and it's not feasible for a lot of people. You're being a little short sighted, to say the least.
