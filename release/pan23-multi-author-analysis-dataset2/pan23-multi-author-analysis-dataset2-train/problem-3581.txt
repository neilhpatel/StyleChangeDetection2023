You can be evicted over a delinquent balance with your landlord. The actual sources of that balance isn't terribly important.
You're missing my point. Just because someone didn't come to you and say, "you owe this" doesn't mean you don't owe it, and it shouldn't be a surprise that you do. You weren't paying your rent in full on time. Your lease, which you should have read before you signed, has terminology in it that controls what happens when you don't pay your rent in full and on time.
More importantly, in general landlords apply payments to the oldest charges first. So you're delinquent on something from last month, not months ago.
At that level of accumulated late fees this seems to take on the context of a landlord who has become fed up with consistently late payments.
Ok so I can be evicted but I wasn’t told the amount until this month and he’s not accepting no partial payments why wasn’t I notified that I had all these late fees when I kept renewing the lease what should I do.
Well let me go into details the pm at the time did not add the fees within 2017-19 the head manager went back into his ledger and then added it up so this was actually negligence on the pm so now we have to pay this up front.
I might consider either consulting a lawyer or offering something like “I’ll pay 1/2 the late fees, all the rent, and be out by the end of November.”.
