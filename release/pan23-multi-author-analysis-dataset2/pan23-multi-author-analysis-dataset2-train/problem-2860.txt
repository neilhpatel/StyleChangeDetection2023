If that's all you said, it's unlikely to be granted. Recommendation would be to cease communication though. Clearly it's no longer a two-way relationship as you've been restricted in various forms.
So long as you stop trying to contact her (because it's somewhat clear she doesn't want any more contact with you), a restraining order might seem unlikely.
Then you might be served with notice of a hearing and then there might be a hearing where she's required to show up and justify the need for it and you're required (or have the opportunity) to show up and defend against the need for it.
But until you're actually served with an actual notice of an actual hearing, there's not much to do except refrain from drunk-dialing her (or communicating with her at all).
