Very few jurisdictions accept a text as meeting the requirements for “written” notice. You could conceivably write your landlord a letter stating that you are entitled to written notice before ending your tenancy, therefore you will not be vacating at the end of the month. The landlord has missed the deadline for this month, and the the earliest he could legally terminate your tenancy is the end of December. That would give you a reasonable amount of time to secure new housing.
If you are paying rent monthly, your landlord needs to give you at least one months notice, in writing. Have you received that? If you have, what sort of rights are you looking for? More time?
Rights so far as this is very abrupt and out of nowhere but I guess they can do that just kind of frustrating since it's so soon.
They sent a text message that they are going to sell the house and I have until the end of the month to leave. So it looks like this would be considered "writing". So I have 30 days from when they sent me a text which was 2 days ago and I paid rent today? (is a text message considered writing?).
