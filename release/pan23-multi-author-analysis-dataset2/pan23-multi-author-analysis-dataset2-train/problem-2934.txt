I doubt a very large corporation would intentionally short pay its employees in such an obvious manner. That's just asking for trouble. Based on the huge variations in the hours worked figure on your pay stub, my guess is that you have to fill in timesheets and they either weren't done properly or were transcribed/recorded incorrectly. Or they took the hours worked from a schedule and messed it up somehow. Either way, talk to HR first. If you're there 40 hours a week, every week, it'll be easy for them to verify that.
First fix the hours so they're correct. Then, you can calculate how much you should have been paid and compare it to what HR says the updated pay is before any withholdings and deductions. See if that matches. Then verify the withholdings. Tax is unlikely to be deducted wrong, since the payroll software does that for them. But other deductions might be goofed too.
Yeah I don't think it's intentional either. My manager is kind of a dumbass but it's also hard to consistently fuck that up for over a year. Sometimes it says I worked for 10 hours and still get paid 0.
The 0 take-home pay for 10 hours worked could be from non-tax deductions like 401k, ESPP, subsidized public transit pass, etc. I don't see how gross pay can be 0 for >0 hours.
Are you actually missing money in your paychecks, or are your pay stubs just showing different hours but you're still getting the same amount of pay each week? Also, are you actually paid on an hourly basis, or are you salaried? It seems very odd that you wouldn't notice that you were missing a full week's pay on a regular basis.
