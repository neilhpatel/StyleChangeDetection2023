There is no possibility that police will use past circumstantial evidence of drug use to charge a minor with drug possession. You can't test a picture in a lab like you can actual drugs. You could appear on video injecting heroin, saying "I, makemebacon2, sure do love this heroin, in this California county on this specific day !" and they still wouldn't charge you.
IANAL (mods feel free to delete this if I'm wrong) but I don't think you can actually be arrested for using drugs in the past.
Those are criminal harassment and extortion, both serious crimes. Text messages or testimony are real evidence of those crimes.
I know you can be arrested for possession, buying/selling, DUI/DWI/OUI, but I'm not sure you can actually be retro-actively arrested or fined unless you break some other law.
If anything the people who would have given you the drugs would be in trouble, (depending on the type of drugs, I don't know if the PD would even care to investigate it).
That being said, if you're being threatened with bodily harm by another person, you should go to your parents or other authority for help (especially if you have evidence).
