The EU is unconditionally by Ukraine's side. When it comes to the beef between China and the US, the EU remains mostly neutral. That could change if China was to provide Russia with weapons to prolong this war of aggression. I sincerely don't think that's something China wants to occur.
I can almost hear trump saying "the china is going to give russia some guns? well our guns are the best in the world, the best, like my resort and you know that's good. Well we're gonna give some of those guns to taiwan because we can show them how good we are already better than china!" Sorry I am sure that sounds too coherent, I have trouble impersonating stupid.
Same problem, they're already recognized out the wazoo. Everybody already recognizes their name, flag, territory, government, passport, citizenship, embassies, economic trade as an independent county, military cooperation with an independent country...
us is not being belligerent if everybody wants its aid and security and its only china complaining about it, that’s just the facts of life and not being the popular kid, can complain all you want but you’re not going to get popular by name calling everybody and only makes you more pathetic.
edit: china has no hegemony but an imagined one, seeing it any other way is falling to their propaganda.
The only thing left to do is to add them to the official UN list of recognized countries. Other than that, they're already a country in every other possible way.
