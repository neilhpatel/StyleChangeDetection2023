Rent to Own contracts have specific requirements in many States in order for them to be valid and enforceable. The first thing you need to be sure is that the rent to own contract itself is sufficient. Once she finds the contract, she should take it to a real estate attorney to review and see what her options are.
Without knowing the specifics of the contract it is hard to tell. If the contract is enforceable and if she is now eligible to exercise her right to purchase at an agreed upon price, she might be able to immediately sell the house at a much higher price. Given how much house prices have gone up over the past 5 years the house value could be above the purchase price. If it is valid you can reassign your purchase option to another buyer at a higher price prior to closing so you would not need to bring money to closing. Even though she might prefer to stay in the house, taking the equity on sale might be better than spending more time and money on an invalid contract.
You could play dumb and say your mom is thinking about moving and see if the signed purchase contract magically appears to enforce the fees of her terminating the lease and purchase contract. If she doesn't have a signed lease than your mom essentially is on a month to month lease.
