If I remember correctly Abbott was telling people not to long ago that they would have to ration their A/C use or risk messing up the power grid. It was like right on the heels of the power going out when it got to cold.
Well, if they are cooplp with power outages, cold winters, hot summers, and high prices, let them have it. If they cry for federal dollars, tell them to bootstrap it and remember their Texas values: small mind, small government, big trucks, big oil. I'm sure the hate in their hearts can keep them warm.
I don’t like him either but what does hot summers and high prices exactly mean? We have the lowest gas prices and some pretty low grocery prices. Plus we can’t really control the summers. They’ve been super hot sense before the United States was the formed.
