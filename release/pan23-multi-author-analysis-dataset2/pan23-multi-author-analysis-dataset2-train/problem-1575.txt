I did some research and it seems a trial in absentia is illegal in the US unless the person consents to it or they are being disruptive while in the courtroom, neither will apply to my case. For a bench warrant to be issued you must have willfully not appeared in court. If the hospital forbids you from leaving, and the court is aware of this, won't that make it illegal for the judge to issue one?
If you try this the next time, expect to be told to appear the next day with proof of the medical emergency. If you don't, it will be considered a failure to appear and a warrant will be issued for your arrest.
(2)Unless the defendant consents in writing to the contrary, the trial shall not commence less than thirty days from the date on which the defendant first appears through counsel or expressly waives counsel and elects to proceed pro se.
It's federal law and applies in federal court, not in state court, and it does not apply where the defendant has failed to appear.
You don't get out of a criminal charge by not showing up. Don't you think everyone would do that if it were possible?
