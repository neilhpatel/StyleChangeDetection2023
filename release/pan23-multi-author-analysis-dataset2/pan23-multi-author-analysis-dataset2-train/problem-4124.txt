Your remedy here is to tell them not to call you. If there's any chance they're going to sue you, that may trigger it.
You can't stop them from doing that - except perhaps by making some kind of payment arrangement or paying off your account.

How old is the debt? Sometimes debt collectors try to collect on debts that are past the limitations period. If that’s the case, or if the period is almost here, then do NOT send a payment—in some jurisdictions that will reset the clock on the limitations period.
