>Idaho Statutes - § 18-1406 - Possession of Burglarious Instruments. Every person having upon him, or in his possession, a picklock, crow, key, bit, or other instrument or tool, with intent feloniously to break or enter into any building or who shall knowingly make or alter, or shall attempt to make or alter any key or other instrument above named, so that the same will fit or open the lock of a building, without being requested so to do by some person having the right to open the same, or who shall make, alter, or repair, any instrument or thing, knowing, or having reason to believe, that it is intended to be used in committing a misdemeanor or felony, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
If you don't have a good way to verify that the person who hired you to open the lock does, in fact, live where they want you to open, then you should not be opening the door for them.
You have to know, or have reason to believe, the person asking you to lock pick has the right to do so. If you know or have reason to believe that they don’t have the right, you are guilty of a misdemeanor.
Perhaps contact your local legal aid office and ask if they have any suggestions? You could also reach out to local locksmiths to see about getting hired on as a part time employee to better your skills. If there is a high enough demand it’s entirely possible they could use an extra person.
Locksmiths likely have insurance that can protect them in such situations. While the matching ID to the address is a good suggestion, it’s not foolproof. My license still has my old address on it. A disgruntled ex could have an ID with that address. It’s a risk.
