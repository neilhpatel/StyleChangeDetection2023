Yes, I'm sure as a 13 year old you have much more understanding of brain cancer than the doctors with years and years of schooling working on him and the solution is just this simple.
Medical procedures are incredibly complex and it doesn't often come down to something as simple as "just remove it". As an eleven year old, he has no authority to demand a doctor perform surgery on him and do what he says, nor do you.
well his parents obviously don't give a fuck about him and clearly neither do the medical staff. So it's either he manages to make it to 14 and get emancipated then sue, or he fucking dies. I don't want my friend to fucking die.
I realize that you are probably very scared right now but you need to understand that you just don't have all the facts. There are a number of reasons why they would choose not to operate, one is that the tumor is very small, very slow growing and brain surgery poses more risks that surgery at this time. His parents can take him for another opinion and if he feels that he does not undersand why this choice was made a doctor should explain it to him, but this is not a legal issue.
If you believe he's being abused, you can report that to CPS for your state, but again, I am certain there is more to this situation than you know.
