I don't think Russia understands that ceasefires aren't actually a unilateral tool available to the loosing aggressor in a conflict they started. Like you don't get to punch someone in the face, then get kicked in the balls, and then say "OK, lemme go get my gun from the car, be right back.".
Yeah, Russia didn't "ask" for a ceasefire... they ordered one. It was of course rejected because you can't order the people you invade to stop shooting you for 36 hours so you can regroup and kill them better in a few days... that's simply not how war works.
But Putin doesn't have enough controll over his army to follow through. He is too weak to give a direct order and have it obayed. It was the Russian bloggers that were talking about retaliating if Ukraine strikes them during the ceasefire. I guess now we know why they aren't dead yet.
It’s weird that this gets spun here like Russia promised a cease fire. They proposed one, Ukraine said no, so there won’t be a cease fire and the attacks continue. Ukraine is rightfully not negotiating with these terrorists.
