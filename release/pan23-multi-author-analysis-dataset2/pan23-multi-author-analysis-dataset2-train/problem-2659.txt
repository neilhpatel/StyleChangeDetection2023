I hope that a security guard would not have access to much of interest. Time to start executing traitors again. Clearly jail time is not enough of a deterrent.
I follow that, and agree with the sentiment, but something needs to be done to increase the deterrent factor. Russia is doing a good job destabilizing the world, China too. People cooperating with these (and other) nations need to be truly frightened of the consequences of working with these states.
I agree to an extent but the punishment must match the crime. We can all agree that betraying your country to a violent dictatorship is not good but we are not in the 20th century anymore where most feels a sense of loyalty to their country. We are also not in war time. Punishment is necessary but taking it to far brings us closer to those that we say weâ€™re better than.
I'd be more deterred by a lenhy prison-sentence than by capital punishment. Especially at his age, I'd be begging for them to execute me rather than locking me up.
US embassies are guarded by US Marines with top secret clearances, we don't fuck around with 58 year old civilian security guards.
