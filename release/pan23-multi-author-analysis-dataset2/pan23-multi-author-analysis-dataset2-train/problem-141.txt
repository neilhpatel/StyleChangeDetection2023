The key to the whole problem is renter's insurance. Get some, even if you do live in a richer/safer neighborhood. Always have renter's insurance.
If they promise as a contractual obligation that they will have certain security systems, those systems do have to work for their intended purpose. But to recover under that kind of situation, you have to prove that the harm you suffered would have been prevented if the system worked.
The gist of it is that as long as the apartment complex isn't \causing\ the problems, and the people who are causing them are coming in from the outside, the complex isn't liable for the damages that residents experience.
Local neighborhood conditions do not need to be disclosed, generally, prior to leasing, again unless the landlord is somehow causing them. The idea here is that the landlord still has a right to rent out the property, even in a neighborhood where you can hear gunfire and car alarms all night long. People who can't afford to live elsewhere would have no places to live if the landlords couldn't make money.
Edit: The other thing to do is to have that conversation with the local police, or other people in the area, before signing the lease. Know the neighborhood before you commit to it (I know that's not always possible or practical, though).
