I've seen about half the panels since we've been doing recording this past week and I'm one of the producers. I'd say they all are pretty amazing of course and each of them has something pretty special to it. But you are definitely right to be pumped about the Indigenous histories panel. The history and issues are so personal for the panelists, and it shows, with this incredible raw, emotional energy running through the whole session. It packs a punch.
By now hopefully you have heard right here on the subreddit from Sept 15-17. We have a ton of exciting things planned and we don't want you to miss any of it!
Interested in watching the live keynote, "The Atomic Bomb and Visions of the New Post War Order", from /u/restricteddata?!
Want to see it all? The full schedule is now available, so make sure to mark these down on your calendar! All Panels will be released on YouTube and perpetually accessible from their date onwards. Time refers to the AMA with the panelists that will be hosted on reddit.
From the feedback we got from the production team, the actual questions we anticipate are along the lines of 'where can I buy audiobooks voiced by you?'.
