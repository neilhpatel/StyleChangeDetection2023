Thank you for your response! Our policy is a little confusing. It said $100,000/$300,000. Iâ€™m not sure why there are two different numbers. We are in TX.
First, this is why you have insurance. They will provide you with a lawyer and defend you up to policy limits. Do you happen to know your limits for liability (or bodily injury liability?) And what state are you in?
You auto insurer will handle all of this up to defending you in a lawsuit. They'll send you pertinent documents and may occasionally ask you how you prefer to proceed (always call the adjuster if you don't understand something). This is normal business for them, they'll get it resolved, and it's possible they'll give her a settlement to drop it. Just pay attention to any correspondence or calls from their adjuster or legal reps.
Second, the amount they sued for isn't really meaningful. Anyone can file a lawsuit for any amount, but they must prove their damages.
If the facts are as you say they are, then the case should settle for less than $100k, which is within policy limits.
Third, most car accident cases settle within policy limits, assuming you have reasonable policy limits.
You might consider increasing them for the future, because those limits are probably not adequate for a serious accident. Also consider an umbrella policy.
