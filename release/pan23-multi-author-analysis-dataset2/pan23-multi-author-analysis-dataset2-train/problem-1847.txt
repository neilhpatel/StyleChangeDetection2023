It depends on the details. A child having mental health issues isn't abuse. A child having mental health issues due to the home environment might be. A child having mental health issues and threatening harm and a parent doing nothing would be a concern.
The person happens to be the grandparent and a mandated reporter through their job. It’s understood that a mental health condition doesn’t equate abuse; it’s the involvement of law enforcement that raised the question of that would trigger a report. As stated in another response, there is only a “gut feeling” that something is off.
Yeah that’s the rub. There’s a suspicion that something or someone in the home environment is triggering an exacerbation but nothing concrete. Hopefully the stay in the hospital sorted out what needed sorting.
I'm not clear who the mandated reporter is here. Mandatory reporting in most states only applies to reports of suspected abuse or neglect. A mental health condition in and of itself does not carry a mandatory reporting requirement in any US jurisdiction that I am aware of.
I was an EMT in a 911 service and transported a number of children/teens having a mental health crisis. In my limited experience, every situation is different. Kids from loving homes have issues all the time.
Police are often added to these calls for safety reasons. Upon arrival, the scene can be chaotic and hazardous for the patient and providers, especially if (for example) the call was for a suicide attempt or assault. CPS isn't an automatic add on simply because cops were there. It would depend on particulars.
