Avian flu is now jumping from bird to other mammals and most likely matter of time before someone will be become infected. Serious effort need to be made to prevent next potential pandemics.
People have already been infected with it. But it isn’t human to human transmission yet. It is alarming that other animals are getting sick with it though because that can signal that it has mutated. If it becomes transmissible from human to human then we are screwed. It has shown to have a 56% mortality rate keep in mind that study was done on a strain that wasn’t mutated in the way it is now.
Wow, thanks for the clarification. From bird to human it has infected but luckily for now human to human has not been confirmed.
Still I hope WHO and CDC take the matter seriously and start researching for human vaccine against avian flu.
I don't specifically remember getting a flu in 19, but I remember getting it twice in the past ten years. First time was milder, it just wouldn't end and I had a controllable fever for two weeks. The second one was just... Wow. Bed ridden misery of applesauce and cream of rice, endless fever, aching, nose running and temperature never being right of wow, this one sucks.
If we get a pandemic of h5n1, maybe they'll be set straight for the next pandemic with what... 50% death rate, the original Spanish flu killed 10% that caught it, which is 50 million dead... 33% of the global population caught it which was around 1.5 billion people. So 50 mil 5 times higher 5.33 times higher HIGHLY networked current population = 1,333,000,000 dead of H5N1.
