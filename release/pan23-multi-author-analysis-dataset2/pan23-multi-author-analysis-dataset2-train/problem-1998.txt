I live in Maine. I paid last months when I moved in. He agreed to pay me 800 of the 1600 back. Then reversed his opinion saying that the apartment was vacant so he kept it. But if I’d known I was going to be charged for that half of the month I wouldn’t have rushed to move out. It’s more that we had an agreement and that he changed it. I have a copy of the text message but I can’t figure out how to upload it.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
Did the new tenant move in when your left, or was the unit vacant for the rest of the month? Just to clarify, he agreed to apply half the rent deposit he was already holding to your final rent payment (prorated for half the month) and return the other half to you?
Since the unit was vacant your landlord would have been within their rights to refuse to return the other half of the rent deposit. Obviously this is complicated by the fact that your landlord agreed to return the money, and then reneged.
You may have a case in small claims, but I'm not sure what your odds of success would be. You could try reaching out to your local legal aid agency, many provide free advice to tenants over the phone.
