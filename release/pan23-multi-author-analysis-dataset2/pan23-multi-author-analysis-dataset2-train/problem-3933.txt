IANAL but I am a real estate and property management executive with 15+ years of experience in rental management in multiple markets, including FL.
Now, without the original lease to verify against, you could have a termination clause in that lease giving the landlord the right to terminate your tenancy with notice. Without it, the state law in FL is that a 30 day notice is required to terminate an at-will tenancy. If you went to court, I would say you have a 50/50 chance of a judge upholding your addendum or ruling you do have to vacate but giving you an extended period to do so. If their ruling is the latter, I would insure that whatever security deposit you out down is part of their order. Most leases only have this in the main lease and not in the addendums. The courts seem to be ruling in favor of tenants in situations like this since COVID so you have a very good shot if you want to fight it.
Came here for this, but to also mention that it would be wise to handle anything like this carefully. If something has a lot of money riding on it, hard disk corruption needs to be avoided, and maybe even have the data rescued professionally.
