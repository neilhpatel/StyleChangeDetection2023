Hilariously, if the no-shows or "present" votes don't come from the MAGA wing then the threshold for votes needed to become Speaker fall in Jeffries favor as long as he has more votes than McCarthy (spoilers: he does).
I definitely thought yesterday was the end of it, they'd adjourn, have some private meetings in the evening, and come back united under McCarthy after he dishes out some committee seats or whatever.
The fact that they came back this morning and he still doesn't have the votes is just so goddamn funny.
