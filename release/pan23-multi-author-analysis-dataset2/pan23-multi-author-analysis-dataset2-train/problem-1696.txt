Militarism, or glorifying military service and integrating military values into society as a method of normalizing a robust, persistent military presence, is a core component of fascism.
Interestingly, the Nazis saw military service as a means of class integration, which led to Hitler coopting the term "socialist" in naming the "National Socialist Party." He didn't seek to rectify inequity between the classes as in Marxismâ€”in fact, he vehemently rejected Marx's ideology and viewed inequity as proper and necessary. Instead, he sought to quell class struggle by selling militarism as a way for the "sons of rich men and poor men to serve a common goal side by side." Of course, that didn't happen, and the Nazis made special accommodations for upper-class society.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
