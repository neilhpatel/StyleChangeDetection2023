Generally when you sign a lease, even with a roommate, everyone is responsible for the whole thing.
Did you try and find a new roommate to pay the other half of the rent when your roommate left? That would have been the smart thing to do.
You're in a very bad place right now. Your roommate abandoning the lease did not eliminate your obligation to pay the full rent. You and your ex roommate do indeed owe this money and one of you will pay. You can try to set up a payment plan and then sue your roommate for the costs, however given the amount of money involved it's likely out of small claims territory. If you do not pay and your ex roommate does not pay you can expect to see your credit hit hard and your wages being potentially garnished after court hearings.
If you pay the 10k, you can sue her to be reimbursed. But itâ€™s not your landlords fault that you signed a lease with someone who turned out to be unreliable, they have the right to collect on the debt owed.
The amount of money that you potentially owe is putting you in get an attorney territory to go over what your options are.
