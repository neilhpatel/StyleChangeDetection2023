I just want to make sure the quality of the repair is good. I don’t want to reach a point where they say “it is what it is” or “that is the best we can do” . I understand accidents happen but I don’t want to have to have to deal with their mistake which just depreciated the value of my car. At the last instance I want them to change the peace for an original one if not satisfied.
Thanks for the advice. I will look into that. Also what I meant with that is the dent is on the door so if I don’t like the result of taking the hit out I would like a original door.
You can look up how to show depreciated value in WI then ask the shop to reimburse you that amount. They may say no. Your option then would be to sue in small claims if it's under WI limits.
Being pissed is fine (and understandable), but that's not going to help much. Mistakes happen, and it sounds like they are interested in making things right. Let them know you have a preference for the body shop that does the repairs. You then provide names for a couple of shops you are OK with and let them choose. They should provide you with a loaner or rental while your car is being repaired.
