A gift is a gift, you don’t owe it back to him. Feel free to do it out of friendship but it sounds like he doesn’t consider you a friend anymore (for absolutely no reason other than his own circumstances).
I haven’t been the best of friends lately, definitely withdrawn but I’ve been open with my struggles with mental health lately and how I haven’t been doing great. Thank you for your response. I feel like either way I’m going to feel like a selfish asshole or a broke loser plus, my own finances are mixed in, and I wouldn’t even know how to go about differentiating who’s is who’s. It’s a nightmare.
Dude, you have things you have been dealing with. A good friend would see this and be worried about you. If he really said the things you put in your post he is not your friend. Those are hurtful and dismissive things to say. Not letting you invest so he could take care of you with his money instead is controlling behavior which leads to his comments to you.
It has been scientifically proven that owning cats is good for our health and can decrease the occurrence of high blood pressure and other illnesses.
A cat's whiskers are thought to be a kind of radar, which helps a cat gauge the space it intends to walk through.
Thanks for saying this man, I think I really needed to hear it. I definitely have felt that way about his behavior but it is so much easier for me to find a way to blame myself.
