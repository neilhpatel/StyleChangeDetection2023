In Colorado a rental must have a functional heater to be considered habitable under state law (Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-505;.
If you get pushback then state that heating is required per Colorado law and provide the statute listed above. Your next step would be determined by the landlord’s response...ideally they will turn the heat back on without argument.
Text the landlord again and ask that the heat be turned on as the home in uninhabitable without it. (Keep communication in writing.).
I would ask them to send you the law/statute that says they only need to provide it within that time frame. I haven’t found any date ranges for CO at all either. In which city/county do you live? Some municipalities have their own set of rules but I don’t think they supersede the state regulations.
They’re claiming they only have to provide heat between 10/1 and 5/1 but I can’t find anything about that anywhere. Even so, I know most states that do that have minimum temperature requirements even outside that window.
