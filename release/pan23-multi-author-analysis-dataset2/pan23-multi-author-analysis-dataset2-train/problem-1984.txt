I'm just making an observation. How long have the strikes been going on for now, and what has been achieved?
Something tells me our politicians need to stop fucking with the rail workers after the Ohio and Michigan issues recently. Hopefully the UK is smarter.

How do you convince a government that cares so little that it actively passes legislation restricting striking workers’ rights while the worst strikes in a generation are going on? Short of quitting altogether, there’s not much more they can effectively do.
If that's your definition of successfully striking, then it's not my cognitive ability you should be getting a hard-on about.
