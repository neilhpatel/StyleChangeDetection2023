Nevada has some very generous laws for squatters. There are some eviction firms in Las Vegas that can assist, unfortunately it has been a few years since I dealt with that.
The timing of their entry is very suspect and likely had some indirect knowledge of your father's circumstances.
There may be sensitive information related to his estate, you may want to consider preventative identify or general theft measures with banks.
Thank you for the info about the eviction firms, I will be sure to look in to them. The woman working in the office was refusing to pull my father’s lease to show the police to prove that this guy isn’t on there. The office manager wasn’t in over the weekend but I’m going to do my best to reach her tomorrow to see if she can help us. I will be sure to file a police report as well. Thank you for your answer, I really appreciate it.
I second mentioning it to the landlord. Explain you just want to get his stuff out of there and then he can start renting it out again but first you need the squatter out. He should do most if not all of the heavy lifting for you at that point, he's not gonna want to go long with no rent income from that apartment.
