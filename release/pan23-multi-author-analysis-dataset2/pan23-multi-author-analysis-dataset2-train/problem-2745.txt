If she is legally competent, and he hasn't broken any laws, then she has the right to leave her estate to whomever she wants.
There is no such thing as a "fair split" from a will, nor can anyone, except a surviving spouse, be "short-changed." Nobody has a right to an inheritance.
What do you mean "full control of the will"? That doesn't really make sense. A will is a will. It controls. What is her mental state, is she incapable of making decisions?
Is his mom also your mom? Is there a lot of $ we are talking about here? The way you phrased it makes it sounds like you are after the money more than worried about the woman.
This woman is an adult. She gets to designate her will however she sees fit as long as she is of sound mind when she does it. The idea is that it's her money.
If you aren't the spouse or another child of this person, then I'm not sure think you are entitled to any of her money.
if I read this post the wrong way and she is truly being manipulated, then you might be able to have her declared incompetent and get a GAL appointed. Of course, you would have to fight the son who would argue he deserves that appointment.
As far as suing him directly. I don't feel good about your standing, his liability, and your damages. Missing all 3 is not a good start to a case.
