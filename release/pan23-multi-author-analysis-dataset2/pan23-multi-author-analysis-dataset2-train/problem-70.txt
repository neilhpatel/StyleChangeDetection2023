listen youâ€™re absolutely right I should have never trusted him with my son in the first place but he made me feel terrible and like i ruined his life he made me feel like it was his fault he shot himself and i just wanted to see him get better i thought seeing our son everyday would give him a reason..
Four months after your abusive ex attempted to commit suicide, you allowed your son to live with him when he threatened to do so again. Although I'm glad the police have said that your son is safe, I can't imagine that being in this environment is in his best interest. The bottom line is that you need to consult a lawyer first thing Monday morning. You should contest the 50-B and get a custody arrangement through the courts.
The 50B that you've been served with should list a date for a return hearing where you can present your side and refute the allegations that your ex has made against you. In preparation for your meeting with a lawyer, you should start writing down a chronology of events.
