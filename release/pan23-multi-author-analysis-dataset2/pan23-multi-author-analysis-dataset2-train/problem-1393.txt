A possible solution to plastic bottle pollution would be a surcharge that can be later redeemed at a recycling plant. Dumpster divers will then scour the city looking for any that still get thrown away since it is basically money.
It's also insanely more expensive to make and logistically move around, a far heavier. So there's other factors to consider in terms of greenhouse emissions with glass unfortunately.
I visited the coca-cola plant in Belize once for work. They collect, clean, inspect and reuse all their glass bottles. There's no remanufacturing.
That's the personal responsibility part. But you can't blame people for buying the product that's available.
In the Netherlands they have machines in the supermarket. They're like reverse vending machines. You put your empty bottles in one by one and your account gets credited.
If Coke offered strictly glass or aluminum containers, the pollution part of this problem would be mostly solved. Then you can start on the "Coca-Cola is poison" campaign.
