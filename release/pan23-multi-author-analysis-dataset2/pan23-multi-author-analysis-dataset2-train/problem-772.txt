>“Let us pray for the victims of this genocide and let us pray for so many Ukrainians - children, women, elderly - who are today suffering the martyrdom of aggression,” he said.
I hope the Archer series ends in thd assassination of Putin. Like a dead switch triggered by Mallory to get revenge for Nickolai Jakovi. That's the rampage I wanna see.
The pope is one of five (maybe more?) patriarchs of the church and is not the religious leader for the Russian Orthodox Church.
One important thing to know is that the Holodomor wasn't so much an ideological issue, as it was an ethnic issue. This was just the last attempt by Russia to ethnically cleanse part of Ukraine to resettle it with Russians, and the way the USSR did it this time was by deliberately starving Ukraine.
The communist party in Ukraine opposed to these decisions, because they knew what Russia was doing and they knew Ukraine would starve if they complied with Soviet requests to seize crops and deliver them to Russia. This was the perfect excuse for Stalin and the Russian-led CPSU to purge Ukrainian nationalists out of the Ukrainian soviet systems, and replace them with pro-Russian politicians.
I say this because it's important to understand that Ukraine is not a concept invented by one specific political movement. Ukraine as a sovereign nation, independent from and equal to Russia, was an ideal held across the whole political spectrum in the 1920s. Fascists, liberals, social democrats, socialists and communists, they all agreed that Ukraine was a country, not just some confused Russians. Don't let anyone try to turn Ukrainian nationalism into a right vs left or west vs Russia issue. It was not - Russia subdued Ukraine through violence, purges and war.
