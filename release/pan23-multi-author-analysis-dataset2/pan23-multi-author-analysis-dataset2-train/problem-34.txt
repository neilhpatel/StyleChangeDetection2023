It's legally your job to understand the insurance you're buying, so unless there's a material misrepresentation in how the dealership sold the insurance, that couldn't have been resolved by reading the policy before you signed, you're _probably_ out of luck.
The dealership is not responsible for educating you. It would be extremely good customer service, and probably a civic virtue, if they did take that on, but if they told you it was liability-only, and the policy document was clear about coverage, and you accepted it, not having coverage for this is not the dealership's responsibility.
If your car was totalled in a collision where another driver was at fault, then you can sue the driver for the remaining value of the vehicle or the cost of the repairs, whichever is less. Given the amount outstanding, you probably want to talk to a lawyer about your options. If you sue the at-fault driver, their (liability) insurance will generally pay out.
I thought that if a car is financed you must have full coverage insurance. Once it's paid off you can drop to liability only, but I am confused that a bank financed this loan without requiring full coverage.
Most lenders do require full coverage, but you're only in breach of the loan if you carry some other policy. You aren't actually insured because of that requirement alone.
I am also confused about how this could have been a financed sale, and at some level I'm taking OP's proposition that the policy really is liability only at face value. You could be right that there's more going on here.
