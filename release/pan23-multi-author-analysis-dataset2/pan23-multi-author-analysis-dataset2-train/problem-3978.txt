Is uncle deliberately withholding the will from being probated (has he not submitted it to the court yet to open up probate) or has it already been submitted? If he has already submitted it, he was legally required to send a copy of the will to all potential heirs. Your mother will have a certain number of days to decide whether she wants to contest it. It appears that she does have valid grounds to contest the will, but she may want to ask an attorney if it would be possible for the attorney to negotiate with uncle for him to agree to return all or most of the money he has already taken, in exchange for your mother's promise not to officially contest the will, which might be expensive in attorney fees for both sides.
The fact that uncle was named as executor in the will does not mean that he was authorized to do anything with grandfather's assets while he was still alive. He does NOT officially become the executor until the estate has been opened up at the county courthouse probate court.
The executor doesn't gain any powers until after the person dies. A will can't be executed while someone's alive. Did he also have power of attorney?
An executor is generally required to file several reports with the probate court. Those should be public record.
What year did grandfather die? Was the will ever probated at the county courthouse probate court? If so, then what year did probate take place?
