A continuing resolution appropriations bill (not a budget) that was passed in the Senate by unanimous consent, with a speech by McConnell in favor of passage. It also passed the House, with a couple days to spare. President Trump vetoed it. I fail to understand how anyone other than President Trump, and thus Republicans, are responsible for that shutdown.
, the longest in American history, which occurred when the republican house and republican senate with a republican supreme court on the sidelines couldn't pass a budget that the republican president was willing to sign. Republican politicians know that two thirds of their voting base are shit-brained idiots and will blame who they're told to blame for republican obstruction.
You have to understand that when the Right refers to themselves as such they aren’t speaking in terms of the political spectrum. They are “The Right,” and therefore you are “The Wrong.” Forcing them to compromise with you is unforgivable because you know they’re right. To truly meet in the middle you have to give them everything they want. Reaching across the aisle means going even further to accommodate their desires.
