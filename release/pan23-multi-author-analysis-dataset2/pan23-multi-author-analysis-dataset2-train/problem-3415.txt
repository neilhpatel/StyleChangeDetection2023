I really just want to personally thank everyone who voted. Your vote does count and this election shows it. Keep voting. There is an election EVERY single November. Keep voting for people who are working for the people. To the young people who voted: Thank you the most. Don’t let anyone ever make you feel like your voice and vote don’t matter. We can keep making progress if more people keep voting. They want turnout to be low. Let’s show them they need to run better candidates, that we actually care about policies and solutions. You guys did great, keep it up.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
