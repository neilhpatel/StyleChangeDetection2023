I'll believe it when i see it. The wh keeps covering for trump while he keeps commiting crimes in front of everyone unhampered. Shit they're too busy calling union strikes illegal and denying them sick leave in the middle of the covid pandemic still going. Uuggh.
Same. I'm honestly worried that this is the system of power protecting itself. It's not necessarily that the system wants to protect Trump, but rather that it is worried about placing any real precedent of limits upon the office of the executive. Nixon is the closest we came, and he was pardoned by the system. Trump dying makes it moot, and l think it's being slow walked to do so. It's either that, or after years of careful legal construction, he gets a slap on the wrist.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
