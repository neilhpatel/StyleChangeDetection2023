I watched a docu on hongkonk and wish I didn’t. I cried through most of it. What China is doing there is vile and watching the students try to fight back was so dejecting.
Those [adults] who really wanted out left before the handover. There was a small exidios before the handover. However most people are used to where they live and didn't want to leave. You leave behind any family and friends who stays, and even if all family does leave (ignoring that they will have family that doesn't) you are likely to not end up near them all so you lose the advantages of family/friends.
No, as I understand it this is a system to a work permit, at which point you just get a green card and you can renew it as normal so long as you’re employed. The renewal of this plan would just increase the time for people to apply for the permit.
I moved just a few hours drive from my family, and it is harder. When my siblings have an emergency they have grand parents who can be there fast. Not to mention all the holidays that are a major deal to get to. As such i fully understand not wanting to leave without being sure how bad it will get.
When I do read success stories from resettlement programs many of them were about someone who was a kid in various refugee camps for years. No surprise they gave up on going back home - they have no memory or connection to this place called home and so can make anyplace home.
