First, it’s unlikely that this person was acting pursuant to a POA because a POA terminates at death. It is possible your father set up a trust prior to death or that his will put assets in trust, and this person was named the trustee. As another person commented you may be entitled to some free legal services through your university. I will note, however, that it’s probably not possible to do a whole lot of investigating without making this person aware you are investigating her. The first step may be to find out whether your father had a will, or whether he executed some trust document prior to his death that put this person in charge of his assets. Getting a copy of whatever document gave her authority to manage the assets will give you a lot of information and may help you in the next direction. Once you find out what document or authority this person was acting pursue it to, you may be able to request an accounting of all the inheritance assets, etc. Good luck.
Thanks for the comment. I am now searching for documents that might be related to my father’s will/trust. I will also try seeing if I can get some help with my campus legal services.
NAL - Another avenue for discounted legal services is to call your state/county bar association. For a small fee (typically $20-50 varying by state) they can set you up with a consultation with an attorney to explain you situation.
Additionally, if it’s as I suspect and it was a trust set up - the trustee (who you are referring to as POA) would have to provide accountings for all of the money coming in or out of the trust. if you are a beneficiary you you are entitled to copies of those accountings!
