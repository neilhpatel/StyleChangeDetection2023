The rule of law is absolutely on his side, but the PQ has so few seats it may not even get office space at the government. To block them on a symbolic issue, for which a new law is to be discussed; the oath to an English king for a government that has declared Québec is a French speaking nation distinct from the culture of Canada let alone the common wealth, for them to use this to block the former heavily weakened party of the current premier that had blocked his assent to power in their party...it's blatant petty politics. And I say say that as an Anglophone in Québec - persona non grata for both parties.
Monarchy is the antithesis to “all men are created equal”. As long as people accept monarchs, even mostly ceremonial ones, they accept that they have betters.
Three Parti Québécois (PQ) MNAs have been denied entry to Quebec's legislature on Thursday after refusing to swear an oath to the King.
To sit in the National Assembly, MNAs must swear an oath to the King and the Quebec people. The PQ only did the latter.
