i was in a really bad place mentally, i have gone through therapy and still do since the event and whenenver i posted i never knew that it was public or anything.
Depending on your age and location you're presumably going to go to juvenile or regular court to address your criminal charges. You should have an attorney represent you for this.
Given that you're now going to magistrate court for a misdemeanor charge and have been suspended I would suggest other people are disputing that.
No one online can tell you what might happen other than to give you the potential penalties in your unknown jurisdiction. What you can do is seek help from a criminal defense attorney practicing in your area to make sure that your potential liability is mitigated as much as possible.
the charge would be for disorderly conduct and I got a letter saying I plead not guilty for disorderly conduct. The visit is at the magistrate so I am confused because that's not court?
That really does not matter. What does matter here is if you are being charged as a juvenile or as an adult and what your attorney can do to mitigate the harm you have done.
