I am very sorry for your loss. Did the autopsy rule the manner of death ruled accidental or suicide? It’s a bit hard to decipher. However, it’s generally accepted that to classify a death as a suicide requires that it be more likely than not the decedent committed suicide. If listed as an accident despite a suicide letter being found, it means the ME did not consider it sufficient enough on its own to meet the burden of proof required. It sounds like the investigator you spoke to was giving you his personal (and unprofessional) opinion about it being suicide and that it was never actually officially declared anything but accidental.
- I would then take all the information and begin searching for a private investigator, but I would prepare with a list of answers you need from this, what you’re trying to accomplish, and provide copies of the information you currently have.
- I would begin organizing my information, documenting it, saving it, and keeping track of as much as possible. For example I would back track to the events leading up to, and making a file for that. Then I would probably document what happened, and lastly how the investigation was handled and a timeline of it. Then I would document points of why you believe it was not a suicide, what information you can collect to persuade it was not a suicide. The final thing you should note is for what may have possibly happened and why you believe it. Everything must be logical.
Easier said than done but your documentation should not contain anything emotional. It must be very logical and concise like a university research document.
- after the private investigator does his or her work, if the results are favorable, then I would prepare all documentation for a lawyer consultation. I would only go to where there is an in-person consultation rather than lawyer over the phone. Be prepared to go through several consultations—but if they get rejected, ask them to explain why.
I have the death certificate in route by mail, county recorder is gathering the reports so I should have those by next week. He died at home, so no hospital records. I have many different questions, and ways this wasn’t handled correctly- I was advised that in an unexplained death with no witnesses- they must go into it as if it were homicide. There was nothing around the house or him indicating that he planned to kill himself. I have contacted my phone company to try and get copies of my text records and they won’t send them because I’m not a lawyer and I don’t have one to ask on my behalf. So I’m sol on that, but I appreciate the guidance.
Are you thinking he was murdered? A sketchy suicide letter is certainly enough to draw suspicion that something weird was going on, at the least.
- I would then try to file for death certificate, police records, and see if there’s some way you can retrieve hospital records if there are any. Some states work a little differently on this.
