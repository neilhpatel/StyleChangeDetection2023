The seller did not have the right to convey property that did not belong to them. So ultimately you will have to decide if you would prefer to not return their property and have them send you to collections or return their property, not have your credit damaged, and (maybe) sue the seller for the value.
It's not going to be worth it to hire a lawyer for an item worth, at best, only a few thousand dollars.
Return the water softener to the company and file a small claims suit against the former owner (if you contact them first and they refuse to compensate you). You could ask for the value of a replacement water softener, but you're only really entitled to the depreciated value. For example, if the expected lifespan of the water softener was 15 years (which seems to be what the internet generally suggests as the max estimate), and it was 5 years old when you bought the house, you'd be entitled to 2/3 of the value of that particular water softener. Although if I were them I might argue that you got 3 more years of use out of it.
1) You have a water softener that doesn't belong to you. You need to either return it or pay to rent it.
