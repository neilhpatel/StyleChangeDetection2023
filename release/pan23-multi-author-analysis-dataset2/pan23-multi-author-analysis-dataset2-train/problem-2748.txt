You’ll need to review the oem warranty but you may still be able to make a warranty claim even if the warranty is expired.
Assuming that the “about two years” to the first major issue timeframe is actually less than 24 months you may have a case for a lemon law claim but you’d need to consult with an attorney that is familiar with the unique aspects of the FL process.
Since the problem was first reported inside of the warranty period and is an ongoing issue it should still be covered under warranty. Collect all the documentation you can and contact Ford directly. FYI the dealers are just a licensed franchise and are not directly part of Ford. Since you have moved and are likely going to be using a different dealer going forward contacting Ford directly is more than likely going to be the easiest route for you.
I really hope that I can help you get a new car. Look up Florida lemon law. If you have tried to have the same issue repaired 3-4 times and the issue is still present you have a very good chance of your car being replaced a 2021. Get copies of all the records from when you first encountered the problem to now. Call corporate and let them know you would like to pursue a lemon law claim as they have tried to fix the same reoccurring issue and your wife no longer feels safe driving the vehicle.
