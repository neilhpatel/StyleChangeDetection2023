Your atty should have notified opposing counsel as well so they may or may not show. The mediator should have been notified. Too. You need to go either way. If nothing else, reschedule if you aren't comfortable proceeding.
You can always do the mediation and ask the other side for 10 days to review any agreement with your attorney. I'm a mediator and have had attys get sick but they will still call in or they send another atty in their place.
I’m hoping that’s what he did but idk he didn’t say anything! We were so happy with him at first and now he seems to be dropping the ball on almost everything. It’s a easy few things to change so we know what we won’t budge on and what we will so I’m hoping we could maybe just try to get it done. It’s been rescheduled 3 times now since last March.
