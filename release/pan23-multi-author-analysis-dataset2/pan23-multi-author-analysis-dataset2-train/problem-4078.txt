I think realistically at this point it’s better to go through insurance. Even if you fork over the 3k you have no guarantee they will accept it and.
Also, while they won’t provide the estimate I’m sure your right and they are inflating the price. But on the other side, it could be more than just the bumper that needs replacement/fixing. You won’t really know until they get the bumper off.
Someone hit my wife’s car on the rear bumper. Original estimate to fix was $1300 + hst. Once it was all said and done it cost closer to $2,500 + hst. It all went through insurance.
I used to work at a dealer parts depo. The insurance company pays for everything that is recommended by the manufacturer. Even little bolts or clips that are useless to the repair. Thats why it was so hefty.
First they have to report within 24 hours so if they want to play hard ball it might end up hurting them. Second if its minor just pay what they are asking and do the math if ur rates go up. They wont reduce for 5 years and might be worse in the end. Also everything u do it in writing.
I've removed a paragraph from this post because I forgot Ontario has no fault insurance. However, my advice still stands that the safest thing to do is have the other driver make a claim through their insurance provider. If you choose, you do not have to make a claim for your own vehicle. (Just ensure that it's safe to operate.).
