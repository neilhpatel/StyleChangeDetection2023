This is typically called "Moonlighting" and generally refers to taking a second shift or after hours job, not a totally different job. Some companies have policies about moonlighting requiring you to disclose that you're doing it, or disclose only if the earnings exceed a certain amount, etc. Many companies have no policies for this at all.
If you are under a non-compete it had to be disclosed to you when you were hired, or, if one was implemented while you have been an employee then you would have been given a paper to sign stating such.
Having said that, "leave without pay" typically allows for you to do whatever the heck you want with the time you are on leave. You should be aware, however, that this type of maneuver cannot be used to circumvent a non-compete agreement.
Non-compete agreements have their own unique terms and wording, I can't say what would or would not violate yours because I don't know what it contains or if you're even under one.
Generally, non competes stop you from working for direct competitors within a certain area for a certain time.
