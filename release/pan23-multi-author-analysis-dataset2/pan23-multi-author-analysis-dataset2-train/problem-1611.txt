How does a mayor in a weak mayor form of government unilaterally control land value? This narrative is patently false and it’s frustrating to read over and over again on social media. The mayor and other council members are held to a set of findings (set within the zoning code and NRS) when reviewing discretionary actions. If those findings can be met, a development project MUST be approved. If denied after demonstrating those findings must be met, then that’s a 5th amendment violation and considered a taking of property, resulting in costly legal fees and the need for the city to pay just compensation for functionally taking private property. There’s no secret control that developers have. Developers have a legal right per the zoning code and state law to do things with their property. It’s a simple process. If people don’t like it, get involved in trying to change the zoning code sections you don’t like.
