We the people most certainly did not. Dead fucking people before ines [I was] born made a shorty [shitty] framework and untouchable grifters and millionaires over whom my actions and vote have zero impact continue to hold the country hostage in a broken governance design. How about that? I'll vote tomorrow that no person has any immunity to on-demand congressional testimony and yes, we can as a species also craft rules that prevent malicious use of that power. But no one is willing to do the hard work of not taking huge corporate bribes to do what is right for all of us.
