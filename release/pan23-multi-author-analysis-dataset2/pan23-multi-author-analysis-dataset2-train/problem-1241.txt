(1) You're overthinking things, which you know perfectly well and is perfectly normal and natural at this point. .
Yes, I guess I am overthinking things and deep down know that I am okay. But the fear crops up at times still, as I am just really afraid of making a mistake.
Also footnoting isn't just showing your work but also helping point out where they might find more work on the topic.
(2) Your dissertation is going to have A LOT more footnotes than your book will, because dissertation footnotes serve a different purpose than book footnotes. Right now, you're in, "See, Dr. Advisor? I read this, I swear!" mode. But block footnotes? 800 pages of lit review? All that gets thrown away for the book.
But as the reader above points out. A dissertation is not a peer reviewed article or book. It is proof to your committee that you have engaged in original research and are knowledgeable of the field in which you are researching.
(3) Rather than instructions, grab a model--a couple of sample dissertations off ProQuest or academia.edu; a couple of books that you know/think are based on people's dissertations. How much "On this, see..." footnoting do they do?
Excess footnoting of what exists isn't my problem...but boy, do I like my historiography sections going back to 1847. I MUST WRITE A FULL PARAGRAPH ABOUT EVERY RELEVANT BOOK HOW DARE I NOT??? Hahahahaha.
