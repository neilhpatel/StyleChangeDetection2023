When the IRS audits a taxpayer, they mail an official notice to the taxpayer stating that they are under audit.
trump never showed any of those official notices from the IRS that would have proved he was under audit. The only reason not to show one would be that he didn't have one.
That was actually tried and the results were utterly infuriating. The mandatory audit program has been, and continues to be deliberately concealed from congress. Describing how the program works, when returns are and are not audited, and how the audits are conducted do not require any confidential data to be revealed. And yet the head of the IRS has said for years that he’s not at liberty to discuss the program with congress because the tax returns are confidential.
You mean his claim he made in 2015/2016 when running for President that the IRS publicly explained wouldn’t keep him from disclosing his tax returns?
This deliberate concealment of the program from congress, even after being order to testify, was actually a large part of the justification for the courts allowing the release of Trump’s taxes. The provable fact that there was a secret tax program being concealed from congress was what congress used to prove there was a legitimate legislative purpose for retrieving presidential returns. It resulted in unanimous votes at every level of appeal to allow congress to see Trump’s returns.
