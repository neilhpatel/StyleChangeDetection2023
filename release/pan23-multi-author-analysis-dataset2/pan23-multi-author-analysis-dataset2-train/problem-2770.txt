Bro what? That makes no sense, they don't want to fight India. The last thing they want is a war on their already-unstable western border. They're already super anxious about India hosting the Dalai lama.
Jokes aside, even India has been very insistent over the years that their dealings with China should be kept purely bilateral. Neither of them want anyone else (especially America) coming in because both are wary of foreign interference. Seems India might be slightly shifting their stance a bit since quad is a thing, but from what I understand India is still one of the least active members.
Yeah, this is genuinely confusing. They may actually have found one of the few foreign policy points where US interference might actually lead to a lower chance of war.
This isn't to say the US is or should be meddling with the LAC, just not sure how their involvement would make the situation worse.
This seems like the kind of thing the CIA and every US government thinks before inserting themselves into a geopolitical mess halfway around the world and messing it up further lol.
