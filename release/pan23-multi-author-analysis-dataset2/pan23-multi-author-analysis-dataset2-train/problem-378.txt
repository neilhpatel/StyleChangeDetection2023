Actually no. In the movie series Underworld, it has been established that werewolves can absolutely run a back-alley high-tech operation, particularly bio-sciences; genetics; cloning, hybrid creation.
By comparison, vampires were using comparatively old, established tech (established by humans too - those guns and leather, wasnt vampiric inventions). Their longevity, physical strenh and proclivity to hedonism, means vampires arent keen on pushing scientific advancement at breakneck speed. They'd rather chill out, party, drink some blood, and feud with each other over grudges from like a 1000 years ago.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
