The car needs to be 25 years old from the date of manufacture. If you can't prove the date of manufacture then you need documentation showing when the car was first sold or registered. If you can confirm any of those dates are over 25 years ago on the specific car you want to import then it's legal. The 25 year rule obviates pretty much all other import requirements.
So I would literally have to wait 25 years. So if it was manafucteed in October I would have to wait till then. Also do u mean when it was made or when it was sold.
Yes the 25 year rule means the specific car you want to import needs to be 25 years old before entering the US. If it was actually manufactured in October 1996 then you need to wait until October 2021 before importing it.
The important date is the date of manufacture, but if you can't prove the date of manufacture for whatever reason then you can use the date when the car was first sold or registered. The logic is that sale or registration always happens after manufacture so if the registration date is at least 25 year ago then so is the date of manufacture.
