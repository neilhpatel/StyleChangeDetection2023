And if it makes any difference this lease was month to month and they only had me pay half of rent for August with an understanding I would not be staying the entire month.
I am very obviously not a lawyer and must be misunderstanding something but every online interpretation I’ve found has the 21 days beginning when the landlord regains possession of the property. In my case the landlord was in sole possession of the property the next day.
If this was the case it would make written notices worth nothing. You could provide your written notice to move out 8/31 on 7/31, then surrender your keys 8/1 and expect your obligations to the unit until 8/31 to disappear. Your written notice stated that you intended to control the unit until 8/31. That part is on you. But the part of new tenants moving in before the actual end of your tenancy muds things up. Unless someone can find case law on this, it isn’t clear what your outcome is.
Isn’t the 30 days notice only to give payment insurance to the landlord? I knew leaving early still left me on the hook for a full months rent but after they took possession of the property on August 22nd (they were in the unit and took possession of all keys) does that not relinquish my rights as a tenant? If someone would have broken in and damaged the property on August 25th would I have been responsible?
