Doctors in most jurisdictions are licensed and regulated by a medical association. Look up your state/provincial medical association and they should have information as to how to file a complaint.
You can also file a formal complaint with the hospital. Based on his conduct, the hospital will probably have a duty to report him the the medical registration board, but it wouldn't hurt to also file a complaint with the board yourself. If you need help filing the complaint or just want to talk to someone about what happened, most hospitals have a patient advocate that you can talk to.
Wasn’t a hospital, more of a clinic. And I’m pretty sure this doc is halfway retired and does some work on his free time. He was very old and spoke a lot about his retirement.
I’m less concerned about what happened to me and more concerned about what he could be doing to more vulnerable people. Is there any risk of my personal information being released to him if I submit a formal complaint? Can I maintain anonymity?
Complaints remain confidential until 10 days after probable cause is found. If probable cause is not found the case will remain confidential. Patient identity and patient records always remain confidential.
