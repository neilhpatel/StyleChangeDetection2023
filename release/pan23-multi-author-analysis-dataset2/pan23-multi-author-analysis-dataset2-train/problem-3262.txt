No doubt this is unpleasant. Nothing here is illegal. (The "women are gossipy" line could be a problem if it was part of a pattern, but as a one-off it's not.).
Honestly, don't give them a heads up. Not legal advice but "I'm not giving an official resignation but they may want to post my position because I'm looking for outside employment and I dont want them caught off guard" put an unnecessary target on your back.
Thank you the purpose for giving them the heads up was out of respect knowing it was seriously impact their company if I just left.
Also, how women are treated at this company is absolutely a pattern. They are disrespected constantly, passed up for promotions by seriously under qualified candidates, concerns are ignored, etc. And when they voice their frustrations they are called emotional and aggressive.
Anyone who thinks they have been discriminated against due to their gender (or another illegal reason) should .
If they are being discriminated against because of their gender, and they report it and nothing is done by their employer, then they . After they report it to their employer first, and if their employer does nothing to fix it, them they report it to the government.
There is no legal action to take here, not in the state of WI. Gaslighting isn't illegal in and of itself. It might be within the context of protected class harassment, but it's not independently prohibited legally, it's just shitty as hell. Most things that are shitty aren't illegal.
