It’s the last digest of June 2021, and once more we’re packed to the brim with awesome answers and perfect posts Don’t forget to swing by the usual weekly features, visit the special threads, and don’t forget to show some love for those hard working contributors.
That wraps us up for another day I’m off to enjoy some summer sun, so enjoy the threads and I’ll see you next week.
It wasn't much of an answer, but I am sad the question about violins being evil was deleted because about Paganini that I hoped more people would read.
Sorry for not contributing sources, forgot about it, although the question is realistically more contemporary. There are very little sources contributed to the question in specific which makes it harder to have a more academic answer than a random guy saying it.
Sunday is also a chance to shout out some interesting questions that remain overlooked. Sometimes getting a good answer is just about timing, so feel free to call out any of your own or those that caught your eye, and maybe a wandering expert will take notice!
Time for another installment of "The Real Questions", where we take a look at the wilder side of r/AskHistorians Here, I give a shout-out to people asking the more atypical questions on this sub: questions that investigate amusing, unique, bizarre, or less common aspects of history, as well as ones that take us through intriguing adventures of historiography/methodology or niche/overlooked topics and moments in history. It's always a wide (and perhaps confusing) assortment of topics, but at the end of the day, when I see them I think, "Finally, someone is asking the real questions".
Below are my entries for the week - questions with a link to an older response are marked with ‡. Let me know what you think were the realest questions you saw this week, and be sure to check out .
