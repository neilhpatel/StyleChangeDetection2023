While I'm not disagreeing that they had an engine problem, the plane seemed to have a higher angle of attack than you would typically expect for a pilot trying to glide in for a landing.
Originally I said, "It looked like it stalled out of the sky". I agree with you. One wing just suddenly tipped over in classic stall fashion.
By angle of attack, I'm talking about the wings. The pilot was not gliding like he/she was attempting to land. The angle of attack was too high, and they stalled. Even without engine power, the pilot is still aware they have to get to the ground without stalling. They would come in at a higher speed and not pull up until seconds before hitting the ground.
Almost certainly not true. Even if the engines had failed (which the video evidence does not strongly support), the pilot can maintain control and land, even if it's short of the airfield. This is a far better outcome than a stall/spin, which the video does strongly support. The aircraft is shown in an extreme nose-high attitude prior to spinning in, which is strongly indicative of a stall. Stall/spins are rarely survivable, whereas a controlled off-field landing often is, depending on terrain. Yes, I am a pilot.
The minimum speed to stay flying is lower than the minimum speed to maintain control of an aircraft with one engine inoperative. If you’re below the latter speed and lose an engine it can induce what’s known as a Vmc roll over. When the original video came out many pilots in the aviation subs (myself included) initially commented that the loss of control looked like a Vmc roll over. However many ATR pilots specifically suggested it was more likely a stall spin accident (too slow in a turn with both engines still producing power). Do with that what you will.
