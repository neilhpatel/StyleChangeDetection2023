My general understanding of the moratorium is that it doesn't apply to non-renewal of leases, only evictions for non-payment. In this case, you wouldn't be getting evicted, your landlord is simply not renewing your lease. I'm assuming that the landlord is refusing to renew because due to the scarcity of rentals, they can increase the price...although they could do that in a renewal also. Why do you think it's due to the stalking? I would consider offering an extra month's deposit perhaps.
I've offered to pay more rent. She just says she is not going to make it available to be a rental any longer (she owns 4 homes and this is the only one she rents out. She vacations at the other 2.
When she had to change my locks, she was not happy. Basically called me a liar. When it happened again she was irate. She then installed security cameras pointing at my front and back doors without telling me until the day of the install.
She said for "safety puroposes". Some things have happened since and I asked to view the security footage and she refuses.
Oregon law will hinge on a couple things, most important being how long you've been there. If this is an initial 1 year lease then you have no protection against non-renewal assumimg proper notice. After 1 year then other protections may apply.
Could be as simple as she wants to take advantage of this smoking hot seller's market then. I'm sorry, that doesn't help you at all, but there doesn't sound like any other solutions. Also, when you speak to other potential landlords, perhaps offer them an extra month's rent as security deposit, maybe that'll bump you up the chain.
I've resorted to applying to hippie communes...retirement neighborhoods...I am literally out of ideas. No one is renting without ridiculous qualifications. Thus my desperation to stay in a place I feel unsafe in. I've been trying to move for 6 months.
