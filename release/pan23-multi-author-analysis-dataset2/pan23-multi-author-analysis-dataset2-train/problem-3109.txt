- Get an order from the family court prohibiting her from filing any unfounded complaints against you.
The fact that your lawyer (who knows more about your case and local jurisdiction) hasn't suggested any remedies makes me think that there aren't any good options.
If you're not satisfied with your lawyer's recommendations then you should seek a second opinion from another lawyer.
I would have her declared as a vexatious litigant, meaning she would have to get a judge to approve any legal proceedings against you. You'd have to get this setup with a lawyer.
I’ve looked into this, but often times she calls CPS as herself or anonymously. My family is automatically a response from the family intervention team. My lawyer and I talked about a “Shreve,”motion, but he doesn’t think it would work in cases of alleged abuse.
The court is not going to be willing to let allegations of a child being abused not be investigated.
The cps reports and the orders of protection are two different things. You may not be able to stop the cps reports but you can stop the orders of protection. At some point cps should ignore her complaints or at least inconvenience you minimally.
At the minimum, I’m no longer have stay aways ordered. I’m just worried that if she takes enough pulls at the slot machine she will get a stay away order eventually and I will not be able to see my kid for a long time with this covid backlog jamming up the courts.
I’m on a first name basis with CPS and it’s isn’t a criminal investigation. Family intervention or whatever it’s called basically takes in the facts and then explains why she shouldn’t call CPS for that reason.
As far as the orders of protection, if she is making accusation about our child’s safety, my understanding is that the court is obligated to get CPS involved and they can’t discourage reporting. As I’m replying the only thing I can think of is to contact the District attorneys office and see if they think she is breaking the law.
