NAL. I'm assuming they provided some type of receipt for the work? Take the ring to another jeweler and get a quote to repair properly. You'll sue the incompetent jeweler for the cost to repair. Your state may have an office that regulates jewelers specifically, or it may be just a business license. A formal complaint to them would also be in order.
I did not get a receipt, I was shaken and not thinking clearly. I did take it to another jeweler, but the original jeweler and his assistants insisted that they would not pay for another jeweler to do the work. I'll definitely look into the office that regulates jewelry, thank you!
Like others have mentioned take the time to get a couple different quotes of the damage and potential cost or fixing the ring , then id suggest going after the 1st Jeweller in Small Claims .
If you paid by credit card you can call your credit card company and dispute the charges. They will then be the ones investigating the charges and the funds should be made available to you immediately after the initial request.
I considered that, but was told that it may cause a legal issue since he technically did make the ring smaller (even though he messed it up). Would disputing the charges possibly get me into trouble?
You don't need to even talk to the original dealer anymore. The next they hear from you should be a small claims suit. Keep a log of dates and times if you know them. Having a receipt would've been great, but if you paid by card, keep a statement handy. They'll probably try to claim they never touched it.
