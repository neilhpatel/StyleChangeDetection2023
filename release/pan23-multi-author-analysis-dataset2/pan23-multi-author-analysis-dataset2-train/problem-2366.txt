You should NOT just run off an vaccinate your children without talking to her or a lawyer. You could end up losing custody of your children if she want to push the issue legally in court. She would claim you subjected them to an experimental treatment without consulting her. Remember these vaccines are not full FDA but approved as Emergency Use Authorization. They have NOT had full FDA approval and that could land you in a world of hurt in court. You are promoting as far as lawyers and the court would see, an experimental vaccine that doe NOT have full FDA approval.
