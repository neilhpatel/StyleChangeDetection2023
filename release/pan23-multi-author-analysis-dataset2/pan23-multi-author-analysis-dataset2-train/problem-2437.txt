I mean the GOP underperformed because, even with some electable candidates (Laxalt, Fung), they really didnâ€™t do enough to move away from Jan 6, election deniers, and anti-abortion views, which ruined them in suburbs.
Doesn't matter he gave GOP what they wanted and threw rest of the USA under the bus in process of doing it. People were pissed and they screwed GOP back. They have screwed Trump once and they will do it again if he wins nomination. This time around they might increase the girth of dong that they will shove up his arse.
