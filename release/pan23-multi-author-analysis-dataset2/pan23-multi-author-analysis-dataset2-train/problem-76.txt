Hi! I’m on a medieval kick, and if there are any reads you especially recommend with a religion angle, I’d be very interested to hear. Subjects of particular interest to me:
Any recommended books on Marquis de Lafayette? I just read The Marquis: Lafayette Reconsidered but came away underwhelmed with its depth. Made a bit more sense when I realized the author was an art historian-- she seemed much more interested in random portraits and possessions than relationships. At one point it effectively time jumps forward 15 years, skipping the Napoleonic Wars and cursorily glossing over the death of Lafayette's wife.
What “church” looked like in villages versus cities, and what the relationships between the clergy who resided in these places was like.
Also just completed A New World Begins: The History of the French Revolution and enjoyed it. A little dry and relatively high level, but as an American who knew very little about the French Revolution, it educated me quite a lot and was a great French Revolution 101 for me.
