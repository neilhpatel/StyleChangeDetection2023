“Asked to compare the scale of the abuses by both sides, Bogner said the mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners by Russians was "fairly systematic" whereas she said it was "not systematic" for Ukraine to mistreat Russian soldiers.”.
Ukrainian here, there has certainly been some Geneva conventions broken by our side. But in the conflict of this scale and this brutality I honestly can't imagine this being fully avoided, especially considering the completely justified hatred of the defenders towards the invaders. Knowing what I know, I can say that our military is truly doing their best to prevent such things from happening on all levels, but of course sometimes they will.
Honestly that’s the best I would hope for. Torture and mistreatment of POWs is never justifiable and should be investigated seriously and punished severely. Without excusing it, even the most experienced and disciplined armies can’t completely eradicate this problem because it’s one of the darker sides of human nature. What’s important is that these incidents aren’t systematic and that the perpetrators are made examples of. If Ukraine does the latter, perhaps it will embarrass the US and other paragons of humanitarianism into following suit.
The Russian army on the other hand... Torture is systematic inside their army even during peace time even towards their own soldiers. I really wouldn't expect anything else from them, it's not just systematic, it's the whole system.
