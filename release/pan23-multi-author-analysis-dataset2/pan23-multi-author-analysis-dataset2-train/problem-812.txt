Nope, please stop spreading misinformation. In app game purchases are through apple the majority of the time and you have to contact them for a refund. On contacting Riot, owner of TFT guess what I was told... The exact opposite of what you said! Please don't comment just because you feel like it. Maybe you feel biased towards saying something condescending because my comment is in the negatives, that's usually it.
I agree that those aren't illegal, but after being AWARE of the mistake/glitch and still refusing a refund, that's what i'm considering illegal. I probably will just do a charge back as the guy on the call said he couldn't help me.
You didn’t buy the product from apple, you bought it from whatever company owns the app. How is some random customer service worker at apple supposed to know that you can only buy that item once? Dispute the charge with the customer service team of the app you’re using. They’re the ones telling apple you owe them money.
The random customer service guy doesn't have to know I can only buy it once. If the customer service guy doesn't know how to help me though... who's fault is that? Apple's.
Anyways, Apple can tell if I received my in app purchases or not. They can check that stuff. They can't do it instantly, but they can take a few business days to figure it out. Instead I was constantly declined a refund over a few business days.
