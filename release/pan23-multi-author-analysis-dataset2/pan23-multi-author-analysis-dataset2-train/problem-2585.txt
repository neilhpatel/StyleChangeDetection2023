Somewhere in the contract you will likely find a statement about the finished house passing inspection, or up to code, or similar.
I will read them when I get the opportunity but the home inspection never actually got completed because of how poorly they did on the home. The home inspector was very critical of their work. It was genuinely terrible work for something supposedly worth 340k.
That is a failed inspection. You always have the option is suing them - you in good faith contracted for a home for your family, and they failed to deliver. Realistically, probably not worth pursuing, for what it would cost you. But the threat is there....
First, talk to the inspector and get a report from him and see if he would sign a statement saying the same thing he told you. The report and statement are going to be your biggest piece of evidence for you as he is suppose to know the various laws as well as the how homes are suppose to be built. This is optional but get a contractor or, better yet, a structural engineer who specializes in home foundation to do a second inspection. The second inspection, especially from a structural engineer, will work in your favor as it will verify the original inspection in case the builder tries to cast doubt on the first inspection. And call a lawyer and present the inspections.
Is this in a city or county that issues occupancy certificates? (Not all do). If the construction is that bad, my city building inspector would not issue a CO. In which case, no closing.
Contact the city or county that issued the building permit, assuming there is one. Ask for documentation verifying the inspections. If they balk, state you are under contract for the property and your private inspection found issues.
The building inspector in my area would never pass a basement with bowing walls that is new construction. That is just asking for issues.
