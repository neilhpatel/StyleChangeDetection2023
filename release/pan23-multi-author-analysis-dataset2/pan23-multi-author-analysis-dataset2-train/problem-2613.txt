Huh that is massive revisionist history, the civil rights act was passed for domestic reasons, not to curry favor with a set of economically inconsequential countries. Also why would other countries care about America paying reparations, are you under the impression that those countries have an interest in paying reparations to whatever native populations they wronged? China isnâ€™t getting puished for what it is doing to the Uighers, nobody is going to risk their economy to virtue signal. A token payment that doesn't really impact the budget could certainly be considered. Whatever that counts for.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
