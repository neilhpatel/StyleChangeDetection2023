I did earlier today, and just got the same generic message from his “executive” team that I do from the refund department with no additional info or help.
At this point, I would just put in a dispute with the credit card company. You paid for the items, returned them in original condition, and no longer have the items, so your money should be returned to you. How can they not refund you and still keep the items? Just go through the credit card company.
At this point, I've filed with the BBB and will start a claim with UPS, but not sure if that will do anything. I have until June 1st to file a CC dispute, hopefully will not get to that point.
Update: apparently an investigation was done and I can no longer appeal the decision. I have constantly sent the photos as proof, but keep getting the same template response from every rep that I email with. The customer reps says it's an internal team that are the ones responsible for refunding me, and they are no longer able to do anything. I've reached the highest supervisor that I can (Amazon's Leadership Team).
