If you can't support yourself you can't be emancipated. You win and they kick you out of the house. What do you do then? You have to tell the court what you plan to do to support yourself.
The same grandmother you claim in your post drove you to such a severe rage you slammed your head against a cabinet? Not sure how that will fix your problem.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
If you feel your living conditions are abusive you can report it to CPS for your state, or speaking a teacher/counselor at school who can make the report for you.
Regardless, living with a grandparent is still not supporting yourself, and so won't be eligible for emancipation. You do not need to be emancipated to live with your grandmother either way, as long as your parents consent.
Then you and your grandmother need to call the state bar in your location and get a referral to an attorney in the area who can handle cases like this and see what they say.
