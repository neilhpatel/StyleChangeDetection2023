It’s more than one review and she’s adding details the original review didn’t include. One person said the doctor delivered her baby but didn’t say where. The doctor responded to that review and named the hospital where the baby was delivered. All of them are like that.
There's a pretty good chance this is a HIPAA violation. You can report it via the online HHS reporting tool. In all likelihood, that's the extent of the remedy.
On the flip side adding additional details and adding details of the third party may or may not bring it back under HIPAA.
In addition to a HIPAA violation any insurance company she is in-network with would be very interested in this conduct. I would also call your insurance and file a complaint. If founded they would also report to the providers licensing board.
Can it just be my insurance or does it have to be the insurance of the person whose privacy she violated? She did this to multiple people and obviously I don’t know which insurance everyone has. I could report to mine though.
Alternately call the hospital and ask to speak to the privacy officer, the hospital has to have one per HIPAA. Explain to the privacy officer what happened. This may yield results more quickly than engaging a giant federal department.
