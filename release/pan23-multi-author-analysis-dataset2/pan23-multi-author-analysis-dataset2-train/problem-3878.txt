It really depends on where you were living. Lydia Maria Child, in her 1832 guide The Frugal Housewife, noted it was possible to preserve butter for a while:
But if the average family of four had a cow, and it was milking, there'd usually be lots of milk. If it had a number chickens and they were laying, there'd be often lots of eggs. A spring house or root cellar was often cool enough to also serve as a place to store butter for a while, but if that wasn't available, dairy and eggs would be traded for other things. Child had a lot of recipes that required large quantities of milk, cream, butter, eggs- if the housewife was in the country. If she was in the city, sometimes the recipe is amended, so the quantities of eggs and dairy is smaller.
But if the cow was dry and the hens weren't laying, and the family couldn't trade for milk, butter, eggs, etc. then the cook might improvise. Like Indian Pudding:
This doesn’t have anything to do with butter, but what does “until Jews get into Grand Isle” mean? I’ve never heard that one before...is Grand Isle a term for heaven?
Not sure. I inferred "forever" based on the context. Child was very much a New England Progressive, and Unitarian, so I think it's doubtful Grand Isle meant heaven.. We could speculate. There's a Grand Isle county in northern Vermont that would have been quite rural. while Jews would have been mostly urban, so perhaps just the concept is to seem absurd.. Or perhaps there was a specific incident that she knew, and we don't.
