Assets and inheritance do not appear to be part of the Kentucky child support calculation. If the inheritance increases his income through investments or the like, then you can petition for a change in support.
$4.7 million is a shit ton to leave sitting in a checking account, so I doubt the courts will have much of a problem with imputing some interest earned to him even if he’s not investing it.
KY doesn't factor in any sort of inheritance in calculating child support as it's not really "income". If your child's father turns this inheritance into something smarter than just a lump sum in the bank, you may be able to get an amended payment.
I echo the other poster's suggestion to simply ask for some reasonable accommodations to the benefit of your child. Make sure your lawyer has copies of your attempts at contact so the court can see you're trying to be both reasonable and act in the best interest of your child. It may take some time to build the evidence necessary for an amendment.
Thank you, will do! Im not trying to take all his money from him I really don’t care but having enough to put his 15 year old through college would be more then enough for me.
