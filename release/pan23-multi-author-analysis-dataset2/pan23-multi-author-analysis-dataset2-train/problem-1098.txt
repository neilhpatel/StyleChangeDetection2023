Your first step is rant to wait and let the city process the claim. Or you can contact your home owners insurance. Suing the city is going to require paying an attorney.
You likely don't have a leg to stand on as far as getting the city to pay for it. Most cities have bylaws that essentially say "you can put an irrigation system in the ROW but it's not our problem if we hit it", but obviously I don't know for your specific city. You should probably just go ahead and file a claim with your homeowners insurance.
If it does come to a lawsuit, you'll want to review any easements on the property and such with an attorney. You could in theory be liable to the city rather than the other way around, in some situations.
So when there's an easement involved, it can become your responsibility to keep that portion of the property clear and easily accessible.
Costs related to not having done so could potentially fall back onto you depending on a variety of factors.
