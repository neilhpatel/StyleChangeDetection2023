Are you sure that you mean copyright, and not trademark? Trademark is for protecting brand names. A federally registered trademark offers protection throughout the US, but only in goods/services related to the trademark.
For example, if someone in OK registers a trademark for "Poo Face" in the category of restaurants, someone in CA can probably use the name "Poo Face" for selling socks (but not for restaurants).
trademark protects names but trademarks can be fairly complicated as they sometimes apply to limited geographical scope or business types. for example there is a Hershey's ice cream company that is not related at all to the chocolate manufacturer.
You'd have to have an attorney look at it to determine whether and to what extent copyright protection applies here. And you should make sure they don't also have a trademark for the name.
No it is definitely copyrighted. The copyright logo is next to their business name at the bottom of their web page. The name Im choosing to use is only slightly different from theirs. I would be providing the same service as them though.
