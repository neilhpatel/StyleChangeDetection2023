Thank you so much, I really appreciate the advice. I am the type of guy who would eat the wrong food instead of complaining to the restaurant. After the bathroom incident I questioned even saying something, but I did and absolutely nothing was done. Now I'm stuck running into him daily and it honestly just makes me extremely paranoid. That's probably the reason I've found the other coworkers hidden cameras. I spend a few minutes a day scanning my office for something that's off - I feel like I should not have to do that at my place of work. There is an EXPECTED privacy that I feel like management does not care about and it does take a toll on my mental mindset.
This bathroom camera is definitely a police matter. If your company is not doing anything about it, I would report it to them.
That is a great question, just some boring footage of me at me desk I guess! This guy is just a coworker, not a boss or manager. He is extremely self-entitled and feels the need to control everything. This is the second time I have found a camera planted in the office. The GoPro recorded sound however the new hidden camera I found did not (according to the IT guy who looked into the SD card).
