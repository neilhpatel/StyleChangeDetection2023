It depends. You can frequently sue the car's owner based on the "family purpose doctrine" or based on "negligent entrustment.". But, typically, you would first pursue his insurance.
For the family purpose doctrine, I think i would need to find out if that vehicle or registration was titled in any of his family name I am thinking that what i got to do.
Title: In Car Accident, If individual causes an accident, gets due by me but not have enough asset to cover my injuries, could I sue that individual family or only the Individual that was by themselves in the vehicle?
Many states have very low limits on mandatory auto insurance that wouldn't cover replacement of a modest modern vehicle let alone any significant medical costs. This possibly is why people typically carry their own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage on their own auto insurance. Personal Injury Protection [PIP] benefits can cover medical expenses from your own auto insurance. If you were able to sue and get an enforceable judgement your own auto and medical insurance may be entitled to recover some of their costs from the settlement/judgement depending on the state and other details.
