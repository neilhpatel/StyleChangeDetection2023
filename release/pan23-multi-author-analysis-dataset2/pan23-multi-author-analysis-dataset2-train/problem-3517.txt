I especially enjoy how these dads are always more concerned with the receiver of the images rather than the fact that their kid manufactured and distributed child pornography.
Yeah the whole thing seems kind of fishy the girl gave me her number right away and then deleted her dating app never seen that before and the whole thing seemed too good to be true Justa what if factors got me freaking out.

ETA I can see that you've actually had this question answered for you multiple times. How many more people need to tell you it's a scam before you believe them?
It’s a scam, in my opinion. I’m a criminal defense attorney in NC and have seen similar issues regularly over the pst few years. If you contact the “father,” he’ll offer to not go to the cops if you send him some money. If you pull the IP addresses from the texts with the local number, you’ll most likely find that they are coming from a spoofing site.
