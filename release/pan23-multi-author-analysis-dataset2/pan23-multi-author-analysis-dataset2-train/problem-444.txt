This is an old estate law youâ€™re referencing- and it is very rare. Where I practiced, you had to have full occupancy for 7 years (might actually be longer), pay all property taxes, and have not been contacted by the rightful owners.
So if your current landlord does not own the property, someone does. You still owe rent. If you have a current lease, the new owner will have to uphold that lease and you will simply just pay the new owner. If you have no current lease, then you will be considered month to month. The new owner would have to give notice for you to vacate, and depending on the state and county, this usually 30 days.
If you have not yet been contacted, you still owe rent. Just save that money away and earmark it for rent. Once the new owner does contact you, give them the rent money you have been saving.
Adverse Possession is what you're thinking of. There are a few elements you have to meet (open, notorious, and adverse possession for example) and there is usually a statutory time period. Some places are 10 years and other are 20 years.
