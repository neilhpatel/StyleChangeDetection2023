Under MA law pets are property, and not subject to "visitation" rights - there are very few states that entertain the concept of pet custody. You can try making a case in civil court that the dog is your property (sue him for the dog, basically), but even if you win, he'll probably owe you the cost of a replacement dog rather than the dog he's currently holding.
If you are genuinely concerned for the dogâ€™s well being then you could always contact the rescue and inform them of the situation and see if they can assist in any way. Itâ€™s likely that their paperwork states that they have the right to remove an adopted dog from any home that is unsafe or neglectful.

I hope you get it figured out. Sorry youâ€™re going through this, I canâ€™t imagine the stress itâ€™s causing. Maybe you can eventually convince him to let you have her. Best of luck to you.
Thank you. I really appreciate that. It angers me because I remember telling him many times that we should wait and not get a dog. I thought it was too early for us. No skin off his back, but now I feel like Iâ€™m mourning the loss of an animal that I truly lovedâ€”and not to a good, trustworthy person.ðŸ’”.
I did and she (the breeder) was horrified, but also said that itâ€™s very hard to prove what exactly constitutes that. She said she would most likely need to catch him in some pretty egregious circumstances over a period of time to have any standing. I think his treatment of the dog is more neglectful than abusive, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s so overt/obvious that sheâ€™d have the grounds to take her back. Also, heâ€™s an attorney, so heâ€™d be the first one to be asking those questions and fighting her on it. Bottom line: Heâ€™s just a slime ball that does the bare minimum for her. But heâ€™s abused me, which is legally documented, so thereâ€™s always a chance he could abuse someone/something else, which is what scares me most. Thank you for responding. I appreciate it.
