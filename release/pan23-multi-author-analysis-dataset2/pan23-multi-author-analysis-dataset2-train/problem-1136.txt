There are no registration requirements for firearms in Mississippi. Background checks are not required in private sales. Only when a FFL Dealer sells to a private citizen. It wouldn’t be a bad idea, however, to write up some sort of “bill of sale” for the firearm and have both you and the other party sign it. That way if the firearm comes up in a crime, you would have proof of when and to whom you sold the firearm.
However, if your father had any silencers, short-barreled rifles, fully automatic weapons, or anything similar that required him to have a tax stamp (any would typically involve setting up a firearms trust) or any sort of firearms license from the ATF (like an FFL), you need to take extra steps to ensure you can legally posses those items. Collectors items, I forget the age requirement, are typically not covered by this sort of thing, but that may not apply for fully automatic weapons.
Also, if you aren't certain the weapons have been properly maintained, have a gunsmith check them out before you try to fire them. Even if your father wasn't elderly, he may not have had good maintenance habits, or the guns may need more frequent maintenance if they were near the coast.
And the same concerns apply to any ammunition you find. Every round is a tiny bomb, and if it's been sitting in a closet for a decade or two, it's probably better to not use it.
I hope this helps you stay legal and safe. If you have any questions at all about your guns or ammo, talk to a local gunsmith or gun store.
Could you elaborate on how old ammunition is a risk? I have ammunition from the 1950's that still operates per design. As long as it is corroded, shows signs of moisture, or otherwise damaged around the crimp, old ammunition is fine.
