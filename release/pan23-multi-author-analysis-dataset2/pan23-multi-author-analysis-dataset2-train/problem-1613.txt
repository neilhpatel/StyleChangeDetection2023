Errors can be corrected. If you and the complex clearly agreed to increased rent then it is conceivable they could correct that.
Frankly, especially as it relates to payment for rental periods already passed, that seems unlikely. 1. I can't imagine landlord actually litigating this. 2. If they did, an outcome of yes you should pay the agreed rent going forward is imaginable. The other is seemingly less likely.
If there was a demonstrable agreement to pay the increased rent, I'd likely offer that (I'll pay the increased amount starting with next month but not go back).
Title: Back pay for 2 months for a lease mistake on the apartment complex end? I want to fight it, $%$ these people.
Just want to say thank you for the legal advice and it worked exactly the way you said it would. Didn't pay the back payments after some resistance and then increased the rent moving forwards.
It may on be you as you could have brought it to their attention. It sounds like you knew it was a mistake and wanted to see if they would notice. Is this correct?
Yes, I did get a notice about increased rent through the mail, though on the lease it was never increased. It was their mistake and didn't bring it up hoping to save money. So even after paying 2 months and had their approval in the end I really have nothing?
