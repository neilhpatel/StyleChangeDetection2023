It’s private property and they are free to refuse service to whomever they want. I don’t know why you’re so adamant about wanting to give your money to someone who you have had several negative experiences with.
Nothing can force a private business to do business with you. Disagreements over filming is not a protected class where the courts would get involved.
When (or if) you write your yelp review, stick to the facts and don't embellish so you have less of a chance having to come back onto this sub asking about getting sued by the gym.
nowhere in the terms of agreement does it state that the instructor has the right to terminate our memberships in this way.
Was this 2 week trial free, and if no was there anything in the contract about them having to pay you money back if your membership is terminated? If the answers are no and yes (respectively), you might be able to sue them in small claims court to try and get your money back, but it would likely be a larger hassle than it would even be worth.
Assuming it was free, there's really nothing you can go after them for. A private business has the right to refuse service to anyone as long as it isn't due to them being a protected class (and in certain special situations, like Emergency Rooms).
