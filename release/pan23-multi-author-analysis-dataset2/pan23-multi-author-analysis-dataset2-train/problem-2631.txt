From what you provided here, it doesn't sound like this incident would make you ineligible to enter the United States (which you have to do even just in transit to another flight), but you may have a long and unpleasant encounter with CBP. It's likely CBP systems will show you have been fingerprinted/arrested, and the officer would send you to secondary inspection so someone can verify the circumstances and determine if there is any legal bar to your entry.
You should also clarify ahead of time with Miami law enforcement what happened with your case, and may want to bring copies of any documentation from the incident showing the outcome (especially if you were never actually charged).
If you aren't charged for any crime, then there is no law preventing you from going anywhere you are allowed to go. (Based on your nationality/visa status if applicable).
And in the case i have one, how can i pay the fine or deal with it knowing that i dont live in the us, im not american ?
First of all, cops can't ban you from entering Miami. If you are charged for a crime, then it is your right to appear in court and face your accuser, which requires you to be in Miami.
You should check if you have any outstanding warrant in the city. If you have, then you should hire an attorney to take care of it.
Have you recieved a copy of the document you signed? Have you recieved any document related to the incident like a summon?
Since i dont live in te usa i didnt receive any paper or remembering having a copy the paper I signed.
I suggest you get in touch with Miami PD and enquire if you have any outstanding warrant or pending fine. If you do, then I suggest you take care of it asap, and avoid entering the city until you do.
