You can file a complaint with the US labor department, and probably with your state labor board about your pay.
You've repeated this a ton, but the truth is you can leave, it's just hard. But you really, really need to sit down and consider the situation as a whole.
You are unlikely to ever change the owner's attitude towards you. The more legal trouble you get him in, the worse that attitude is likely to get.
You are unlikely to ever get paid more than the bare minimum requirements, and again, the more legal trouble you make the lower and lower the chances of ever making above the minimum required wage/salary get.
Also, consider that your best chance is to get paid minimum wage. What other assets will you need to get before you open your own business, factoring in that it is incredibly unlikely you will get them from this job?
Please note: I am not saying that you do not deserve to be paid a living wage or what this owner is doing is right. I'm not saying that you have no legal options. But you need to get the "i CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN'T leave!" option out of your head. Leaving must be a possible outcome.
Be very realistic. Can your location support two of the same dojo? What is it going to be like having this man as a competitor?
I hate to break it to you. You can leave your job. You deserve to be treated better. Even if you were making the federal minimum wage it doesn't sound like you can support yourself. The only reason you can't leave is that you tell yourself "This is the only option." I know you invested a lot into this, but your boss isn't going anywhere, and you don't really sound happy even though you love the work. If you are good at what you do your boss is missing out on a good employee. In my opinion you are facing a life choice. If you are young to be in this position you will find and be accepted at another dojo.
