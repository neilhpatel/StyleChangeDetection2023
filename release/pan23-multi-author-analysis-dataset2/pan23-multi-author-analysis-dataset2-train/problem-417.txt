That said, again, what's important here is that these person and personal belongings searches cannot be unreasonable or otherwise demeaning or cause embarrassment to the employee. Without possibly disclosing your personal medical history, you should sufficiently be able to express to HR or management that this process they have adopted due to Covid does and will continue to result in embarrassment, or shame, or an undue burden for you personally. They should accommodate these concerns, or else I would say they risk opening themselves to a lawsuit if you were to get fired for refusing that type of a search in the future.
Keep in mind that HR, despite what they tell you, exists to protect and serve the company, not the employee.
Keep your questions to them somewhat open... "hi! I understand precautionary measures to prevent theft, but what is the company policy on employee searches?".
Probably just a kid using less scary words to deal with a scary situation more easily. You know, make light of it so dealing with it is less of a big deal.
