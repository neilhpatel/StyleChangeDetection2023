It is clear that potato and depression cancel each other on a 1:1 Basis. If you have 1 Depression you can be cured via the Applikation of 1 potato.
Hey, I’m just trying to quantify stuff, here. Terms like “recession” and “depression” have very specific definitions. It took Russia eight months of sanctions to get from “feeling cute, might delete Ukraine later” to “recession.” Still, the missiles fly. So, let’s see how they look when they get to “depression.” How long will that take.
They experienced a 97% collapse in car production since last year. The recession has been long here but up until now the Kremlin attempted to hide it with bullshit numbers and by throwing oil and gas revenues at it. It's just that it has become impossible to hide it anymore at this point.
This is the official data released straight from Moscow (i.e Putin), which means it could very well be BS.
For all we know Russia could actually be in a recession and they're hiding it both for pride and so their citizens don't rebel.
If the purpose of economic sanctions is to cripple an aggressor’s economy and convince them to stop fighting, the results to date have not been encouraging. So, where is the bottom, here? How many people have to starve before Putin pulls out? I’d like to see the numbers on that.
