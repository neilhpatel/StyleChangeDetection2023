It depends why you are looking to read it. If you are trying learn the history of Nazism and Hitler, my absolute official recommendation as an historian is that the best translation is none, as Mein Kampf is perhaps the single worst source for that purpose, and there is nothing that would be learned from reading it that you would not be better served with from a biography such as Kershaw's duology, or a general history like Evans' trilogy. This is not a response offered lightly, but one that is quite serious, based off of long study of the topic, and familiarity with the sources., and is likewise echoed by other historians of Nazi Germany here such as /u/commiespaceinvader . If you are writing a paper and simply need direct primary source quotations, just use the Murphy edition, but for god's sake don't waste your time reading it cover to cover.
I read the writings of many people in history with radical philosophies as I am interested in understanding their psychology. I do plenty of reading on for historical accuracy purposes, too; it was while reading a few other history books that I decided to search for this text. I don't fear reading the writings of an individual with whom I clearly have nothing in common because I stand firm in my own beliefs. I do not need someone warning me away from literal words on paper, I just need a recommendation for an accurate translation. Certain publishers selling the English translation donate the proceeds to Jewish charity organizations and seeing as how I have Jewish family, I don't mind contributing. Very unhelpful.
