With my last encounter with this guy he most definitely assaulted me. He told me to give him oral sex I said no then he proceeded to choke me pick me up and put me on his bed touch my breasts then he held me down and touched my private area. My school found out they told police and they said that as soon as I make a statement and give dna evidence (which I have) then it’s a pending assault charge but my mom never took me in to the police station so there’s no likely chance I could actually do anything until I’m older.
But you can speak to a trusted counselor at school and get help in reporting this to the police even with a parent’s assistance.
As a very general principle, “peer pressure,” as you describe it, will not be sufficient to create rape.
But this is why we have a law related to age of consent. A fourteen year old is particularly vulnerable to that kind of pressure, and generally lacks the experience to resist the sort of subtle pressure that an older person would recognize and discount.
In some states, the age of consent varies based on the age of the other participant. Without knowing your state, it’s difficult to offer any kind of opinion.
