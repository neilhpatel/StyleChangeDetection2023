I'm pretty sure quite a few of the additional ones in storage will be the "spare parts" the statement mentions. Those things have been mothballed for a while now, it is pretty likely that not all of them can be made combat-ready again. But Ukraine will need spare parts anyway...
They do have modern fire control systems and thermals, either the same or at least on par with the AMX-10s that France is sending. They are perfectly adequate for territorial guard units at least, and their primary contribution will probably be that they free up better equipment like newer models of the T-72 and incoming western tanks. Currently, there's quite a number of more modern tanks that Ukraine has to use as reserves just on the Belarusian border for the unlikely case that Russia launches an attack from there. Replacing those with older tanks like the Leopard 1s frees them up to be used in more critical zones.
How do you expect them to support the logistics of 10K tanks, never mind train crews to an adequate standard?
