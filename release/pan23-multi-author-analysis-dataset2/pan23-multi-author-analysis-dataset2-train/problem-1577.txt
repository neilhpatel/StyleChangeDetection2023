Basically anywhere, no, if she asked you for nude photographs, they have no cause to take legal action against you. More-so, blackmailing you for money is against the law most places.
You should report this conduct to the website. Doing anything further will be harder given it is online and they might be anywhere.
This is a very common scam. Typically people will get the nude images and then someone will pretend to be their dad or something and say you were texting their underage kid. And in exchange for not calling the police they'll ask for money.
My only guess would be that she's from tennessee since that's what her profile said. And that's exactly what I though. Thank you for your response and I will use the advice that you've given me.
There is a very good chance this woman does not actually live in Tennessee, and an even better chance she doesn't actually exist. A lot of the times these are done and by people in other countries using VPNs and such. Your best bet is to probably just block them and move on with your life.
