If you do owe it (you likely do), call the university. They may be willing to put you on a payment plan.
When she enrolled in the courses she agreed to pay the tuition they would be charging and the terms of cancelation. Generally there is a window where you can withdraw and recieve a partial refund,but passed that point you are responsible.
The fact that she never logged in doesn't change anything, she had yhr option to login and the school likely never revoked her ability.
Letting something go to collections is a poor decision, it doesn't have to go to collections and ruin credit score to pay less. There is always the opportunity to discuss with the school directly if they will accept a lesser amount. Which I will agree is not very likely to have happened, but it could've been attempted. Even if they didn't agree to lower it they could likely have given options to pay it back in payment plan or could point you to other resources.
Fees are not the same as tuition. She agreed to the terms, signed up/registered for the classes and decided not to go. She is still responsible for the payment of what she bought even if she decided not to take advantage of it.
Most places attempting to collect debt will set up reasonable payment plans to avoid having to take costly measures to force their money back through court judgements, wage garnishment or bank account garnishment.
