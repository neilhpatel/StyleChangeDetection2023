Do you mean the police have threatened to charge her? Or is this something her ex has said? I find it hard to believe she's going to be criminally charged in this; it seems to be a civil matter not a criminal one.
Her ex could pursue her in Small Claims Court for the value of the machine, but many people who threaten such a thing never actually follow through. Also, there's no guarantee he would win; it will depend a lot on how much notice she gave him.
At the time we were unsure but we have recently found out she will be charged, but we’ve been in contact with a lawyer and they seem to think it will not go very far, thanks very much for your advice as well!
I believe she tried to contact him but received no response, it had been here for sometime before she sold it and he contacted her again maybe a month to a month and a half ago and said he’d be claiming it as stolen, but to as well I thank you very much for your advice!
Title: Mother sold an ATV that was left on our property for a year, previous owner came looking for it but owes my mom money.
If he left the ATV on the property for over a year, it would likely be considered abandoned. According to a I found, Ontario Canada has been playing with the idea of unclaimed property policy for a while, but has not implemented it, so I don't think you are legally obligated to hold onto it unless you agreed to do so prior.
