10K and yes I have data points and we are in negotiation. My legal question is ‘given that am I dealing with another parties insurance, why should I be beholden to their internal practice?’ The car does not meet the legal definition of total loss and my preference is to have it fixed. Even if I agreed to their price I would want to know why I am not entitled to a repair if desired given state regulations.
Before anyone asks, I will not accept a salvage title and there isn’t a comparable vehicle actually for sale in my market.
If you can find local, similar cars (similar year, similar make and model, similar condition and mileage, etc.) going for significantly more than what insurance is offering you, you can bring that evidence to them and begin the discussion about disputing their offering.
You are correct that TX statutes requires a total when repair costs exceed 100% of ACV, but I've never found any legal or case law standing that prohibits them from totaling at a lower percentage.
Because this is a third party claim, nothing is legally required from the at-fault driver (or their insurance) until you have a court judgment.
Getting you into another vehicle isn't what this is about. This is about reimbursing you the rough fair-market value of what was lost. If you can dispute their offering of $10,000 with strong evidence that that's a non-negligible undervaluation, that would be step one.
You COULD choose to sue the other driver (Justice Court, TX small claims court which has a 20k limit, may be open to you) for your damages (reasonable repair costs, diminished value and/or loss of use). But you would recover funds only with a judgment in your favor.
