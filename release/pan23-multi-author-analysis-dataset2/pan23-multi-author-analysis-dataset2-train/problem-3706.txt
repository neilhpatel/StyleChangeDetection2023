Is the eviction related to a broken clause in the lease? You don’t get to throw people out without a reason. You can’t make them pay if they don’t reside there. There are a few exceptions like disputes around section 8 or restraining orders… but with the info above.. sounds wonky. Most cities have a resource to help with landlord disputes, maybe start there?
How could I be able to find these resources? Would there be a number I could call? I live on the Goldcoast if that helps at all.
Thank you for the reply, that's the thing why I'm putting it here and asking because it is wonky, it's messy and there are so many red flags.
Good gracious… first they can threaten all they like.. you can threaten back. Doesn’t resolve the problem. I know it’s super hard not to be emotional around this, but the facts will out as they say. If this person was out of their lease period, other clauses in the lease apply. If it was a one year lease and the lease ended, there could be a 30day to one year rollover clause. But all of the same agreements apply. This person has to have broken a leasing agreement to be evicted, must have documentation to prove. I’d be on the phone with the city in the am asking. If the lease is in a 30 rollover the landlord can ask you to leave with very little notice, but then you wouldn’t have to pay anything forward. It feels like you are missing a rather large part of this equation.. must read lease. If this is verbal… whoa nelly.
Have you seen the lease? Put your eyeballs on it and read the fine print? I live in CO, but our local city runs this resource. I think most cities have them??? It’s cheaper to resolve the problems up front than to turn to the courts and it helps with the houseless problem.
