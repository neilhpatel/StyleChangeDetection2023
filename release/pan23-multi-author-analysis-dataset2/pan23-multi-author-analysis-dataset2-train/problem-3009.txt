If the other party didn’t have any sort of stop sign or red light you are a majority at fault. Even if they share slightly in fault you will not be able to collect from their insurance given Texas uses a modified comparative liability model.
OP you haven’t given much information on why you want to know who was at fault but if there were no injuries and you both have insurance, this is something your respective insurance companies are going to negotiate on their own. It is very likely who is “at fault” will only partially factor into how they divide the costs and that will also in turn only partially factor into whether and how much your insurance costs rise. It’s best to just volunteer your version of events to your own insurance company and to the other company if they ask you and let them deal with it. That’s what you pay them for.
This is what I had assumed. Insurance will deal with it in court, but this is for future reference. I was not sure what the legality of a turn signal being on would be. From this thread so far it seems that they are just about worthless in the court's eyes.
It’s not that the court doesn’t care it’s that you had a greater duty to yield to the right of way. The turn signal certainly could have contributed to the accident (if you can prove it was on.) There may also be legal reasons why his signal was on and he didn’t turn, such as a business entrance right after the turn. You obviously know the location and if this was a plausible reason.
I'm sure I will be contacted again to give my side of the incident, but this is for my own knowledge really. Insurance will do what they do and I'm sure my rates will jump a bit for awhile.
