If you're in a different country, that information will be useful, but I wouldn't personally have enough information if this is outside of the US.
The main reason I was asking location is because if you were in the united states, I can say confidently that this is a scam. I don't know enough about the laws in other countries, but I think that verifying the source, as the commentor said, is a good idea.
You mentioned she gave them her ID, would that have private information on it that the potential scammers could use to commit fraud? If so, if this turns out to be a scam, you should try to take whatever steps are regionally available to prevent fraud from that information.
To me this sounds like a very simple scheme: you tell someone they have broken the law but you won't charge them if they give you information. Then you move the goalposts and say that you won't charge you if they pay you money. This gives you money and private information which you can use to commit fraud and get more money.
If I were you, I'd be careful, and don't send them any money until you have something undeniably official as proof.
The email she received asking for money was from the verifed lawyer that is proven; we are not sure what to do because everything that she has experienced is the sceheme you told us. What should we do>.
I think you need to verify that it is not a scam. Was it a legal letter/email and are they a re verfied legal representative etc..... do some research.
Hi, the scheme that you just told is exactly what they did: they had no information on her, but after they coerced information from the masses about how they would not sue them after giving information is when they moved past said goalpost; my mother isn't happy with this. We can't counter sue(?), and now we're not sure what to do.
