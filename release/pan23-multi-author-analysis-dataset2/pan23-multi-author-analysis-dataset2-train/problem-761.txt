And that's why Britain isn't enough, and neither is Poland. Neither of these two have any qualms about stepping into the role of a great power; in Britain there's an urgent need to prove our continuing relevance after recklessly abdicating from the top tables of European power, and in Poland they aspire to a leadership role among the free nations on Europe's eastern borders, and both nations have it in for Russia. But neither of these are great enough for Germany to feel comfortable falling in behind them. Germany needs a _greater_ power to follow, if they're not to feel worried about returning to a position of leadership and even domination over others - and that greater power can only really be America.
Denmark officially agrees to forfeit its own delivery of 19 French-made self-propelled Caesar howitzers, opting instead to have them delivered directly to Ukraine.
If US/EU/UK combined donated 19 Caesar howitzers, or equivalent, for every 6 million people, that would be 2,660 Caesar howitzers. Or roughly 3,500 Bradleys / Strykers.
