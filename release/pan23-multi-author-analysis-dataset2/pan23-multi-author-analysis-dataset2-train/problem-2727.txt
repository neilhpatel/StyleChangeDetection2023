I ask because I left my ex in a hurry (he shares another home with his father on the title) and I went with his father to get my belongings and my ex wouldn't let me go in to get them myself because I had asked police to come with me previously because I am afraid of him/ he gets unhinged when he losses control. So he still will not return a lot of my and my baby's property and the police asked me to not go back and to go to claims court to get this settled... but it's like over 8K of property and it is just so complicated.
If you are both on the title as co owners, you can't be evicted for not paying rent(and effectively can't be required to pay rent). You could sell your share of the home through a partition sale, and so could the other owner. You would be responsible for half the property taxes and maintenance costs. The other co owner could move in. Either of you can have guests. If either of you goes bankrupt, the mortgage co can require the other owner to pay off the home or refinance in their name only.
