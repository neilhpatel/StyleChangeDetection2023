The difference this time is that the Democrats didn't even need to pass anything. Literally complete inaction from Congress on this issue would have been better than how this turned out. Then the workers would have at least been legally protected in their strike. There's no way the companies wouldn't have folded as quickly as possible. Would there be an economic disturbance that resulted? Maybe, but we're about as far as you can get from the next election right now, so the political repercussions would have been minimized. But Dems in Congress chose to prioritize that slim risk and the happiness of their donors, and took those protections away. Any political fallout from that is on them, full stop.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
