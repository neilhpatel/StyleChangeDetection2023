This is way above the pay grade of a Reddit sub... Institutional abuse and sexual abuse allegations are things that would need to be handled by a lawyer that is intimately familiar with such things. This likely even goes into the territory of federal civil rights violations which makes it even more specialized... My advice would be to look for news articles about other people who have gone after facilities for similar abuses and see if you can reach out to the lawyers for those victims to find out if any of them are interested in hearing more about your potential case... You don't need to limit yourself to VA specifically because this is very likely to be a federal situation... I know that there have been similar suits in FL over the last few years so that may be a good place to start research...
Keep in mind that some states have statutes of limitations on such claims as being X number of years after the victim turns 18... I am not sure what the specifics are in VA, but it would be a good idea to know that.
I’m not sure if it would do any good to be quite honest. They’re still up and running after somebody died three years ago. The person ended up going into cardiac arrest after the staff were dismissive and kept telling the child they were faking their symptoms. One of the other patients had to run in the back and call 911 after she collapsed ( which of course you aren’t allowed to go in the back ).
