Ukraine is making hay over Poland missile blast because Zelenskyy is always ready to ever tighten sanctions on Russia and up the ante in arms sent to Ukraine. All sides need to just calm down and let the investigation determine what the truth is, the evidence will not lie (though there are people that will). Whatever the truth is, Ukraine is being bomb to beat hell with every attack on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure a crime against humanity and a violation of the Geneva Conventions, yes a war crime. These attacks represent an escalation by Russia and calls for just one large escalatory response, Ukraine needs even more weapons and more sophisticated weapons to both defend itself and deter further such attacks. To not stop further attacks means blood in our hands, the blood of millions of Ukrainians who will freeze to death and tens of millions more Ukrainian refugees flooding into Europe.
I 100% can confirm a split over who's missile it was will lose more support then acknowledging it was a devastating result of defending themselves from rus. aggression.
