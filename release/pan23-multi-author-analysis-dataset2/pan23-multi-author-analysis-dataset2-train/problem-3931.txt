We can't tell if that charge is legitimate or not. It would be based on the specifics of charges, payments, your billing cycle, your outstanding balance, etc.
Well, they can send it to collections and your credit will take a huge hit, which will cost far more than $1.58 in your time and hassle to resolve. If you can resolve it any other way than paying it off. So think long and hard whether $1.58 is really the hill you choose to die on.
Edit to add: The reason why I'm feeling like I want to see what that conclusion looks like is mostly because of the Bank of America website. As of the 6th of January, and up to even this second, the interface shows me as having an account in good standing. $1800 credit limit, just like they said it was going to be. Nothing at all about being closed or suspended. I hadn't tried in a while, but I just tried to make a purchase in the faint hope that this had all resolved itself somehow. Naturally, it is declined, because my account is closed. They told me so, but I had to talk to a person to find that out, and they lied to me about how I could get it back. That such a big company can have such a broken site and deliver such terrible service makes me want to make them spend as much as possible to recover that $1.58. I'll be calling and talking to them about it, but I'm not paying it.
The last actual use of the account was to pay a bill on the 12th of November. I then received a late fee and this same interest fee on the 20th and 22nd of both November and December. As of the 6th of January the debt is clear, 22nd I get the same interest fee, but not the late fee.
