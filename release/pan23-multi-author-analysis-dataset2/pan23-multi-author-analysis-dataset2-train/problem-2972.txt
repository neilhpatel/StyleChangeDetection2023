For example...our new customer complaint application, C360. Now, in the past, if you had a complaint, you called your local post office, we'd hear your complaint, and act on it, or explain why we couldn't. Such phone calls took 10 minutes at most, maybe 10 minutes of investigation, and a few minutes to followup with the customer. This new app is a fucking shit show that has the customer plugging in shit tons of information, clicking on all manner of radio buttons.... Then, about three to four people pass this through each other to process and assign the complaint. They don't understand how the potal system works so they arbitrarily assign all complaints to the addressee's post office...
