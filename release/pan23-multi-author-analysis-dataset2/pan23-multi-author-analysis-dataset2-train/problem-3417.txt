No, 007 is on a mission to find out why Chinese scientists are vanishing on the moon in an effort to release international tension and prevent WW3. Bond then finds out Elon Musk has secretly built another moonbase and he is the one abducting Chinese scientists for his sinister project.
So, it's another space race. This time it's China vs. US. Nothing like a challenge to get the team spirit going. Seems to me solar makes more sense than nuclear for long-term habitation. But I'm just a sci-fi dweeb. Also thinking long-term leapfrog potential for other projects. But, I'm just a dweeb.
Okay, but then what? Isn't harvesting helium a mining operation? Dark side of the moon, so it won't ruin our view, but what's the goal? Is this supposed to provide energy for trips to Mars? Is this Xi's retirement home they are building?
I'd say maybe to a battery charging facility on the moon. The amount of traffic to the moon and back required seems like it could be a problem. As for the land, it's a dusty rock with no atmosphere. People complained about wearing a mask during Covid. Having to wear a space suit would be more unpleasant than that.
That's cool. So, helium-3 and nuclear fusion is a very different story from the headline. The other side of the moon seems like a safer location for an experiment that could result in an explosion 100 times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Japan to end WWII.
