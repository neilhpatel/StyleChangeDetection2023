RIM is connected to Atomwaffen that has been trained in the Russian camps, so US has fifth column prepared to do the same. They have already killed like 8 people.
Honestly, I’m so tired of hearing about Jan 6th. During the 4 years of Trump’s presidency there were 23 liberal started and democratic supported riots with idiots running around talking about “No Justice, No Peace” with a whole bunch of people killed by rioters, attacks on police and a riot outside of the White House, and since the definition is sedition is “Conduct or Speech inciting people to rebel against the authority of a state or monarch” everybody that supported or took part any of of the riots during that 4 year period are just as guilty of sedition as those idiots on Jan 6th. It completely blows my mind that the left and the right constantly condemn the actions of the other side and then turn around and do the same thing. Just like with those classified documents… and both sides ignorantly believe they have the moral high ground while in reality they are both just equal parts of the same problem.
