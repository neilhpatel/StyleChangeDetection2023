This would depends on all kinds of details. Are we avoiding intellectual property laws or something else?
In the broadest terms it is unlikely that an off-shore VDI and TeamViewer is the “one simple trick” to avoid the law.
It really sounds like a "simple trick" thats why I want to understand why is not valid, unless there is just a random rule that says "this is not valid".
For the most part law isn’t computer code to be fooled with contrived inputs to produce spurious outputs. There is the application of common sense, legislative intent, and equity.
Moreover, in this lack of detail about the best we can say is that at a technical level you probably haven’t avoided the crime or violation.

Does the 'copying' concept applies to show images or videos of it? Should not that extend to every video that is avaiable in youtube? Or does just apply some "common sense" that solves it all?
