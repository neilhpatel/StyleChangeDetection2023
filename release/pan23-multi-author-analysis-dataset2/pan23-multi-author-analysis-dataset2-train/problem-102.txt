But if you feel like you broke your leg because of their failure to maintain the store, you’d contact a personal injury attorney. Preferably with more paragraphs and sentences.
This is a classic premise liability slip-and-fall case. You don't list your location, so specifics can't really be given.
I don’t mean to make you feel bad. I’m saying that because being concise and clear in your communication will make your case more attractive to an attorney.
Premise liability for business invitees is contingent on negligence on the part of the property owner. It's not as simple as "I got hurt on your property, so you're responsible". Instead, the courts must look at factors such as assumption of the risk (you saw it was icy, and decided to walk across it anyway), the open or obvious nature of the hazard (hazards that are open and obvious are generally supposed to be avoided by a reasonable person), the shopkeeper's duty to warn about known hazards (if someone let an employee know about the ice, and they didn't put out a sign or salt, that's bad for them), a premise owners responsibility to keep their property fit for its intended purpose (placing done salt and clearing snow/ice in high traffic areas), and the extremes of the weather involved.
It's certainly worth contacting a personal injury attorney who specializes in premises liability, but there's no guarantee you have a claim available. It's very factual dependent.
