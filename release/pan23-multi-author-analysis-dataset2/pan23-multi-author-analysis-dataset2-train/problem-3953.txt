It seems like a silly, unethical game to play for an obvious pecuniary gain, something that a character and fitness board would find interesting should you ever want to actually be a lawyer.
I disagree with u/KBCme's simple conclusion; a "representation of fact" can be made via all sorts of actions and non-actions, not just a literal statement. You do not need to explicitly say the magic words "I am a lawyer" to impart the belief that you are one, and that is what is necessary to make a representation of fact. A pattern of lawyerly behavior is a stretch but could theoretically pass muster. Though if a judge buys that argument, whether that representation is material, and whether the landlord actually relied on it, are separate issues.
I'm not barred in IL but in every state I am barred in, you can look up my name via the state bar and find out the city I work in.

They do have our home address on file after all.
