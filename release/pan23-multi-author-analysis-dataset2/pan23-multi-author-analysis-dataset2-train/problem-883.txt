As for the walled up cubby hole full of construction debris, those are very common in houses this old. More often than not something has been wholly or partially walled off near the basement area and it’s almost always full of old pipes and whatnot. It’s going to be hard to prove that the seller did that, we really anyone in the past 140+ years could have done it, and it’s not necessarily the type of location that would get renovated “down to the studs”.
Has your house been declared a historical home? If so, it’s possible no subfloor is acceptable. Houses didn’t used to be built with subfloors, just planks underneath, and historical homes have to be renovated true to how they were built in many cases. Even if it’s not a historical home, it’s possible that because of its age it’s grandfathered in and doesn’t need to be updated with one.
Did you have a home inspection prior to purchase? They probably wouldn't have caught the charred studs inside the walls, but if you did then did they note any issues/damage?
Did the seller disclose anything? You could go after them for not disclosing the fire damage if they were the one who covered it. The dump room is something you can go after.
