I’ve done a lot more reading in the NALC book. And under article 8 and 8.5 they can only mandate after and only after they have maxed out the ODL. My office is presuming they will max them out and just mandating everyone before they have fully scheduled out the ODL. On top of that, mandating on SDOs is called and overtime draft. And can only be done in emergencies. And can be refused as per any prearranged conditions such as birthdays, anniversaries or appointments. And cannot be questioned by management. But my original inquiry was if it has legal standing that if I do have VA doctors appointments scheduled for my SDO and they then institute a last minute overtime draft that I am required to prove to management that I have a legitimate doctors appointment. I don’t then they are legally allowed to require me to prove I have actually been to a doctor in my scheduled free time away from work. And also when I am not requesting any form of leave. My management staff have been completely out of control with mandating. And also under article 3 of the NALC they are required to keep us fully staffed and have not done so for over seven months. We have been working Christmas hours since october of 2020. Anywhere from 10 to 14 hour days, and with days off mandated, six days a week.
Laws work in the reverse manner, laws have to say they cannot. If the law doesn't say they cannot, them they can. This probably isn't going to be covered under labor law. This will probably depend entirely on your union contract and your union's willingness to fight for their members.
Provided they are maxing out the otdl, they can mandate. Supposed to rotate from junior up every quarter but if it's that bad and everyone's coming in on sdo, they are likely fine.
