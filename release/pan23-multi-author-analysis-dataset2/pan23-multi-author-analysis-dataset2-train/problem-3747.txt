Generally speaking, a garage keeper is liable for the vehicles in their possession. I can only speak to how this would happen where I live (Canadia); this may or may not apply where you live.
Keep in mind the insurance company will only subrogate if they feel it is financially worth it. They are not obligated to pursue subrogation.
If all else fails; you can always put in an insurance claim with your insurance company, and your insurance company will make a claim on your behalf against the dealership. Based on what you're saying, I think the insurance company would have a good claim to subrogate against the dealership; this would have the effect of 0'ing out any amount paid on your behalf under your insurance (therefore hopefully not resulting in an increase to your premiums!). Some insurers, however, will point the claim regardless of dollar value; so you may want to ask your insurer how a claim like this would be handled, and whether or not / to what extent it would effect your premiums in the event that the 3rd party is held fully responsible.
If it is the case that you had dropped off your vehicle, and the garage was fully in care, custody, and control of that vehicle, and it was stolen while under their custody, then they would likely need to claim that loss against their garage keepers liability policy.
Pursue with the dealer, if they balk, file with your insurance. Keep all your records. Your insurance will eventually make a subrogation decision. If they decide not to subrogate then file in small claims court against the dealer in the amount of your deductible.
In Arizona if they DO subrogate, they are required to subrogate your deductible. Not all states require that.
