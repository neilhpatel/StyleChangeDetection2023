This is very state-dependant. There are websites that will help you craft the most widely accepted advanced directives, which can be legitimate in about 44 of the 50 states iirc. If you are being trained that you need a dnr from your specific state only, that training is likely incorrect, unless you are one of the states with wild specific requirements. I understand it from a liability perspective, but it's terrible policy from a patient's rights perspective.
The reasoning behind why tattoos are not enforceable is there have been cases where people have since changed their mind about their stance on resuscitation despite having gotten a tattoo proclaiming the opposite years earlier. Medical professionals err on the side of using all possible means to keep you alive because we can't undo death, and it could open them up to legal prosecution if they let someone die who actually didn't want to.
EMT/Paramedic training in my state VA as of 2011 taught us to ignore tattoos for the reasons listed above. We only look out for medical tags. Which could be on bracelets or dog tags.
