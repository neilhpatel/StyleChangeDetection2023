The production company, was centered on my relative. He owned all the gear except personal instruments, and as far as I know, he leveraged that to keep the copyrights in the company. Video and audio recording would have been done by bandmates, friends and family (like me), employees (we had a few roadies we'd pick up for bigger shows). I don't know if the company had a planned successor, and might have passed to his wife? I am working with her permission, but neither of us is sure how the company's copyrights are effected, or if these were registered.
If it's not clear in my other responses, these are mostly tripod recordings done from the sound booth. Camera, board, cabling, etc. was all owned by a production company, in turn owned by my relative.
As far as I know only studio recordings of original songs, and those songs themselves were ever registered for copyright.
There are still two copyrights at least, the song (lyrics and music) and the recording. Those are automatic, nothing needs to be registered. All the songwriters would have rights.
The licensing of the covers would be something to address for wide release. This explanation is a little basic but it gives you the gist:
