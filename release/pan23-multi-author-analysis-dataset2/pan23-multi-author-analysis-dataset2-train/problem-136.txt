Most immigrant communities have a place like this where people can get help with legal documents or sending money to family. Most of the time they’re attached to a grocery store or some other business in the community. They generally cater to older people who aren’t comfortable using technology or people who have just emigrated and don’t have other options yet. It’s no surprise that China would use these places to spy on their own people.
Because the law requires due process, and we don't simply take the accusers word at face value. The article even states the RCMP are investigating the ones in Ontario. If they find concerning things there I suspect the investigations will be expanded to additional sites. But they don't get to just kick in doors and take private property on the say so of a private citizen.
But week after week we read more articles about illegal police stations that are just allowed to keep functioning. It's a smear campaign on something they wish were illegal but isn't.
It isn't. Nobody seems to care. I really can't understand why RCMP haven't kicked their doors in, seized all of their files and prepared charges against these people.
And before you ask what's wrong with harassing something you don't like, I remind you that's exactly why abortion clinics get people camping outside to harass staff.
