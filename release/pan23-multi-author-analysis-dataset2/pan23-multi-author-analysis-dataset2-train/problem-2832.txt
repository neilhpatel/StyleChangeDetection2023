Your best bet honestly is to take some of the money you saved on the commission and pay a local real estate lawyer to help you determine your liability (if any) and listen to his advice. The commission on a 2.2 million dollar home is significant, and you've saved enough by not having to pay him. Again take those savings get a professional opinion and not take reddits advice. Good luck to ya.
Go to the local Board of REALTOR®️ and ask for options in a hearing. Typically, if he/she is a REALTOR®️ , there will be options for you to go through their board to settle a commission dispute.
I would file a complaint with the state real estate agent licensing agency. Ultimately, it will come down to the wording in the contract and if he sues you, whether a judge would agree that his actions constituted his breech of the contract.
Then you have an implied agency agreement (I’m not a lawyer but I’m a real estate agent) it is, in my experience, with that type of agency difficult to pursue commission especially down the line like this. I’d talk with an attorney who specializes in real estate next because you’re talking big money on a 2.2mil house and don’t want to get screwed because they may know how to work the system since they walked away like they did but more likely than not this will be a meeting with a lawyer where you send him the emails of them abandoning you and him sending a letter on his letterhead.
