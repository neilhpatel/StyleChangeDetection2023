The rule in Canada is concurrent sentences when it is charges stemming from the same set of facts. (The response above is incorrect that your lawyer will have to try to get concurrent sentences. You will automatically serve concurrent sentences if what you say is true and it is 5 charges stemming from the same incident.).
Additionally, as a general rule you do not serve your full sentence (i.e. even if you get sentenced to the maximum of 10 years you will be out in less).
You’re lawyer will attempt to have you serve all 5 counts, concurrently. I’m not sure what the circumstances were but I’d say 10 years is possible and out in 7 if no further charges incur while you’re serving your time. If it’s hun charges that increases your sentence depending on what state. I’m in NY and I know illegal guns come with stiff sentences.
Your attorney will work to make the sentences concurrent, so that you're serving all five sentences at the same time.
Edit: nvm I am stupid, I didn’t understand the concurrent part. But you said the lawyer will attempt it. Does that mean there is the possibility that that you need have to serve them sequentially? I really have no clue how this works.
