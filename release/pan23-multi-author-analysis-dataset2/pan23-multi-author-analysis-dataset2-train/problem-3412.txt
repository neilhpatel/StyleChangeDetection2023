It is not illegal in Finland and in fact it was present in other demonstrations elsewhere in Finland. If legality changes then it is a different matter, but that decision is not made by Turkey nor does the extortion make it so. So Turkey has the right to veto, seems Nato opposition here had merit to their arguments that we should not ally with authoritarian regimes.
The best I understand it, a chunk of congress wanted to make the F-16 sale contingent on Turkey agreeing to stop harassing Greece. Turkey wanted the US to waive that clause in light of their (very significant) assistance with Ukraine and Iran.
And although there is no direct relation, they folded that request into the Finnish and Swedish NATO applications.
Always were, its just sad that some concessions are already made, like in Finland on Independence Day this week they prohibited PKK flags from a demonstration. While the authorities claim no connection rather "prevent provocations and creating a danger" it is hard to see who would be provoked other than Turkey administration.
I would hope they would give no concessions and while I have supported joining Nato for 20+ years I am starting to agree with the opposition argument that we should be aligned with authoritarian regimes like Turkey.
