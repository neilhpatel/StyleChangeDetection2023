The police may not have been able to, but the school's Title IX coordinator sure could have. The campus police should have helped you contact the appropriate police department and they should have helped you contact the correct school office (and I'm surprised they didn't act like they were mandated Title IX reporters - school police almost always are).
It's not too late to contact the police for where the assault occurred. That would start a criminal investigation process.
It's also not too late to contact your school's Title IX office. A Title IX investigation is not a criminal case and can occur independently of a criminal case. It can result in punishment for the other student, up to and including expulsion.
Sure, but an on-campus title ix investigation is not time limited like that. That limit applies to the OCR complaint, and because the OP was told that they couldn't do anything by a university official (the police), OCR might waive their 180 day requirement.
I mean, most campus police are deputized by the county to work on and off campus. I doubt they “couldn’t” do anything, I think the just didn’t want to.
