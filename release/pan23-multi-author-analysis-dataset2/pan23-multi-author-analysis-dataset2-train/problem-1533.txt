You inspected, test drove, liked the car and bought it. I'm assuming this car is 20+ years old, correct? There's no warranty on used cars.
Bring it to his shop, maybe you can get a deal but unless he's running a charity, he's not paying for it. You're paying for repairs for your car.
I understand theres no warranty, but I bought the car based on claims made by the owner. If they purposefully furthered false claims/withheld information about the cars condition, isn't that fraud? I would have haggled the car down and not bought at asking price if I wasn't assured of it's mechanical condition.
Next time I'll make sure the seller is fine with an inspection done at a mechanics shop. Lesson learned, but I am trying to think of the best options in this scenario (legally but more likely just socially asking him to be reasonable).
Plus there's no legal standard for a description. I can say "it's in great shape" and that won't hold any legal weight because there's no standard.
Pampered isn’t a warranted statement. You bought a car as is. You had the opportunity to do any inspections you desired. Your state might give you an out if it can’t pass inspections.
