Do you have an actual contract or just the offer letter? What's it say about your protections against being fired, disciplines, etc?
I am located in the Bay Area, and my work is in Sacramento. I have the offer letter. I will confirm my protections against being fired and edit this response when I have it.
You have very few rights here. You can be fired if you insist on not going in for onboarding. The company does not have to reimburse you for your travel costs. It's not common for an employer to go back on promises made during hiring, but it happens often enough, usually when the person hiring you isn't communicating properly with your future manager.
In this situation, the person hiring me from HR and my future manager were both present and aware that I wanted to confirm what my requirements for being in-person before moving would be, prior to me accepting the offer. Therefore, I don't believe that it was a full discrepancy, because my future manager is the one who contacted me about coming in sooner.
in your case, and in most jobs in the US, the employer can change the terms of employment at will. It doesn't make financial sense to spend time hiring someone and then giving that person expectations they cannot fulfill, but it does happen. So you'll have to deal with the commute once a week (many people commute SF to Sac), work things out with your manager, or find a new job.
