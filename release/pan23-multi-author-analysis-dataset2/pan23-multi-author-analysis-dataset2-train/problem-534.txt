Lionbridge does not seem to be a company that has high employee satisfaction. I agree with other commenters to contact HR and even if you don't currently quality for state disability, it seems to me your condition still entitles you to some kind of disability accommodation under ADA including certain job assignments.
I was also on a lot of medications and it was difficult to work more than 4-5 hours and for the first month needed breaks every hour. Under ADA, they legally have to give me reasonable accommodations which they did after my doctor wrote all my requests in a letter to them. I only got paid for the hours worked with the non-worked time I used my sick days. This allowed me to keep my job until I fully recoverd.
Not paying you for hours that you have worked is not OK, regardless of the quality of your work. If theyâ€™re unhappy with your work, their recourse is to reduce your hours or fire you.
My former employer requires all employees regardless of status to clock in and out. They don't dock pay if you're salaried, but would take any time less than 40 hours from your pto/vacation bank.
