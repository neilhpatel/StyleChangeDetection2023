Maybe, we can't guess. Debt collectors have been known to bring suit after the SOL. It's up to the defendant to raise the SOL as a defense. If you are served, include in your answer that the debt is past the SOL.
How should I respond? He gave me a direct line to call him and his name and said he “needed to hear from me by Thursday”. I get the feeling he’s just trying to scam me into acknowledging the debt or making some payments on it.
I wouldn't respond, but if you'd like to respond, it should be to ask him for an address to which you can send a debt validation letter. If he declines to give you an address or insists that he's somehow not obligated to comply with the FDCPA, you can assume he's either a scammer or an unscrupulous but real debt collector who is willing to violate the FDCPA. If he gives you an address, you should send the debt validation letter via certified mail within 30 days of initial contact. This letter helps you vet the collector's veracity, it also prevents the debt collector from pursuing the debt until such time as they validate it. You can find sample DV letters here : in your letter, if you wish, you can ask for more information about the debt, tell the debt collector that the debt is not yours or that it's past the SOL, and tell them not to contact you again or specify that they only contact you in writing.
Well, if I don’t respond, wouldn’t I forfeit any opportunity to settle the debt were it to be a valid claim?
I asked for the name of his law firm and it was only available via the sos.ca.gov website as an LLC incorporated in Delaware and operating in CA. The type of business is an “investment club” however part of the form says it’s a “Corporate Service Company Which Will do business in California as CSC - Lawyers Incorporating Service.”.
