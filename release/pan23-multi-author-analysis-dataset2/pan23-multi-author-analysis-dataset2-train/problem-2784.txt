“Discrimination on the basis of disability is prohibited by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance)”.
As others have recommended, you need to have a friendly conversation with disability services. Come prepared with your medical documentation that supports your requests and be able to explain what your accommodation needs are in order to appropriately access your course material/learning environment. Threatening them will get you nowhere. Keep an open mind to their suggestions and remember they are there to help you. The more pleasant and informative you are about your specific needs, the more they will be able to address them.
You're not adding any relevant information here. There is nothing for you to do until you talk to your disability and make an effort to agree on a reasonable accommodation with the school.
