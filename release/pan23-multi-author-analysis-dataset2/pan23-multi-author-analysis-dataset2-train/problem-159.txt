CO requires a 10 minute break for every 4 hours. Is this just one manager or everyone? I'd try talking to a different manager, or possibly the franchise owner if available.
Basically, no, they must provide uninterrupted 10 minute rest breaks (or pay overtime for forcing you to work through them). Meal breaks they may be scummy and try to claim the exception, but that still doesnâ€™t get them out of the rest breaks.
does not count as a break. Standing around while doing nothing while on the clock is part of the job. A break is when you can leave the front or even leave the store.
Someone in the thread already said they sent it to a benevolent person in corporate. With the info you gave they could already ID her if they really wanted. And who knows what they'll do with the info.
It's one thing if you are making that (not smart) decision for yourself, but you are making it for someone else. You should at least check with her to make sure she is OK with your decision.
OP, kudos for being a good brother, but for your sister's sake please edit out unecessary identifying information. All that is needed is the state. No need for age, birth month, specific city and how long she's been working there, probably should have left out the specific business in fact.
If her boss saw this thread he could ID your sister no problem ( it's not as unlikely as you might think that he might see the thread, all it takes is someone who knows someone in town's chick filet management to send them a link saying "OMG, is this you!", and if one of them gets the link he probably will. I could see an regular employee's friend actually sending the link and it working its way to him. That's a net hundreds of people wide.).
