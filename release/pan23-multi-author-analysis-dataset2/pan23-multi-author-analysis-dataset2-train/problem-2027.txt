Start with trying to communicate with him and just talk to him. I had a leak under my kitchen floor that flooded the wood floors of my next-door neighbor's entire first floor of a 4,000 sq ft home. He tried to saddle me with the problem. I called my insurance guy and he said I could file a claim for my damage because that was covered under the house policy, but my neighbor had to deal with his own insurance guy. I just told my neighbor what he said and to call his own insurance guy. He did, but much of the work had to take place in between the houses to create better drainage and I offered to split that cost, but he declined as his insurance paid for it, but it did require some heavy earthmoving and digging equipment. Well, he didn't tear down my fence, but he did re-sod the grass he tore up communicating through the entire process. And we're still neighbors. Communication is the first line of defense.
One thing to consider is that they may not be allowed to build the pool at all. Many jurisdictions limit the percentage of your lot that can be developed. With an oversized house already in place they may not have enough land left for a pool. This may also affect your land due to changed drainage area.
