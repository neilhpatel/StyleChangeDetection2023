If he's not on the lease, he's an unauthorized tenant. You might not be able to make H leave at this point, but P has no right to stay there. You may have to have your landlord evict him, however.
I'd probably get him involved sooner rather than later. The longer you wait, the more it looks like you've been condoning it and just now have a problem with it.
A name would help, but it can be pulled off without it. It's more difficult but possible. The important part is to be able to serve him with written notice. That might be able to be accomplished by addressing a letter to the occupants of the address and not necessarily a specific person.
As you've correctly noted, moving in a "guest" as a tenant is a violation of just about every lease anyone's ever made. Your problem now is going to be that you, the four roommates, are the collective tenant and in order to evict H (if she will not send P away voluntarily), the landlord will have to evict you all. You definitely should get the landlord involved.
