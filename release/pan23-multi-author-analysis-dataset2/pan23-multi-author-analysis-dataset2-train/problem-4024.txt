He just took his word for it and let him go with a court date and that was it. I only learned about it this year in may when I was told I had a license suspension in Pennsylvania the offense happened in September 2019.
I live and work in Florida the offense happened in Pennsylvania. I had to take off work just to fly out of state and get things settled. My driver's license was suspended because of the offense and I had to pay to have it reinstated for something I didn't even do. Hope this helps a little bit sorry if it doesn't make much sense.
You can try to sue. There will be a big difference between “the police did what they felt was right at the time, even though charges were dropped later” versus “police knew it was incorrect and did it anyway”. You will certainly need a lawyer to file the claim, and the cost of this will absolutely exceed what you paid for the flight and restoring your license.
The officer who initiated the traffic stop only went off of name and date of birth a social security number was not provided nor was any form of identification.
