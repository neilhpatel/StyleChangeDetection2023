It may have been the police's way of telling you two to chill out and avoid each other, because if the police have to come back for another altercation, one or both of you might not be spending the night at home.
After the police said- you are not allowed to talk to them, I said- except to verbally defend myself. They said better be the bigger man, etc. I disagreed about that. One officer said- if you do that, next time we'll have to arrest you.
Consider the possibility that the police are telling you a whole bunch of scary stuff to get you two to chill out and leave each other alone and avoid each other, because you've clearly demonstrated that you can't be around each other without fighting, and if you continue to do that, one or both of you are going to end up getting arrested.
"Be the bigger man" means no matter what this person says to you, you have the option of refusing to respond, refusing to get dragged into some dumb argument that potentially ends up in a physical altercation, and instead maintaining your composure and ignoring them. You should choose that option in the future instead of the option you chose last time.
It's a calculation, with factors like risk, and standing up for what's right / acting out of self respect / acting heroically. How would you feel after "being the bigger man"? Don't you feel angry, oppressed etc? Doesn't it impact your productivity? People like to pretend these effects don't exist and irrationally stick to the "be the bigger man" dogma.
No, I really donâ€™t give a shit what other people think, especially in the case where I allow it to get the better of me, lose control of my emotions, get in a stupid fight, and end up in jail. All because someone made some dumb sounds at me with their mouth.
