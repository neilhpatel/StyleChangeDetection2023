Yes it does, it's just not the answer you want to hear. Was it scummy? Maybe. Was it illegal to require vaccination to keep your job? Not likely. Do you have any damages that you can directly point to due to getting the vaccine? Not likely. Were you under an employment contract? Per your reply to another person, no. Was the firing illegal? I feel you would have mentioned it if it were. So what you can do legally, is move on.

Unless you were fired because of a protected status such as race, then you can be let go for literally any reason including no reason at all. The only option is to move on, file for unemployment and look for a new job.
