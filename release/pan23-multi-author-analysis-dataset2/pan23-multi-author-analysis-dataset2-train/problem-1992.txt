My thought was that they would just cover it up or that I would be giving them a heads up? It isn't criminal to use a guests information for personal reasons? I thought it would be negligence on the hotels part.
There's really nothing for them to cover up. Honestly they don't have to do any specific thing. Most employers would be concerned about this.
The other user make a good point. If this was a national chain, bringing this to corporate may help avoid a local manager taking care of his buddy. But frankly, the national chain probably just drops the concern onto local management.
I can understand your concern, but as someone who works for a hotel company, I can tell you they're very unlikely to cover this up. Guest safety is something reputable hotels take very seriously indeed, and this type of a violation would get the employee terminated.
"Any person who willfully and without authorization possesses, uses, or attempts to use personal identification information concerning an individual without first obtaining that individual’s consent, and who does so for the purpose of harassing that individual, commits the offense of harassment by use of personal identification information, which is a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in §775.082 or §775.083.".
1. Why would we think the hotel did anything negligent? I can't really imagine a process whereby non-sensitive guest information like directory information would be subject to some kind of controlled use.
