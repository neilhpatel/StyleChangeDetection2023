Yeah the first charge isnt under dispute it’s the second one which we never agreed to and we have already been charged for those same phone calls and emails by our own lawyer. Thank you.
Green is their lawyer the first blue is my moms name and the second name of our lawyer. Red is my uncle and green is his lawyer.
If the lawyer is representing your aunt and uncle the bill goes to them. If the lawyer is representing the estate of your grandmother the bill goes to the estate. It isn't on you to pay the bill unless maybe if your the executor of your grandma's estate.
INAL- but I think the first charge is probably fair as lawyers are sometimes needed in real estate sales especially in that price range. The second charge I do question what that charge is and whether it should go to your uncle. I would ask the attorney for a more detailed explanation. If it doesn't satisfy you then you can take billing disputes to the bar association for mediation.
Please explain what you mean when you say the lawyer is "attempting to charge us $3500.00." Have they sent you an invoice to pay or are they saying they are going to deduct that amount from your share of the proceeds from the sale?
I don’t see how they could invoice us anything we never signed any contract or fee agreement with this lawyer we have our own and have alreAdy been charged by her for these same emails and phone calls.
