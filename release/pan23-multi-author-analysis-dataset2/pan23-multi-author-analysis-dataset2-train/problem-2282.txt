If that's the case and he installed a new fence 3 inches into his own property, well, that's his fence and I'd tell him to pound sand. Ignore him unless you are served papers to appear in court, and if so, consult a local real estate attorney before going to court.
Was the first fence, right on the property line? In some states you might be held responsible for half the maintenance of a fence like that, but this varies a great deal by area and you didn't include your location.
Your neighbor should have done the "neighborly thing" and asked if you wanted to go in on the fence. Even then you are not under any obligation to do so.
I agree with this. Our neighbors put in a fence with about 6 inches between it and our original fence and the vining weed problem that was nonexistent before is now out of control.
