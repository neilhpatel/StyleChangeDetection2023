1. You can give the keys back to landlord, refuse delivery of the property, and fight that out if landlord wants to fight. You'll have a reasonable argument but, of course, context and circumstances are important.
For anyone following along. I told them I would not occupy the space if it wasn’t cleaned quickly. That I would fight it as uninhabitable.
He told me I’m in the lease and there’s nothing I can do about it. I asked for a formal response so that I can settle this by whatever means necessary. I have 270 photos of nastiness to support my issues and the lease asked any issues to be reported in the first ten business days.
I reached out to the property manager and told him that I would not take occupancy of the house until it was cleaned. The bid I received was $1k to clean (I provided it to him). I also told him that they are more than welcome to come up with a solution to provide an acceptablly clean house for us to occupy. My quote was a courtesy.
3. This isn't a great option but it is the one most people are left with: you can clean and move your stuff in.
