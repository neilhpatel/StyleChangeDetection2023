China can’t conduct a war in the Indian Ocean even if they reached it. They have no ability to sustain operations there except Pakistan, which India will happily bomb.
It's a misleading news.. indian defence spending has almost been constant with very less increase each year. Most of which goes towards salaries and pensions(under new pension scheme).
India is looking for 20-25% reduction in manpower. So that the money can be spent towards tech... Like every other major power is already doing.
It’s at least as likely that they end up in the middle income trap, which is the ditch China may have just fallen into.
No small worry about Pakistan, too. Not state-to-state hostilities, but the potential for a major social collapse as Pakistan seems to be getting clobbered with drought, flood, heat waves, high inflation, Taliban terrorism, and an unstable political system all at once. Though Pakistan's military would probably be ready to take over again before it would come to a Haiti-style total collapse.
