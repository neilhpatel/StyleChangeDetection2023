While you need to be 13 to register a sUAS for recreational purposes, you must be 16 to take the Part 107 exam.
You can however, operate a sUAS for commercial purposes under the supervision of a part 107 pilot. So if you've got a parent or friend that is willing to get certificated and stand by while you fly then you're good to go. Just be aware they will remain the RPIC (remote pilot in charge) and will be fully responsible/liable if anything goes wrong with the flight or if any rules are broken.
because if i’m going to make money off of it i’d like to pay it back to them, and even if i don’t need to i like to show my gratitude. I’ve been blessed to grow up in a wealthy family and my parents have done a great job on raising me surrounded by experiences that most people could never dream of affording while still humbling me and teaching me the value of money. i want to pay it back. it’s that simple.
Good for you. While I’m sure your parents would never expect any money from you (especially at 13), learning this desire even crossed your mind will have them bursting with pride.
I recommend talking to your parents about your desires. Since you’re 13 and you need to be under the supervision of someone else, maybe one of them would want to take up flying drones with you? They could also support you by taking you to different drone meet-up groups in your area where you could meet professionals in the biz and start to network? You may want to come up with non-monetary ways to “pay” them back until you reach the age where you can take the exam.
