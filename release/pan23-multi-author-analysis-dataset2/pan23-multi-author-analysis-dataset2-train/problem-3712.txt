$800 is peanuts but get an attorney. Unless music is just a hobby you never intend to do anything with. You will need one. Get one now. You don't have to pay a lot. If they REALLY need your song, then $800 is peanuts. But they can also hire someone to cover it just like you. I would rather get $800 to establish myself and build on my career but a $2000-$3000 amount won't make them balk. You're in California, music attorneys are (normally, pre-COVID) at every Starbucks. Use this to your advantage.
You should already have an attorney who specializes in music and situations like this if you have 400k and do music.
My guess is that it's not (for example) a big [insert fruity trillion dollar company] campaign because they would license exclusively for a set period. But they wouldn't reach out directly, their ad agency would.
