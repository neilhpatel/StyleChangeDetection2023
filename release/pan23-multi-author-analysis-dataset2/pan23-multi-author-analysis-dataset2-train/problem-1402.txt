Like a responded elsewhere it's a mess... I'm done with it but thanks for your responses... Everytime he calls it notifies me that the call is recorded and if I thought the conversation should be private then to hang up and follow the facilities procedure to get my number on a private number list... Also I called his attorney and she thought he was out because apparently he had other people do this and left voicemails and she said usually when she gets calls from inmates it comes from the same number... I don't know it's all jacked up and I'm done... This all started because I felt bad for him and gave him some money for his canteen... Now all of the sudden he wants me to help with everything... He really doesn't ask for money much...
He says his attorney doesn't answer the jail calls... I don't know why... I'll ask next time he calls... But like I asked earlier shouldn't he be able to call his attorney on a private line for free? He has a court appointed attorney so I wonder if that has anything to do with it...
As an attorney, I hate getting calls like this. Because I don't necessarily have time to talk you and then him whenever you call me. I also can't control a phone call like that. Just get the questions, short message from your brother, call his attorney, and his attorney will get back to him when he has the ability to do so.
