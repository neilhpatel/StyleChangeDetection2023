At this point I just want her gone if she won’t sign the lease for the remaining 2 months of rent. But the problem is my ex is living there and will probably just say she’s a guest and is welcome to stay so even if I brought the police over to get her out as she’s just living on my dime, my ex is also on the lease and would give her permission to stay so it wouldn’t even be worth it. The only thing I could think of doing to possibly get rid of her is if I just showed up with my own friends and started sleeping there to annoy them as she’s been there for 6 months for free.
