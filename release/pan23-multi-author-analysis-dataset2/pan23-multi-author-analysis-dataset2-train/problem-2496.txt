. No questions will be asked and you will not be required to explain your decision. If you feel you cannot safely raise a child, that may be your best option.
You cannot sever your relationship with your older children unless someone is ready and able to adopt them. You can choose not to use your rights as a parent, but even if you formally waived them, you could sue to re-establish them. The courts can sever your rights if it's in the interests of your children, but generally not on your petition - it'd have to come from the other parent or from child welfare services.
If you would prefer to be part of your childrens' lives, you have that option. You can petition to change the custody orders to establish fixed visitation, instead of at the father's discretion. If you have a history of safety issues, that visitation might have to be supervised, but if you comply you will be able to file for unsupervised visitation down the line.
You will be required to pay child support as per the terms of your custody orders. You can take action to ensure that that's appropriate for your income, and if you are unemployed but actively looking for a job you may be able to get the amount you owe reduced or suspended.
Im currently unemployed and actually plan on going back on disability. I was originally on disability for 6+ years prior to getting married due to my mental health. Only reason I stopped collecting disability was due to the fact that their father was taking and cashing my checks before we got married. But like I stated, the money isnâ€™t the reason why I want to terminate my rights. I just want him out of my life permanently.
You could allow the children to be adopted by a step parent if one exists. You do not have to see the children. But you cannot get out of paying to support them (unless they are adopted).
