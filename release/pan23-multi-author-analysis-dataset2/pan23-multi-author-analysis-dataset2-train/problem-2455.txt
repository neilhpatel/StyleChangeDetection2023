I would suggest that Hannible of Carthage is probably not a good comparison. Yes, he took significant losses going over the Alp, but it allowed him to get the drop on the Roman Empire, allowing him to run around Italy unchecked for a significant period of time. When he was challanged, he proved himself to be a very capable commander, and secured multiple victories against the Empire. He was able to do this, in part, by the fact that he walked a load of elephants over a mountain (which is, admittedly, a ridiculous idea).
Hannible was competent enough that Rome was reluctant to challenge him directly, and he wondered around Italy for over a decade before finally having to redeploy to Africa to challenge the Roman advance there. He was considered to be the greatest threat to Rome during the second Punic war. Not a bad effort, considering he was going toe to toe with one of the most powerful empires on earth.
You’re underselling Hannibal a bit. He’s considered one of the greatest military minds of all time and still holds the record for the most enemies killed in an ambush, but yes, the other guy is an assclown.
His march over the Alps was an act of genious, not insanity. It completely surprised the Romans and bypassed their main forts protecting Northern Italy. He lost all but one of his elephants and a lot of men but the strategic gains of the move allowed him to still be known today as one of the best generals of all time.
