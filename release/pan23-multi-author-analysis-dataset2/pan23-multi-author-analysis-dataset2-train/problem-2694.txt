I would not recommend going into the PD and admitting that your nephew resisted a police officer physically and fled. That is unlikely to work out in your favor, especially since the officer was within his right to detain someone who committed an offense in his presence.
Unless you were present, you also need to consider that maybe your nephew isnâ€™t telling you the whole truth here.
I have good reason to believe he's telling the truth. My nephew isn't good at lying and he tends to be honest to a fault.
Whether the officer was in his right or not doesn't necessarily make it the appropriate course of action. My nephew apologised and wanted to get home, instead he had his personal space invaded. Big nono for him though he's working on it.
Putting a hand on someone's shoulder is far far down on the scale of "physical confrontation". Your nephew was then attempting to flee, refusing to show id, and generally not complying with entirely lawful and reasonable orders.
It is when it's grabbing his shoulder and this is for someone who is very uncomfortable being physically touched. And the cop didn't let him back away and get that space.
Well, as you can see, sometimes people flee when the police contact them. Generally when they attempt to detain someone, the police are going to try to avoid giving someone that space to run.
