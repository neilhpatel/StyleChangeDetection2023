Yes, it can target mortar, artillery and missile attacks if it determines them to be a dangerous hit.
If Zelensky means the Iron Dome, then yes, there is a production problem. The existing number of batteries is not enough to cover Israel's needs, and if Hamas feels like they need attention (which happens quite often, and will probably happen when the new Israeli government takes place), the stock of Tamir interceptors will be severely diminished.
In a total of 122 UN resolutions involving Israel, Ukraine voted against Israel in 95 of the resolutions and abstained in 27 of them. It did not vote in favor of Israel even once.
The patriot is not produced in Israel, the Iron Beam is highly experimental, David's Sling and Arrow are in even less production than the Iron Dome. The only possibility is the Barak 8, of which India takes the bigger slice of production.
That's of course besides the point that the Iron Dome is the wrong system for Ukraine's needs, but it is a nice sound bite to "demand" it anyway.
Iâ€˜m saying OP is right, there are no known issues with production capacity or order queueing, so it would be a very welcome move by Israel to give approval - even if order fulfillment takes a few years.
> As reported earlier, Ukraine made another official request in October saying it was "highly interested" in procuring Israel's air defense systems, particularly the Iron Beam, Barak-8, Patriot, Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow Interceptor, along with training for operators.
