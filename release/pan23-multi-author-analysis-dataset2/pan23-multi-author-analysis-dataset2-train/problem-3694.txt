When individuals are labelled as members of terrorist organisation there are further restrictive sanctions on those individuals. For instance they would not be able to travel to or stay in most countries. . assets can be seized etc. Atm irgc is taking advantage of diplomatic immunities while continuing working against the local and international community (due to oil /greed mainly).
Considering that Iran does not have nuclear weapons at the moment… but doing its best to acquire them, been part of None Proliferation Treaty is more or less meaningless.
With the way Iran supports Russia these days, and the way it continues nuclear research… world may become much more receptive to pre-emotive strikes to prevent research to conclude into functional weapon.
Experts concluded years ago that any pre-emptive strike would only push Iran’s nuclear program further into secrecy. They have the knowledge base and the human resources to develop nukes. You’d have to obliterate every nuclear scientist in the country (aka Israel’s strategy) and also remove all the documentation. US doesn’t need another war in the middle east lmfao.
