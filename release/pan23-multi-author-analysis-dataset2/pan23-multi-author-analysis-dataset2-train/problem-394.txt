Whether or not they're willing to sign some receipt you put in front of them is not something anyone here would be able to guess. You know them better than anyone here and what they would and wouldn't be likely to do.
As we are new here I'm not sure if they would sign them or not, but I figured it would be worth the effort if this is going to continue.
This first deposit was made by cash a few weeks before moving in, and while I did receive a receipt, either my partner or myself managed to misplace it in the chaos of moving. All other payments were made with checks and I have both the apartments receipt and my banks for those.
If you want your own receipts and they're willing to sign them, make those receipts say everything you want them to say: date of payment, amount, what it's for, who it's to, who you are, method of payment, payment serial/check number, and so on and so forth. It's really up to you, but the more detailed, presumably, the better.
This might be unnecessary but may also send the message that they won't get away with fucking me over.
Sounds like a simple misunderstanding about what has and has not been paid that can be cleared up by providing proof of payment.
We probably wouldn't have signed here, but it ended up being kind of a last minute decision and it's a very convenient location for me for work.
There were some other actions and behaviors when we were getting set up here that lead me to believe it might be them trying to pull a fast one. I'm not taking any further action until I get a response from them again, but based on other things I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to fight me on it.
