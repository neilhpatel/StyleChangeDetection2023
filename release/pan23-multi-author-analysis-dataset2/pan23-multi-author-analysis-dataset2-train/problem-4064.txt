Oh, definitely. We need to fight this at every level. From local right up to national. What scares me the most is that dehumanization that is being done towards trans people. I'm not trans, but I am Jewish and I know my people's history. Dehumanization was key to Nazi Germany's Holocaust.
A few decades ago, I went to the Holocaust Museum in DC. At one point, you can go through or around one of the train cars used to transport Jews to the death camps. I went through and paused inside. I tried to imagine fitting as many people inside as the sign noted that the Nazis put in the car. I couldn't. Then, I realized that I was trying to fit people. Even with imaginary people, I was giving them basic human dignity. If I tried to fit human shaped luggage, I could easily fit that many people.

Sadly, the current Supreme Court would likely rule that no Founding Father ever wrote anything about puberty blockers so trans people don't have a right to exist.
