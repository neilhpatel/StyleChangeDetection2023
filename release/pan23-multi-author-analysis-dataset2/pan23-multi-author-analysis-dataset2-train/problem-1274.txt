You are not going to successfully sue an employer for following CDC guidelines. A mask is a mask, it's for your protection as well as the protection of others. It's not a scarlet letter or a political statement.
CDC guidelines change with the wind. What happens when the CDC removes the stipulation that only vaccinated people can go maskless? Can employers still require non vaccinated to wear masks?
The key part of your argument was that you can't successfully sue an employer for following CDC guidelines. Now you say that you STILL can't sue an employer EVEN IF they are in contravention of CDC guidance, if it in fact changes in the future. Yeah this doesn't feel like legal advice anymore.
There are different reasons for each answer; that doesn't make them less correct. I was answering based on the situation at the time, not some future hypothetical. (And thanks for reminding me why I shouldn't answer hypotheticals.).
Good point. Iâ€™m not interested in suing. I figured in a situation like this employers would be required to make an all or none decision. Thanks for your input.
