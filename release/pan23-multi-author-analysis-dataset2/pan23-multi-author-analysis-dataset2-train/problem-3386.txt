(IV) Garage keeper's liability coverage. Towing Carriers providing storage, directly or through an agent, shall obtain and keep in force at all times garage keeper's liability insurance coverage.
Yes, I’m actually looking at a Supreme Court case from OK (Scott Auto & Supply Co v. McQueen) wherein they say a garage owner cannot escape liability by posting a sign. Different jurisdiction, but that’s a persuasive source. I didn’t know that.
Probably not. Those provisions are for tow companies that routinely store vehicles. A mechanic is not automatically considered a garage keeper. However, if the work was already finished and they were charging to store the vehicle until the owner retrieved it they MAY qualify as a garage keeper. That’s a question for a lawyer in that jurisdiction.
Bailee’s Legal Liability is what your looking for here. Insurance coverage or not, you left your vehicle in the car of a shop. That are under an obligation to return it to you, at a minimum, in the same condition in which you left it with them.
