IANAL, and I am not in the US, however I have been engaged as an expert witness in this area on several occasions.
Just take good notes of who you were speaking to, their position, what you asked, what they did/didn't answer, etc.
Thanks. What recourse do I have if the dealership isn’t very forthcoming with information? I feel like they haven’t told me much about the actual problems, just weasely words. I only found out about the drivetrain issues after calling customer service, not from the dealership.
Sometimes they aren't forthcoming (sometimes they don't know what the issue is and they are just troubleshooting/changing parts starting with the cheapest/easiest options first, sometimes they are just assholes).
They will either be able to fix your vehicle fairly shortly, and it won't have any more issues - or it will continue to be a problem.
I can't speak to how these issues are handled in the US, but in my country having the documentation enables you to prove you've been complaining about the vehicle for xx-amount of time, and that it has been out of service for yy-amount of time.
Having excellent documentation will help you navigate whatever legal path your jurisdiction requires.
Document your time meticulously, you may not need it but it certainly won’t hurt. My state requires a copy of every work order, yours may not.
