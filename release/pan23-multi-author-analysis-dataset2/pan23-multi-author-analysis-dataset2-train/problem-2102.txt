You'd need to be able to prove that the original development company knew there was asbestos in the units and that they did not disclose it to the subsequent purchasers.
It may depend on wording of the disclosures. Unless the asbestos is friable/airborne it's not considered a hazard. It can stay as-is, and that's fine. It also may not be considered a negative to marketability, if other units also have it and they sell fine, then the impact on value is built into the price. Anything built pre-1978 potentially contains lead paint and asbestos, and this is on buyers to check for if it concerns them.
So if the disclosures asked about known environmental hazards or things that may negatively impact marketability, and they said no, I don't think you have any cause to go after them. If the disclosures asked is there asbestos, and you can prove they knew it and they lied on the disclosure, you have a better case.
It might be worth talking to neighbors about trying to negotiate a bulk discount with a contractor if they are able to do multiple units.
