Could I delete his text and say I could sue him for an invasion of privacy since there's no proof he informed me of the CCTV being there? He's said that he will kick out anyone seen taking items or leaving doors unlocked, which I think is an overreaction. The rent is really cheap for the area so I don't want to risk getting kicked out over a misunderstanding.
I thought that California required me to sign a form saying I consented to the CCTV though. I didn't think he could just set it up without everyone's permission since we live here too.
You just said you'd have to delete the text. You obviously got it, so telling the court you did not is perjury, a criminal offense.
If you got the text, deleting it and telling the court that you never got it is a lie. I'm not sure how to make this more clear. Lying in court is a crime. You can not pretend the facts are something else just because you believe he cannot prove that you have the text.
He testifies he texted you on such a date and time. The judge asks you if this is true. You can not lie and say it isn't or that you didn't get it. You cannot refuse to answer and can not lie. So you'd have to answer that you did, which in any circumstance where the answer is what the outcome hinges on, tanks your entire case.
