I survived high school in oklahoma and I was never going back anyway, well before this as I have my own kids. The education system there has rapidly deteriorated since my graduation. A near useless 300k a year superintendents office at every school regardless of size of the school.the Refusing to consolidate rural schools in towns into bigger regional schools. You now no longer need any teaching credentials at all to teach k-12, no college, not even a seminar on how to instruct students. I don't even think you need to show any expertise/knowledge in the subject you are being hired for. Florida is going the same route. They sold the lottery as way to help fund education way back in the day, I doubt they have provided any additional funds or anywhere near what they were supposed to. Then they cut state education funding 1-1 for any funding they did provide from the lottery. Teachers wages are at near poverty levels because they refuse to acknowledge that most teachers these days are single and younger not married older women who are not the sole income earner. You can literally go to texas and immediately get paid twice as much.
