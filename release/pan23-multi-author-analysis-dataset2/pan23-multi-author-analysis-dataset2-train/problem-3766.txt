Most likely outcome will be around 290-300 EVs for Biden with WI and PA being the shakiest, but I expect him to carry all his 2020 states and perhaps even win NC.
Arizona is likely to go Biden and Dem because it is full of actual conservatives who can’t stand the racist/fascist crapola coming from Florida. Think McCain types.
In my opinion it is possible that Biden might pull off a Reagan 1984 situation in 2024, where Biden runs the map except for Florida.
Nevada is full of socially liberal libertarians who can’t stand Florida-styled MAGA for another reason.
Regardless.. the real question isn’t whether Biden can get the necessary 270 over DeSantis/Trump, but by how far a margin Biden wins in 2024.
The best case scenario for Biden is 2020 plus a potential pickup with NC so around 319 EVs, but I don’t know how you get to 355+ with solidly red FL, OH, TX.
Edit: A case could be made for OH to be competitive given Sherrod Brown is up for re-election, though probably the likeliest outcome is a narrow re-election win for him and a narrow loss for Biden akin to Georgians split-ticketing between Kemp and Warnock.
