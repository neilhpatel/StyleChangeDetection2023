Definitely wouldn’t take this any higher than the dealership, just trying to build a good case to get them to give me that price or even $330/mo or under. I want to sound like I know what I’m talking about 😅.
If you want the car take the offer they’re offering, it doesn’t sound unreasonable. If you want the offer don’t be surprised if it’s already disappeared should you pursue the advertised price.
I have read the fine print and there is nothing about dismissing errors except that the sales person isn’t bound by promises or representations on this sheet unless the dealer representative signs, which they did.
You can file a complaint with your state agency overseeing car dealerships but that likely wont help you get the advertised price.
The paper states that the dealer agrees to lease this exact car to me, so I don’t think they’ll be able to pull it out from under me.. but I’m not sure.
This was the only document I signed and the only thing that mentions no fault of the salesperson is listed on point 4 under important buyer information:
“The salesperson has no authority to make and dealer shall not be bound by any promises or representations unless they are written on this order and approved by dealer’s authorized representative”.
It’s not like it was just a one off typo; he printed me out prices for multiple models and apparently forgot to adjust all the prices with the “correct” interest rates. He reviewed them with me, then wrote it out himself, and then had the dealer sign off on it. It wasn’t until I left that he called and was like oops, mistake. So it’s definitely weird and I’m not sure what to make of it.
