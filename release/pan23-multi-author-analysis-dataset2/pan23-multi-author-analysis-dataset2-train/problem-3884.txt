Above any and all practical benefit for Iraq and China to trade in yuan, it's part of a larger strategy to provide an alternative to the USD.
Nah in this case screw the Iraqi govt in particular. They are doing this because of the fact that the US caught them money laundering for Iran and took actions against them.
They do come with collateral, demanding sensitive assets in the event of bad repayment performance though.
However, this is leading to their primary source of resources, Africa, increasingly seeing the PRC as a threat of neo-colonialism and as a whole African still prefer American-based investments and aid.
Maybe I'm missing something so please correct me but since the yuan isn't accepted internationally or by most countries, they'll need to buy yuans of they wanna use that to pay China, and if they decide to take payment from China in yuan they'll have to exchange it to dollars if they wanna use them when anyone else?? Won't that screw them with exchange rates?
I dunno. A growing and worringly high percentage of CCP belt and road initiatives are fiscally insolvent (up to a third) and resulting in runaway debt, higher interest than they ever had with the west, and deeper instability. E.g. in MENAP's pakistan. They also promote corruption, back room deals, and ban domestic auditing and therefore damages governance transparency and fiscal responsibility.
