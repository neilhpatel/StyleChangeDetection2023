Oh man run, do not walk, to get a rabies shot. That's not something you want to risk _at all_, rabies is always fatal.
In terms of legal standing, you'd only have a suit if you actually had damages. Consult a PI attorney but unless one of you suffer a significantly expensive injury (or die of rabies!) you won't have very much in way of recovery.
You must get it checked out yesterday. It will kill you without treatment. It is 100% fatal in all cases that did not have an early vaccine.
It was your responsibility to get vet records the day you took the dog in. And as your property, it was your responsibility to get your dog vaccinated if he was not. You should not trust people at their word when doing so could become a legal liability.
You took in the dog and therefore the liability. Yes you can be sued by anyone bitten by the dog. Homeowners and renters insurance can cover dog liability, but typically had to be requested and excludes certain breeds. Check your policy, and pay your renewal before making claim if end of policy period. Licensed insurance producer.
