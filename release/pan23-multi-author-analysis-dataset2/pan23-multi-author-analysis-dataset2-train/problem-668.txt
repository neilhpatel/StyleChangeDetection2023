This has been in the works since 2019. It's not a new thing. And it was concluded before the war began.
Russia is still profiting, but at least the arms aren't going to Russia itself... at least on paper...
It's not a good look for India recently given everything else as well, but this thing didn't exactly fall out of the clear sky indeed.
Iâ€™d be interested to know what percentage of their economy is driven by expats in the west sending money back to India, for example.
See my friend you ate up the propaganda under the guise of which corruption happens in India. Several INSAS replacements were in the works but were sidelined. Even the SIGs that are ordered have their complaints. And AK203 is not forward looking choice. So only conclusion is that they were selected because they either made political sense or some pockets were lined. The alternative is that our army and MoD is entirely out of touch with reality and future of warfare.
As much as I hate this deal - since it reeks of corruption (they railroaded all attempts at indigenization and still bought some 150k SIGs anyway which is a different round - which means two sets of optics and other accessories) it's not much of a military cooperation.
