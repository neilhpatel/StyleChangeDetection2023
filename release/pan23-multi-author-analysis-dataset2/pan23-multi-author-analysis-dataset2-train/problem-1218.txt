Ballot harvesting isn't door to door campaigning while asking for you to fill out your entire ballot on the spot. Are you sure they didn't just come with a petition or flyer or asking for you to return something saying you were committing to voting that way? The Illinois state legislature and some local governments accept "comments" like you described from the public to gauge actual voter sentiment on specific things, and if that's what this was, it was completely legal and not what you described or even related to it. Ballot harvesting is simply collecting completed, sealed ballots with no knowledge of what is voted on. And if they did come and pressure you to vote and expect you to hand over your ballot with them watching, that is illegal under electioneering AND ballot harvesting laws in general, and again not ballot harvesting (yes, the collection part would be technically, but this is something entirely different). Like, I did campaign door knocking and phone banking in central Illinois for 20 years and what you experienced was explicitly forbidden by internal campaign policy as well as being illegal. You should contact your county and Illinois State board of elections/election commission (depends on your county or city) or SA/DA's office and report your experience if it was as described, however.
