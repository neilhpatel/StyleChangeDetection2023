This current pandemic is falling on a presidential election year in the United States. How did the 1918-1920 flu pandemic affect the 1920 presidential election?
The short answer is that most of the time, they don't. Generally, there are two sources of information about these plagues: contemporaneous descriptions of symptoms, and on occasion, archaeological finds such as bodies which can be examined for postmortem effects. However, most diseases don't leave symptoms which can easily be identified from a skeleton (they tend to affect soft tissue much more, and [thank the gods] the pathogens themselves don't last thousands of years in the dirt any better than the people do), so in most cases we're left with historical records and some guesswork.
How do historians determine that past epidemics and plagues such as the plague of Athens or the Antonine Plague are diseases known presently to us instead of previously unknown novel diseases (from isolated populations or animal species) that died out?
There are occasional exceptions: for example, the Plague of Justinian, which ravaged Constantinople in 541-542, has been confirmed to be Yersina Pestis, better known as the Bubonic Plague, by found in the teeth of victims.
But the case of the Plague of Athens is more typical. We have numerous historical accounts, especially that of Thucydides (in his History of the Peloponnesian War, book 2, chapter 7), describing symptoms in detail. I'll spare you the quote as it's really graphic, but if you want to read it in Richard Crawley's translation, you can by searching for a paragraph starting "That year then is admitted to have been otherwise unprecedentedly free from sickness.".
