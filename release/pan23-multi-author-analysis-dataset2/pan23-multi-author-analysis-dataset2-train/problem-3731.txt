The fee is described as such: “We are a tipless house. The way we make that happen is there is a 22% fee added to the end of your bill and it’s divided equitably between back of house to front for everybody who contributed to your experience.” Some servers tried to explain it in more detail and they went around to every restaurant making sure everyone was sticking to the script.
The employer is very careful not to use the word tip or gratuity when speaking about it to customers, but encourages us (servers and managers) to tell people they don’t have to tip because it’s included. It’s just a very fine and questionable line that can’t be touched I guess.
There are two ways this could go. One is that the employer calls this a "fair wage fee" or some functional equivalent. That's probably allowable. The other is that the employer calls this a "tip" or "gratuity" and this isn't allowable.
Colorado requires conspicuous notice that “Service Charges” are not discretionary tips for the sole benefit of the typically tipped employee.
Their website FAQ states the following about the fee: “The CHP (Creating Happy People) Fee is a 22% service fee that goes to support the entire team behind your experience at our concepts. This means that hospitality is included in your total and takes good care of our staff as they take good care of you.”.
