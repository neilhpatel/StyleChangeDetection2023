Jesus Christ, their rhetoric The GOP rhetoric. Trump was just a symptom, now they want to double down with their other extremist candidates. Abbot, Youngkin or their real poster child, DeSantis. Here, look, we'll push another , more extreme candidate and then you'll see our greatness. If we get a real champ elected and you don't see it, we'll pass laws, take away rights and destroy democracy so we can force you to see it.
Most Republicans realize that Trump is a loser. But they keep on looking over their shoulders trying to keep in line with their fellow Republicans who are still supporting Trump’s MAGA fascist movement. It’s rather like all the admirers who keep on praising their emperor’s fine clothing until someone dares to speak up, “the emperor has no clothes”!
