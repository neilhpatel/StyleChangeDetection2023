So what even are republicans anymore? Performers? Quasi sports figures trying to take the place of absent large market competing entities where they can have a "team"? Soul less image builders terrified of exposure?
The whole shtick, the whole game, the propaganda, the hate porn, the sticking it, it's all just so fucking pointless. I have no idea what they are doing or what game they are trying to play here but there's not even any point in listening to what liars say. They just always lately seem to find anything that isn't legally nailed down, and smear their shit all over it.
