Parkinson’s is a terrible disease that can cause violent outbursts; the brain is being destroyed. There comes a point where someone that has deterioriated needs to live in a special environment with trained staff.
This is a difficult situation because you may have used excessive force on an elderly person with reduced mental capabilities; but the family may be willfully ignorant of the deterioriation of the person’s behavior.
He has definitely been medically neglected by the family. My partner and I have consistently said that his violent behavior is worsening and have insisted he be moved into an environment where he can be cared for or someone is going to get attacked and harmed.
If he has made previous attempts before and threats, did you report it to police/landlord before this? If not then they will treat this as a first time issue and anything before will be null.
The two hits to the legs may complicate things and considering family's accusations it may be time to seek out a lawyer in case.
He was making an attempt to get back up when I struck him. I also forgot to mention that I have severe PTSD and I had the reaction I had as excessively because of flashbacks being triggered. He has not only threatened my life before but has also made attempts before.
