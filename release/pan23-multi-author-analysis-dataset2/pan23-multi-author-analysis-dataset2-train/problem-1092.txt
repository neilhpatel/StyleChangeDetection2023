I'm from northern Finland. I can count on two hands the amount of days when we had -25c or colder temperatures since the new year. Usually around this time of year the temperature is a comfortable -15c to -25c, but this year it has been between 0c and -15c. This winter has been unbearably hot compared to last winter. Recently the temperature has alternated almost daily between 0c and freezing, which means that the top layer of the snow/ice is melting and then freezing into a smooth ice surface. It's fine to drive on in a car, but if you're walking on foot it's really annoying because there's always this one bit of the sidewalk that isn't covered by gravel and that's the part you step on while walking and end up almost slipping on.
Snowfall is a dumb as shit measure of climate change in both circumstances, considering it can still snow when temperatures are above average in certain regions, and may not snow during below average temperatures.
When the snow season starts it's usually around -1 so it snows, snow settles and stays. The sun can't warm up the region anymore.
This year, once again, it was above 0 degrees and we have no snow. Now it's -5, but the rain already passed.
When I was a kid we had snow every year at the beginning of December. It's February and there is no snow.
