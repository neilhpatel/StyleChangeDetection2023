Since then, it's been relatively quiet. Let's hope this is not the start of a new series of terrorist attacks.
Elections are scheduled to be held in June 2023. But since Erdogan technically can't run again if he completes his full term, it is expected that he will call snap elections some time before that date. He will wait until he's ahead in the polls though.
I think they have realized that they can never get ahead in the polls legally. They want to create confusion and terror while conditioning their supporters before any elections take place. This election will definitely be rigged in every ballot box where they can rig it and they will make sure everyone at wherever they can’t rig will have a difficult time voting.
Hot take: erdo is either behind this attack or allowed it to happen to consolidate support for his reelection.
It’s been a few years, but I recall the bombings kicking off in May/June of 2015. I remember being in Izmir and seeing that an attack happened in Ankara? (I think).
The real problem arises if they lose. While Bolsanaro’s case was relieving to see, I feel like Erdogan has entrenched himself too deep to accept defeat like him.
Arguably he did this before in the lead up to the attempted coup. Interestingly once the attempted coup happened the attacked immediately stopped..
Also, the idea that he is scaring people into voting for him is widely accepted among the international journalist community.
Fun fact the flight back from Istanbul to turkey had a Spanish kid tripping on something, claiming he had the blood of Superman within his blood and tried opening the emergency escape hatches. We had to have an emergency landing in Budapest.. further compounded by passenger having a heart attack from the ordeal.
