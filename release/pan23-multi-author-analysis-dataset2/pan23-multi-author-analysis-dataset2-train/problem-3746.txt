We couldn't guess that. What are they threatening to sue you for? Are you contractually responsible for client bills? Is there some credible allegation that you were "gaming" the system in conspiracy with your customers?
I was with them for 14 years and no evidence of trying to game them system nor would I. I’m just wondering after a year of them pursuing this, should I even worry about them taking this to the courts.
You're going to have to give some context then to why your employer wants to sue you because a customer not yours didn't pay their bills. That doesn't make any sense.
What would you countersue for? Many commission agreements make commissions dependent on realized revenue, not booked revenue. Does yours promise pay even when the customers don't pay?
They’re trying to collect $10k on one customer not paying but owe me $30k on commissions for another customer.
Under many commission plans it would be reasonable to offset retractions of paid but not earned commissions against earned but not paid commissions.
If they paid you $1000 in commission you actually didn’t earn because the customer never paid. They owe you $1000 in commission earned and paid. The net outcome is zero due to you.
If the commissions on the earned sale are greater than the unearned one they may owe you the difference.
Obviously there’s more at play here, and you still haven’t given any explanation as to why they want to sue you.
Why would a firm go thru three legal firms over the course of a year, with no progress since the beginning, and then finally litigate? Seems like bluffing at this point.
