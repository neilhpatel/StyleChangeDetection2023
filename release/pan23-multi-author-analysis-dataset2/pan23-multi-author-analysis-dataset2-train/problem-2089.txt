That aircraft carrier is nothing but a floating dock anyway. Did Xzibit set this up? Yo dog I heard you like floating docks so I put a floating dock on your floating dock.
You laugh, but it might just happen! Not because they’re afraid of the military threat that piece of shit represents, but the long-term environmental impact of it getting anywhere near your own country’s aquatic ecosystem. That aircraft carrier is nothing more than a floating superfund site.
Sunk and punched a hole into it so bad it wasn't a guarantee the ship would be repaired. I see they half assed the repair again. Though with Russia it's probably more of a quarter ass or one eighth ass at this point.
All their shit is self-immolating. They’re doing more environmental damage than damage to their enemies. Their military is more of an environmental war machine than anything else.
They were also (allegedly) on their way to commit major warcrimes against the US West coast when they got word of the surrender of Japan and (allegedly) dumped all their planes (allegedly) painted like US planes and (alleged) chemical weapon payloads overboard.
