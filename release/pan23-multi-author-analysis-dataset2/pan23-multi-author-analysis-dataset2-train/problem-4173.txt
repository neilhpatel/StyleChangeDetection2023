Over the late 14th century to 15th century, your work shows an increasing specialisation in English war armour for dismounted fighting. Then, around the mid 15th century onwards we seem to see English styles move away from that and towards configurations seemingly aimed more at mounted combat again. Presumably these changes followed the changing fighting style of those men-at-arms.
As to why... in the WOTR, the English weren't fighting foreigners anymore. They were fighting each other. They tried using their dismounted tactics, but the variability of the battle conditions was more extreme, the topography more changeable... so the commander who had his heavy cavalry read may have been better prepared to deal with more unpredictable battlefield environments. That's just one idea though- the real answer must be very complex indeed.
Aha! We're straight off with the big question: WHY? Why is always tough. But yes, basically the English favoured their tactic of dismounting their knights and men-at-arms to deploy them as 'super heavy-infantry' until the end of the Hundred Years War in 1453. After that point, as the Wars of the Roses progressed, we see a renewed interest in the use of armoured cavalry. Tentative at first perhaps, but increasing. We see decisive cavalry action at some of the later WOTR battles, like Tewkesbury (1471), and then the take over of heavy cavalry charges towards the end at Bosworth and Stoke. And hey presto, the evolution of armour follows that trend, slowly moving away from optimisation for infantry service, to designs more favourable to mounted combat. And indeed heavy cavalry continued to be important in Renaissance warfare up to the middle of the sixteenth century at least.
Could the English who got dragged into a french civil war by their masters even afford to serve as heavy cavalry in numbers where their decision would have mattered to overall trends?
