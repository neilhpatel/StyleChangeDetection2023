I get that to an extent, I'm just not sure how that affects the right to a speedy trial. One would assume they cannot hold people indefinitely with no arraignment or trial date in sight. I guess the other thing I'm wondering is if this lenh of time incarcerated without a trial or arraignment could lead for a motion to release her or to lower her bond to get her released into the trial date can be set. I'm hoping that won't happen, but the longer this goes on the more I'm thinking something like that could end up being a possibility.

If she's been in jail for a year, she has certainly already waived the right to a speedy trial. Without the waiver, criminal trials start within something like 30 to 60 days after being charged. The conventional wisdom is that demanding a speedy trial is a very bad idea in almost all situations.
