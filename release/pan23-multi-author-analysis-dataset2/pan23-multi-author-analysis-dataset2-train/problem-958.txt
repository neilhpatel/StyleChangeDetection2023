To the OP: NATO is not further encouraging Russian behavior. NATO should not respond as Russia does because we are better than that. You are asking for direct NATO involvement and your comment is stoping well short of a full analysis of what would happen. You are asking for an extensive escalation. This isn't Afghanistan or Iraq, this is a nuclear power. NATO would present an existential threat to Russian Leadership. NATO exists to protect NATO territories to avoid encroachment by Russia into NATO land. Unfortunately, Ukraine is not in NATO. It is the job of all the worlds major powers to avoid world war III, and they are toeing the line of it as far as they can without encroaching into it.
It honestly seems like there's a bigger benefit to using other systems for the same logistical strain. Maybe we can use this war to deescalate the military build up between Greece and Turkeye by sending equal numbers of leopard tanks from both. They have like 700 between the 2 of them. Spain also had a whole bunch of them too that I think are getting held up by Switzerland somehow.
No, he doesnâ€™t have to attack NATO at all. He only has to keep it inside Ukraine and he can do as he pleases, including genocide. NATO will not stop him.
