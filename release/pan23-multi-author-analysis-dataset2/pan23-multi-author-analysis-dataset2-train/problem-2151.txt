I thought Lavrov already said they were at war with the West and NATO like once every other month since the war began. Now it’s almost a real war? As opposed to what? An ethnic cleansing conducted by Nazis that claim they are hunting Nazis, civilians, gay, witches, biological super soldiers? While claiming to try to disarm a country while actively supplying them with arms of their horrendous losses of which most died probably believing the lie they were told for their initial incursion/invasion?… I guess almost a war is a lot less words at least.
I don't want to go all 'Murican, but after watching Ukraine bring Russia to its knees, I think a "real war" with the west would be very very different than what Russia is having now.
From what I've read, there's a real fear in Washinon that if we do get dragged into a conventional war and slaughter Russia too quickly, the war will go nuclear very quickly as a result.
If the Russians lose in Ukraine, Putin loses his head. He will never let it happen unfortunately. We are treading in unknown waters. That said... fuck Putin, Russia, and I hope Ukraine keeps kicking ass.
