The question you really want to ask is if this was ethical. And the answer is likely no. Depending on how she was involved with your dad’s medical care. We are typically not allowed to accept gifts from patients. Exceptions can be made due to cultural circumstances and if the gift is of nominal value. For example, I once accepted an Asian pear from a client because he had found them at a local market and they were native to his homeland and he wanted to share that part of his culture with me.
I would try to find out if the medical group she works with has a patient relations department you could report her to. And also her licensing board.
You could bring the situation up with the hospice agency social worker and they can give you further advice as to if you want to file an APS report for financial exploration or report them to their licensing board.
Now if your dad was deemed to be lacking capacity and/or competency at the time he gave her the money then legality comes into play as she may be guilty of financial exploitation.
Token gifts, such as cookies, chocolates, bottle of wine, those are acceptable from patients to providers, but those are usually unsolicited.
What you need to do is get this woman’s name and report her to your state board of nursing. She will likely be in a world of trouble with them.
The worst case scenario would be if they tried to change their will to benefit this person. You could try to unwind things if you can prove your father was incompetent, but it would probably be an expensive mess to sort out.
