Again not a lawyer but may be difficult to prove. There are many things you could have done such as starting with telling the property manager you werenâ€™t moving in due to the safety issue and that they would need to continue paying the hotel tell the home is secure. Having that in writing along with all back up of each communication prior to the tree falling where you advised them of the issue would have helped your case.
NAL it may be hard to prove your case since you are still residing there. The other party in court would certainly point out if you felt the place was such a hazard you would not have moved back in after the tree fell. How many follows did you send about the garage and gutters?
So I should mention that the tree fell 2 weeks before the original lease had ended, and we had already signed the new lease. Half of my roomates are actually not in the house at the moment and are inside staying at their parents. Me and one other roommate have no one else in Minnesota to stay with and would have to live in either a hotel, arbnb or something else of we needed to evacuate the house.
