I think the US’s long game in Ukraine is to get China to sink themselves. They lose a lot of face by doing this, and all their trading partners are aware.
Yeah the stuff we’re giving to Ukraine is a drop in the bucket. The average American can’t even comprehend how much money and weaponry the United States military has.
its also something to consider that we (and all our other allies) aren't giving Ukraine modern stuff. Its all stuff thats been sitting in a warehouse collecting dust.
We treat all our hardware that way. Its not just a paranoia toward the ukranians sort of thing. If its modern/bleeding edge and it breaks on the field, be bomb the shit out of it so they can't examine it.
We Vehemontly refuse to give ukraine anything remotely considered "modern" out of fear they might "lose it" and the Chinese or Russians somehow get their hands on it.
None of the dumped weapons or vehicles were cutting edge or even remotely advanced. None of NATO members left anything valuable back there, apart from lost lives, money and ego.
