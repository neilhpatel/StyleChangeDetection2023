Your friend - and possibly everyone on the list - is potentially looking at criminal liability. Manufacturing fake IDs is much worse than possessing (or ordering) them, to be sure, but it's possible that you will all be hearing from law enforcement.
If you're contacted by police or the FBI, do not panic. Politely decline to speak and tell them you want a lawyer. Stick to that. They already have your name and image in the production - they don't need you to confirm anything.

once you've invoked your right to counsel...the interrogation (if there is one) should stop until counsel arrives. You should not volunteer to speak to law enforcement under any circumstance. Do not fall for the 'it'll go better for you if you cooperate' line, either.
As for penalties, it depends on what you'd be charged with. It may also depend on whether there's an interstate aspect to this alleged crime, and whether your alleged ID was a DL or a passport, for example.
