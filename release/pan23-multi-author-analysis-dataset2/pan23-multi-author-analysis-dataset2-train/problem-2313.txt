Now, reporting the gift. It would be considered a deemed sale of $500k. If only $100k was paid, then the gift would be $400k The mother needs to report that on a Form 709. Assuming she hasnt used all of her lifetime exclussion (\$11.5m per person), she can use a portion of that. It then becomes just disclosing the gift, no tax due. If there would be a tax due, the gifter is responsible, not the recipient of the gift.
The IRS does consider sales between family members for below FMV to be considered gifts. Now you have some wiggle room sometimes, but in this big of a discrepancy, you would have trouble arguing that. An example would be selling it for $425 when its worth $500. You could argue that you dont need to hire an agent, dont need to go through the hassle of showings, etc. But this big of a difference, it probably is a gift.
As for the deemed sale, your mother needs to calculate the gain. Sales price - (purchase price + improvements) = Gain. If this has been her primary residence for 24 of the last 60 months, she can exclude $250,000 of gain NO MATTER WHAT (she doesnt need to buy another house). If your father is alive and it has been his primary residence for 24 of the last 60 months, then you can exclude another $250k ($500k total). Lets say its just your mother and it has been her primary residence for 24 of last 60 mo, deemed sale of $500k, cost basis (original purchase price + improvements) is $200k, gain is $300k. OF that gain, $250k is excluded and she would have a taxable gain of $50k, taxed under the long term rates.
