OP, those are both good subreddits above. I would also contact Care.com (you should have an account there as the employee right? So you can view your paystubs?) and inform them you stopped working there as of date X and ask them what to do. Although they are just a bookkeeping service my guess is they might incur liability if they continue reporting hours worked and tax payments to the government after they’ve been informed they’re fraudulent (or at least, not correct) and so they might take action to stop this going forward.
Likely, you'll want to notify her properly (certified mail), maybe get a lawyer to send a cease and desist letter, then notify the tax authorities (local/state/IRS).
I will suggest /r/tax for suggestions on how to maybe report her and/or Care.com to the IRS. /r/personalfinance may have some ideas on what regulatory agencies might be able to get involved.
Your taxes will be based on a 1099 or W2. Whoever produces that has to get it correct. I would not worry about it until you get your tax document at the end of the year. Keep track of everything so you can plead your case if needed, but I doubt that you will be required to do so.
I’ve used the service. It’s just an accounting and tax service: the employer enters the nanny’s hours, they compute the tax deductions and tell the employer the net amount to write a check for. They make the various tax payments, withdrawing from the employers checking account.
