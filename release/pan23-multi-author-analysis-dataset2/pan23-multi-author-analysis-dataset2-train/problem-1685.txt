Ukraine has a lot more obligations to fill than just that, and with their latest changes to the Ukraine Supreme Court, they haven't even bothered to move in the right direction for that!
No, as is and as much as we want Ukraine to kick the Russians the fuck out, a EU membership really isn't and was never in the picture, war or no war...
It's just not going to happen unless and until Ukraine is able to fulfill the EU criteria for joining, which clearly they aren't all that interested in these days given the latest changes.
I can understand the EU not wanting to have a new member with a hot border dispute that would then become the union's problem, but this is kind of cowardly: Russia has no claim to any of the territory it has siezed by force in violation of the UN Charter and international law.
The EU has no need to recognize the occupation of any Ukranian territory by Russian forces as anything other than a crime.
Their economy wasn’t been destroyed in that time though, the sanctions over the past year will have a real crippling effect eventually.
With likely more territorial losses in the south, and likely fighting over Crimea. The east will be contested for a long time in Donetsk/Luhansk, eventually Russia will have to make a decision on those territories, whether it’s important enough to them that they keep going or accept that they’re ruined and pull out.
Also, if there's one thing Russia seems to have in spades, it's desire to occupy Ukraine. Not sure potential membership in the EU moves the needle at all...
