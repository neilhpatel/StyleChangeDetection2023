I am NOT a lawyer but I am lawyer adjacent and do some work in MO. Missouri has a case lookup system named casenet. Link here: You can look up information regarding this case, this will give you a list of documents filed and any upcoming dates as well as information related to the other parties, most importantly their lawyers if they have any. Those attorneys may be willing to also help your wife as long as there is not a conflict in the defenses. That may help cost wise both your wife and the other person the attorney is defending.
The Missouri bar also has resources for obtaining an attorney. Link here: There are tabs for "lawyer search" to look for an attorney that would help with defamation claims or there is also the "free legal answers" tab which may also be helpful.
This is great, my wife has been utilizing the first link you shared but not the mobar link. So we're working that now along w/ a couple of other avenues. Thank you so much.
I'm glad it is helping. The thing that is giving me a little heartburn for you is the "appeal within 10 days" thing. Was your wife ever given previous notice of this suit?
She "got served" a couple of weeks ago and that was the first she'd heard of it. She's got a very busy full time job that makes it difficult for her to call lawyers and pick up her cell when it rings. She was trying to keep this from becoming my problem too, and was trying to do most of this on her own. For the record i have been trying to get involved but she was wanting to handle this. Now that the deadline is approaching she's letting me do a little of the research as well.
