A former US Navy SEAL, who deserted the military nearly four years ago, was killed fighting in Ukraine, according to a military spokesperson.
Daniel W. Swift, who was a Special Warfare Operator 1st Class, was killed Wednesday in Ukraine, the Navy said in a statement. Swift deserted the military on March 11, 2019.
Swift had his Trident pin removed, a Navy official said, a severe step taken after a Trident Review Board determines a sailor no longer lives up to the requirements of being a Navy SEAL.
The US State Department confirmed the recent death of a US citizen fighting in Ukraine but offered no further details on the circumstances.
“We are in touch with his family and providing all possible consular assistance,” a State Department spokesperson said. “Out of respect for the privacy of the family during this difficult time, we have nothing further to add.”.
POTUs doesn't want anything suggesting that usa is fighting an active war against russia....we're just giving Joe's buddies the Ukrainians a few billion dollars of helpful nudge, waaay outside the combat areaa. Officially this guy was definitely not in Ukraine as part of any official us military presence performing a police action. And this guy in particular has been off the books for years. Completely clean, no communication from us military to him since he vanished. Officially.
