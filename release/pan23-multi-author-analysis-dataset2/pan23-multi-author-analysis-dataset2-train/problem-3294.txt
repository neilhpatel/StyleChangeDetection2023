Time for another installment of "The Real Questions", where we take a look at the wilder side of r/AskHistorians Here, I give a shout-out to people asking the more atypical questions on this sub: questions that investigate amusing, unique, bizarre, or less common aspects of history, as well as ones that take us through intriguing adventures of historiography/methodology or niche/overlooked topics and moments in history. It's always a wide (and perhaps confusing) assortment of topics, but at the end of the day, when I see them I think, "Finally, someone is asking the real questions".
Sunday means another chance to browse through all the fantastic questions answered this week, and see the amazing amount of history material available just a click away Donâ€™t forget to check out the usual weekly features and show some thanks for the hard working contributors who make this such a brilliant community.
