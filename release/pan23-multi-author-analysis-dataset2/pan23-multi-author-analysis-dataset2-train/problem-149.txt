You can sue him for the replacement cost in small claims court. You could try to file a police report but they may say it is a civil matter, your state and local laws may apply. When in flight, yes, that is felony territory. When it's crashed it's like any other property that might end up in his yard, from a frisbee to a dog. You can't just destroy people's property.
For the moment you ask for compensation and if that doesn’t work take them to small claims (property isn’t considered abandoned the moment it is left on your property).
There is a model aerial trespass tort law in the works though so I expect flying drones over private property without permission will soon become very costly to the pilot.
I however would simply walk away from this and consider the cost of trespass (suing your neighbor has much higher long term costs than your average drone).
I was under the impression that airspace is not able to be trespassed on therefore you could not legally be in the wrong for flying over somebody's house or backyard. Could you direct me to a source that states otherwise?
That is correct while the drone is flying. A crashed drone is no longer in the air. Depositing property on someone else’s is still trespass. A drone that has landed for any reason is trespass.
Yes it is technically. There is criminal (a person) and civil (property). The law does not distinguish between types of unwanted property deposited without permission.
And yes this has started fights between neighbors before where kids have repeatedly lost toys in their neighbor’a yards.
