When we moved into our last place 1 week into the month the full month's rent was due on move in and the prorated amount was on the 2nd month. The third month all was even.
Title: If my first rent is due August 1st, why is my landlord telling me I canâ€™t move in until August 16th?
Student housing, with multiple bedrooms per unit and each resident on an individual lease? If so, this is pretty normal. Take a close look at your lease; it'll probably say that the rent for the full lease term is <amount>, divided into 12 equal payments due on the first of each month, starting August first. They always set those up to have a few weeks between end of lease and beginning of next for their cleaning sequence and such, while people who renew their leases get to stay through that gap between the two.
