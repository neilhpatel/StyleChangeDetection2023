To be honest, while it is one reason, it's not just degrading an adversary's military capabilities. It's basically turned into a fight between 'the West' and whatever axis that Russia, Iran and North Korea represent. So many countries have invested themselves into the conflict, it's hard to see the US just backing out.
People make it out like the US would 'cut funding' and it'll be over for Ukraine, but by 2024, the EU and many of US's allies will have been so invested into Ukraine that a full stop in support would severely damage the US's standing and probably wouldn't stop the conflict anyways. You can see signs of it taking up a life of its own as Switzerland is considering dropping its neutrality and Israel is hinting that it might get involved as well. There's also the growing rearmament of EU nations. Poland for one, but also you have to consider Germany's increasing spending on defense.
The defense industry is one of the most powerful political blocks in the country. Cutting off their newfound cash cow would be political suicide.
