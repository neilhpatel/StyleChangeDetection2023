You said the debt got passed to you at age 18 and the offer to settle at a lower amount was rescinded due to violation of terms of an agreement you don't seem to have a copy of. You need to contact the state agency who billed you and get confirmation of the debt transferred to you, an explanation of how that's legal, an accounting of payments made towards the debt (unclear from your post if your parents even made a single payment), the terms of the original agreement, and why the offer was rescinded. Then post in this sub again with details and your questions.

So you need to figure out what this bill is actually for. While some states do charge for incarceration, Michigan does not. Also, even for states that do charge parents for incarceration specifically, those fees seem to max out at $1k per month which is far below what you owe. You certainly had many other fees associated with the incident/court/probation/sealing which your family was required to pay. And there would potentially be fees and interest for not paying it. But that doesn't account for $100k. And it doesn't explain why it is being assessed to you and not your parents.
