A blue tsunami is going to require good governance (as much as possible with an uncooperative House), get rid of any problem Democrats NOW - clear the deck of any lingering Bob Menendez and Cuomo type problems. Be squeaky clean as much as possible.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
We need to stop using words like “red wave” or “blue tsunami.” They make the boasting side complacent and the defensive side energized. If the midterms showed us anything, it’s that elections aren’t going to be blowouts, they’re going to be grinding slugfests. Get out and vote every time, don’t expect a massive shift.
