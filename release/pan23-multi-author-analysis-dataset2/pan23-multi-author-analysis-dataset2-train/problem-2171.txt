You don't have any legal responsibility to do anything. But you do the defendant a favor to contact the court on the documents and let them know what happened. In the alternative that defendant is going to have a default judgment entered against them.
When that happens, and they eventually find out there's a judgment they have no idea of, then they'll have to go to court and demand a traverse hearing to determine if they were actually served properly. It's their fault for not updating their records, and not having service on the Secretary of State or their registered agent.
Contact the attorney and let him know that the LLC is no longer at that address, and you have no connection or relationship with the company or anyone associated with the company.
Called the attorney. Told the secretary what happened. She asked me to wait on hold. After waiting 15 minutes, the attorney was put on the phone. He told me it was my responsibility to tell the process server that I was the wrong person. To which I tried to explain that it was early in the morning, and I tried to yell at the person but was ignored. Then he told me that I should help him get the contact info for the correct person, to which I replied that he can eat shit, and fuck off. I was just doing a courtesy call.
So I think he might have said the LLC name before the address, but I was too out of it to hear it properly. I am not 100% sure. The guy talked really fast. Or maybe I was half asleep.
