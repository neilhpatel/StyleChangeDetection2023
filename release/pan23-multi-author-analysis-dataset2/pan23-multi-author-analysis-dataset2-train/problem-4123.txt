Don’t. Your guest doesn’t need the HOA’s permission to bring their service animal onto the premises. There is no possible benefit to asking for permission.
I'm assuming that "yes" is to the question at the end of the post ("would that same protection also apply…") and not to the question in the title ("can my HOA restrict my guest…")?
It’s a service animal with all the proper documentation. The HOA hasn’t restricted access but I was planning on going to the HOA to seek approval for the dog to be in the building. I was just curious about whether they’re required to allow the dog in or if I’m gonna have to do some shmoozing.
I’m not sure this is correct. Even homeowners can be required to provide documentation proving that the animal is actually a service animal, so I would assume HOAs would at the very least have that ability with respect to guests and their service animals. I think the important distinction here is that this involves a residence, not a business.
Also, requirements aside, I’d rather not upset my HOA. The possible benefit here is staying on my HOA’s good side.
