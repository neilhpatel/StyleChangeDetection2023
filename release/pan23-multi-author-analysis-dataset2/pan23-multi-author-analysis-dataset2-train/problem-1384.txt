Let’s say you have two objects Rick, one of them is a shitbag, shittier than most. The other is the most heinous, dripping awful bag of shit you’ve ever seen Ricky. When these two bags, bags of shit that is, start slouching towards one another, ending up in a clearly uncomfortable and let us not forget shitty embrace Ricky a miracle happens. Shit will flow from the area of super saturated shit to the area of slightly less shitty shit, and if the contact remains unbroken, the shit levels will level out. Equaling two massive, stinking, stupid, vain, prideful bags of shit who will do everything in their power to make sure your boss doesn’t pay taxes on his 4th yacht, and ensure you don’t ever get healthcare. Maybe the park ain’t so bad.
