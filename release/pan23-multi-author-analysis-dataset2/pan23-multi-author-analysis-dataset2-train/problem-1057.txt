As someone who used to work for an insurance company the bicyclist is going to have one hell of a time trying to get any money. all the evidence is stacked against him insurance have a hard time paying claims their supposed to and find loopholes to not have to pay so an open and shut case like this they definitely wouldnâ€™t look to pay.
You were at a complete stop and someone on a bicycle ran into you, aswell as a police report backing it up? If that's true your insurance company is not going to pay out to the guy.
Thanks for the reply. Police report concludes bicyclist was the cause of the accident because he was riding against traffic. However, report didn't clearly include ststement that my car was stopped. In fact, I was releasing brakes to start going but saw cyclist and got back on brake before even releasing clutch and stepping on gas. Car was stopped. Cyclist states I moved forward but but that's false. He hit me but the cyclist claims I hit him so there is a difference in statements. The thing is, can insurance pay a settlement but still hold me not principally at fault?
