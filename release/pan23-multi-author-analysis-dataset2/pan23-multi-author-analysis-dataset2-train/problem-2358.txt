That doesn't mean you assault someone with a vehicle. You could have easily done a lot of damage or worse.
In the future if someone is blocking your car, get out and walk away. Do not hit someone with a vehicle.
If it never comes to that, then you never have to (or should) explain yourself -- and that's a good thing.
To clarify, it's pretty out of her hands now - the police will decide whether to move forward with an investigation, but she can choose to to cooperate.
im in the military and she told our therapist and that set off immediate protocol that separates us for a short term amount of time. she wanted to talk and hash out a problem we had, but i was too embarassed about how i hurt her feelings and now all this stuff is happening. i dont know if she knew telling our therapist would get my job involved as it is a military provided therapist.
If the police contact you, don't say anything except something to the tune of, "I'd prefer not to answer any questions at this time, thank you.".
my command is going to talk to me about it. i am in the military and it’s simply how it goes. they basically give me orders to stay away for however long i am forced to live on base and they will make me talk about it.
The time and place to explain yourself is after you're arrested, in court, on your court date, with your attorney, in front of a judge and jury -- and at no other time.
If she was illegally blocking you in, then you sit there, call the cops, and be mildly inconvenienced for however long it takes the situation to rectify itself without intentionally driving your car into her.
As far as I know, you still have the right to not speak to military law enforcement personnel when suspected of a crime.
If you are able to consult a JAG lawyer I would consider that before doing any talks with command. I don’t know much about the military but I’m pretty sure you can be punished for off base crimes.
