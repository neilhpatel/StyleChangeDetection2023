Continue not talking to the cops. If they arrest you, tell them, "I'm not going to speak to you. I want my attorney." Then call the guy you spoke to.
That would be a wild accusation considering weâ€™ve only made out one time and that was it. We decided to just be friends after that and were friends for a whole year until we just stopped talking. She ended up getting married and then divorced shortly after. It seems she went a little bit crazy and gained about 150 pounds. Just seemed like a bad situation.
Just that her mental situation has maybe gotten worse. The police did not give any type of information on the allegation and wanted me to come in to talk about it.
If arrested, you have to give them ID information, but you don't need to answer any other questions.
