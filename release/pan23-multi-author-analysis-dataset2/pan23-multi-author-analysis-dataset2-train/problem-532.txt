As a Swede I have have not seen the best of Erdogan and his regime lately, and have been resentful of the Turkish diplomacy towards us. But that does not take away my empathy and sympathy for the Turkish people and I am sure many Swedes feel the same.
Besides, helping each other in times of need brings out the best in us, and we still have recent memories of the gracious help we got with our massive forest fires, with lots of brave Polish firefighters arriving amongst others. Everybody needs a hand sometimes and there's never shame in receiving help.
Priority one is to save lives and I hope we can make a difference. Then I'll go back to grumbling and being annoyed at Erdogan again.
I know the relations between our countries have not been the best lately, but let's put the whole NATO-thing aside for a moment. If we can help with the rescue work and relief after these frightening earthquakes I am confident we are eager to do so.
This is what happens when emergency relief funds are pilfered by administration cronies, and when precautionary measures that were recommended by expert geologists decades ago are ignored time and time again.
