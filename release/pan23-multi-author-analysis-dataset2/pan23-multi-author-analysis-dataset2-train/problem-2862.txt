yeah you can see in r/conservative and on conservative news sites there is this sudden realization that Trump is absolute poison for the GOP. his election was more about Hillary and the DNC's failures than his electability. but it will take a LOT more than finger wagging and some "hey Trump, scram!" (I shit you not was the final line in a conservative piece from today) to clean the rot that's in the GOP. I mean there was a lot of rot there already, but the Trump faithful will not go quietly into the night--and neither will Trump. it's going to be a bloodbath between now and the 2024 primaries. I am pretty certain DeSantis will cruise to the nomination, but Trump is gonna make a mess for them before, during, and after, and I can't wait.
Look Mark, just go with me here, I mean "The Apprentice" is a great name, we love The Apprentice. But what if, and I'm not talking about a complete overhaul, but what if we just juiced it up a bit. Just gave it a little more pizzazz. We don't have to throw out your idea, but what if we called it "Donald Trump's Apprentice"? Don't you think that makes a huge difference with just those two words added?
