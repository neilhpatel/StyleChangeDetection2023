There's an Engineering Explained video that debunks this. Even if you replace all vehicles on the road with EVs, and make them all charge every day at peak times, it's only 30% more draw than current. If you incentivize people to charge overnight or in the mornings by varying kWh cost based on usage, then the charging overhead needed for entire fleet replacement fits within the current infrastructure. Also realize that refineries take shit tons of power, so if those are not working as much to provide gasoline, then that frees up more electrons for EVs.
how the hell can they say that 20% have to be electric? so if for a given year for Ford, they've sold millions of cars, the vast majority of which are gasoline, you get to november and it's "nope we can only sell electric to meet our quota" for the rest of the year? or do they mean sales from manufacturer to dealership?
They’ll sell fleet vehicles or lease them at a loss if they have to, to get their quota of EVs in. It’s why they used high mpg cars as loss leaders for years.
