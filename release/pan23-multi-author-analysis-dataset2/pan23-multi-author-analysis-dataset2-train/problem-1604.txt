Well according to the CCR they have the right to screen and reject any potential tenant and all the leases have to be registered with them. I'm trying to renew my lease. Everywhere else I've ever lived only requires application when first moving in.
"Any such fee may be preset, but in no event may such fee exceed $100 per applicant other than husband/wife or parent/dependent child, which are considered one applicant. However, if the lease or sublease is a renewal of a lease or sublease with the same lessee or sublessee, no charge shall be made.".
I think you're missing the point. By default, the CC&Rs only apply to the property owner. You aren't necessarily required to adhere to them just because you're living there.
This raises further questions of why all the predatory condo associations don't declare as just regular HOA because from what I can see there is no hard definition and it all just depends on what they pick when they register with the state.
You would have had to specifically agree to follow them (in your lease or in some other document) in order for this to be your problem.
If you didn't agree to that, then you have no relationship with the HOA, and you are generally not responsible for any of their fees or fines.
