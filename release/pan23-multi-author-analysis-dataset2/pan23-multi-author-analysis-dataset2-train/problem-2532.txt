I work in banking, and I can say it's not unusual. It seems to be more of a merchant policy, as I've seen the same merchants repeatedly do one method over the other. But as another person said, it's visa/Mastercard who actually has an agreement with the merchant, since visa/Mastercard charges the merchant for different types of activity. So they may be screwing visa/Mastercard, but in the end, they're multi billion dollar entities.
it's not illegal, but it might violate the merchant agreement with the credit card processor or it might run up double fees if they charge for the refund transaction.
As far as the customer goes, some merchants don't even tell the bank the hold has been released. So that hold will be on the customer's account for 5 business days regardless. Only a few merchants actually have visa/Mastercard notify the bank for immediate removal of the hold. Again, probably in the agreement with visa/Mastercard.
Well, since you are returning the money anyway, it's legal. However, the refund metric will then appear higher.
It would depend on the agreement the customer has when they purchase. If your retailer says they wonâ€™t charge the card until pickup, you could be opening up the company to liability. This is how class actions get started.
