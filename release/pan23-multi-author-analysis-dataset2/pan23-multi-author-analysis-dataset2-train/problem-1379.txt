Technically, jail is a possibility but I'd be really surprised if based on these facts you had to serve jail time. Your license may already have been suspended, and since your BAC was so high the fines can be upwards of $5,000 but seriously, you didn't run into a old lady and break her pelvis. You broke the law but the DA very well may want to cut you a deal to reduce this to something far less serious. An attorney is absolutely going to be worth it here.
I can if I have to. Most of them won’t even talk to me unless I give them a couple hundred $ and I just don’t really have that, and I owe my sister $500 for getting me out this morning. This feels like a nightmare.
They could get you for OWI even if the car was not turned on. These are not uncommon. If you had the ability to drive the car, if you had the keys, you can be arrested for it. Knowing this, many people try to hide their keys in the bushes or some other trick (that doesn't work) when sleeping off their drunkenness in their car.
