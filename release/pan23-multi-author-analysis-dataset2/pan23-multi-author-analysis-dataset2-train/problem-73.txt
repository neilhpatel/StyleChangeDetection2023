If CPS doesn't have enough evidence to say the child isn't safe and needs to be removed then I doubt know how you will.
This isn't how this works legally and your mom should call the CPS supervisor of the worker that told her to file for custody of a child not in her care that CPS doesn't feel is at risk enough to remove or take action.
I don’t understand why DCF would tell us to file for emergency custody and then have it be pending/wait for court. Why would they tell us to do it if they didn’t feel it was necessary?
Just to second the prior comment the suggestion made by the CPS worker is really bizarre. If the home situation is so unsafe that the child needs to be removed then CPS should have removed them, and in that case your mom could volunteer to act as a foster placement for the child. If the home situation is safe enough to satisfy CPS then your mom cannot just demand that the child come live with her.
