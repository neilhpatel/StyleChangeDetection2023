I guess to further my point. If I get pulled over in a state where possession of cannabis is legal. How would cops verify where the cannabis was purchased? They wouldn't be able too. Therefore if I have an amount of cannabis on me that is legal to possess I wouldn't be committing a crime. Unless possessing cannabis on a interstate regardless of state laws makes it illegal or I'm missing another part of the law.
Aside from federal law, each state regulates the importation of marijuana, and "a baggie" isn't legally enough. It's generally banned and needs to be produced in-state. If not, then importation is very strict.
I see what you're saying, but that's not how it works. A crime is a crime. Let's take it 431 steps further and say you murder me. The police can't prove it. That doesn't mean, "therefore, you didn't commit murder" nor does it mean I'm not dead.
Totally understand what you mean. But I guess more specifically I'm not questioning the ethical part of the law. Just the principle. Alternative example. I live in NJ and cannabis is legal. If I buy weed from the guy down the street or have an unmarked bag of weed from a dispensary and get pulled over on a local road I would not be in violation of the law. Unless I decided to disclose to the police the weed I have was from out of state voluntarily.
