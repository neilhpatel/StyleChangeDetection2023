The article says they carried out the execution in public, as a “heart-warming” gesture to the security forces. Sadistic.
Nonsense, most people don't want to die, and have a strong survival instinct. And this guy probably barely did anything wrong. Like the other guy who was executed for honking at a protest. Basically executed for nothing. Or the girl who started it all who was beaten to death for not wearing her headscarf properly. They're not thinking "well, i was right". They think about wanting to live.
Payed out when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. The rope is payed out! You can pull now.
Please spread this story. There are many more at risk of execution, whether they have been formally charged or not.
One of their strategies is to withhold the bodies of the people they murder until their families swear to abide by the regime’s lie for cause of death (suicide, heart attack, stroke).
If you don’t comply, they keep the body, bury them in an unmarked grave, and refuse to tell you where.
If the family complies so they can bury their dead, and then come out against the regime, they will literally dig up the body and move it somewhere the family do not know. They literally did it to 16 year old Nika Shakarami.
His name was Mohsen Shekari. He was 23. He was charged with “Moharebeh” or waging war against god. They accused him of blocking a road and injuring a guard.
There are 11 protestors who have been formally sentenced to death. 3 of them were recently moved to solitary confinement, a move the regime often pulls right before they execute someone. Mohsen was one of those 3.
There was no trial. He had no lawyer. After being imprisoned for over 2 months they executed him by hanging.
But yes one of the ways they execute people (Iran executed the 2nd highest number of people in the world, only after China, a nation of 1.3 billion to Iran’s 85 million) is through this crime of Moharebeh or crimes against God.
Yeah I hope they will return the body but I highly doubt it considering the way people are gathering to pay respects at the other murdered people’s burial places. They won’t want that to continue.
Don’t trust the words of this regime. They claim Mahsa Jina Amini died of a heart attack at age 22. lol.
People aren’t protesting and risking their lives because of Mahsa Amini or the way they’ve responded to protestors. It’s because they are shit at their jobs. Since they came to power, Iran has fallen into poverty. People can’t afford bread, they can’t find medicine, they can’t find work, they’ve mismanaged the drought.
It’s not true of course, they’ve simply taken religion and twisted it into a weapon with which to best people into submission to maintain their own power and greed.
It’s bogus and just a way for them to justify imprisoning and killing hundreds and thousands of people every year.
They Islamic Republicans is also one of a handful of governments that executed people for being gay.
The irony of these savages thinking they honor God when their actions would make Satan himself blush.
Not only are they a murderous, totalitarian regime that polices your clothes, your beliefs, your relationships, your daily life, they are just plain bad at running the government.
It’s hard to feel like I’m helping in anyway since I’m in the diaspora and not in Iran, but I’m doing what I can do make sure their message gets heard.
That’s why revolution is the only way. It would be one thing if they were just controlling, but they can’t even meet the basic needs of the people. The people would rather die than continue this way. And there’s no coming back from that.
We are wearing them down, they’re just still killing the citizens in the process. Leaked audio from a regime meeting detailed just how worried they are. They specifically said they are losing the media war. Posts like these are a part of that.
Please, Iranians have a hard enough time fighting our government as it is. If you’re not going to come with love, questions, or solidarity for our cause, please just leave us alone. Ignore our threads and move along to other posts.
Mahsa was the spark but she wasn’t the reason. There are thousands of Mahsa’s filling up graves like pockmarks on the countryside for 43 years now.
Parents of murdered protestors tell crowds of thousands to keep fighting, keep going. Don’t give up, we can win this. As they are burying their babies.
You don’t have to care, you don’t have to support, but don’t add any extra noise please. We’re struggling to just hold on right now and comments like these don’t help.
Revolutions don’t happen overnight. The last revolution took over a year, this one won’t even hit 3 months for 8 more days.
We had a revolution in 1979 that then got co-opted by this regime. Iranians are much more aware, much smarter than before. The mistakes of the past will not be repeated.
They were silent until very very recently. Them and UNICEF waited over 2 months to say anything ir offer and support until Iranians in the diaspora created and signed petitions to call them out and made post and post hounding them until they spoke up.
If that isn’t fighting like hell, if that isn’t acting, either you are the exceptional soul who could withstand the multitude of the world’s terror, or you are not appreciating the revolutionary fight ordinary Iranian citizens are putting up day in and day out.

Not for sure but I have some guesses. Because it is not in the world’s political interests to be rid of this regime. It’s taken us kicking and screaming for the media, governments, and international bodies to take notice.
It appears Amnesty International has now entered the conversation. But many of us are still bitter it took months of us basically harassing for them to do so.
I’m not comparing the situations in Iran and Ukraine. As far as I’m concerned, they are both tragedies. But I saw the way the Western world reacted to Ukraine, so totally and swiftly and with a decisive narrative that fully backs Ukraine. And I’ve seen the minimizing and rug-sweeping of the conflict in Iran (and let’s not forget the continued plight of Uyghurs in China) and it’s amazing how different it is. The situations aren’t directly analogous but they are both situations of David fighting against Goliath for freedom and winning.
Plus it doesn’t help that a lot the world is woefully uneducated and incredibly biased towards the Middle East. They view us as savages who can’t help but kill each other so who cares if we’re dying right? That’s what happens there. So who gives a shit.
Yes! Though if I can offer a slight correction, if speaking about the people or the country, use Iran. If referring to the government, only call them the Islamic Republic or IR. They do not deserve to be referred to as Iran and we want to make that distinction clear.
Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. The deck is yet to be payed.
They “claim” (and you can never trust what the Iranian state media says. They still claim Mahsa Jina Amini died of a heart attack at age 22) he was blocking a street to protect protestors and he injured a guard.
The majority of the people in Iran fighting against the government are Muslims themselves. They are tired of being policed in so many facets of their lives. Children literally beaten and murdered if they speak one ill word against the dictator. Girls kidnapped by morality police and raped. Boys forced to give two years in the military for a government that has so deeply impoverished the nation that they can’t even afford bread.
Only after hounding them did we get Unicef to acknowledge what’s going on. 64 children dead and they were happy to ignore it until the Iranian Khalehs and Amoo’s (aunties and uncles) of the world got on their ass.
There are several more men at risk of being executed today or tomorrow. Toomaj Salehi. Saman Yasin. Mohammad Boroghani. Mohammad Mehdi Karami.
The Islamic Republic state media reported it. They talked about it like they did the world a favor 🤮. The media is heavily monitored and censored by the regime.
I got my degree in Political Science with an emphasis on Global Politics. I might be talking out if my ass, but it’s at least an educated ass.
He had no trial, he had no lawyer. They promised his family they would not kill him if they kept quiet that he was in custody so they complied. They tortured him in prison for 2 months and this morning they hanged him.
Many of the women fighting and dying wear head scarfs by choice and none of us care. We want democracy and freedom, not for our lives to be at risk for one wrong word or a piece of fabric.
It’s about. This is not an anti-Islam movement. The government calls themselves the Islamic Republic but they has much to do with Islam as Scientology has to do with science.
The head scarf was the spark, but it is not the reason this happening. People don’t die in the street for months on end for fashion. It’s for freedom.
I don’t mind when people laugh at it, it’s a ridiculous username I made 10 years ago. Honestly we could all use some levity and moments of joy these days. Glad you find it funny.
Hmm you’re correct in that we do revere our martyrs, but centra feels like the wrong word. They are important to us but we’re not looking for them. But once they come about, they’re important and we make a point of remembering them.
