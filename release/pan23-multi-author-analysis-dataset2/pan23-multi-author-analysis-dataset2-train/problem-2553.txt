Time stamps are dependent to the time set on your phone. I have pictures of the damage and we have security footage in front of our house, that shows the package being pushed in, missing cardboard that had been damaged in a fall to make it look fine. I was unaware of the original package so I did not realize it was missing.
A third party delivery company. And I guess inspection was in the fine print above where he told me to sign. I did not read the entire paper as thoroughly as I should have. The man was in a hurry.
You need to talk to the company. It hurts that you accepted condition but even in your story there’s nothing to assume anything visible was damaged and there wasn’t.
I will also add that nobody notified me of the fall that the object had taken in the truck, or that damaged cardboard had been ripped off as well as bubble wrap to inspect a part for damage, which wasn’t even the part that broke. As it was not my package, I was unaware that the cardboard had been removed or anything.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
