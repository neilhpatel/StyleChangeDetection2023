Did you ever take this child to a psychiatrist? Because this sounds like serious behavioral issues that need more than just therapy, honestly.
Either way, while often the advice is "don't bother with a lawyer until you are sued/charges are brought", this is NOT one of those cases. Start looking for a criminal defense lawyer now, get a consultation, and basically ask for help with damage control/preparation. It is FAR better to spend a couple hundred bucks now and prepare ahead of time, than it is to wait until cops are knocking on your door or you are served and your lawsuit is available publicly.
They were taken to one when younger and diagnosed with a few things that they were put on meds for. Their mother blocked all further attempts at taking them to a psychiatrist or therapist.
There is no documentation if it other than the fact they were scheduled for appointments and then were not taken. The only documentation I have of any of their behaviors is me speaking to my friends over the years and notifying them of the situations bc I needed comfort or advice...but I assume that wouldnt count?
