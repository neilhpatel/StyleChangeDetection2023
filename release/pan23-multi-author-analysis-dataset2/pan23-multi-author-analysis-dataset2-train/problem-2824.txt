I think since he has existing medical conditions that it’s probably safer to be inpatient while playing around with medications and such. I wish him nothing but the best. As a Pennsylvanian, he is such an asset to the Senate. I’m proud of him for destigmatizing mental health treatment. Having depression is not a moral failing.
Depression is an ugly beast. That he’s in the hospital makes me think it’s pretty bad. Hope he hasn’t hurt himself or anything like that, and that he gets the help he needs.
As a non Pennsylvanian I see him as an asset in the Senate too. He is a champion of the middle class that’s becoming extinct in America. I hope he recovers well and remains in good health so he can do the great things he was intended to do in the Senate.
