What if his brothers or sisters show up and say they're supposed to collect rent,correct his cousins?
I'm sure he can designate someone to collect, but he's a felon in another country and in guessing legal notices like that might reveal his location so...
This guy kidnapped a young girl at gunpoint, fled the country, and now his parents are saying I messed everything up because I won't illegally grow marijuana to send him money...
I want to make these idiots jump through every legal hoop possible just for being horrible human beings.
I'm talking about covering your own ass here. You'll want at least some evidence that you're attempting to make payment and have the money on hand, because otherwise you risk eviction if you get it wrong.
Like I said, check the appropriate authority (county registrar / registrar of deeds / etc) to see if their claim of owning the property outright holds water.
If it doesn't say so, and demand some other evidence that they're acting on his behalf. Hold onto receipts when you do pay.
