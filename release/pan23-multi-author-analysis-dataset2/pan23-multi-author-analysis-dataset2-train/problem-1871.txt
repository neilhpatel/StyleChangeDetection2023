Federal MPs (including Crown Ministers like the PM) stop accruing government contributions to their government pension plans at age 65; this gives them an incentive to retire when they hit 65. To actually be paid out they must retire from public life; a sitting MP cannot collect their pension. They can defer collection of the pension for as long as they want to but there is no real benefit in doing so. Plus, they have to have served as an MP for a minimum of six years before they can even enter the pension plan. They can't collect a full pension until age 65; if they choose to collect their pension before age 65 then the payout is reduced by 1% for each year that the plan member retires before age 65. A reduced pension can be payable as early as age 55, no earlier.
Iâ€™m hoping in a few years we get action movies with Biden as the president casted by a close to retirement age action star. I could totally see this kind of scene playing out.
This reminds me of the funniest comment I ever saw on reddit. It was about a meeting between Trump and Putin, and that only the two of them were aware of the contents of the talks.
I know the hilarity doesn't translate well on a retelling but I still think about that thread every now and again.
