My lawyer said he will object if it is brought up in trial, but this is just the deposition for the civil court, so it is just the lawyers and a court reporter. My lawyer said I have to answer anything and everything they ask, but that he will object and most of it won't make it to court.
It sounds like they're asking this for the sake of establishing damages. If you've have past traumatic experiences and it affected your mental health, then it could be argued your current mental health condition isn't solely a result of the matter at issue.
Are you aware of any law that does not allow a sexual assault victim during a sexual assault case to be asked about prior assaults?
Generally, rape shield laws revolve around trying to use other instances to prove or disprove the instance in question. If it's being used for some other purpose, it may be allowed. As another commenter noted, usually civil trials have a bit more leeway.
There's a lot more scope to ask these questions in a civil case than a criminal case in many jurisdictions.
That's a good point. Hopefully because the incident they're asking about was a one time thing and the case being tried is about recurring molestation taking place over the course of a few years they don't be able to make that argument.
