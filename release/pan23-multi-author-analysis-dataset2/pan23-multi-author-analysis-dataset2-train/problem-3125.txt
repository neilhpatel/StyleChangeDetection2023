If the class is commercial vehicles vs. private vehicles, I agree. To the extent you seem to be trying to spin this into discriminating against people based on a protected class, no.
I didn't say that economic class was a protected legal class... just that it tends to be working-class people who have logos on their vehicles... hence this rule being somewhat classist.
I guess I'm just surprised that such a rule is allowed legally. Just seems inherently classist when it's primarily tradespeople who put business info on their vehicle.
They can have rules against having business vehicles on the property at all or running a business from the residence. Lots of people use magnetic signs so they can be removed and put back on as needed.
Does your lease actually say that? If so, since it isn't specifically prohibited under the Florida's landlord-tenant statutes, it is an enforceable lease provision.
I emailed the property manager to ask and they said the building's "rules and regulations" ban any "vehicles with logos" from the property.
The lease either needs to contain that rule, or the lease needs to include a provision that tenant's must abide by the building's rules and regulations, which also should have been provided to you before signing the lease.
