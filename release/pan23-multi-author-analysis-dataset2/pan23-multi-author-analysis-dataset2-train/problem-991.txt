\- Paul Ryan to his speech writer, with a Post-It saying "could you make a hundred variations over this, and hand me the more subtle and opaque ones first?".
100% agree, been saying this since he left office. He's setting himself up to be the anti-Trump, middle of the road conservative in '24. Who else is there? Desantis is too extreme (like Trump), poll after poll shows people want a younger candidate...Ryan/Biden could be dangerous for the left, and if there is a candidate on the right that scares the Dems enough to primary hard on Biden, how good does he look in his 80's coming out of that?
I consider myself Team Blue and I would vote for Paul Ryan over Biden in 2024. Itâ€™s insane. He will be far too old to be President, and who knows who will be welding the power through the DNC.
