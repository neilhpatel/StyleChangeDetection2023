And I'm not gonna do a big back and forth, Canada has shown time and time again it takes a forgiveness approach to violent crime. It has shown over and over again victims don't matter and that fine if you wanna live in a society like that. I don't. So take care bud.
no idea. wtf is wrong with people? im generally anti death penalty but with something so random and senseless id have them pass go and collect their 200 volts.
No, an execution is specifically a killing that occurs as a punishment for a real or imagined transgression, or alternately refers to a specific "style" of killing that usually refers to an individual being made helpless and then killed at the "leisure" of the killer.
I'm pretty sure you're helpless if you get "swarmed" against people with deadly weapons if you dont have a gun already loaded and locked.
Correct usage is to write for the culture that your audience is from, which means to use the established terminology of that culture.
In Canadian English, the correct term here is "swarming". Writing "group attack" would be to deviate from the established term, and therefore would be less clear to the Canadian audience that expects that crime to be referred to as "swarming".
When you are the external audience, the obligation is on you to try and gain an understanding of local language use. There is no obligation on the locals to change their terminology for your sake. (E: not meaning to sound brusque here).
Forget leaving her on the street. Sentence here to 15 years plus. No parole. I want less time for non violent offenders. I want more time for murderers. She is a murderer. And I can tell you right now, when I was 13 I would know its wrong to walk up to a man and stab him to death. I would know the finality of death.
She is out only with supervision and being qualified out. If she fucks up. She goes back. Plain and simple man. Her life, he line. No takes back. She played for keeps so for keeps She plays now.
