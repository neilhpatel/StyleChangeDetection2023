Every time I see one of these headlines I just think, but who is really profiting from the growth here? The individual workers? The companies? The government? Supposedly all of them but rarely is it the first case.
Maybe they grew 5% after the 30% this lost over the last few years? That's all I could possibly think of as China's economy is currently collapsing not "growing".
Combination of pent of Chinese consumer demand akin to US after lockdowns and going into 2021. Additionally, massive levels of government spending to revive housing sector and spur growth. Instead of focusing on GDP I'd focus on reports of debt levels. More government spending to revive housing sector will make the number larger but long term it's unproductive debt aka dead weight. Estimates I've seen are debt to GDP levels around 300%.
Because OP asked who does this growth benefit, listing out a few things. Like how a rising tide lift all kinds of boats this high growth should help all sections of the country.
But here the focus seems to be wondering why the rich got richer rather than thinking did the poor got better in the same time? The answer is yes.
