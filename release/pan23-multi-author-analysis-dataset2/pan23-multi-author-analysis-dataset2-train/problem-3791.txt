Yes. Your first amendment rights are between you and the government, not you and your employer. You can't be arrested for free speech (subject to the known limitations). As is often said, other people can tell you you're an asshole for what you say. Or, in this case, fire you.
Your first amendment right to free speech prohibits the government from restricting your speech. It does not apply to your private employer.
Generally speaking, yes, you can be terminated for saying things other people don't like at work, even if "NON-DERAGATORY".
Your speech was not restricted. You were free to say whatever you wanted, and you did. And now you have a consequence for that speech.
I was using my freedom of speech to spread the word about it. Now what would happen if I got a recording of him saying that. We r an "open opportunity buissness" (I don't think I have that right) but anyone is able to come in and if they meet qualifications but for him to state that goes against the open opportunity stature, does it not?
