Waiting to have your interests represented until late in the process could make this cost more, not less if there is to be any dispute.
This seems akin to the thinking that lawyers don't do anything if they're not standing in the courtroom. The truth is that the ratio of attorney work outside the courtroom to inside is something between 3:1 and 10:1 or higher depending on the type of litigation. Your attorney does lots of things before this gets down to putting terms to paper.
The challenge will be that your attorney won't have shaped the information going into those terms. And again, if she gets there and realizes that things have gone wrong or the other side has become entrenched in a position she would have argued against, fixing that may be much more time consuming than having done it right in the first place.
You'll probably want your lawyer to have the same amount of time to work on this as hers, so it's probably better to meet with one now, tell him what you want, what you're willing to negotiate on, and so forth. Then, when you get her proposal, your lawyer will be ready to write up a reply. He might even decide that it would be better to write your own proposal and send it to her attorney.
