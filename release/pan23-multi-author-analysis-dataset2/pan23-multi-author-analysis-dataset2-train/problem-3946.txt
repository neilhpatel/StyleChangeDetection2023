Finding out something could have been resolved a lot easier/ cheaper if you caught it earlier once would probably make you check your mail at least once a week.
You should check your mail once per week in case of legal notices and the like. That's about the time they assume you will check it in, so checking once a month might get you into trouble as you can't say, "I didn't see the notice because I don't check my mail often" and have that be an excuse.
If your box is full of junk mail (or anything) from not checking it, the postperson will consider any further mail undeliverable until you clear it out again. They can't empty the box for you (obviously) so I believe it just goes back to the post office until they can deliver it again. Im not 100% sure on that last bit, but I've accidentally left my box too stuffed and had to go get the mail that couldn't be delivered.
Check out OptOutPrescreen.com, you can register to opt out of a lot of soft credit offers, junk mail, etc. That and putting a freeze on your credit could help reduce the amount of junk mail you're getting. It will also help protect your identity and credit, as well as keep your mail carrier happy.
