You won't be arrested. Chlamydia can be treated. It's an STI. The other thing is, you didn't know you had it. You would need to have had malicious intent on spreading it. But again you just found out and it's an STI. Just focus on getting the help you need for yourself regarding the R word.
Does he have any claim on the fact I didn't tell him AS SOON AS HUMANELY POSSIBLE? I planned on talking to my friend about it, and maybe my therapist, and waiting to see my doctor before telling anyone. My mom is taking care of me she even told me we needed to just go to bed and not worry about it until the morning. Can he get me arrested for not telling him right as I found out?
How do you know he wasn't the person who gave it to you? It sounds like, by his own admission, that he sleeps around with a lot of different women and doesn't use protection. If I were you. I'd respond to him and say that for all you know, he's the one that gave it to you for the reason above. Were you tested before you started having unprotected sex with him? If you were then that bolsters that argument.
