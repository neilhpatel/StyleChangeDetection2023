There is also likely bigotry playing a factor. As 'protecting french language' heats up, there is a lot of pressure for Quebec to accept more west Africans (as they can protect french, most other immigrants flip to english). But that'd make Quebec dark skinned, when a reality is a large number of those defending french language are actually using it as a dog whistle to protect old stock white francos. Quebec has one of, if not the worst demographics on the continent and their language will significantly drop if they are not willing to target darker Quebeckers for immigration. Instead, racist tension builds and builds in Quebec (they are not alone of course).
Video account from people of colour who immigrated to Quebec and face discrimination and other issues, despite your denial:
I dont know about canada but in new zealand the cops just radio the local comms operator who can look up the listed owner and their contact info. Call the owner, if the suspects cellphone rings or has the same name on his drivers license its a pretty easy check.
But then again I grew up in a country, where its not a problem that police have a gun. So maybe its a societal problem.
Yeah. But defund the police, pay them even less and shorten their education. That will surely attract only the brightest individuals to the police force. /s.
What its about depends on who you ask, even within the movement. Some want to even disbanded the police.
Defund the police isn't about defunding their training, it's about making sure the police with less or even just bad training don't become militarized like they are in the US. Idk about you, but I wouldn't trust any cop with a loaded weapon to do their job properly when they can't stop being racist and hateful on main when unarmed.
From what I have learned about canadians on tv is a possibility is the officers were french and the comms operator was english? (joking).
