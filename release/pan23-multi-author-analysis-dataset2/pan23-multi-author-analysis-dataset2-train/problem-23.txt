IF you dad is a convicted felon, yes, he is not allowed to be around guns and if his family reports him, he could get in trouble. If he never had physical access to the guns he might be okay though. But unless he is on scene with the guns, the responding uniform police officers aren't just gonna go take out warrants on him especially when they can tell it is bullshit family drama to begin with.
He lives on a camper near the driveway of the residence- so there are no guns in his “home”- however, the family’s house has firearms in it- which he has a key to. So short answer: he could have access to the guns- however he doesn’t know where they are in the house.
But, your father needs to double check his status. IF he has a felony conviction (which based on your post, is not a bogus felony charge btw) from when he was a juvenile....that might not even count any more for the purposes of felon in possession of a firearm.
Then if the cops get called and he is found to "be in possession" of a firearm he could get in trouble.
The cops likely won't turn around and charge him if he moves away and the family tries to report him after the fact to "get back at him".
Has he ever had a background check done or applied to register a firearm? A 50 year old juvenile conviction might not even pop.
