The Landlord is not entitled to search your personal belonging unless your stuff is in a designated common area (which he can search on grounds of security/suspicious items) or if it's an emergency (e.g You collapsed and he is looking for your medication, but these are few and far between).
A common area is one that you have no expectation of privacy. Your room and your closet would be an invasion of privacy for a roommate to go through, so it's not a common area. A shared bathroom, kitchen, etc, common area.
Were you present during the "search"? Can you give details on the rtdrs hearing notice? is it related to the search?
Are you sure they can search through belongings at all? they're not an officer of the law and if I did it it would be tresspass to chattel or related.
Gotcha and that makes sense. What my landlord did was not right whatsoever. Thank you and everyone else whose commented for being so helpful and informative!
Just take a moment, take a breath, and don't make a decision without knowing your rights and obligations.
You may want to slow your roll on leaving and going straight for an attorney. Read your rights first. Your actual damages may not come close to being construed as an illegal eviction, so leaving may leave you on the hook for rent.
