Similarly some businesses claim to be "too big to fail" so they can maximize profit to the point of screwing things up, then receive a bail out.
If i was a big business and i had an issue with Qatar's actions then i would very very vocally say i am pulling all sponsorships, and guess what, that would be a story. Free brand awareness 24/7, asking customers to make a choice between my principled stance and the businesses who do not care.
I do think that there are other people out there that will interpret "too big to fail" in both of the ways I described. Anyone wishing to portray large corporations as strong, secure institutions will want to push the "unsinkable" interpretation, and then whenever the banks do actually run into serious trouble, they can use the alternative interpretation to justify getting bailouts, before turning round and switching back to the 1st interpretation going "see, told you we were too big to fail..!".
"World Cup too big to back out." - "We can't lose the marketing it gives us for us to ignore human rights abuses".
I only recently twigged to that pun/double meaning on "too big to fail". For ages I just thought it meant "massive enough that it can tank most problems that would tank a smaller system" but what it actually means is more along the lines of "oh god if this fails we're all super duper screwed".
(edit: er, "tank" as in gaming tank in the first instance - absorb damage. And "tank" as in fail in the 2nd. Could've worded that better...).
The tank autoantonym wasn't meant to be the wordplay, that's how I naturally worded the sentence before I re-read it and realised how confusing it was.
