It's going to be a lot easier to get Leopard 2s to Ukraine, than Abrams. The Leopards are already nearby.
They need Leopard 2s, they are the only vehicle that's good enough, that's nearby, already in europe, can be parted with by their owners, and have enough of them to make a difference.
However Symbolism is important once the UK gives Ukraine tanks and Russia (surprise surprise) does fuck all about it, others will follow.
Ukraine's head general said 300 main battle tanks (and 700 IFVs) would be realistic to return to pre invasion lines. NATO has collectively thousands of both in storage that will likely end up being scrapped, so it's mostly a matter of having political will and some training.
It's been a year and Ukraine has more Armored vehicles than it started with, They captured a staggering amount of fully intact T-80s, T-90s and T-72s in the Kharkiv counter-offensive. and many of those tanks arent even going to come into play for months. they have to repair and refit them.
This is partly true. Those are valuable assets, however this kind of fails to see the point of western tanks for Ukraine.
Another area that western tanks simply outclass Soviet tanks is in mobility. Even the most modern Russian tanks can only go 4-10KPH in reverse. Most western tanks can go 30-60hph in reverse. When keeping your heavily armored front towards the threat is important this is a surprisingly useful thing to have.
One of the primary reasons that the US and allies beat the ever living shit out of Iraq in the Gulf War back in the early 90s was because US armored vehicles were by and large equipped with more modern sensor and communications packages. This is still true today, at the moment both Ukraine and Russia lack modern sensor packages on most of their tanks. See first, shoot first, kill first.
