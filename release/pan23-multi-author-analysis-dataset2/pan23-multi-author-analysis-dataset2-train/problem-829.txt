I don't know why they called it the inflation reduction act, you could have just named it a green energy deal or something, shit has nothing to do with inflation.
60% of Americans want the government to "fight" inflation by launching tax cuts and sending out stimulus checks.
By that standard a bill meant to keep medication costs down, increase policing of tax fraud and make the US less dependent on the trading price of oil is well named.
The EU import over 60 billion dollars worth of cars annually (or 3.6 million units), with the largest importers being the UK and US. This is 2 comments back to back which show you don't really know what you're talking about.
Their concerns are noted, but also they can fuck off. They should be applying their own subsidies for green energy not complaining that the US is doing so.
The trade is wildly lopsided with the US importing 1.2M cars while the EU imports just 270K from the US. The EU tariff is 10% while the US only imposes a 2.5% tariff. $43B in imports, versus just $6B.
They do provide their own domestic manufactures a tax creidt AND allow those subsides for Vehicles from the US. The EU is upset that america is essentially not returning the favor.
