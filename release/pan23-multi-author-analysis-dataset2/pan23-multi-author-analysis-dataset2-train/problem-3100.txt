>The appeals court did hold up the district court’s ruling that dismissed the individual complaint against Helms, and said that Helms is protected under qualified immunity, which is a rule that protects police officers from being held individually liable unless the officer clearly violates a constitutional right. Sharpe argued that it was “clearly established” that Helms violated his First Amendment rights, but the court disagreed and said the officer was “entitled” to qualified immunity.
It's also toothless because the context is that the plaintiff needs to prove that there is effectively a ban on livestreaming police stops in order for there to be any action taken. Also the cop get qualified immunity because of course he fucking does.
Probably have to prove a policy in order to put the department and city on the hook for damages, the ruling will still be helpful going forward though.
