Ultimately, it happened because relations between Noriega's regime and the US deteriorated over the course of the prior decade, and he began to shift his country's alliegence towards the Soviet bloc. If that hadn't happened, it's debatable as to whether or not the situation would have ever escalated in the manner that it did.
Noriega was probably involved in the drug trade. He was probably also a CIA asset He resisted two coup attempts leading up to the invasion, before and after his political opponents alleged widespread election fraud on the election of one of his backed candidates to the government. This made him unpopular with many Panamanians(?) as he basically suspended democratic proceedings in reaction. The US was already pressuring Noriega, and amidst all of this a vehicle of off-duty US military personnel travelling in to Panama City was attacked and several individuals were killed or captured. This incident proved to be the immediate catalyst for invasion.
tldr; There are a lot of reasons both genuine and dishonest for the invasion to have happened. I don't think the US being scheduled to hand off the Panama Canal a decade later had much to do with it, though.
Put simply, Noriega was a central-american dictator that pivoted out from the US sphere of influence and subsequently became the subject of the latter's scrutiny. Ultimately the removal of another autocrat was probably a good thing for the people of Panama, but it was done by invasion and probably for political reasons more than anything else.
Iâ€™ve read and seen too many (supposedly) true stories involving drug smugglers during that era that all claim to have met with Noriega and paid him protection money.
