I'm a real estate agent and realtor in NJ. The best way to find out the answer to your question is to get the managing brokers involved, and ask to see copies of the rejected offers. We all have to keep copies of all rejected offers, and submit them to our broker. Start there and don't worry about anything else until you have that information.
I don’t know how things works in background. There’s a possibility that seller’s realtor may have lied. I sold my home in different state but every offer I received was in writing and I refused in writing.
I am a Realtor and I would bet money that the sellers agent lied. The problem is with thatuch of a difference in price your agent should've made the sellers agent verify the competing offers before you countered back with the full price offer. All offers, accepted and rejected need to be kept on file with the brokerage so I would call the managing broker of the seller agents brokerage and ask for verification of any other offers, and then go from there.
Even if the seller's realtor lied, yours should have helped you by pointing out that it's foolish to offering asking price on a house that's been on the market for 200 days and it's unlikely that other offers came in at the same time yours did on a house that had been on the market for more than half a year.
Edited to add: A lot of real estate agents and realtors respond to posts like yours. They empathize with the realtor, rather than the seller/buyer. Take their posts with a huge grain of salt.
