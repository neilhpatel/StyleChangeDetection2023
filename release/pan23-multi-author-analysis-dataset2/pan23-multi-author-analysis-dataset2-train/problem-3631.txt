Honestly I would involve your landlord as well. Don't expect them to be able to do anything, but the jerk with the trumpet isn't just affecting you, they're potentially affecting the whole building and if nobody else does anything about it, your landlord is going to see some rapid turnover in their building at least which equals lost revenue for your landlord. Which means your landlord's investment is being devalued by the prick with the trumpet and your landlord might do something about it. Maybe they have a cousin in the force or they're friends with the DA, who knows, but it can't hurt to call in all the resources you have to take down the lone trumpeter.
NAL: Talk to code enforcement during the day to go over the issue and see if they have any potential solutions. (they will probably suggest police non-emergency as it is outside of hours.) If you need to continue using the police, try to note a pattern (they play wed-sun, but not mon-tue, etc.) and go to the police to see if they can perhaps try to have increased patrols in your area during those times.
Alternatively, figure out where this person lives and make use of the local noise ordinance that probably allows for louder sounds after a certain hour.
Sorry if my bugle call sheets are slightly out of date, it does include retreat at 6, but Taps closes out the list at 9:15, as it was named for the drum signal for lights out.
Surely you canâ€™t be the only one whose sleep is being affected by the trumpet playing. Talk to your neighbors around you and get everyone to call the police and report it every night.
