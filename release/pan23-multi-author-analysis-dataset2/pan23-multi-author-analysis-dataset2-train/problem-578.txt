There is a really cool book called The Red Atlas that shows how the Soviet Union made insanely detailed maps of every major city, military installation and bit of significant infrastructure in basically every NATO country back in the cold war. No particular reason to think they stopped just because of a change in management.
I don't believe so, but I'm not sure. The Falkland Islands weren't, and it's believed that even Hawaii would not be covered under the language of the treaty.
Article on failure of initial convoy said they were using maps from 60s/70s that were missing entire towns.
The book goes on to talk about the tons of intentionally wrong maps of Soviet territory they produced and provided to the general public lol. Russian paranoia is not a new thing.
The lack of casus belli is not the thing that is holding NATO back. We have just as much reason to attack now as if russia started attacking NATO. The point is that NATO is simply afraid of nukes. Which is understandable but also its understandable that russia is equally afraid. Which somehow gets removed from the calculations.
