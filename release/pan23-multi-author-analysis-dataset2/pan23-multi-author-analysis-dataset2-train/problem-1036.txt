You might have to, I don’t know if being a minor will save you or anything but it’s still a possibility. I can’t promise what they’ll charge you with.
Not being able to get your license may be the least or your concerns at the moment. You may want a lawyer. I'm not sure if it makes a difference since you're still under 18 but looking at a potential misdemeanor. The other issue, even if you got your license. Your insurance rates will be high due to this event.
I know this will certainly be a delay in you getting your drivers license. You’ll need to take another drivers education course. You can’t get your license until you’re at least 18 (not sure if it has to be 21 but I know there are steps you need to take before you can even get your license). I also know penalties can include: Class B Misdemeanor, 24 months probation, 6 months jail time, or up to $1.5K fines. You should get a lawyer possibly.
You can be sad and depressed all you want, but you made the choice to do that and you’re going to have to face the repercussions. Just be lucky nobody got hurt from your decision.
