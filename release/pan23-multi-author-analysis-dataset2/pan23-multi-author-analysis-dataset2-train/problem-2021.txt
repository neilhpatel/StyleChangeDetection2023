I'm a Louisiana attorney based in Jefferson Parish. I'm gonna assume you're in the New Orleans area, but let me know if you're not and I can look up your parish's laws. For the NO area, call code enforcement to report the habitability issues of the house. Specifically mention that you believe the house is harboring pests (the bugs) and causing an infestation; I know both Jefferson Parish and Orleans have ordinances prohibiting that. If you think the smell could be caused by sewerage issues, mention that too, since that's definitely something code enforcement will want to know. Orleans and Jefferson also should both have something on the city website that lets you track complaints for code violations by address (for Jefferson, it'll probably be under a section called PMZ/Quality of Life). And you need to keep calling code enforcement until they do something about it. It really may take 5 or more calls. If they don't get to it, contact your local councilmember.
Unfortunately, the number of reports made to CPS or APS really matter. It is helpful if more people call, more times, over a period of time. Be insistent. Give detailed information. Make note of the days you see him outside. Ask them what it would be helpful for them to know. I've found adults often don't know what to report if a child is being neglected, and I imagine it's similar here. For example, note whenever he's outside without seasonally appropriate clothing.
