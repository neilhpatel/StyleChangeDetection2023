The endgame for voters has shifted to national policy, and if it takes embarrassing individuals to get what Republicans want then Republicans will seek them.
Republicans love to use people that aren't straight white men as tools to oppress other groups. They see him being a drag queen as an opportunity to attack one of their most hated groups.
That's really funny, since it's exactly what a narcissist would think when they get called out. "I thought I was faking empathy perfectly! Why are these other people so unfair to me?".
My belief is what you're saying probably has a shaving's worth of truth, but there's not going to be enough for a noticeable impact. He won't be re-elected, to be fair, but to say he's affecting the perception of Republicans to Republican voters nation-wide in a way that reflects voting patterns...just saying, I've been hurt before and fear my skepticism has plenty of precedent supporting it. They were already voting for Hershel Walker elsewhere when they knew he was lying.
Maybe, but counter-point: Marjorie Taylor Green has been re-elected and appointed to committees now. Similar things were said about Marj two years ago.
