It's likely not your issue. But how far is the FedEx? I do understand that it's not your fault that they are sending you boxes, but if FedEx is 15 minutes away, you're really better off just heading there and putting this in the past, instead of continuing to waste your life with this shitty company that can't seem to even send packages to the right place!
Getting to a FedEx is a pain because of the hours I work, and when I'm off I have a one year old I'd have to drive around and bring in. She's in a brace, so getting her in and out of a car seat is a big deal.
I told them multiple times to just come pick it up, but they claim they can't do that and keep saying, "sorry for the inconvenience". It won't be inconvenient, I'm just putting it out with the trash.
Not to be any more pedantic than you are, but sending packages to someone who didn't order then is pretty clearly sending them to the wrong place, to the wrong address, etc. I understand that the shipping label has OPs address on it, but the packages are obviously not being sent to the right place.
