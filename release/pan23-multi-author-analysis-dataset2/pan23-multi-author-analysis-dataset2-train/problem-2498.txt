A few days after taking office, Boris Pistorius announced ambitious plans for the future of the Bundeswehr. In order to achieve this, there are three central tasks. In addition, the new Defense Minister wants to visit Ukraine in the next few weeks. The new Federal Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has announced that he will visit Ukraine as soon as possible. "What is certain is that I will travel to Ukraine quickly," said Pistorius of "Bild am Sonntag". This will "probably even happen within the next four weeks," he added.
Under him as Minister, the Bundeswehr should take the top spot in Europe, Pistorius said. "Germany is the largest economy in Europe, so it should also be our goal to have the strongest and best-equipped army in the EU." However, this cannot be done in three years before the next federal election, it still takes a few years longer, emphasized Pistorius. "My job is now to set the course for the turning point to succeed." Chancellor Olaf Scholz had proclaimed this almost a year ago after the start of the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine.
