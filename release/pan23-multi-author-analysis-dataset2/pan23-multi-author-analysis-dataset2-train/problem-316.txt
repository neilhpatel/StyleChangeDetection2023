If the comments I've seen from conservatives over the last few days are any indication this is already effectively true. The Republicans and the MAGA Republicans are splintering hard and fast. If the Republicans manage to get by with only a small lead of a couple votes they'll have to deal with the MAGA wing demanding to put insane shit in every bill to get their vote while simultaneously getting the "sane" Republicans to agree to it. They'll kill anything critical that the majority of their party would want passed all in the name of investigating Biden. I wonder how long after a popular (with republicans) bill doesn't pass because Boebert won't agree unless they add in something stupid will it take them to start constructing bipartisan bills again.
Basically that red state legislatures specifically bar early ballots/mailed ballots from being opened/counted early or even day of because they hope to sow mistrust in the electoral process with a "red wave" that is cut down by mail in/drop off/early voting ballots.
