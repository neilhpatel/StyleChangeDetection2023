I didn't want to clog the initial post with too much additional information about the story, but if anyone requires more information, I would be happy to. I really appreciate any and all guidance, sifting through this stuff flying blind is hard!
Would the character be willing to go the less-than-legal route? There have been many historical cases of underaged people doctoring birth certificates, including Dan Bullock, the youngest US soldier to die in the Vietnam War.
While this wouldn't be a matter of just changing a birthdate, I could see a forgery being manageable.
The birthdate thing is super interesting. He is 25 in the story, but I am reading about Dan Bullock, and I think they both have that kind of undying I-want-to-serve spirit that would influence a forgery or fudging of the birthdate. Super interesting, thank you!..
Oh that is so interesting. I think this character absolutely would go the less-than-legal route as it pertained to forgery. I'm wondering now how much that would cost to do right (this guy is also b r o k e ). Do you know anything about counterfeit practices back then? He'd have to know someone or know someone who knew someone...
