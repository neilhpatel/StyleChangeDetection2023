Based on the verbal agreement and your expenses you could speak to an attorney about making your claim for more of the proceeds. That point may be dulled by you having exclusive use of the property your ex co-owns for the last nine years.
He has made threats to stop the sale of he doesn’t get, from what it sounds like, MORE than his half but I feel like I am entitled to be repaid for the upgrade (I have receipts) before the remaining proceeds are divided equally.
The obvious argument against that is that real estate improvements rarely give a 1:1 increase in purchase price. Some upgrades bring more value than others, but spending $50k on a kitchen upgrade may only yield a purchase increase of $35k. Some “upgrades” even lose value from the property (like spending thousands to install a statute and fountain, except it’s the ugliest statute in the world and built into the middle of the living room). Reimbursing you from receipts and not the actual value has the potential to over-reimburse you for the costs you paid.
The simpler argument is that you had a partnership agreement authorizing him to have 22% of the property, and attempt to hold him to that agreement, providing you have evidence of that agreement.
