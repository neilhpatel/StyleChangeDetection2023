Realistically speaking the location of the incarceration is irrelevant. The inmate isn't going to escape and revictimize this person, and the board of prisons isn't going to transfer a prisoner because their new prison is closer to one of their victims. You can write as many letters as you'd like if it makes you feel better.
Yeah, I realize the chances of escape are minimal. But being a lower security prison, it is going to offer more freedoms to the prisoners. I'm thinking the freedoms would include additional means of communication, which the victims do not want. The prisoner is known in the past to try and make contact with the victims of the crime.
If someone did want to make the request though, who would actually be someone that could make that decision? Like would a senator have any pull at all (like they do with other misc situations) or do that have literally no say in what happens with prisoners? Would a prisoner review board have more to say?
If they try to contact the victims that could likely be reported. Your concern is its lower security, but based on the decision to move the prisoner there even if theh werent close to victims they would likely have the same privileges at another lower security prison. Proximity wouldn't matter with phone calls.
I guess I did not see it as completely unreasonable which is why I asked the question in the first place. They (prisoners) are able to request moves from prison to prison for their own reasons and I figured people involved with the prisoner would maybe have similar abilities to request moves.
As other poster board of prisons would be the best place to start. There isnt likely to be much in the way of they remedy you are looking for.
