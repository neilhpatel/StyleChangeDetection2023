I wrote a couple years ago, which addresses this question. The short answer is yes, and depending on how big you believe a rock has to be to be called an "island", there are still "islands" out there being found today.
It is remarkable to me that Landsat Island is so tiny, only 25 m by 45 m. This may be difficult to answer, but to what extent did aerial surveys increase our knowledge of oceanic islands? I imagine some significant landmasses were only discovered with the advent of observation aircraft?
I'm afraid I can't say; I work in the space industry on remote sensing spacecraft, not in aviation, geography, or the history of either. This would be an interesting new question for the sub, though.
Do you know what happens with newly discovered islands like this? Like, does a country claim it? Can a person claim it? Is it like Antarctica and no one can claim it?
In the case of Landsat Island, this was already within the territorial waters of Canada, so there wasn't any question. Most of the places where new islets and rocks are likely to be found are already covered by existing jurisdictions or treaties, as well, since they're likely coastal, tidal, or (most likely) buried under polar ice.
Some Treaty Parties do not recognise territorial claims and others maintain that they reserve the right to make a claim. All positions are explicitly protected in Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty, which preserves the status quo:
No acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica or create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica. No new claim, or enlargement of an existing claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force.
