Otherwise, in those segments we do not know how far off they are, if at all. The spend for each is coming close to or already comparable to the US, whom must spend far more money maintaining what already exists (bases, fleets, and equipment, as well as personnel salary and retirement in a far more expensive country). In terms of military interest they are focused on internal stability, Taiwan, and economic interests in Africa, Central and Southeast Asia. These one to one comparisons of GDP spend between militaries is outdated. Hell, if we were to rank militaries for what their goals are, even tiny countries like Azerbaijan and Israel rank pretty high. These examples as well as China do very much want to conquer and hold land (or water). For what their goals are they are very much ahead of Russia in terms of strenh. Russia's goals far far overreach their abilities, even before the war.
Maybe someone in Russia had a lightbulb moment and realized that attacking Japan would be an automatic declaration of war from the USA.
Japan is ranked top 5 in the world for military strenh, but then again Russia is like 3 and we saw how that went!
