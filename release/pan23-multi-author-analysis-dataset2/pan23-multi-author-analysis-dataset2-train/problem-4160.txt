It is also advisable to check the house and make sure any small valuables didn't vanish. Keepsakes, jewelry, coins, guns, identification documents - visually verify that they are still there. It may be too late to track them down if they were pawned, but it's possible that family members stupidly stole something and kept it.
u/ThinkerWhoTinkers is right about this being mail and/or wire fraud, and that a restraining order is a good step. I would also suggest she revisit the will with an estate attorney, in case someone was part of the will and the shenanigans (and thus should be removed from the will). However, she can also go after them for trespassing.
NAL. Your uncle committed mail fraud and either individually or with his siblings also likely committed wire fraud. Contact the police and give them all details. Also get a restraining order against them. Make sure your grandma is ready to see this through against her kids, as they will use an emotional appeal to get her to drop the charges.
