No it’s not a question of sovereignty. It’s cheap whataboutism. Don’t backtrack now. There is no question that is a violation of sovereignty to conduct a strike inside someone else’s borders. The issue is whether or not that violation is justified. In the case of going after the most wanted man on the planet, whose presence Pakistan has no good excuse for not knowing, that’s justified. In the case of a displaced ethnic group whose fighting to not be genocided, and who’s only crime is being near the Turkish border, that is NOT justified.
The strikes had targeted Qandil, Asos and Hakurk in Iraq and Kobani, Tal Rifat, Cizire and Derik in northern Syria, it said, adding that "so-called directors of the terrorist organisation were among those neutralised".
Al qaeda is a terrorist organization. We killed their leader whom Pakistan had no business harboring. Kurds are not terrorists. They are in their ancestral territory. This is nothing like Bin Laden. Take your bullshit elsewhere.
It’s cheap whataboutism. There is no question that is a violation of sovereignty to conduct a strike inside someone else’s borders. The issue is whether or not that violation is justified.
What is the question? Was their sovereignty violated in both cases? Who’s asking that question? Who is of the mind that nobody’s sovereignty was violated? Nobody. That’s why it’s obvious that your only goal is cheap whataboutism.
It was a rhetorical question with a statement. You tried to shoehorn an argument based on your sympathies. It’s irrelevant. Stop getting so hostile about it.
