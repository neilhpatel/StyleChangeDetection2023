The key bit may be the term “Classical” and, perhaps, the location. Academics of the post-classical period have recent publications about the cenote at Chichén Itzá, indicating that the people sacrificed came from a wide geographical area, Copan or western Honduras, “Copan or Tula of the Central Highlands in Mexico, just across the Yucatan Peninsula”.
This older, 2015, piece “A Brief Note on Human Sacrifice in Classical Mayan Culture” examines human sacrifice in the Classical period. Likewise this one, “Human Sacrificial Rites Among the Maya of Mayapán: A Bioarchaeological Perspective” looking at the post classical period.
The article is informative, but be aware that it’s not lacking on details of what the bones themselves relate.
Oh, the professor was focused on the Classical Era from 250AD to 900AD. She said that the supposed human sacrifice evidence for the classical period was a misunderstanding of the rules of war. That the supposed deaths were just executions not human sacrifices.
This makes me wonder how do you distinguish a sacrifice from an execution? There's a grey area where e.g. an ecclesiastic court sentencing a witch to burn could easily be seen as a sacrifice, yes?
