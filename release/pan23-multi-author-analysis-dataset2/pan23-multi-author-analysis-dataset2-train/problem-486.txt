Having something for over a decade implies it wasn't something you intended on getting back. The issue here is that if you litigate it, you have to prove it was just there for storage. How can you do that?
Thank you for your reply. Obviously I can't prove it was there for storage, but she has no way of proving it was a "gift". It was stored with the thought that it would increase in value, which was my husband's intention at the time.
Correct, but when we asked her to store it, the reason was it is quite large & we did not have the room in our new home. Location had no reason for the increase in value, the years that have passed has accounted for the increase in value. I appreciate your thoughts.
She doesn't have to prove that, though. It's been in her possession for 14 years. Nobody is going to make her justify why she has it in possession.
In other words, from a purely legal theory problem, if it was merely a gratuitous storage, you're right that you have title.
But the problem with that story is it defies common sense. That's a hell of a long time to offer gratuitous storage.
On the other hand, her story -- that it was a gift -- fits nicely with the events. So unless you have some sort of extrinsic evidence that it was NOT a gift, I'd say that any judge would find that it was a gift.
