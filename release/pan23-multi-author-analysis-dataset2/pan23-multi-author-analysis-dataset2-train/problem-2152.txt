Because we were physically okay, we both were conscious, standing, and able to communicate. They asked if anyone was seriously injured and unconscious which neither of us were. However, we were on the road to being seriously injured if we stayed out there any longer.
I don't know anything about the Canadian law on this topic, but it's hard to imagine that emergency services would be liable if you tell them you're fine.
I agree I should have been more clear about how critical it was but I was in shock, I had never even called 911 before in my life until then, and I just answered the questions they asked me as best I could. But the one thing I did make clear was that we were in an extremely dangerous situation.
/u/cowmandude made the point I was going to make. This seems like a problem in communication, what you said and what they probably understood (or were confused by). Had you told them, "our lives are at risk we need rescue immediately" or "this is a life or death emergency" then things might have gone differently. Agree with the other commenter about posting in the Canada sub, and glad you are OK now.
