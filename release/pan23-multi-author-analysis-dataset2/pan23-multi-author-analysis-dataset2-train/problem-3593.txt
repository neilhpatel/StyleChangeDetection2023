Sure, it was a smaller group compared to covid, but they still nonetheless refused and sued to keep from getting the shot.
Yes, because thats what the anti vax protests about - the mrna technology. (Nevermind that there are multiple shots that dont use mrna).
There are 17 mandatory vaccines in the military. Additionally the flu vaccine is administered annually. Outrage over these mandates coinciding with political rhetoric surrounding covid is plainly manufactured. Everyone sucked in by it should be embarrassed.
The army has dozens of mandatory vaccines, nobody bats an eye. But the second the orange turd and his clown car of sycophants start ranting about the covid mandate, all of a sudden the neckbeards are mobilised and come out of the woodworks.
Rempfer and fellow Guard pilot Lt. Col. Russ Dingle spearheaded efforts, including congressional testimony and lawsuits, to bring a halt to mandatory vaccinations until several major problems with the program could be fixed.
As for the other vaccines, those have been used for decades. Remind me again, which of those vaccines use mRNA tech. Exactly.
