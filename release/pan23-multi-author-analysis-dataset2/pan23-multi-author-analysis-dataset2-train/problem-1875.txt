look, I did more for Democracy than even George Washinon, way way more. we wouldn't even have a Country if it wasn't for Trump. you had the Radical Left trying to do a Coup and make Obama King For Life, which would send us Straight To Hell believe me, but then I came down that Golden Escalator, we had many many millions of people, hundreds of millions, all there for Trump. and don't forget I had bigger crowds on January 6th than even MLK, and it was a lot better looking if you know what I mean, a Million Patriots, there to stick up for their Favorite President. you know it doesn't ever get talked about by the Fake News, but there's never been a President who's been treated more unfairly than I have, even JFK. ok, no more questions, you're welcome.
