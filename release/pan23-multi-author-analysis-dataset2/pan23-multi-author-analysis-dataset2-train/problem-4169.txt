Sorry to get back to you so late but I noticed the effects within 2-3 days. Didn’t have any empty feelings like other medications had givin me. Going on 3 years.
This. I know not all meds work for everyone but Zoloft/Sertraline have been an absolute life changer for myself and several of my close friends struggling with anxiety. Whenever anyone asks me I always tell them to ask their gp if it’s right for them.
Me too. Took Lexapro years ago but it nothing for anxiety. My depression didn't cause anxiety. Anxiety caused depression. And Zoloft is much smoother too.

Okay so tmi, yes, this is a side effect. Probably half the time I have a hard time finishing. The trade off between an orgasm and a nonfunctional anxious mess is completely worth it. With the right person this becomes a non issue.
