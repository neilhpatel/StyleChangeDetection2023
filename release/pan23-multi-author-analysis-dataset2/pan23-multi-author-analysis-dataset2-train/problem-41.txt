Some truly believe they are fighting NATO forces, and the majority of Ukrainians didn't fight. So by that logic, “NATO will run out of ammunition” doesn't sound as crazy. What they don't realize is, for example, reports of Ukrainian army speaking foreign languages doesn't mean that they are fighting NATO troops. It means that a lot of Ukrainians know at very least English on top of Ukrainian+Russian(and that Russian soldiers have no clue how heavy Ukrainian accent sounds). Plus, the % of Ukr army which are foreign volunteers is pretty small. And EU countries aren't lying when they say that their army (except US observers, but that wasn't really a secret) isn't directly on the ground (projection of pathological liar as usual).
Also, for the folks unaware and all “war is terrible”: the russian war machine made the spectacularly sound decision to place live ammunitions right next to the bunker 😑.
Whether it’s laziness or sheer incompetence, moscow did more to kill all 450+ soldiers than Ukraine did.
They started this nonsense with lies, plowed ahead with no strategy, and are pwning themselves with stupid costly mistakes all over the place.
