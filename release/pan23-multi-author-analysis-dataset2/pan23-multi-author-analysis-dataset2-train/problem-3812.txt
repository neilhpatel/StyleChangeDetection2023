Baldwin has won fairly comfortably in her re-election bids but I don't think she's yet said if she'll run for another term. Tester OTOH is in real trouble as MT has lurched far to the right and AZ looks dicey if Sinema runs as an independent (even if she does poorly the elections in that state are so close it won't take much for it to flip to R.) Even if Dems somehow maintain their razor thin majority SCOTUS reform still won't happen. (If they lose control and a SCOTUS seat somehow opens then Democrats won't even be able to fill it if R's hold a majority.).
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
