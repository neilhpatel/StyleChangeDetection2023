Virginia is a one-party consent state, meaning you can audio record any conversation you're a part of.
You can't hide your phone in your pocket to surreptitiously record others' conversations that you're not a part of, though.
Video recording is likely legal as people have little, if any, expectation of privacy while at work (save for places like the bathroom, changing rooms, etc.). But if your video-taking is capturing audio of conversations between others, that could be legally problematic.
And just because something is legal to do at work doesn't mean your employer has to allow you to do it or allow you to keep your job.
It may be against your company's "policy" and could get you in trouble for recording and taking pictures while at work if they find out who went off and reported them.
I would suggest you do what you feel is needed but keep in mind the company could try to reprimand you (not in a legal sense) by firing you if your job is an "at will employer".
Oh, I'm fully expecting to be fired if they find out I did this. I am well past the point of caring. I just want to make sure I don't get in any legal trouble.
I fully expect to be fired of they find out I did this. That isn't an issue. I just want to make sure I don't get into any legal trouble. It is t a federal building, so looks like I might be safe!
