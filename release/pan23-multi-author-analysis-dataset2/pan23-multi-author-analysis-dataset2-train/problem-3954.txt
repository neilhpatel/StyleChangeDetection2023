Russia's entire strategy was based on attacking a weaker country and focusing on civilian casualties. Now they're upset that other civilized countries are helping Ukraine push back.
even worse, the west is just toying with Putin... goading him to send all of his troops to the meat grinder... send all of your tanks.
the arming of Ukraine hasn't been on a scale to decisively win the war, but rather just enough to seem winnable to Russia.
by the end, they will have gained no territory, but their losses will be enormous. they will be 2-3 generations behind the west in technology and economic development.
Tons of rogue states have nukes and there are others that could develop them if they wanted to, what’s stopping any of them from nuking the planet? Since we’re still here, it seems sanity always wins out, even during the Cold War when all sides literally had trembling fingers constantly on the button it didn’t happen.
Putin will be considered one of history's most foolish leaders... one that doubled down again and again while everyone knew the cards he was holding.
i think it wouldn't be defensible to say that if russia stopped the war now and spent the next 75 years trying to catch up, they couldn't.
From a humanitarian point of view this is much worse of course. But for an end to Russia, the state collapsing in on itself would do far more damage than just being pushed to their borders. Though perhaps these are not exclusive to one another.
Good take. I have wondered that if you really wanted to see Russia crumble, the answer is not to defeat them quickly, but to have them engaged in fighting "forever".
I just can't see a worse outcome for Russia than a prolonged war, massive casualties, and an ultimate loss.
