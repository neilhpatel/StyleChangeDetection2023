We called the insurance company since we have used them in the past for instances very similar to this, and they have covered all fees while providing us with transportation and a tow, all within an hour. So this was very much an outlier. I used the service in the past, and it was fantastic, not sure what happened this time. The reason we called the insurance as well, is because we didn’t have enough money on us to pay a tow company, we still needed a ride home, and my parents don’t have a credit card (they are against credit cards for some reason). So we needed the insurance to provide us with a tow, and a ride, which they had done in the past quite well when a similar situation happened with me about 2 or 3 years ago.
Not being rude but if my car breaks down and I have my elderly parents with me I would just Google the nearest towing service and submit the receipt to the insurance company for reimbursement. You went an absurd route by calling an insurance company who messed things up again and again.
Sorry to say you have no legal recourse but you can give an attorney $2500 to open a case and see if they can do anything. I’ve studied law and your case would go nowhere in my opinion.
