Regarding the issues raised about recruitment, housing, and veteran care, it is important to acknowledge that these are complex and multifaceted issues that require attention and action. However, it is inaccurate to suggest that the CAF is not investing in its members or that it is neglecting its veterans. The CAF has implemented a range of measures to address these issues, including increased funding for housing and benefits for veterans, and efforts to improve recruitment and retention. Canada has faced challenges in recruiting for the military for several reasons. One of the primary factors is the strong economy, which provides many other job opportunities for young people. Another reason is that many Canadians may not be aware of the benefits of a military career, or may have misconceptions about the nature of military service.
Giving any credence to China's claim is the same as saying, "Well, I guess North Korea claims to be best Korea, so it could be true!" All I'm saying is you're "both sides"ing an issue that does not have two reasonable sides. This isn't an issue where reasonable people can disagree, and we shouldn't pretend like it is out of some misguided sense of "fairness".
