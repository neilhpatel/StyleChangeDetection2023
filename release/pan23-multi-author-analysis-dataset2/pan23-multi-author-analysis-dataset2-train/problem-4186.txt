Do you have any proof of the sale? Did you write/get a receipt? Screenshots of the convo about agreeing to price and date to meet up. Emails of the transaction?
I would contact the Department of Transportation of the state that issued the plate. They are not going to be able to resolve your ez pass issue but they can mark the plate dead.
Compile and backup all of these and then contact the DMV in the state the license plate was from and advise the vehicle has been sold and the tag was never returned/forfeited.
When you contact the TOLL be sure to let them know you have already contacted the DMV of the issuing state and that you have proof you are no longer the owner of the vehicle as of X date and you have proof of sale.
In my state you can cancel your license plate over the website with you personal information. I might be hesitant about reporting it as a stolen plate. Last time I did it, I just select "Car Sold to New Owner" and it didn't ask me any more info.
In many areas you are supposed to notify the motor vehicle dept when a car is sold. This absolves you of any tickets or fines racked up on the car (as well as liability if the new driver causes an accident). There's probably a form online, you can fill out. You might call them if you can get through to anyone and see if they can help you get rid of these tolls.
