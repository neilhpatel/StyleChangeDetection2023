She doesn't get to decide if charges are filed against someone and police/prosecutors need actual evidence to pursue charges.
you are legally allowed to refuse to talk to the police. Say you do not want to. If he gets a lawyer you can cooperate with his lawyer. If you do not talk, I do not think there is a case.
He could. The prosecutor/police would need to prove that you've had sex with him. Whether a prosecutor would actually pick up this particular case is anyone's guess.
It's one thing to be technically illegal, it is another thing to be prosecuted. The police have a limited amount of resources, and they likely aren't going for a 17-18 year old relationship where the 17 year old isn't cooperating and refusing to testify. This is mainly just a scare tactic. I'd be more worried about losing your relationship with your parents.
i'm worried about losing my future. i want to be free and not worry about someone breathing down my neck. i don't talk to my dad. anyways, my mom is embarrassing me a lot and telling me that everyone in my neighborhood now knows me as that girl who snuck her boyfriend in at night. maybe what you're saying about it being a scare tactic is true. she told me that the fact she had to stand there in the middle of the night and cuss him out made her so embarrassed. truthfully, it got to me. i don't want to go outside lol.
thank you. my problem is that there's no way to prove either side- no way to prove we did have sex and no way to prove we didn't have sex. my mom just thinks that since we were in a relationship, we were having sex. could she really be charged with that? she's filing a report, but couldn't she say she was doing all of this because she had reasonable suspicion?
