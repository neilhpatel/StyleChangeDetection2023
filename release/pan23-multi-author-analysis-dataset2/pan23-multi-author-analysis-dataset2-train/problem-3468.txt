NAL but spent a lot of my time hanging out in tattoo parlors in California. You won't need it to be notarized. Every artist I know has them sign the form, scans a copy of their ID, and files them away together. What I would recommend is having a lawyer go over the consent form to make sure everything is good to go.
Notarization has no magical powers, and it does not determine whether a document is legally binding or not. The contents of the document do, as well as the individual circumstances under which the document is executed. If your consent form wasn't drafted by an attorney, there is an excellent chance that with or without notarization, it is not binding.
All notarization does is verify that the person purporting to sign the document is indeed the person who signed it. Unless that is an issue in a particular case, notarization is irrelevant. There is no statutory requirement that a consent form for a tattoo be notarized.
With very few exceptions, documents do not need to be notarized or witnessed (some things such as wills or marriages are an exception) to have legal effect. There are various laws that require contracts to be in writing in certain cases, but almost never is notarization required.
Thanks so much üôè so what makes a contract/consent form legally binding? Can anyone just write out their own contract and have it be legally binding as is?
That's a more complicated question. The basic elements of a contract are that both parties are competent and mutually agree to it, validly accept it (such as by signing the same paper), and there is consideration for both parties. But a contract can be held unenforceable if it is illegal or violates public policies set by legislation or precedent. Certain parts of contracts, ex. those pertaining to interest rates, have specific regulations. Other parts such as waivers of the right to sue, right to jury trial, hold harmless clauses, etc. can be very tricky and in certain cases almost impossible to make valid.
