Ok we may be working with something now. Have you spoken to dealership about these issues? On the retail installment contract did you sign an arbitration agreement?
Unless they have you a warranty the car is an as is sale. Meaning you agree to accept delivery as is. Unfortunately nyyou should really have gotten it inspected before the sale, not after.
So we did speak about the dealer after finding out about the major oil leaks, and they refused the return due the the “as is” warranty my dad had signed.
Very true - private sale would be fully SOL but from a dealership there is the Missouri Consumer Protection Act if the OP really wants to try to pursue something.
[t]he act, use or employment by any person of any deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, unfair practice or the concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise in trade or commerce or the solicitation of any funds for any charitable purpose ... in or from the state of Missouri.
