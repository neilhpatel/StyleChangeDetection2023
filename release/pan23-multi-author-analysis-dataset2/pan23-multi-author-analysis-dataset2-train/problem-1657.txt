Your car is almost certainly worth considerably less than the labor and parts required to restore it. There are people in your area trying to sell relatively similar cars that are also two decades old, and you should be compensated enough to purchase and register one of them.
Your insurer may be willing to let you keep the vehicle and still reimburse you the difference between its pre- and post-collision values, but then the extra costs of repair will be on you. I do not recommend this; it is not clear how much even restoring it to running and road-legal order will cost you.
You should plan for it to be totaled. The maximum amount you will be owed for the car is its objective value prior to the wreck.
You can still request to keep the car when it's totaled, but you will get less money, because the objective value includes what it would go for as scrap.
You will get a salvage title in that case, and then a rebuilt salvage title when it passes inspection.
Depending on the amount they offer, this will end the same. His insurance will defend him, and depending on what they pay out, your car will be totaled.
It doesn't sound it's clear cut the other driver was at fault. But lets put that aside, if he's responsible he owes you the book value. You can go for a salvage title and put the money towards repairing the car. If that goes beyond the book value, that's your choice. Book value on that will be practically nothing, so keep that in mind if this happens again.
