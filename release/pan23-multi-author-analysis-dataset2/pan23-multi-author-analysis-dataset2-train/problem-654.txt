Agreed. I was prior enlisted myself and have been to my fair share of promotion ceremonies, both enlisted and officer and my experience is similar, none have actually lasted longer than an hour or so. Hers is a junior officer promotion and with COVID, not sure how they’re going to do that. Not familiar with Covid era policies and ceremonies.
Primary residential parent doesn’t mean the other parent has no custody - read the whole agreement. Who has educational decision making authority? If it’s not specifically stated that she does, then by operation of law, you both as the parents have decision making authority.

You will have a strong argument, as this will be detrimental to their education, however this may sour your relationship with your ex.
She was scheduled for NTC and then a deployment, but the deployment got pushed back and then eventually cancelled. We had agreed to keep the kids in school out here with me for the rest of the year as changing schools is stressful and should be done as little as possible. I think this is just her way of getting them back early from me.
