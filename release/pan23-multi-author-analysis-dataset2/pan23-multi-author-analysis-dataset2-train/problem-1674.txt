If tow away signs were posted at the entrance to the complex that’s within the law. I’d be more concerned about being towed from visitor parking if you were clearly parked there. Don’t know what you mean by “request a hearing”. You could pay the costs to get your car out of impound and sue in small claims court to get your money back for the improper tow. Focusing on the signs more than being towed from visiting parking leads me to believe there is more to the story.
The Texas Occupations Code states that the operator/owner of the vehicle is entitled to a hearing on whether probable cause existed for the removal of the vehicle. I'm trying to figure out if there was probable cause for the tow company to tow my car.
The way the facility is set up is that you enter through the front gates and park in the designated visitor parking section. It's then up to the person you are visiting to "register" your car. We did this, but the towing company is saying we didn't register the car until 9:58 PM and they towed it at 9:45 PM.
What time did you register the car? Do you have a receipt or some other proof that you registered the prior to 9:45. Looking online it looks like you’re entitled to a hearing simply because you had your car towed. If you feel that the tow was improper request a hearing, take your evidence with you to court and let the court decide if it was proper or not. Reddit won’t be able to tell you what the court will decide, especially because you keep leaving out details.
