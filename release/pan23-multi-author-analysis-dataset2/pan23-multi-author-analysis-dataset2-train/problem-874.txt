If your mom does not want him there and your sister keeps inviting him over, then she can evict your sister for not obeying her wishes.
My sister is an adult but this man threatened and pushed my mom so I don't feel comfortable with someone like him here, we pay rent but my sister signed the papers even though it was supposed to be my mom since she pays most of the rent and bills while my sister doesn't.
My sister is a adult but she doesn't have any evidence on me of me threatening her or her boyfriend while I have pictures of my bruises and scratches of the time he fought me at my house and I also have vids of her pushing me and threatening my mom.
For the trespassing thing it depends if your sister is a minor and also depends on the terms of your lease.
Your adult sister can invite anyone over she chooses. Absent a lease the property owner or persons he subleases from can give her proper notice to end her tenancy than file for eviction.
In addition, you may also report your sister to the police for assault and threats and use the videos as evidence.
