You can put anything in a will but itâ€™s still illegal to mutilate a corpse in most states. No reputable mortuary or mortician would agree to what your friend is proposing.
Doesn't your friend understand any piece of them can be used in DNA testing to determine sex at the time at birth? So if that is a real concern for them, cremation is the only way.
It didn't occur to me to bring this up but now I will. Really I know the only way they are going to get what they want is cremation, I just need to come at them with more than my own speculation before they will listen.
There are two posts on here that your friend needs to pay attention to. First off, the bone crushing. I'm assuming they are referring to both the pelvis area (most commonly used to determine sex) and the skull/neck area (one can be used to measure to determine sex and one has a bone that is more pronounced in males).
The above poster was correct that any reputable funeral home will refuse to crush just those sections because its considered mutilating a corpse.
Has your friend realized that any bone in their body can be used not only for DNA collection to determine sex but even bones not mentioned above can be used to determine sex?
Forensic scientists have used long bones (think like your femur) as well as tarsal bones (the bones in your feet) to also determine sex.
