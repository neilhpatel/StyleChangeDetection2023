Previously the department of the Interior had considered a lease but canceled it due to "lack of commercial interest.".
Wait, haven't people been saying that the price of gas is because they can't drill? But only one company bid on these rights?
However the inflation reduction act REQUIRED the government to hold a lease sale as part of the argain with Joe manchin.
I imagine there’s less than a 0% chance any of that shit gets drilled for oil/gas for those environmental reasons.
However (2x) the lease is contingent on the results of a lawsuit by environmental groups arguing the legally required environmental impact statement failed to adequately consider whether gas drilling would impact whales. Which probably affected the price.
I feel like there's some funny business going on... I was told that Biden fucked the gas industry by pulling permits and now they can't drill....
$63k is basically like nothing so this was probably done just so they can say they added 5000 acres of drilling rights for Pennie’s in their quarterly reports, which prob makes them more than the $63k they spent.
