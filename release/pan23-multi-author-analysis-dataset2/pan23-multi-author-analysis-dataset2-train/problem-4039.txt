The measure put up right before hand, which calls for Congress to pass legislation banning dark money and for the DNC to "fight for solutions" passed no problem.
Neither the DNC nor any campaign can accept dark money by federal law. That's not what dark money is. Dark money is money spent by non-profit, technically non-political groups independently of any campaign.
This is what they're refusing to vote on: "Be it further resolved that the Democratic National Committee reaffirms its support for banning corporate PACs from donating to candidates, and barring lobbyists from donating or fundraising for anyone they lobby".
I don't think you have been paying too much attention, the old ranks of Republican control has been lost...their "far-Right" already control the party.
Nope, that's the one that passed! You can see resolutions 18 and 19 in . Resolution 18, which contains that text, passed. Resolution 19 is the meaningless one that attempts have the "DNC ban the use of 'dark money' funding during any and all Democratic primary elections.".
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
