If he was charged with 120 counts, the odds are high that the actual number of images found was much, much higher than that- it would be very rare to charge every single image found.
If each charge carries a punishment of 1 year in prison, then the sentences could be set to run "consecutively" which means that he'd serve them one after the other and be in prison for 120 years.
Or they could be set to run "concurrently" so that he's serving them all at the same time so he's only in jail for one year.
I think you reversed your terms in your example. Concurrent means at the same time, so 120 1-year sentences running concurrently means 1 year in prison.
Another question, will we have to wait until sentencing to find out if it'll be concurrently or consecutively? It seems like a big difference to me. His parents have a lot of hope that he'll get off with something like 30 days in jail, but that looks very unlikely to me.
An outcome like that would likely depend on some sort of plea agreement. Perhaps one wherein he agrees to treatment and certain conditions of his not being fully convicted and sentenced on the entirety of his offense.
Certainly those outcomes sometime occur. It is difficult to predict when they are more or less likely. That turns on all kinds of details like his life outside of this offense, to some extent on the nature of the images, and to some extent the mood of the judge and even the presentation and affect of the defendant.
Sorry if these questions are dumb, I'm just trying to gather some info to tell his family because they're quite distraught over his arrest.
What exactly would a plea agreement entail? I'm not sure if it's relevant, but he's already given the DCI a confession and they apparently have loads of proof.
His family needs to listen to his lawyer about what can happen here and how to get there. We can't guess whether a plea is available here or what that might look like.
