I grew up in Johnson County. 42 years ago, a young man could pick up a ball and run it for anywhere up to 100 yards real good. For some reason, this spectacle made him a hometown hero. And that's all football is, spectacle. Any skill, talent, physical ability is subservient to the spectacle. Those warm feelings of triumph and heroism that made the author idolize young, college running back Herschel Walker are grounded in nothing more than the sight of men fighting other men in ritualized combat in protective gear making people excited, and that excitement can carry through voices on a radio.
The same way these people - who never gave a shit about covid or masks or anything but were right there the second any Democrat wasn’t wearing a mask - we need to hold them accountable the same way when they’re not staying true to their morals of racism, sexism, religious fanaticism and so on. Voting for a black man who sleeps with & beats (white) women definitely isn’t a value the rabid right is supposed to have.
And that's all one of our two parties want to run on today. Feelings and spectacle. They want to feel anger, because if someone says the Not Us team are trafficking children in furniture boxes, well, they're not us and therefore evil, so it feels right, doesn't it? When a president gets on a podium and mocks a political opponent like a second grader, the shocked and angered reaction by Not Us is the same spectacle as watching one big dude barrel through two other big dudes, not drop a ball, and keep running.
The article doesn't make sense, because the author is just feeling and not thinking, and now sort of confused that he doesn't know what to think about his feelings. Because he's out of practice.
