Damages would cover the cost of my flight home,the court costs I’ve had to pay myself already,the costs incurred by me having to sort my own birth certificate and the cost of changing my name(they changed my name to what was on my birth certificate when I was aged 4 so all my schooling and qualifications were in a made up name that was never legally mine,the cost of travel to and from and including both dna tests that I had to have to prove he’s my father to then claim citizenship and the cost of applying for my citizenship as it would have been free had they actually done it as per U.K. Law.so far I’ve had to pay £100s to solicitors and courts out of my own pocket.My dad has cash,owns loads of houses,just prefers to spend it on his wife and holidays instead of his granchild.
Thankyouthat’s the first piece of helpful advice I’ve had,here in the U.K. it is law,so technically could sue(if he had have been british)I was kinda hoping others had been thru the same tho x.
The Federal Benefits Unit of your local consulate can help you get a social security card after your passport is issued.
Also, if you are male and under 26, you'll need to register for Selective Service. (Failing to do so can have all sorts of annoying follow-on consequences, like ineligibility for federal education assistance, and being unable to obtain Federal employment.).
Register with whom? If you are referring to registering the birth with the US, it is not mandatory for parents to file a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.
