Except, it's perfectly legal to buy a firearm as a gift. It says so right on the Form 4473 that you fill out. You answer yes, as you "are" the "actual purchaser" of the firearm, and are not acting as an agent for someone else (straw purchase). It is legal for OP's relative, or even someone they don't know, to buy the gun as a bona fide gift, with no expectation of payment in return.
Any interstate transfer of a handgun needs to go through a ffl. It needs to be shipped to NC and you do the paperwork there.
So what you're saying is, I need a 21+ relative or friend to "buy" the handgun from my relative in Virginia, in which case I could obtain a PPP and buy the firearm from the 21+ person?
If I'm not mistaken, and I very well may be, it would only be a straw purchase if I am not allowed to possess a handgun at all, or if I was a convicted criminal attempting to purchase a firearm. Neither of these apply to me.
I have more to add to this problem of mine. The firearm was owned by my late great uncle. He passed about two months ago, and the firearm in question was owned by him. What additional legal hurdles does that create?
