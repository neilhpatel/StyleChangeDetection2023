As an account holder, he is legally authorized to move money in and out of that account. You may be able to pursue him civilly for the money, but it is highly unlikely that he'd be criminally liable.
Your brother should close this account and open a brand new account at an entirely different bank where dad does not bank. Different branch of same bank is no good.
Banker dude here. If your father is an account holder, then it was not a fraudulent transfer. Any signer on the account has equal legal access to funds in the account, and can perform transactions on the account (assuming you are in the US, you don't specify).
If you do not want him to be on the account, then your brother is going to have to contact the bank to either remove the other signer, or open a new account where your father is not a signer on the account.
It is very unlikely that the bank will reverse the transaction on the account, since they were done legally. Any resolution to this about retrieving the funds will have to be outside the bank, such as obtaining the funds back from your father directly.
