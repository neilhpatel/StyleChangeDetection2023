Yes, he can sue you in the sense that almost anyone can sue almost anyone else for almost anything. It's the merit (or lack of merit) of any lawsuit that really matters. Unless you're disseminating demonstrably false information, generally, you're welcome to speak the truth and your honest opinion in the sense that, while that's not going to stop someone from suing you, it might be a great defense in court.
Yeah I spoke to my therapist at lenh about whether it was responsible to post online. I am severely concerned cause his audience is primarily female and I have witnessed him being predatory towards women. I felt I needed to do/say something cause I have a feeling my case won’t be picked up due to not having physical evidence this happened.
What exactly do you mean by "speaking out?" Do you mean posting about it online for the world to see? And if so, are you sure that's what your therapist meant?
There's really no way to continue posting online like this without that risk. If your therapist recommends talking this out in order to help you through it, is that not something that can be done with that therapist?
Maybe I need to rephrase my post but I suppose I was more wondering if he can really win any sort of lawsuit if he can’t prove it didn’t happen? Idk if I’m explaining it right...
I do realize that there’s a risk of that. I have had a significant amount of anxiety when it comes to this situation because I feel that I’m now responsible for what he does to other women because I didn’t say anything or try to warn people. So she had suggested to ease my mind a little to actually say something. I am normally extremely private online and my name isn’t actually connected to any of my social media accounts. And since ending the relationship (before I even said anything) he was sending people to come harass and bully me. Why? I have no idea cause again I hadn’t even spoken about what he had done yet.
