Did you provide an emissions test certificate ? It's my understanding that even private sellers in Colorado have to if the buyer lives in an emissions-test area (like Denver).
That's my principal concern. Your only obligations as a private seller are the odometer disclosure and not making specific, written, false statements about material defects.
If the buyer contacts you in any way except by serving a small claims summons, tell them to refer to the "as-is" agreement in the bill of sale, and do not offer to refund any money, perform any repairs, or provide any advice.
If they do serve you with a summons and complaint, collect the bill of sale, the advertisements (print them out, with at least two copies) and maintenance records, and that bill of sale.

Thank you for the response, as I feel much better if things do get escalated - being freshly 18, the thought of being sued was scary. Forgot to mention it originally, but yes I did provide a passing emissions report. My other issue is that he is the only one with the signed bill of sale (forgot to bring a second copy for myself but thought it would be fine since I did not foresee any issues to come of this). For the moment, I will start gathering all the records of maintenance and inspections and find the pictures of the advertisements. Thank you for your time!
