On top of that the conservative narrative is so toxic even the mainstream media treats their more "reasonable" sounding arguments ( that are still total BS ) like the whole sports debate as if it has some kind of actual scientific merit. Nowhere in here are families, doctors, mental health professionals, or medical researchers actually being represented fairly. It's a purely political debate, just like climate change or vaccines, there is no actual controversy. The only controversy is people getting upset about people existing who they don't like.
It honestly blows my mind how offended people get over absolutely nothing that has to do with them.. at all.
