I used to work for a company that made safety instrumentation for oil and gas, ie pressure, temperature, flow, and level sensors. Most of which are used around the world in refineries and transportation systems like pipelines and terminals. Most of these refineries are automated so having working sensors is extremely important in the safety feedback loop.
We were shown a video at work of a refinery exploding in Mexico that killed 12 or so people because they had defective sensors that didn't alert the control crew of a problem.
Also the refining process is especially volatile, using insane pressures and pretty nasty chemicals that are both caustic and explosive if they mix in or or subject to different atmospheres.
It's essentially a fuel-air bomb. The initial blast aerosolized flammable fuel, which mixed with air, then found another ignition source. Because the material is evenly mixed over a large area, the pressure front stays strong for a lot longer.
Thermal instability is an issue for certain pyrophoric (sulfur compounds) and unstable (e.g. Acetylene, butadiene, propadiene) materials but generally if you have significant loss of containment, the fuel-air mixture will eventually find an ignition source.
