I appreciate what your saying. But as much as she says she’s done with them I don’t think she can just leave them like that. They don’t live in an area where they can walk to a bus stop or walk in to town to get food.
If your friend is not ready, emotionally, to leave, then she does not have to. I would encourage you to encourage her to find a therapist or counsellor to talk to about her mental health and making changes for herself.
A manipulator is not going to stop taking advantage of someone when presented with options. So if she is wanting to find something that allows her to leave with her parents' blessing, she won't. They will continue to demand that she continue on doing the same things she has been doing and refuse to change or accept any alternatives.
Legally, she can move out and cease supporting them. To fully cover her ass, she should give them one months notice, in writing, that she is moving out (she does not have to stay, just pay one last month's rent), but she has no legal obligation to live with and support them.
