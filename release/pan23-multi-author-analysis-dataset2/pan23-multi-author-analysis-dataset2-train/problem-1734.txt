And I wouldn't be shocked if they supply them with drugs before combat, the way they do with child soldiers in Africa. These guys are all disposable mercenaries and Russia wants them fighting like berserkers because the only thing they've got going for them at this point is sowing terror. Plus they've had issues with their own troops cutting and running away from combat, so drugging up the mercenary forces made of convicts and mental patients will go a long way towards making sure they fight and do it in a way that could demoralize the enemy.
Have you seen the prisoner of war the Ukrainians have that was in the Russian army for the original invasion, sued the state for sending him to war, got kicked out of the army with a dishonorable discharge and then was conscripted straight back up again?
Yeah, that reminds me of that story when the US bombed Wagner troops in Syria (?) because the Russian government denied any official presence in the area. It had something to do with a river. Gotta see if I can find it.
