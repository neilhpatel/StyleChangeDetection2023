If the opinion editorial itself were particularly well-supported, it might be okay, but this one uses weasel words in the paragraph that makes the claim you cite (saying "economists warned" and "economists said" without citing the specific economists). The only real source explicitly mentioned is the ProPublica report, which only indirectly supports your claim.
Also it's funny how the GOP has been harping on about inflation over the past 2 years, and one of the first bills that the GOP House writes would make inflation worse.
There's evidence that the Trump tax-breaks-for-the-rich bill on inflation, so this bill would be like giving your fetal-alcohol-addled teenager free access to alcohol, drugs and guns.
I agree that Trump was terrible for the economy, and that the bill you mention probably did exacerbate the current inflation crisis, but your link doesn't really support your claim. It's not great practice to cite an opinion editorial to back up your point.
Again, I wouldn't really care to be so pedantic if I didn't agree that you're probably right. I just don't like seeing good points made improperly, especially when we have enough fact on our side.
Nah, they'll start talking about inflation again when CPI consistently drops over the year as the market is correcting/higher interest rates. They will then claim "victory" over inflation dropping... even though their role will be non-existent in this drop in CPI.
