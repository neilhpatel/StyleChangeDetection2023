I really don't have any issue with who he brings around my daughter. He's a good dad. I'm worried that my parents don't respect boundaries and will try to force their way into my daughter's life. I've cut them off. My ex isn't close to them and he hadn't, so I worry that they will see any lapse in communication as a sign to intrude.
I guess my goal is the prevention of them harassing us again. Honestly, I just had a breakdown because my cousin won't stop calling me and I'm afraid that if I don't respond, they'll get to my daughter using her dad. They've already threatened to file a missing persons report when I stopped talking to them last time.
These people are very physically and emotionally abusive. They've been this way to me, my siblings, and my nieces and nephews and I don't want them near my daughter. Moving halfway across the country doesn't seem to be enough of a gap between us.
It's not something I want to deal with if I can avoid it, but it's been pointed out to me that this is something I can't avoid.
You can prevent your family from seeing the child while they're in your custody, but not while they're in his. Unless there's more to the situation at present, you have no grounds for a protective order in the US.
