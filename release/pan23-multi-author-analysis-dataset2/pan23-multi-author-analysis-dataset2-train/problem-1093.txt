Gaza is controlled by a terrorist organization and the west bank is controlled by a dictator and would also be controlled by a terrorist organization if only elections were allowed.
Seems to me since most of the persecution against Jews happened in Europe, land should have been taken from Europeans to create the country of Israel. European persecution and Zionism created most of this problem.
As an Arab, I'll be the first to admit that we didn't treat the Jews properly either, especially Sephardic Jews, so some kind of compensation should exist. But the British and Ottoman governments were pretty braindead to allow foreign Zionist organizations to invest and buy out whole swaths of land in ethnically Arab territory. Like, you're just begging for decades of ethnic tensions and instability for a quick buck.
The pope calling for justice and peace is like PETA declaring they are upset and offended. Even when they are in the right it's utterly undermined by their track record both past and very much present.
