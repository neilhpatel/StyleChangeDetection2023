Your boyfriend's father is not obligated to keep his adult son on insurance, or to give him a reasonable deal on an extra car he does not use. He is not obligated to let him use this vehicle at any time. Your boyfriend should try to stay with a friend or otherwise find alternate housing until he can get his own place. He should not stay somewhere that is damaging to his mental health and where he is abused. He is not responsible for his mother's finances and any repercussions his leaving may cause her. His mother is an adult and responsible for her own well being. She should be protecting her son, not the other way around.
it says it right there in the last bit i wrote lol. “his dad is an abusive asshole”, meaning he’s physically abusive. if he moves out he doesn’t get the car, he can’t get to his job, he can’t save money to move out of his moms if he goes there seeing as the only place he could go, and he won’t be able to afford college. uber isn’t really an option either seeing as how expensive it is and his job is 30 mins away.
