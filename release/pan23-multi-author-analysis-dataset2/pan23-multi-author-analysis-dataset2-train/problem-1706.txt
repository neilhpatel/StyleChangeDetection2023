I doubt it comes to that, though. The regime would likely implode or go nuclear if UA got even a few hundred miles in.
It’s highly doubtful any international equipment will actually be entering Russia though, it’s probable the aid could cease & its a chance Ukraine just couldn’t take. It’s all been described as defensive, not offensive. They’d definitely be free to use domestically manufactured or sourced equipment though in any invasion.
Some reddit talking heads are saying that this new round of vehicles from France and the US is great because of high power, high speed, easy repair, and medium protection.
its a heavily armed light tank with minimum amour but a big gun, and its on 6x6 wheels so it can go really fast and really far without refueling........if used correctly it could inflict a lot of damage on enemy rear areas and as firepower supplement to Ukrainian scout units. However it definitely should not be seen as a ''tank'' or a equal to a tank, its a light wheeled vehicle meant for scouting missions.
