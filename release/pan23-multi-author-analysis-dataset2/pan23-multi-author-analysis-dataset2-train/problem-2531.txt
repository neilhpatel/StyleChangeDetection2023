Secondly, there is a famous Moltke "quote": 'two armed mobs chasing each other around the country, from which nothing could be learned.' Which nobody can affirm that he actually said and provide a time and context for his remark. It's also in my opinion, highly out of character for Moltke (at least the Elder). Moltke was a highly intellectually curious professional, a student of history who cut his teeth serving in the Ottoman empire and learned a great deal from obsolete campaigns and armies. Moltke also learned a lot from studying, and taking part in, the civilian use of railroads. He didn't put the Prussian army at the peak of military innovation by ignoring everything outside of the Prussian army and scoffing at others, he was famous for leading the General Staff to compile as much information as possible. His political opponents in the Prussian army were exactly the kind of people who might have made such a sneering quote, but Moltke wasn't that kind of officer.
