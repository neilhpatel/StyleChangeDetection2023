With 6 conservative Supremes (1 apparently willing to rubberstamp anything that any wacko presents), and coming off of a re-election campaign, I'm guessing Abbott figures now is as good as any to send in a Christmas list to Santa SCOTUS.
Just in time to get a pre-POTUS-election win for Republicans if SCOTUS upholds it, or a win for Republican nationalist fear-mongering propaganda if SCOTUS does not.
>No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.
Election Denying was meant to be 2022's winning issue and it turned out to be a bellyflop, so the Republicans need a new issue to circle the wagons around, and it's going to be immigration morphing into Replacement Theory i.e. "a victory for workers.".
My guess is Abbott is getting out ahead of the major talking point/rage point for the GOP in 2023-2024: Replacement Theory.
in 2020-2021, Republicans created Critical Race Theory as an election rage point, and DeSantis and Youngkin used CRT effectively to fear voters. Youngkin won on it, and DeSantis used CRT to ram through some useless legislation that he ended up campaigning on as a "victory for parents.".
