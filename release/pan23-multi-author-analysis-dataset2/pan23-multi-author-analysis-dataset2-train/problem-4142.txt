> Ukrainian officials say that they almost never launch HIMARS rounds without detailed coordinates provided by U.S. military personnel situated elsewhere in Europe.
"United States intelligence has been providing Ukraine with unprecedented intelligence assistance since the beginning of Russiaâ€™s invasion.".
WTF makes that news though? We knew almost a year ago that Ukraine was getting detailed NATO intel, in particular US sats, and uses it for targeting. Here, an example.
Just go home. Death is the natural consequence of war. Diplomacy has proven ineffective and Russians ought to face the reality of their situation. The longer they remain on Ukrainian soil, the more people from both sides will die. Ukraine does not want to be part of Russia.
If you cannot handle logistics 50 miles from your border, you should not invade your neighbor. Russia isn't the big deal they think they are. No amount of wishful thinking will replace forklifts, containerization, training, economic diversification, or precision guided munitions.
Long term, this war will probably render Russia ever more irrelevant, reliant on China (and Iran of all places) for military and technological resources, India and Central Asia for markets that will favor the importers of Russian raw materials more than the exporters in Russia.
In the cold calculus of international affairs, the war has frankly been great for everyone but Russia and Ukraine. The EU. US. India. China. They're all going to walk out of this conflict having gained a lot. Ukraine frankly, probably just gets to live without losing as much as it could have.
Russia's already flagging population is now going to be straddled with young men maimed for life and its political system might well collapse if this goes the same way the Soviet War in Afghanistan did.
