Kansas requires landlords to mitigate damages, which means that they can continue charging rent in line with your lease but they must make a reasonable effort to re-rent to another qualified applicant. They can't just continue collecting rent for the rest of the lease term without some justifying circumstances, like a lack of qualified people to rent to.
NAL in Kansas, but my understanding is that nearly every state has a doctrine of mitigation of damages. In a nutshell, if the landlord doesn't the reasonable efforts to rent out your old place, it's a defense if they try to sue you for unpaid rent. Talk to a lawyer in your state for more information and the best way to proceed.
