The microphone is in a separate area of the store in which dosing information and ailment-specific treatments are discussed. There is definitely a reasonable expectation of privacy.
So, considering that this information isnâ€™t freely divulged to employees, would the dispensary be violating any laws in keeping the microphone enabled?
I think there would be such an expectation given that it is medical related but I suppose it depends on the set up of the dispensary. Like I could see it not being an issue if it only recorded a separated lobby but if it is picking up on people asking for like dosage advice for their ailment it certainly seems like they should have an expectation of privacy.
If I had to guess, I would lean towards this likely not being as serious of a case as you think and one that should be dealt with internally rather than legally, unless absolutely necessary. Going the legal route will definitely cost you your job, and it will be hard to prove that they're listening in on or storing audio recordings of patients (especially as dispensaries are more like pharmacies than doctor's offices).
