Because There’s also no guarantee Russia won’t fuck around and shut it off again. But getting gas from any countries in Qatar part of the world is nice and cool on the world stage. Human rights be damned. It’s also probably cheaper.
Considering we have to decarbonize our entire society by 90% in the next decade to avoid catastrophe, why don't they just not get it at all?
Yes, yes, I know - the idea that we might not devastate our biosphere and all our hopes for the future is laughable. I just keep hoping it won't happen, but....
So much for the virtue signaling of the German team. Hope they close their eyes next match to what their home country does: Buying oil from violators of human rights.
Lol this guy posting from a phone that never touched free hands before his, wondering why Germany is buying oil from Qatar lol.
Geopolitically, Qatar has far less ability or desire to destabilize Germany than Russia. Qatar isn't waging war on a nominal ally. Qatar also hasn't shut off Germany's fuel supply in the last year.
Less of the amount it is the blunt hypocrisy that when interests are placed on the table, the west is willing to throw away their morals (considering germany was on front runner in condemning Qatar) and what they kept pushing for on those countries. Similarly to what USA still dealing with KSA and how they continue to let them do what they want.
