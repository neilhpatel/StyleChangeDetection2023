I'd reach back out to that attorney and determine what was actually done (I suspect it may have been done through the state and not an actual lawsuit in court) and then ask for advice on next steps.
So, we didn’t know what to do when he didn’t get paid (we did try to resolve by talking to former employer first), so called a lawyer for a consultation and went from there. There may have been a wage claim involved, I know lawyer filed several things, but the whole thing was eventually resolved through settlement. I’ll try to get the exact details from spouse, sorry. Spouse was a salaried employee, W2. We didn’t travel. It was all done from our state since spouse was considered an Oregon worker.
Your bank is doing everything correctly. Federal law requires them to make the funds available quickly, and bad checks often get exposed as bad later. Out of curiosity why not file a first instead of suing? Was your husband a 1099? At this point you need to find the money to pay off your debt, and you may just have to sue the person again. How did that work the first time, did you travel to their state?
