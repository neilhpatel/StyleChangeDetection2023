"Sir he was dismembered with what appears to have been a chainsaw. You, his security detail, have nothing to report?".

What clean up? Just get into power, blame all the problems on Putin, can of the war and return to 2014 borders. Sanctions get lifted, gas and oil sales to Europe return though not to pre war levels, and Ukraine gets reparations to rebuild from said oil sales. Russia gets revenue, Ukraine survived and gets rebuilt along with a new Marshall plan, and Russia gets stability and end of the energy crisis, the world gets a more stable energy sector and food supply, and China misses discount Russian gas which is also good for the world.
