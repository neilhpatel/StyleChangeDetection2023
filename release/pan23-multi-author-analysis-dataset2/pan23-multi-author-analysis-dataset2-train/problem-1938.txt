I really think NATO has been quietly training Ukraine on western equipment and then as they near a sufficient level of training, suddenly NATO is willing to send the equipment. Why would they publicly broadcast this information when it’s strategically disadvantageous for Russia to know. Better to say publicly they aren’t getting it and then behind closed doors train them. Then when they show up on the battle field being used effectively it will be unexpected.
