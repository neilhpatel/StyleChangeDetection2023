Yes, you are a tenant, and would be considered a month to month tenant. They'd have to follow the correct procedures for notice to vacate (30 days notice) and then formally evict you if you do not leave during the notice period.
Just keep in mind that it would be very foolish for your parents to agree to sign a lease with someone who pays no rent. So while you may like to have a lease, your parents may prefer to keep the arrangement as it is...especially if there is conflict or there are signs that this arrangement is not working well for them.
Right now, you have only those very basic rights which are given to all tenants. Your parents can end the arrangement with the minimum amount of notice required by law, and can end the arrangement for any reason or no reason. This arrangement is as in their favor as it is legally possible for it to be.
Thank you. I know it seems like a simple question, but was not sure if I would be considered a tenant since I am not paying rent.
Having a lease would make it harder for them to end your tenancy. You may be due additional notice. They may not be able to end your tenancy before a certain date unless you specifically violate the lease, and even then you may be due an opportunity to cure the breach.
It's almost certainly in your landlords' (here: your parents) best interest to keep things as they are so that they have the maximum flexibility and minimum requirements to end the arrangement.
The reason leases exist is because good tenants are worth their weight in gold to a landlord. Most landlords are willing to voluntarily offer a good tenant additional security and protections by waiving away some of their rights to end the tenancy because doing so is generally worth it for a responsible, long term tenant who maintains the property and pays rent on time.
