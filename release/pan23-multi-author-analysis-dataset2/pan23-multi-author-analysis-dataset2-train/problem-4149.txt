Wrong factually on all accounts. When you look at total lifetime investment and C02 produced they beat natural gas (we won't even discuss coal which is way behind both) on all these measures. There is an environmental impact from all forms of energy production, but the cost both in dollars and impact are lowest for wind and solar. Even if you were to look just the initial impact from installing solar and wind versus creating a new natural gas plant they beat them there too. The lifetime emissions(that is taking into account the amount of C02 produced even considering installation/manufacturing of the pvs or windmills per kwh) the difference is staggering something like 100x less C02.
Developed countries significantly reduced coal usage in that decade, but renewables (and especially the needed storage for a fully renewable grid) were way too costly for developing economies. They had to use coal to meet increasing electricity demand, which made up for the progress in developed countries. Thankfully manufacturing costs for sustainable technologies are falling fast, but the question is if it'll be fast enough to avoid catastrophic climate change.
