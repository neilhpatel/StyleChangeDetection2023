I wanted clarification on whether it amount to Discrimination or Retaliation. It seems it falls under the latter, just not the illegal variety, even if how things were handled were unethical in my estimation. They got rid of me, hired someone else, and are NOW investing in actually training new hires, based on what I've learned from my coworkers now that an official training/shadowing schedule has been put into effect (Something i had suggested in my letter. ).
I had been promised training, and that never came to fruition. That was the core of my objections in my letter, because it made my work a lot more difficult.
How was I questioning their competence when by their own admission they were ill equipped to afford me any training?
I was terminated, because in my estimation, a lot of the concerns I had were legitimate, but were difficult to accept. I didn't cite names, only very broad generalizations. When I was confronted, I cited the examples accordingly.
Workplace retaliation refers to being punished for exercising your legal rights in the workplace, not for a dispute that arose from they way you handled a request from your supervisor.
Why would I then be terminated, when the Office Manager had been the one to request that I submit that list?
My main objection pertained to the lack of training i had been guaranteed in my onboarding letter not having been given to me. That lack of training made my work load a great deal more difficult, especially the lack of clear directives.
