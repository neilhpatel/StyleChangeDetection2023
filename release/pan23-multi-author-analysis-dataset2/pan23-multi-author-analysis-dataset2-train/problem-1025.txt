That proposition really isn’t as clear cut as you think. Only a small percentage is going towards wildfire prevention. The EV incentives are kind of acting as corporate handouts to ride share companies to meet required goals (Lyft is the main sponsor of this prop btw). I’m all for taxing rich people more, but the money would be better served in the general fund where it could be used towards better energy options like public transportation, which Newsom has been trying to focus on. It’s by no means a bad proposition, but imo it’s not worth locking us so many years into. Would rather vote on another more solid prop a couple years from now.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
