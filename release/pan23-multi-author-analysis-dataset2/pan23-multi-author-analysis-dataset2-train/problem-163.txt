If your landlord refuses to inspect the unit with you, either while you still have possession or afterwards, then your recourse should they withhold from your deposit is to dispute it. The lack of an inspection generally means you have not been given a reasonable opportunity to remediate issues that would otherwise have been discussed, and can make it harder for your landlord to defend the decision to deduct from your deposit.
Given that California allows you to recover the deductions plus up to twice the total amount of the deposit if it's withheld in bad faith, and given that refusing an inspection can indicate bad faith, that's a big stick.
You're correct that state law provides you with a right to a pre-move-out inspection, but statute provides no specific consequences if your landlord refuses. It's situational. Do your best to ensure that the unit is clean and that any damage you did is repaired, take extensive photos after you've cleaned your things out, and be prepared to take your landlord to small claims if they aren't prompt about returning your deposit.
Also the landlord stated in the lease he has two months to return the deposit. Is this legal as I know it should be 21 days? Oversight from my end. Thanks again for the replies.
Thanks for the reply. I guess I'll do as you said and document it throughly and also save his email refusing to inspect in case anything comes up.
That's when he threatened trespassing if I attempt to come knock on his door. This landlord is almost frightening. But clearly he just doesn't want to meet in person after mistreating us during our stay.
