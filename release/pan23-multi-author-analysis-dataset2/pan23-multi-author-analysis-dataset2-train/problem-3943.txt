Aliens could get in touch tomorrow and we must know what to say to them, scientists have warned, as they launched a new research hub to prepare humanity for first contact.
The University of St Andrews has joined forces with the UK SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Research Network to establish protocols and procedures if aliens are found.
The team warn that although there are measures in place for dealing with threats posed by asteroid impacts, there is no agreed response if a radio signal were picked up from another intelligent lifeform.
The Seti Post-Detection Hub will bring together experts from around the world to decide how to decipher methods, enact space law and anticipate societal impacts.
That'll have been jets, they cut power to glide and quickly change direction then flame something) I don't know the term) to shoot off quickly, sucks but true. If you know where you were you can check transponders for the area.
i actually saw my first UFO(s?) last week. been stargazing since i was young. it was nothing like the TV or movies. was similar to a shooting star but it suddenly appeared as a fixed light then streaked away, but it happened 3 times in a row. same origin point and same streak path, all in fast succession; 3 times.
there wasnt a direction change, but i did figure it was probably military testing. but it was def high altitude and the rate of speed was incredible. definitely wasnt a "manned" craft. likely missile or drone testing. happened at about 5am and no military bases nearby, but it was likely near orbit so it could have been anywhere. and highly likely it was launched from another aircraft. it appeared like a star before it "rocketed" off (x3) lol.
