One option may be to put pressure on the security company through them, as I doubt it looks good for the company that their employees are perceived to be stealing from members. May be grounds to dissolve, or at least not renew a contract with them. That would be a good incentive for them to force the employee to return the cat.
Did you specify to the police that you have video evidence of your cat being stolen off of your property? "Missing" vs stolen might change their priorities at least a little.
Sorry, I forgot to add that I filed a police report afterwards and nothing came from it, which is why Iâ€™m now looking at whatever legal options I have. Not a lot of people take a missing cat seriously unfortunately.
Check with animal control asap. If someone finds a "stray cat" and they report it to animal control the time period for the owner to claim the cat varies by state, but it's typically around 10 days. After this time period has passed without the owner claiming the cat, the cat can be legally claimed by the person that reported it as stray. The vet will even legally be allowed to change the microchip to the new owner if the cat isn't claimed. Alternatively, you could call around and check with the vets in town and see if anyone brings a cat in of that description to check the microchip.
