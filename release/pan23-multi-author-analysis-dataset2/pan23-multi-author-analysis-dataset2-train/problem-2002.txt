You will die there if you pick the battle. There is absolutely nothing that makes it illegal to identify you with images from public available sources. You are welcome to go off the grid and live in the middle of nowhere where you don't interreact with anyone or have any meaningful digital footprint, but if you want to live in modern society your only solution here is to convince people they shouldn't do this, because as the law and US constitution stand this is legal and couldn't really be prohibited.
