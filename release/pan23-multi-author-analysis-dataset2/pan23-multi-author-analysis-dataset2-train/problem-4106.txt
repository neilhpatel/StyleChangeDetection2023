A big part of oposition against PT were from big farmers that wanted the dismantle of both the indigenous people protection and enviromnent protection offices - and they got it. For example, in may 2021 a group of farmers machine-gunned a indigenous settlement in amazon and absolutely nothing was made. And everything was recorded.
Edit: that's where my expertise ends though. I have no idea how to make it more efficient. Raising cattle in the plains is obviously easier than raising them in the jungle. Which brings up another more macro level question. Why are they trying to raise cattle in the jungle?? I mean I know why ($$$) but it just seems like an interesting commodity to specialize in in the rainforest.
I think it can change for the better a great deal, if for nothing else because the international markets and press care about the Amazon and in his previous government it did improve a lot.
Things wont suddenly be amazing, but being afraid of being fined again if not jailed should help a little at least.
