In NY the only utility that follows the property and not the owner is water. The water company can put liens on the property. This should have been investigated during closing. You may land up having to pay it and then try to get the money back from the previous owners.
A little more context: there was no issue until the water dept changed out the meters to smart meters. They neglected to check/read the inside meter that they were removing for what seems to be over 12 years (records don’t go further than that). And they were only reading an external meter. When they removed the inside meter they took the meter reading from that inside meter for the first time in more than a decade and charged me for an absurd amount of water usage. At the time I had only lived in the house for about a year. I’ve proved without a doubt with several meter tests and pictures that the meters worked in sync but they’re seemingly ignoring any documentation and asking me to pay. Additionally my usage over the few years I’ve been in the house (from when I moved in to now) still doesn’t add up to the amount they’re asking me to pay.
