It's on them to deliver you exclusive possession of the unit in a habitable state, that's the 'implied warranty of habitability'. You might have to have a lawyer write up a nastygram if they are ignoring you, but I imagine not only will you be able to break the lease without penalty, your landlord might be on the hook for your incidental costs in finding a new place at short notice (hotel stays etc.).
NAL, just piggybacking on the top comment. For the nastygram you need, contact your school's legal support/law clinic/whatever it's called. When I was a broke grad student and had legal issues with my moving company, my school's student legal aid provided the letter I needed and the issue was promptly resolved.
Even though the complex is independent the school legal clinic may be able to help you. Schools frequently have resources to help students from being taken advantage of this way.
If you are a student at the University of South Carolina you can get free legal help with your situation from the university. On sc.edu search legal services and you can get a free consultation.
