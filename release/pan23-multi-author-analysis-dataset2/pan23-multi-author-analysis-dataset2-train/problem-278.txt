This is just so performative. Like every time someone bought the ticket, bought the room in the hotel, bought anything at all in Qatar, some money went to the goverment, that specifically make the laws to persecute certain groups. If you care about those groups, why you attend the event and pay them money? Also, it is interesting, that there were no gestures or armbands for women rights and slavery labor. Priorities I guess, since slave and woman lives are not controversial enough to draw attention. And obviously, I am pretty sure that not a single Qatari will change their view about lgbtq+ to more positive and accepting after all this, but there might be those, who would be going worse, seeing it as attack on their culture, where foreigners come and try to dictate how they should live in their country.
All I know is that while all of the power is in FIFA’s hands, a team protest that forced a forfeit seems like it wouldn’t be possible (at least as a reaction from FIFA). Then again, it is FIFA. Who knows what they would figure out.
