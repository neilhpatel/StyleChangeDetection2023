The current owner of the property would need to call the police for the trespassing. You would not have standing to make the complaint.
What you could do is follow the survey guy as he's laying flags and photo/video the location in real time. Additionally with permission of the current owner, use line marking paint to "back up" the flag location.
Aside from that, once you have purchased the land, post no trespassing signs and set trail cams up to document the neighbor coming into your land. Call the cops and cite trespassing. Maybe put up a fence.
Just request the Surveyor to not flag them and to please cover all pins with dirt or sod. We do that on request. Only the monument bars and discs are required.
One of the easier solutions: the surveyor can drive steel or iron spikes into the ground, rather than merely plant flags. Normally they use magnitized spikes that can be up to 8 inches long, as those are easy to detect. But, they can be particularly long spikes if you want, like a piece of rebar that is several feet long - if you ask ahead (and maybe you need to provide the rebar if they don't have any available).
