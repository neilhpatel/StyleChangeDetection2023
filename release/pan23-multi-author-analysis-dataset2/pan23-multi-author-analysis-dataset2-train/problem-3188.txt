Saying Biden authorized the search of his political rival in court had to have been a soundbite for grumps rabid base. Thereâ€™s no way a lawyer who understands how warrants are issued could possibly believe Biden was involved.
This is exactly why the JD appointed the special council. In the before times of the long long ago, the JD worked independently of the President, especially after the Kennedys, they passed laws to make it more separated. Then along comes Trump and adds doubt from here on out cause he used the JD as his own lawyers and the FBI as his own police so of course they think everyone does it.
They shouldn't, they should have demanded proof and when there was none hold the lawyer for Trump in contempt. You can not willfully lie to the court as an attorney.
