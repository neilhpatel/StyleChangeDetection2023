You haven't explained what actually happened. It sounds like you had a trial and were found guilty. If that's what happened, you could consult with a lawyer about appealing the verdict.
You should speak with a criminal defense attorney about the possibility of any sort of appeal or deferred judgment.
If you were already convicted for this offense, it's not going to be possible to just re-open these charges and "try again" for a different result.
Well, that's exactly what I mean: your previous narrative implied that you went to trial, raised a defence which was rejected by the trial judge, and were found guilty, but now you're saying that you plead guilty. Appealing from a finding of guilt after trial is rather a different matter than an appeal following a guilty plea.
So now you've got two problems: you failed to file an appeal in time (30 days per here: ); and you may not have any grounds to appeal (you can't withdraw a guilty plea after sentencing just because you changed your mind). The only useful advice here is to consult with a criminal lawyer who does appellate work.
