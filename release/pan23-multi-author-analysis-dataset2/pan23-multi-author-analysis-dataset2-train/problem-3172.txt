They rented out my unit to someone else and didnâ€™t really explain why they didnâ€™t explain why they didnâ€™t just put the new tenants in the other empty apartment. No I donâ€™t want to move though, mostly because I work a lot and itâ€™s no time to plan it unless I want to stay up until 4 am packing, moving, and cleaning.
The Fair Housing Act very strongly sides with the tenant on these issues. If your assistance animal qualifies for the protections of the Fair Housing Act, then it doesn't matter if you bring them in before or after you make a reasonable accommodation request. While it's ideal to show your good faith by requesting the accommodation and providing the necessary paperwork promptly (which you have), even hiding the assistance animals until you get caught isn't fatal to your request for a reasonable acommodation.
Their claim that you cannot have your animals in the non-sleeping rooms of your apartment is not true. Assistance animals can go anywhere the tenant can.
Submit the paperwork promptly, but do not be anxious about them actually attempting to fine you or evict you because of a delay in the paperwork.
They can ask for a letter from your medical provider stating that you have a disabling condition and these specific animals (two is uncommon, but not impossible) are required to treat your disabling condition.
They can ask for things like a rabies vaccination certificate before allowing your animal onsite, and can require you to have a pet license if your city requires one. But they can't pester you with specific questions or forms about your physician, nor can they pester your physician with anything but very basic "did you write this letter and is it true", and "are you a licensed healthcare provider treating our tenant".
Okay, thatâ€™s what I thought, but I have no legal source to back me up because it doesnâ€™t explicitly state those details online. I just walked my dog and noticed a 3 day notice to comply or vacate letter on my door about the animals. ðŸ˜ª.
