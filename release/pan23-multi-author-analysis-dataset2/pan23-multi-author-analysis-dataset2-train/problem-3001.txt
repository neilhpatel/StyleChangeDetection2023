I expect you and your lawyer will approach your ex with an offer that amounts to restating your position that you put five grand into the down payment and X number of dollars into improvements on the agreement that it was to be your shared home, and would have become your home together when you got married/when you were able to get financing, and that you understand that the property is hers but you're not willing to walk away from all of the investment. Capping that with an offer to settle the issue for whatever number you feel is appropriate puts the ball in her court: she can either ignore you, counteroffer with something else, accept, or refuse, and you can go from there.
Because the agreement was that you would own the home together, I think you should talk to a lawyer. Ideally, you would have your name on the title and this would be a much easier problem to solve, but without that, you may still have some valid arguments for recovering part of the improvements in value. Don't expect to get all of your money back, however, and at some level, be prepared to compromise just to solve the problem. Litigation is expensive and will wipe out five grand plus a year of improvements in weeks.
You almost certainly signed a gift letter as part of her getting a mortgage. The bank would have asked her about any large deposits within the past year. Do you remember doing that?
