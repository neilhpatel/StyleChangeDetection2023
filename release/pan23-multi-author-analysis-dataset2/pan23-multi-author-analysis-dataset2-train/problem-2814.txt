Contact the Missouri Department of Labor. They will review the situation and advise you as to your rights/obligations, and they will help if a check is being withheld.
Missouri law . See .110 of that provision. The penalty provision for the law kicks in if final payment isn't made within 7 days of receiving a written request for wages. I would get a consult with an employment attorney within a day or so because they will likely be pretty reasonable in guiding you through this process.
There are no requirements under Missouri law that address when wages are due when an employee quits a job. If wages are not paid by the next regular pay period, then the wages can be collected by legal action. If the amount due in back wages is less than $5,000, workers may file their claim in small claims court, where costs are less and it is easier to proceed without hiring private legal counsel. Individuals attempting to recover amounts above $5,000 should pursue a private right of action in circuit court.
Keep in mind that MO courts don't reward people who wait on the demands with penalties. People who have waited 90-180 days to send a written request were denied penalty recovery, hence the need to move on this.
So she quit her job without a two week notice, has no intention of going back there to work. The employer wants her to to sign a resignation notice that says she quit without two week notice and will not work there anymore.
