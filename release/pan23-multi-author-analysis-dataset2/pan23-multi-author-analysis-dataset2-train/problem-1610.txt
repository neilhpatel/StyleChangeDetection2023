This is likely due to the company’s insurance policy. Our provider requires all employees to be transported to and from post accident testing. Most assume that is so the employee doesn’t pull something on the way to alter results but it’s really a cya policy to protect liability in case there is another accident (due to drugs, injuries from initial accident,etc.).
You have this backward. You are asking for a “rule” or “law” that says they can discipline you. You need a “rule” or “law” that says that they cannot.
No one here is going to give you a citation to 99 USC 999 that says “an employer can make an employee take a cab after failing a drug test.” This is implicit in the employer/employee relationship absent a contract or law that changes that.
It's not like they said they would arrest you and fine you, they certainly had no authority or right to do that.
They don't have any ability or authority to advocate for criminal or civil charges with the police. And they cannot petition the DMV or anything like that to revoke your license.
