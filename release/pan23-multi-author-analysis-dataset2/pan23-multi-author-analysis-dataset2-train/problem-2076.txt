When I was 17 I got into a pretty bad car accident and had to have surgery, I was given an insane amount of pain pills for....well, pain. I also had an uncle who was a pill head, I was oblivious at the time since I've never really been around pill addicts before. He used to give me rides to my doctors appointments or to refill prescriptions and then hit me with the "oh man im just having trouble sleeping bit, or my stomach hurts, mind if I get a few" yada yada yada. Anyway fast forward a few years and im applying to be a cop in my city. They ask me the question "Have you ever given away or sold any of your prescription medicine before" And I figured I would tell the truth and it would come up later and I would explain myself. NOPE! Lifetime ban from applying for the city. Come to find out later the thing is to lie on all your applications if you want to be a cop and a good amount of cops tell you to lie but just stick to your lie through the whole investigation/application process.
Unfortunately the few decent guys I knew that tried becoming cops quit after a year or two because 1) everyone treats them like shit and 2) the pay isn’t enough to afford living in the area you serve.
I very much believe in a “be the change you want to see in the world” mentality, so good people need to step up and enroll in academy.
