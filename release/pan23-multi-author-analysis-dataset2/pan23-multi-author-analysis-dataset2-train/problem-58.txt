Thanks! I'll let her know to talk to the COA to see if they had given the previous owner any notices and in the mean time talk to a real estate attorney to see what info they need from her and what she can do to not have to pay the 62k.
She'll want to consult a real estate attorney in the appropriate area and go over the terms of the sale, the condo agreement documentation, and the situation.
She wasnt aware of the damages before getting this assessment, yeah i told her she would probably want to get an attorney, she only asked me about it because i work in homeowners insurance.
She's trying to get in contact with the previous owner, my friend was unaware of the damages at the time of the purchase and doesnt know if the previous owner knew.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
Talking to the COA is probably the easiest way to find definitive proof in that respect (previous notices, etc).
