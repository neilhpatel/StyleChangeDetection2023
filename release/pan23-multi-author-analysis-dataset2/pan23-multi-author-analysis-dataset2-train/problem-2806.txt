I wasn't expecting this attitude from the prosecutor general, Augusto Aras, due to the circunstances of his nomination. In Brasil, three prosecutors are voted to form a list, called , from which a president indicates one to be the prosecutor general. The president is not obligated to choose from such list, but it's customary to indicate the most voted, as far as I know. Aras not only wasn't the top voted, . Bolsonaro indicated him in such conditions twice (I've linked only the second time).
sorry to be a pparty pooper, but their names are yet to be mentioned, and the personal connections only happen at Bolsonaro's family leve, and they are not even in Brazil. It's a long way before we reach them in the Brazilian justice system.
Kissinger did worse things for a longer time than those two and nothing ever happened to him. He succeeded where they failed, he was the advocate for torture camps in South America to the US government.
The only thing with Bannon and Stone is that they didn't do it in an oficial capacity, but I still doubt they'll see any justice.
