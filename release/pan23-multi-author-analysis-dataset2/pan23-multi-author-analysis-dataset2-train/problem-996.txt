In Illinois for someone to use a GPS device to track their location without their consent. Even if you granted consent to your employer to track your location while working and/or while driving a company owned vehicle, that consent wouldn't extend to include driving a vehicle the company sold you for your personal use.
It's unclear whether your purchase of the vehicle included the purchase of the tracking device. You could report it to the police and ask them what you can legally do about the device. The police might investigate and the DA might prosecute. It's potentially a felony stalking offense. I have visions of the police investigating, your boss suing you for not returning the device or for damaging/destroying it, your boss getting prosecuted for stalking, and your boss retaliating against you by firing you.
I think most people would assume you own it now, but if your boss demands it back, you refuse, and he sues I'm unsure what a court would decide based on his evidence and yours. If it was me, I'd take pictures of its condition before and after removal and store it somewhere in case he asks for it back. And if feasible video the removing of it. Hard to predict what your unethical boss will do.
Honestly, I wouldn't even be sad if they fired me. I'm kinda tired of the drama this place generates. I am for sure going to be trying to change market areas to move to another branch with different people. Current boss is a petulant man child. The money is good is the only reason I won't quit.
I totally get it. Sometimes it's hard to give up the pay. Hopefully you'll get to leave on your terms, but it sounds like if you get fired it'll be cathartic. Good luck.
