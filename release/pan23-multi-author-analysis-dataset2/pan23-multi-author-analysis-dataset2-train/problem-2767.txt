Based on my poor understanding of the law, there is nothing illegal about using someone else's name in a website by itself - for example, the website billclinton.com is not owned by the politician of that name. Having said that, I think you left information out of your post that could be useful for better-informed people to give you a better answer. In no particular order:
Do the websites say anything else beyond a picture and "pending publication"? If so, do they say something that is defamatory and/or not true?
Is he succeeding? Do you have any way to show that you lost a job opportunity specifically due to this website? This is important because it could show that you have suffered a specific, quantifiable damage.
Again, these are common starting points that can guide you into getting more helpful answers. Another common non-legal advice in general is to look for a reputable SEO firm to help you bury those pages with better results.
I assume they mean its a nude photo on the site which would be the first hit in googling someones name for a job. They faded the naughty bits out, but it's still just a huge naked photo of the person on the website. Revenge porn laws may help?
Who took the picture? A common suggestion here is that the photographer owns the copyright for the picture, and people can sometime use that to demand a picture be removed. Also, if the picture is sexual in nature then revenge porn laws could apply.
