As someone who worked in the banking industry, that's their stupidity, then. Mortgage rates in Canada (and in many cases elsewhere) have been at or near historical lows for almost 15 years now. Anyone who took a variable rate gambling that the rate would continue going down is incompetent and deserves to lose their money. Anyone who had an older mortgage that didn't refi into a fixed rate when it was more favorable is also a fool.
I make six figures and that is more than a third of my monthly take home... i make 50% more than the national average income but am no longer able to afford the average rent ( usinhe 30% of take home metric.) What. The. Fuck.
It blows my mind that this is not a bigger issue with politicians. Nobody really seems.to talk about it beyond vague descriptions of "being concerned" about housing. It's a full blown housing crisis and no one at the top gives a single flying fuck.
The feds and provinces need to take drastic measures to ensure affordable housing as a first priority, then maybe unfuck healthcare right quick.
