This person has been alone in your home for months at a time. Check on ALL of your documents, especially those for your home and bank accounts. If they have found your routing numbers or a checkbook, they could have access to all of your funds anyway.
1- Take any objects from the home which are irreplaceable - deeds, bonds, heirlooms, photos, etc - and move them off site to somewhere safe. It could be the home of friends or family, a storage unit or even a bank safety deposit box. Make sure a copy of the recording and current, dated photos of the property and valuables within are included.
1a- lock down any accounts (change passwords, put new lock code on phone & computer, etc) of yours which your partner may have had access to.
Chances are they cannot ruin you and are just being emotionally manipulative, but better safe than sorry.
3- issue him a notice to quit within \[X\] days (the minimum depends on your state, but 30 days is the typical minimum). If he hasn't left the property by then you can start eviction proceedings.
