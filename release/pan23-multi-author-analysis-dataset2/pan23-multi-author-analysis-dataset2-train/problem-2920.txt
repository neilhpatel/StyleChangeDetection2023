A) there is no stated procedure under any NATO article for expelling or even suspending a member, they could choose to leave and I guess they could be “persuaded” to leave, but cannot legally be kicked out, at least in any known process.
B) even though they’re a fucking dirt ball regime, they are strategically extremely important, it’s a necessary alliance.
B) at ww 1, turkey is not part of allied force, but the allied force still win the war, if turkey want to be allied part they should obey the rules, and not being scumback.
B) idk how WW1 which was over 100 years ago has any relevancy today and I don’t see your point at all. Turkeys strategical importance lies solely in the Black Sea, a mostly non-factor in ww1 as the Ottoman Empire pretty steadily controlled that region, with Russias presence their and Turkey being the sole rule makers of the Bosphorus makes them an incredibly important ally.
The entire geopolitical situation in Europe is different, naval warfare is an actual factor now, the Black Sea is now of EXTREME strategical importance, like I really don’t get what you’re trying to say.
