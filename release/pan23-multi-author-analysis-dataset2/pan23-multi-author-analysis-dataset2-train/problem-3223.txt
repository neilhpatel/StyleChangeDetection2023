This is going to be very hard to prove. This will require an inspection of the internals of the transmission. Are you willing to pay for all of this in the hopes you'll get definitive proof the transmission has internal wear beyond that of normal driving at 50k... and then to prove that wear wasn't already pre existing? This sounds like an uphill battle. Why won't Honda Corp help?
Thank you for the reply. Honda says it's a "dealer workmanship issue" and can't do anything about it except record a formal complaint against the dealership.
The shops I called said that kind of inspection might be possible, but not really reasonable to do. Does it really require that kind of proof? They admitted to the mistake, and transmission experts say it likely caused damage.
My thinking was, name them in a small claims suit, claim a reasonable number, and see what happens. I did this for Subaru some years ago for failing to honor a warranty, and they just settled. I wasn't even demanding Honda do anything in particular. I said they could replace it, have an independent mechanic verify there was no damage, or provide a warranty for the average lifespan of a well-maintained transmission.
So even if all parties agree someone made a mistake, and damage was likely, all they have to do is say, that number is not precise, so we don't have to do anything? I'm a dummy with this stuff, so idk.
They owe you for the damage they caused. No one can say what that is without really taking it apart.
That makes sense, we towed it to a transmission shop to get an assessment and estimate. It could probably be debated, but this seems like a credible way to go, right?
