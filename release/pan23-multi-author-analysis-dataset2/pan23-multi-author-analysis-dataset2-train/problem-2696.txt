If you backed out before certain deadlines, then there should be no issue refunding the earnest money. If you backed out after certain deadlines, then you may not be able to get your earnest money back. This is pretty much all that matters. What are the relevant deadlines?
Hindsight is 20/20 but there would have been no difference working 90 more days then quitting without any notice, absent a contract requiring 90 day notice.
Don’t believe the seller that the it’s not worth fighting for the money they’d get. I can’t say who’s right - but you really should ask your realtor what they think.
It all depends on your contract and what contingencies you have and how it’s written. There’s usually a financing contingency that says if you can’t get financing by xx date, you can back out. I’m not familiar with the wording in the standard PA contracts, but I don’t think it gets into specific reasons for not getting financing.
So if your contract says so, and you can’t get financing, you should be able to get your earnest money back. Of course I’m making many assumptions - but read your contract and talk to your realtor.
