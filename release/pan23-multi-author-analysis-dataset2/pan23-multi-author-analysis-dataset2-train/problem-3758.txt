That is why everyone is advising she communicate through text. Her best bet is to actually establish herself and the kids in another state though. Then even if he gets custody the majority will likely go to your sister. Plus he will have to file for custody in the state the kids live in. Your sister should really talk to a lawyer to find out her options. This stuff will just escalate over time, especially with her being so far from family.
If she’s married there’s nothing dad can do about it. He can call the cops. They might check to see everything is as you say then leave.
Besides the birth records and marriage certificate, having texts sent to the spouse saying that she is taking the kids to visit family and her itinerary would help.
Let her know that if she does it now, when they’ve just recently moved, she’ll be stuck having custody hearings in her new state and will have difficulty moving the kids back to Illinois. If she takes the kids back now (assuming IL is where she was previously and she’s been in MI less than 6 months) then she can file in IL and all custody decisions will be based on the premise that the kids are IL residents.
