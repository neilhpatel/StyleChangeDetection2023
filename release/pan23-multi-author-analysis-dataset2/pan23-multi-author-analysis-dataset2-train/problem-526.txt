Bah! As an American our leaders are more embarrassing. Trump dodged the draft cause of bone spurs, which wasn't true, and then proceeded to not pay taxes for God knows how ever many years. Bush jr. got places in the national guard so he could evade IIRC. If your only redeeming value is being wealthy and then you don't pay taxes, you really are worthless to the rest of civilization. There is a long tradition of rich people using their influence to not go to war, but it sure as hell makes the plebs think that if you ain't gonna go to war I sure as shit ain't gonna go which just leaves the poor who are forced to go, they don't have other options or their current situation isn't any better. Makes JFK and the others that actually served, despite being wealthy, so much more respectable.
Damn right,, it’s ok for bastards politicians to send other peoples youth to war but they don’t want to send their own kids to war and risk their lives! About time some said it like it should be.
I'm obligated to remind everyone that you can sing the lyrics of War Pigs to the tune of Deck the Halls, and vice versa.
