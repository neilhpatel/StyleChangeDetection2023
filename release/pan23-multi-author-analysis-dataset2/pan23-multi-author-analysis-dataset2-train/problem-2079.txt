Most do. I have no fucking idea why. Maybe because I wasn't alive in the 80s (Born late 90s, 2000's kid) and my grandparents who raised me don't look back on it fondly either.
“There was more common sense in the 80’s” is a BOLD statement considering things like the war on drugs, the reaction to the aids epidemic, trickle down capitalism and the satanic panic, just to scratch the surface of the tip of the iceberg.
If they didn't have Nukes then all of the countries supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself probably wouldn't have to add the stipulation of not attacking Russia back with said weapons.
Even if all the nations of the world were to cooperate and get rid of theirs and all the terrorists were to agree to never use them we still have several that are lost at sea that could just randomly go off.
The 80s just seem like humanity collectively got together and went "Right, let's just make this whole decade one massive fucking mistake in pretty much every way possible".
I think what's going to happen is someone's going to have to create something that makes them inert remotely.
