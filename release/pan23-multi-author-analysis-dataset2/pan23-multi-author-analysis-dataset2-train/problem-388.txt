If you're fighting a defensive war against an invading neighbor then strikes across the border on military targets are a completely legitimate defensive tactic.
Perhaps not a land invasion, but inserting covert spec-ops teams deep into Russian territory to sabotage military targets, rescue POWs, assassinate war criminals and military leaders, and encourage partisans ought to be easy and on the table when Ukrainians speak fluent Russian, know FSB tactics, know the land, etc.
The Russians are doing pretty good job of turning there own against them themselves .I mean in regards to the fighters Russians call up ken that don't wanna fight in your war may just shoot there own officers for freedom.
I'm surprised there aren't more internal terrorist attacks from parents who lost their kids. That way they can't even blame Ukraine or the west without some convoluted logic like they did with the old lady who burned a general's car, saying she was hypnotized by Ukraine SOF. There were reports of recruitment offices burning but that's before the fact.
