And yet Republicans shit on Kamala for meeting with Central and South American governments to try to address the root causes. All they care about is optics. She wasn’t personally on the border wrestling migrants to the ground so she doesn’t care about border security at all. They’re literally incapable of thought deeper than what they see in front of them.
Where does that fall on the most pressing republican agenda? Perhaps there needs to be a list to reference for the next election cycle to keep a scorecard on promises met. A montage of his accusations would be nice.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
