Hello, Christina! We typically send questions that ask or feature DNA to AskScience as that's more their area of expertise than ours. You're welcome to ask a question about the historical record. For example, what do we know about the interactions between Vikings and the Indigenous people of North America? or is there any evidence from the historical record that Indigenous people encountered Vikings?".
Apologies, but we have had to remove your submission. We ask that questions in this subreddit be limited to those asking about history, or for historical answers. This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to /r/AskScience.
If you are interested in an historical answer, however, you are welcome to rework your question to fit the theme of this subreddit and resubmit it.
Fully respect your decision to remove the post and would be grateful if you would take the time to explain why.
As I mentioned in the post, researching DNA, my own, and fell upon the archived post /question to which I had found new evidence...
As not a question, but an update to the archived question I stumbled upon in google, how would you suggest I should have shared the article?
