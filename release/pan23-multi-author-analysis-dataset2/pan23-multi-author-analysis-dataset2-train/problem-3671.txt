Be careful how far you pursue this. You can always tell your friends that, even though the character may have been initially based on you, almost everything in the story didn't really happen to you (or happened to someone else.).
The harder you fight it, the more people will look at you and assume the portrayal in the story is truthful. Look up "Streisand effect". Streisand wanted to censor a photo of her home, but all she accomplished was to bring more attention to it, and make more people want to see it.
It sucks, but you can't make information that's already out in the world disappear. A noisy lawsuit will only sell more books and movie tickets. That's not the result you want.
Stories change in movies too, so it will be different than the memoir. Until the movie comes out, you don’t really know what is going to happen.
See . I don't think you have a case under that law; it's mostly concerned with use of people's name or image in advertising.
You might have a case for libel, if she made demonstrably false and defamatory statements and an acquaintance could reasonably identify the fictional character as you. If nothing she said was false or particularly negative then you wouldn't have a case.
It doesn’t sound like she used anything qualifying as your likeness. And she is entitled to tell her story in experiencing you. Don’t date an artist, I guess?
