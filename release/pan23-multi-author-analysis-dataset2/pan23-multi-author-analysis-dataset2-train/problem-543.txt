When the time comes, you simply tell your sister again that you will not do it. If she petitions the court to be appointed executor in your stead, the court or her attorney will provide a form for you to waive your right to be executor.
As for the trust, you notify each of the beneficiaries and the backup trustee in writing that you are not willing to serve.
If you are on decent terms with your sister or whoever the Successor Trustee is, you can ask what specifically they need. If you are contacted by an attorney, ask the attorney. Youâ€™ll probably need to talk to someone anyway, to get the names and addresses of the beneficiaries.
You can find online templates and forms. If you are declining to be executor, be sure to check with the court or the attorney to be sure you use the right form. There is no way to submit the form in advance of probate.
Oh I understand now what you meant when you said "When the time comes". I thought you meant now but you mean if they both pass. Ok, that makes sense, thank you for your help.
