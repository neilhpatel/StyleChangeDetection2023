I’d prefer Dems to hold the house but if it’s a 1-2 seat majority then you’ve still got the potential for a few defectors to help get things done (or not done in the case of bullshit impeachment hearings. Think about how frustrating Sinema and Manchin have been in the Senate and then imagine 218 of them running around on the Republican side. It won’t be as good as a democratic majority but it might prevent things like disbanding the Jan 6 committee.
