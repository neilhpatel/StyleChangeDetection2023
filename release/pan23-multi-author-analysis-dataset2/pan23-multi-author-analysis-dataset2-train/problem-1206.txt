For many, religious preferences can be deeply held, and private. Keep it that way. The easiest way to approach it is to email your principal and explain in detail what you want to wear because it conforms to your religious beliefs. Ask if this presents any dress code issues. You dont need to justify anything else to them. Its probably likely that there aren't any problems with it as long as you refer to it as a custom of your faith. If students ask, give the same response so that you don't violate any religious speech rules. People will respect your privacy if you don't respond to intrusive questions.
You would need to approach your manager or HR and begin the discussion on requesting a religious accommodation that allows you to go outside the dress code within specific parameters. For example, you may be given permission to wear a head-covering, but the school may require it to be black or grey so as to look professional. As part of the religious accommodation process, you will very likely need to disclose your religion and possibly provide some form of documentation.
You may find the on religious garb and grooming helpful. In short, you are entitled to "reasonable accommodation for sincerely held religious practices." If your faith requires you to wear a head covering (regardless of whether every member is required to wear one), you are entitled to do so. The size and organization of your religion are irrelevant, as long as you are sincere in your faith, defined very broadly.
However, you will need to be willing to discuss your faith with your employer in order to request this accommodation.
