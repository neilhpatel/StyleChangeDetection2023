The short version is that there's simply no substantive state's rights aspect to the American Civil War. At all. Anyone telling you this is lying for dead white supremacists. If they are doing this knowingly, which is likely, then we can remove the qualifier of "dead" from the prior sentence and ad that they are seeking to recruit you to their cause. Pointing out that the only state's right the treasonous major enslaving states were committed to was to keeping slavery, a system of torture and rape for profit, going in perpetuity are saying not that there is a state's rights aspect we might meaningfully discuss, but rather calling out the lie.
Is the "States' Rights" apologism a more recent phenomena? From what I understand, Confederates in the immediate aftermath of the war recognized that slavery was the underlying issue and never really mentioned States Rights. Even comparatively recently with Confederate apologism or even works that portray the Confederacy in a less negative light (particularly Shelby Foote's Civil War series), slavery is never denied as the leading issue. It's a pretty common part of the discourse now unfortunately, but I'm wondering how far back it stems.
