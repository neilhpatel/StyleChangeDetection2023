What Ifs are really popular questions sometimes, but the thing is, with a little work most 'what if' questions can actually be turned into really good, really interesting questions that match the rules. It's all about the angle and perspective you have when asking the question. If you never need a bit of help phrasing things, let us know!
Edit: to clarify, second example might be too similar to the first question. As for the first example question, I'd imagine that framing the question like "why did the Industrial Revolution happen in Europe" would emphasize European factors (but has not obligation for discussing/comparing close competitors like China), whereas "why did China not industrialize first" might place the emphasis on Chinese factors and perspectives. [Edit 2: another example might be something like "why did ideology/belief system X fail to attract a mass following in this place, despite documented proselytizing efforts?"].
The best option, usually, is to not make assumptions. "Why didn't X do Y instead of what they actually did?" makes a lot of them in most situations. Certainly there are some instances where it is well known certain options were considered and rejected, but a lot of these questions end up just being people trying to "logic" the better course with hindsight.
Two questions: how would you formulate questions about what plausible options that a historical actor had on their table but opted not to follow through on those?
And conversely, would questions about explaining historical absence (eg why didn't country X experience the Industrial Revolution first? Why didn't person Z choose a certain option despite it being on the option menu?) be considered counterfactual?
