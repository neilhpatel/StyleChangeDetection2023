A "no dogs allowed" side on a particular building may mean that dogs are not allowed to walk/pee there. It's very hard to tell without context. Before anything else, follow up with the landlord, have them check the condo rules and regulations and other documents, or call property management and check before jumping to conclusions.
You have a lease from the landlord which explicitly states that you can have a dog, so your landlord cannot evict you for having a dog. The fact that your lease might be inconsistent with their HOA's rules is neither here nor there.
The HOA is not your landlord, so they cannot evict you or impose fines on you. If they have R&Rs which prohibit dogs, though, they can probably fine your landlord for being out of compliance with those rules, and can continue doing so for as long as they remain out of compliance (i.e. as long as your dog remains in the unit). Your landlord cannot pass those fines on to you.
If, in fact, no dogs are allowed, then no dogs are allowed and you can't have a dog there. At that point you need to decide whether to terminate your lease with the landlord and find another place that allows dogs.
