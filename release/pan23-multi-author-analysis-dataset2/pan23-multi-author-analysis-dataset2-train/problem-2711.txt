Then it's not practical to pursue through small claims. You can sue in your state and get a default judgement but that's not going to be helpful if he doesn't willingly pay. You already said suing him where he is isn't practical.
Can you elaborate on what that means to get a default judgement, and what happens if he doesn't willingly pay? How does this work if I'm in WA and he's in CA?
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
So you have a (relatively) expensive piece of paper that says he should pay you. If he was in the state there are methods you can possible enforce things but it's pretty useless with him in CA.
Default means the defendant doesn't show up. There's no trying of evidence they just go with what you claimed.
IANAL Have you tried contacting PayPal and explaining to see if you can dispute the charges? PayPal has buyer protection and might be able to help you get your money back if you show them the chat history and let them know you never received the item. Also, if it was sold on Etsy or a similar site, you can report them there as well.
