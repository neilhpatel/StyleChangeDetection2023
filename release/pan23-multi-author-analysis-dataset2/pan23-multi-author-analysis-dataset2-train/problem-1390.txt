Didn’t understand a couple parts of the article, but sounds like a whole load of nothing. Just angry about Madonna finding some loophole in the law to adopt children from Malawi.
It’s an Indian a Nigerian website, and it seems like it’s pretty damn biased. Randomly brings up “mainstream media” and brings up specific bad things Muslims are doing.
Another article at the bottom of the site "Biden Tells Israel to Give Money to Terrorists, Not Terror Victims" - I'm pretty sure this site can't be 100% truted.
>The double standards of the mainstream media and of the far Left anti-racism industry is stark. The real victims continue to be ignored, while those who call out abuses are silenced. Victims including African children, women abused under the Sharia, Nigerian Christians ravaged by genocide, women who have been exploited by transgender men in sports and raped by men who identify as women, are being systematically ignored.
>The Ethiopian World Federation has gone to Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera in order to ask that he investigate “’homosexual and transgender’ allegations over the adoption of the Malawian children for possible ‘human trafficking and social experiments.’”.
