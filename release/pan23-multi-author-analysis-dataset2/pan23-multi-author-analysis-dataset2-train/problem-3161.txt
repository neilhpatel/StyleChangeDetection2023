If your passport was taken, does that imply that you are currently in a foreign country? If so, that is a larger concern than missing the event.
Regarding your initial concern, contact the venue and explain the situation. Ask for alternative ways to confirm your identity. If you are staying at a hotel, maybe the personel there have connections at the venue and can assist in confirming your identity, since you'd have had to provide identification at check in. Maybe a combination of things.
I.e. email confirming purchase, facebook page, linkedin page, utility bill with your name on it, electronic picture or scan of either your license or passport, credit/debt/bank card, etc. Hopefully, you get the idea of things to potentially use.
You are fucked more than likely. You shouldn't carry all your forms of ID on you at the same time without a very good reason.
You can try to go down to your DMV and see if they issue same-day IDs or licenses. Or you can contact the venue and explain your situation to them, and see if there's any alternative. These are really the only options I can think of which would get you into the venue.
Most dmv’s at least where I’m from issue a paper one in hand that you can use until the replacement one arrives.
I know in my state, if you move and update your change of address with the DMV online, you are given the option to print out a temporary license showing the updated address. However, it doesn't include a picture.
