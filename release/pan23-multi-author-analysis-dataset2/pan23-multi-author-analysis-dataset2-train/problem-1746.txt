It already does. The UK enjoys some of the cheapest drugs in the western world due to direct government subsidies for drugs. You literally pay 9Â£ for any drug when most cost hundreds if not thousands elsewhere....
if anything the government needs to put a price cap on it. Its really inhumane how companies take advantage of consumers for health needs or food. Bloody bastards.
No. No no no.... that's part of the problem. "It always has been this way, it always will be this way... so, fuck it, right?". 'TIME' has been 'around' for more or less 13 billion plus years. This kind of thinking goes back to industrial capitalism a couple hundred years back. Some broad strokes sweep 'way back' to rape-and-pillage colonialism....or, at its biggest stretch, the birth of rigid division of labor and hierarchical civilization about 10-12000 years ago. It's not inherent...it's not normal...it's certainly not inevitable.
edit not seeing the demand climbing is one thing, but production stoppages + beforehand price hikes x200 are telling signs of expectations. This is where it crossed the line into criminal activity territory, imho.
