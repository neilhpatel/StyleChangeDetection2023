If you start a car without a catalytic converter, it is usually rather apparent. Assuming you have to drive any amount of distance where an officer may be, it will be pretty obvious to them there is an issue. The shop certainly could chose to report it, whether the police act on it is up to them.
Your options are to make the car legal to operate or to scrap it. There isn't really a middle ground.
This is kind of the ordinary answer. You'll get in trouble if officers gain information about you committing a crime. One way they may get information is by a tip from a concerned citizen.
It doesn't take much inspection to realize your catalytic converter has been removed in the way done when stolen.
The mechanic is just covering his ass legally speaking anyways, if he lets em go and they get caught they could just say oh my mechanic said i didnt need it, then they get a warrant for his records, find the invoice for the exhaust inspection and he likely looses his license and livelihood. Im a mechanic and id do the exact same thing and sleep like a baby after, not my problem you cant afford to fix your shit.
