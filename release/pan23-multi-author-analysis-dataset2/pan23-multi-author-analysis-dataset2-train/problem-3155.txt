Growing up in the late 80's in Arkansas, I can remember when Walmart used to advertise "Made in the USA" all over their store. Huge banners all over the store. This is back when Japanese electronics and cars were seen as a big threat.
You can still get both of those on the darknet. This was years ago the last time I looked into it but there is a Chinese company that makes Quaaludes in Africa and they are sold in Africa possibly by a different name.
I watched a documentary and these guys would make pipes out of beer bottles and other items and smoke ground up Quaaludes. Apparently it was turning into a huge problem. People would stand and smoke this stuff and literally pass out and fall on there face. I know mxe was all over the dark web 5 to 10 years ago.
My mom's favorite story from her youth is taking a bunch of qualudes and driving through one of those kiosk-style BP gas stations. Like, literally plowed right through the whole thing.
Not just that but there are plenty of countries in Asia who would be thrilled to pick up the scraps. Taiwan etc even has a great microchip industry. Phones, electronics etc would still get made relatively cheaply, just by someone else. Yes, it would take a bit of time before the market fully adapted, but once it does then it's equally slow to reverse it again do China does have a lot to lose.
