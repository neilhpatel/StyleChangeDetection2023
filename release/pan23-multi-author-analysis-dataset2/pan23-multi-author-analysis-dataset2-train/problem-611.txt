I don't see any reference to a "75% rule" but maybe it's elsewhere. (Donuts wouldn't be taxed, why would pies?).
Let your boss handle this. Unless you are the boss, then ask your CPA or attorney. You don't want to parse the law:
I’m not the boss but me and my boss both didn’t know what to do. It seems when it says “baked goods as is” it is referencing to pre-made food items. If we are making our own pies I would think it should classify as prepared food. Maybe we will not take the order in the meantime, Thank you for your advice.
If the owner doesn't think this applies, then great. It's not for you to determine. Do you normally charge tax for pies? If so, then send that to the lady. But the easiest thing to do is to cancel her order if she won't pay tax.
