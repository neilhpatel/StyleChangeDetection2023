One of those articles makes the argument that people shouldn’t be allowed to use food stamps for soda which I’m not sure how I feel about.
That's true in every neighborhood unless your neighborhood is a dairy farm. Soda is cheaper to manufacture than milk. Race has nothing to do with the price.
Giving up soda was one of the best decisions of my life. It was not taxes that led to this decision, but I am all for taxing deadly consumables like Coke and cigarettes.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
In all seriousness though, it’s sort of depressing for these people but I don’t know if a soda tax would help them. Unless it was put towards some sort of community dental care?
