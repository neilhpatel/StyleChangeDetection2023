Your landlord is correct. You and the other tenant are one legal entity right now and your options are to break the lease together or for the landlord to evict you both. You can pay the missing rent in order to avoid being evicted and then sue your roommate for the money, and if you just want to be physically out of there your landlord might let you sublet the room [edit: nm, I see that you're physically located elsewhere already - but you may want to sublet to recoup some money if you can find a subtenant], but basically you're both going down together whatever happens because the legal agreement between you and the landlord treats you as one entity.
If your co-tenants aren't paying rent, your landlord himself doesn't have incentive to let you out of the lease at all. Like, even if the other tenants agree, why would he? That's one less person from whom he can recover unpaid rent in court.
