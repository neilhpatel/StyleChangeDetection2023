This was a result of the direct flight method SW uses instead of hub and spoke. On top of that, because there were so many flights canceled because of weather, which I’m pretty sure he can’t control, the phone line that SW has to report statuses of planes and personnel to find planes and labor for reroutes and alternative flights was completely jammed and they famously run a skeleton crew to save money as it is. It was easier for SW to basically hit the reset and cancel everything and start clean.
