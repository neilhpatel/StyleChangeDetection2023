2. This person will need a valid passport, the visa, their alien registration number, the date of any previous divorce, and a copy of the divorce (depending on how long ago it was).
One caveat to the J-1 visa is that it is not a “dual intent” visa, meaning that you cannot have the intent to get a green card when you apply. This can create issues if you are not careful when pursuing a green card while on J-1 status.
I would consult an attorney before doing this, since the relationship clearly predated the J1 visa application and you don't want to end up ineligible to adjust status or receive an immigrant visa later.
I understand that the rules of this website don't allow people to post links to attorney websites, and that's fine but I've never searched for an attorney as I've never needed one. How do I go about finding the right one? Surely typing in "attorney" in Google won't help much. I'm not sure what I'm asking here...
Asking around is always a good way. Reaching out by email and seeing how they respond to you could he another. Looking on immigration focused forums. Etc..
