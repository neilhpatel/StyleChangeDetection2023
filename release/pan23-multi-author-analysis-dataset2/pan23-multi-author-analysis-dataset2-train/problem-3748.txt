I posted this earlier, but what the hey, it's Ben "Wet Ass P-Word" Shapiro and Matt "what is a woman" Walsh saying today that and I directly quote, "You could be a visitor from Mars and you could see that all of human procreation relies on man, woman, child" in relation to marriages.

Sometimes the best thing is to mentally walk in another man's shoes. How would your parents feel if they were told they weren't allowed to love and marry each other because someone else didn't like it?
