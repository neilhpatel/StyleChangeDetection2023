And if you didn't, you probably should. Your homeowners should provide an attorney - make sure to ask them. You may need to specifically request the police file charges.
I've kept my insurance in the loop but my understanding of small claims court is that I'd have to represent myself at trial. I've never dealt with anything along these lines before though, and I'd be happy to find out that I'm mistaken on this.
A lot of times they can file a motion to move the case from small claims court to circuit court so that they can defend you in the matter.
Additional question to this; Is your gate at the edge of your property line? Not that it would make too much of a difference, but was he hurt on the sidewalk off your property or was he still in the bounds of your property lines?
I'd much rather throw $100 at a lawyer than a penny at this guy, so I'll definitely be going that route if my homeowners insurance doesn't wind up just taking the reigns for me. Do you know what type of attorney would be best for this type of thing? Thanks for the advice.
Sounds good. I'll be reaching out to my homeowners insurance this afternoon either way, hopefully that motion to move it to circuit court is an option. Frankly my best case scenario is having to deal with as little of this as is realistically possible.
