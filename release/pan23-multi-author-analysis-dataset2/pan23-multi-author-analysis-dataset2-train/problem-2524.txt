Former president Donald Trump began broadcasting widely-discredited conspiracy theories about MSNBC host Joe Scarborough after being prompted by documents given to him by Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, according to former White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah Griffin.
Joe Scarborough’s a political nonentity who spreads his milquetoast with Miracle Whip and calls it his Extra Spicy Sauce, forever oblivious to the fact that he represents a dying demographic that really truly doesn’t give a shit about the rest of us hence his complete irrelevance to the political process known as modern American politics and the fact that he will never ever be the man he may or may not have been in 1995.
Who else remembers Joe & Mika letting Trump call in and free-associate with his usual bullshit for twenty minutes at a time, with no pushback whatsoever?
Yes, they were a big part of normalizing him for a lot of moderate Republicans. Always thought they were all big buddies, must have missed when they had their falling out. Not the biggest Morning Joe fan, but when I watched it back then as breakfast time permitted, Trump's call-ins seemed like a regular feature.
