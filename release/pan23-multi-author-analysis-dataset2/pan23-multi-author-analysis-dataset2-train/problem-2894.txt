IMO he means the manufacturing and processing industries will now reconsider where to put up with its industries after the losses they have accumulated from COVID to this war currently. The current layoffs, inflation and unemployment are all lagging indicators of a recession sooner or later to come due the total effects of current war and COVID. Any country which has the capability of surviving the recession would be a preferable spot for building up industries. China's public is in a tumultuous state due to its stringent COVID laws and a foreign source is assisting them too.
He's talking about how America's reluctance to be the world police anymore (since Trump) combined with China and India's economic rise means that power to make world-shaping decisions has shifted from America/Europe-centrism (e.g. bodies like G7) to more multi-polarism (e.g. bodies like G20).
This has NOTHING to do with Russia-Ukraine. You guys are so consumed by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, you even look at unrelated news from that lens.
