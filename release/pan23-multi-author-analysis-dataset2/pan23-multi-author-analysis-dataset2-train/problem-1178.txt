Generally these tickets aren’t given until someone complains. Maybe you just have a new neighbor who needs to use a wheelchair. Or someone elderly now needs a scooter. Or a neighbor just had a baby and is taking walks/jogging with a stroller. Whoever complained has a reason that they cannot travel through your unpaved lawn to go around the car. I would expect you will keep receiving tickets if you continue to park there. It doesn’t matter that no one had cared that you were parking illegally for ten years - they care now.
The driveway you describe was likely never designed for parking. It is just a route to access your garage.
It's completely paved all around. I don't have a front lawn my driveway stretches the lenh of the house and connects to my neighbors driveways so it's all paved.
My neighbors driveways border my house on either side so it's just one continuous patch of concrete. My house is much closer to the street then theirs however.
This sounds like someone threw up a house in violation of zoning setbacks, with a variance or not. Sounds like a certain beach community I know, where houses are on tiny lots and parking is hard to come by. If it's an area like that, sometimes they'll issue tickets even if no one complains. Sidewalks are for walking, you'll have to find another place to park your car.
