The centrists are in charge of the funding, of the party’s direction, and of the party’s public message atm. So knowing this pretending that progressives have a fair fight when we know the same centrists who run the party will dump money into their opponents in the primary and oppose them in messaging is a fucking joke. When centrists run it’s them versus the republicans. When progressives/leftists run its them versus republicans and centrist dems. Denying this is denying reality.
