I once spent a week in the UK and most of their food sucks. Just terrible rubbish. Indian food was pretty good there. And bangers and mash are alright if the gravy is good. Their breakfast is good too but if you let yourself eat the beans for breakfast you'll be farting all day. The rest of their food sucks tho. Very bland and basic. And if britishers hate American food so much why do you have so many fucking McDonalds and burger kings and kfc's? And all those places were jumping and the local restaurants I went to we were the only people there.
When you're eating fine dining and elaborate meals all over the place, sometimes you just want the comfort of familiar junk food. And for all it's faults and local options, McDonald's does try to have consistent-quality standard menu items everywhere.
Antibiotic beef dose actually taste way better tho. American beef is delicious. Both the flavour and texture are superb and prices are so low. Puts all the beef in Europe to shame. Not that all European food is bad but if you're an American traveling in europe it's really important to remember not to order beef because it's so disappointing. And in UK they dont even particularly know how to season and cook it right.
