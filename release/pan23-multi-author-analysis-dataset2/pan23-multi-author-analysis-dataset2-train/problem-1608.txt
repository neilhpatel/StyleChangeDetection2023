There's no trying to destroy the industry, it's a dying industry, like coal. It'll inevitably end, it needs to end (not at once, progressively phase out), if you haven't noticed yet.
The "free world" itself has been involved in multiple invasions and regime topples of many nations. The "free world" is also built on nationalism. And the "free world" is literally built on hypocrisy.

It makes sense that their Hindu-nationalist regime - which systematically enables the persecution of religious minorities and curtails free speech by banning NGOs critical of their policies - would feel more at home dealing with other autocratic regimes rather than those of the Free World.
And if there was no such enthusiasm in previous decades when India wasn't lead by such a shady government, why would there be now or in the foreseeable future?
