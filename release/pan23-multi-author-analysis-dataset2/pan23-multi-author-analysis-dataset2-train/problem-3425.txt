Another option could, if other options are not viable, is to ask the company to sign an indemnification agreement where they agree to cover the costs of any lawsuit or judgements against you. May be unlikely that they agree, but is potentially another option.
That makes no sense. They are currently transferring the risk solely onto you instead of using their van. If you were to be involved in an accident, your own insurance would likely deny the claim since you are working at the time and then you alone are on the hook. They have this van but are unwilling to use it and are instead putting you at risk. Run from this place.
(Also: What is your camp's policy about being alone with campers? I know a fair number have a "Never Alone" policy.).
That’s exactly what I was worried about. I’m going to tell my supervisor i’m not longer comfortable driving the kids, and then I’ll probably be looking for a new job.
Let's not forget that your insurance my not cover the use of a personal vehicle for business purposes.
We don’t have any policies against being alone with campers. Actually, I am frequently required to be alone with kids because we are so short staffed.
