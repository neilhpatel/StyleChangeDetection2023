It seems like many here didn't read the article: the most wild thing about this case was that said immigrant was a Ukrainian Jew named Abraham, who was talking too these bastards in Hebrew - so they perfectly well knew his ethnicity.
You totally missed my point: I was referring to the comments like "yeah Israelis are nazis", while I argue that this particular case is about typical youth violence that has nothing to do with ideology.
And to make myself clear that it's not okay I referred to the attackers as "bastards", hoping to make it clear that I think it's "not okay". Turned out it wasn't enough ðŸ¤·.
Yeah I'm a Ukrainian and my parents are currently in Ukraine I'm not. Whenever I see article like this it's almost always a misinterpretation of reality. People come to reddit to relax and have fun. They don't give a second thought about manipulative assholes like OP trying to get useless karma. So we get pointless hate. Sad stuff.
Someone who read the article on reddit? Gtf outta here and let us spread hate towards citizens of a nationality that we have biases with. (They are the racists, not us!).
Everyone jumping on the "Israel is always the bad guy" train. I can give you a long list of all the shitty things Israel does as a nation and what they allow their citizens to get away with. However, this just seems like 2 asshole teenagers.
They were vandalizing gym equipment. A man saw them, asked them to stop, when they didn't he started recording their actions. This made them angry and beat him to try to delete the video. It didn't seem to matter to them who he was or where he was from, just that he recorded them being assholes.
And if any says well the headline if the article seems like racism bait, screw you for implying that we are dumb enough to fall for a few words without even trying to check or think for ourselves! Thats only boomer on facebook who do that111.
