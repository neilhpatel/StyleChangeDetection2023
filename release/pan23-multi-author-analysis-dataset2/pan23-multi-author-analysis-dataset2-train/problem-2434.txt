I’ve been digging around because I was curious as to who else even tried, and as best as I can tell, while a few former presidents like Herbert Hoover at least competed in the primaries for their party during a later election, the only ones I’m seeing who full-on ran for president in the general after losing reelection were Martin van Buren and Teddy Roosevelt, who each failed to get their party’s nomination and so ran as third parties (Free Soil and Bull Moose, respectively), which basically screwed over their original party and let the opposition president win.
GOP is about to find out what happens when you partner with the mob and you realize they're not helping your business anymore, but leveraging it for its credit and hustling shit out the back door, and they're at the point where they're about to torch the joint for the insurance check.
But if we can get DeSantis to adopt the slogan "Make America Great Again Again", Trump might get that anger-induced stroke he's been dodging for a decade.
