And the US is saying the Abrams, a tank built to fight Russians in Europe, is not suitable for the Ukrainians to fight the Russians.
Sure, the Abrams guzzles fuel like a frat party does beer, but it can still be used in a defensive posture for, what the US claims, is an expected Russian push in the coming months… and it’s hardly like we are seeing hundreds of kilometres in advancements, the lines have been stable for a few months now and we typically see, at most a couple dozen Kilometer movements.
You cannot make the argument that it’s easier to train a Ukrainian crew on novel US/German/UK tanks than it is to train engineers to build a depot/operate mobile depots.
A T-72 gets nearly 1 mile per liter, Abrams, particularly modern, more fuel efficient ones, get 0.5 miles per gallon. And older ones are measured in gallons per mile.
It would matter because older Abrams A1 and A2 non SEPv3s which are what most likely would be sent lack an APU. You literally have to keep the gas turbine engine running for power to the gun, optics, thermals etc. It doesn't matter if you aren't moving, it still needs a shit ton of fuel.
Ukraine doesn't have enough fuel. There are already fuel constraints with its existing infrastructure to supply the Soviet armor it has. It does not have anywhere near the appropriate capacity to supply Abrams.
