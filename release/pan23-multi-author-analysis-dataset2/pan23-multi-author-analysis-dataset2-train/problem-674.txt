Actually the biggest concern was economics. Nations that trade with Russia didn't want to lose that trade. Lots of countries even get nuclear fuel from Russia. Countries that trade rarely go to war for that reason. Nobody really thinks that Russia is going nuclear.
Basically we're (the west) afraid. Russia is essentially threatening to nuke the world if they don't have the freedom to genocide Ukraine, it's why were taking so many precautions with supporting Ukraine. Ultimately the civilized world wants to prevent a larger scale war, which is understandable.
"Civilized world" that created most of WMD in the world, killed most people in the last century and enslave half of the world with colonies, also responsible for almost every war since industrial era? Damn you people really have short memory and learn nothing about exceptionalism.
If one keep doing one thing over and over while against anyone else trying to do the same thing then that is hypocrite, not learning. And also cannot self-claim themselves "civilized".
Because Ukrainians didn't resist at all, not the military, law enforcement or civilians. They were basically caught by surprise especially considering the political chaos in Ukraine at the time.
