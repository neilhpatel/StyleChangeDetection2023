I'm surprised that there hasn't been an actual rebellion by troops and some Generals yet. Surely they are desperate and have had enough. I know the families get threatened as well but this whole idea that Putin is more of a threat to their lives than Ukraine ever was must be a motivator to turn on him.
Their primary value (at least if I was in the position of a Russian general) would be freeing up more valuable troops to be used on the front line.
They're probably not super well equipped to begin with. If you look at how how poorly organized the invasion has been so far, I very seriously doubt the people conducting the invasion could do any better organizing a massive rebellion.
In any army, a ton of manpower is spent on non-combat roles: truck drivers, military police, construction, guarding supply lines, and also patrolling and protecting the country’s borders. With a peacetime army, I’d be wasting trained soldiers escorting supply convoys, protecting rear areas, and just loading and unloading shit on and off trains and trucks. If I had a ton of new conscripts, I’d put my conscripts in these roles and move the trained soldiers to the front lines. I’d also use conscripts to guard non-conflict borders and move the combat troops from there to the front lines.
I don’t doubt conscripts were used as an emergency stopgap to plug into holes in the front line, but what I described above would probably provide better immediate value. Of course, shifting more professional troops to the front line also helps buy more time to give the conscripts more training before sending them into combat, since conscripting a million troops in the secret directives will provide plenty of men to fill combat units as well.
Of course, what I said above is only if there’s still professional combat troops available. If all those are gone and they’re truly scraping the bottom of the barrel for every last man, then yeah, they’re pretty much fucked.
