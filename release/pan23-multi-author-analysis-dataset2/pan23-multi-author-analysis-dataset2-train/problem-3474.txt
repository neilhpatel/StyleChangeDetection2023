The FOIA itself applies only to federal agencies. Your state may have a sunshine or open records law that could apply.
Have you contacted the victim liaison at the prosecutor's office? They may have a bunch of information for you.
I know the US Marshalls were present at the time of the arrest. I also know the FBI and the Federal Marijuana Task Force have also been involved in the investigation.
Yes I have been in regular contact with them, unfortunately they have been less than helpful in providing any information, we did not even recieve a copy of the victims rights act from the victim advocate, I had to find that online.
When I asked for the paperwork I would need to get court transcripts in the future, if I should want them, her response, verbatim was "you wouldn't be able to cover the cost even if you did want them".
Also just for clarification, I'm plenty aware of the standards for investigation. I was trying to keep details slim but just so you're aware of your ignorance I'll break some small parts down for you.
My brother was murdered in a remote location in CO. He was lured there by the person who killed him. Nearly immediately they had their suspect confirmed via cctv footage. My ENTIRE family lives in NY and NO ONE in our family was ever even formally interviewed by police. The death notification did not even come until 3 days after he passed.
As to being treated like a suspect- unfortunate as it is, the killer is often times related or known to the victim. This may have obviously not been the case in your circumstance but again something to consider.
