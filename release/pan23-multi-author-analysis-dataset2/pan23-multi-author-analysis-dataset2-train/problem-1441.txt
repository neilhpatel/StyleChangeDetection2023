Are you aware of every document you have in your possession? Most who have or have had to handle any meaningful volume of documents would not be able to answer affirmatively. (at least not if they're being honest) Even if there was someone who was super on top of their filing situation and did actually have an accounting of all their documents that quickly gets undone when you start adding staff handling of documents into the equation.
Which is to say... if anyone has ever had staff that have had to handle documents, organization, moving, filing etc... there is next to zero chance unless you are fucking memory savant that you even could be aware of every document that is within your possession.
The irony of course is the fact that they've spent years portraying Biden as mentality deficient and incompetent yet here we are now supposed to believe that he is supposed to have a memory that most children and teenagers don't possess?
Nah, obviously those documents Trump had weren't really there, it was all faked by the biased FBI and mainstream news media. And even if they were there, it's because they were planted by the biased FBI. And even if they weren't, it's not a big deal because there weren't that many. And even if there were that many, it's no problem because Trump was authorized to have them. And even if he wasn't, well, uh...
