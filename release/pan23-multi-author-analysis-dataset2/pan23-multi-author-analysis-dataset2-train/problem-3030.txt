But sometimes, every once in a while, between the hum of wasted energy and low quality effort, sometimes that timer will match up with the clock on the wall. It'll only be for a literal split second before continuing its backwards march of disintegrating whatever valuable resources were placed under his watch, but it does happen.
The constant talking about "nuking" something, passing off efforts that are only barely warm on the surface level but drastically undercooked beyond that(and seem to perpetually be "2 more minutes/weeks" from being ready), and ruining the leftovers from previous efforts in favor of "quick fix" processes instead of letting them get the time in the oven they needed to be fully realized...
And in the 1970s we learnt that diversifying your energy sources and local energy production(even at an increased cost) are strategically very important.
Someone went and cancelled Project Desertec which had huge German investment into electricity production in the Sahara. The explanation at the time was an excess of electricity in Europe ... and NS2 went forward.
Otherwise it's just a perpetual blink of random, incorrect times. They lost his manual out of the box and no one cared enough about him to bother finding out which buttons needed to be pushed to set him on track with reality.
