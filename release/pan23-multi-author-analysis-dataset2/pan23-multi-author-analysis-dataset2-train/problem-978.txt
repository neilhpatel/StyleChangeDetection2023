It makes sense mathematically, which is why old school politicians hate it. Our leaders should be the brightest of us, both in intelligence and in appeal. The whole point of mass voting is that when you ask a large enough group of people what the answer is to one thing or another, the majority of that group tends to pick the right answer far more often than not. Ranked choice puts that to the forefront. Which is why it wont ever happen as a federal mandate, because it would require both sides to actually put their best people forward. And that means taking up risk that their best isn't enough. Neither side is sending their best, what they're sending are the people most able to muck up the system and put it to a stand still.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
